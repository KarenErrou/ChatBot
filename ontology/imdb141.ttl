This one was made back in 1961 which means it has its 55th anniversary this year. The director is Hungarian filmmaker kos Rthonyi and this is not the only Edgar Wallace film he worked on even if he was not as prolific in terms of these films as many other German directors in the 1960s. There were a whole lot of writers busy with this one here as many other times with Edgar Wallace films but also like many other times the outcome is an example of too many cooks spoiling the broth. I may be a bit biased as I am not a fan of the film series at all but this movie here also did not manage to get me interested. The cast is not the problem Fuchsberger van Bergen Kinski and Lee are all really prolific and successful actors. But the story is and the way the character's actions were written. i know these films also go for humor occasionally but there are so many scenes that feel really bad. Just one example would be how long Fuchsberger's character hesitates towards the end before he follows Kinski's character. Speaking about the latter I think he is a really good actor but here his character is bizarre even more than usual and makes almost no sense at all. He was completely irrelevant and had almost no screentime until the very end and then we should take him seriously as the main antagonist? Not working. The good guys i.e. the cops all seemed fairly bland and uninteresting and it was impossible to cheer for them and I think it is both the actors' and the writers' fault to some extent. Lee certainly was a bit of a scene stealer but he alone cannot make up for all the boredom and lack of realism associated with these 90 minutes. I don't recommend the watch.".

	schema:headline " Fun little flick!";
	schema:reviewBody "After witnessing his wife Linda Hoffman engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy the already somewhat unstable dentist Dr. Feinstone Corbin Bernsen completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patients.This delightful semioriginal and entertaining horror flick from director Brian Yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late Nineties. Although The Dentist' is intended to be a cheesy fun little film Yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense. Despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days the movie is intriguing generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest even during the more ludicrous of moments. The Dentist' suffers on occasion from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel there are only sporadic uninteresting moments and in general the movie follows itself nicely.Corbin Bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic deranged and perfectionist Dr. Alan Feinstone. The way Bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex particularly fellatio is something short of marvellous. While many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous Bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable. Had The Dentist' not been intended to be a fun almost comical horror movie Bernsen's performance would probably have been much more powerful. Sadly the rest of the cast including a prefame Mark Ruffalo failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick.The Dentist' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable particularly I would presume for fans of cheesy horror. Those who became annoyed at the number of Scream' 1996 clones from the late Nineties may very well find this a refreshing change as I did. A seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make The Dentist' one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the 1990's. On top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and on the whole realistic scenes of dental torture which should keep most gorehounds happy. Far from perfect but far from bad as well The Dentist' is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once. My rating for The Dentist'  6.510.".

	onyx:emotionText "After witnessing his wife Linda Hoffman engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy the already somewhat unstable dentist Dr. Feinstone Corbin Bernsen completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patients.This delightful semioriginal and entertaining horror flick from director Brian Yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late Nineties. Although The Dentist' is intended to be a cheesy fun little film Yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense. Despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days the movie is intriguing generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest even during the more ludicrous of moments. The Dentist' suffers on occasion from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel there are only sporadic uninteresting moments and in general the movie follows itself nicely.Corbin Bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic deranged and perfectionist Dr. Alan Feinstone. The way Bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex particularly fellatio is something short of marvellous. While many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous Bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable. Had The Dentist' not been intended to be a fun almost comical horror movie Bernsen's performance would probably have been much more powerful. Sadly the rest of the cast including a prefame Mark Ruffalo failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick.The Dentist' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable particularly I would presume for fans of cheesy horror.

Of course being the blood thirsty gal that I am I had to go out and find this movie. Now I don't know how to put this without loosing credibility so I'm just going to say it I actually had fun watching this movie! I know that it's stupid not the best story and beyond bloody and gruesome but that's what I was looking for and The Dentist delivers in the scares blood sex and crazy psychopaths. Sometimes I just need a fun movie like this to just let loose and get grossed out by.Dr. Alan Feinstone is obsessed with order and cleanliness. On the day of his wedding anniversary he spies his wife Brooke having sex with their filthy pool man Matt. At his dental practice Feinstone's first patient of the day is young Jody Saunders there for his very first dental appointment. Feinstone begins to clean Jody's teeth. Everything goes smoothly at first until he imagines that Jody's teeth are brown and rotten. His dental pick slips stabbing Jody in the gums. Jody's mother picks up her crying bleeding child and leaves angrily. Feinstone sees his second patient beauty queen April Reign. Alone with April Feinstone sedates her with nitrous oxide so that he can fill a cavity in one of her molars. As she drifts off into unconsciousness Feinstone imagines that she has transformed into his wife. He begins kissing and fondling her on the dental chair then begins to choke her. April starts to cough and halfwakes up from the gas. Feinstone snaps out of his trance and quickly rebuttons April's blouse. Feinstone decides to end the day early and sends his staff and patients home. Later that night Brooke meets Feinstone at his practice. He reveals his new Italian operathemed patient room. He encourages Brooke to try out the room's dental chair. When she does Feinstone binds her to the chair and sedates her with nitrous oxide. With operatic music blaring in the background he begins to pull out Brooke's teeth. Feinstone has gone off the deep end and is definitely not going to let anybody stand in his way of cleanliness.Honestly as silly as this movie sounds I did have a lot of fun watching The Dentist. The best scene without a doubt is when he teaches that nasty IRS agent a lesson in hygiene that I'm sure he'll never forget. Man I don't think I've brushed my teeth so much after I watched The Dentist. Yeah I am going to warn you this movie is in no way for the faint of heart it's very bloody. There's stabbing gun shots and just these brutal dental torture scenes that will make your stomach turn. Yet somehow I just enjoyed this movie if I ever want just a good gore movie that was made for true horror fans I slip it in my DVD player and that's the tooth LOL! I am so funny! Um yeah I try give me a little credit.710".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard of this movie I naturally just wrote it off as one of those 'formula' scary movies... you know find one thing that a lot of people are afraid ofspiders heights closed rooms... and in this case dentists. But it was actually better than I expected. I does have some genuine scares and the mood of the film is thoroughly creepy and unpleasant. Even though I've never been afraid to go to the dentist I found the torture scenes to be quite painful and sometimes even hard to sit through. In fact I might have problems the next time I go to a checkup. The plot is surprisingly original and interesting. The pacing was good... I wasn't really bored during any part of the movie. The acting is where the movie fails to surpass the low expectations towards the movie... it is exactly as bad as you'd imagine and sometimes worse. The characters are also kind of stereotypical... there is just about every single kind of nervous girl with dental problems that you can imagine. The script also has quite a few problems... suddenly more and more people show up to see the dentist. And even though the first couple of patients come out crying and in various states of unpleasantness the rest of them are still somewhat eager to get in the chair. I did like the slow descent into madness of the dentist Dr. Feinstone. That was surprisingly good. Normally movies like this have little to no explanation of the killers motivation but this one had a somewhat good one. The cinematography was kind of experimental like the camera crew andor the director of photography wasn't sure what angles they wanted and just threw in anything they could think of. As a result some of it looks good and some of it looks very firstyearoffilmschool. The gore effects range from good to mediocre. I could tell how many of the effects were done but some of them had a good... uh... effect. There was relatively little gore which came as a surprise... most of the scares are achieved through suggestion and the eerie mood of the film. I found it to be a nice diversity when the kills were done without dental equipment... this only happens a few times through the movie but when it does it's a good change of pace. The film has a few good qualities and about as many poor qualities. However the latter group can be ignored by being a little forthcoming and looking at the good entertaining stuff in the film. There's a good amount of attractive girls in the film and the scares are reasonably good. I recommend this to fans of Bmovies horror flicks and possibly of the director or one or more of the actors. I urge anyone who's scared of dentists to think twice about the film though... it might turn them entirely off to dentists. Everyone else consider watching this movie. It's surprisingly entertaining and not as bad as many claim it is. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Brian Yuzna has had an uneven career in the horror genre creating masterpieces such as Return of the Living Dead 3 or Bride of ReAnimator but at the same time he has done awful movies such as Faust Love for the Damned or the mediocre Progeny. He is obviously better in the seat of Producer where his work producing Stuart Gordon's films has been superb.The Dentist is one of his lesser works as director but the low profile it has benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes it a very enjoyable experience. It tells the story of Dr. Alan Feinstone played superbly by Corbin Bernsen a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not really as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife Linda Hoffmanhas an affair with the pool boy. This event disturbs his mind and puts him in a killing spree as he takes revenge on the world for being so filthy.The premise is very well handled by Yuzna as he takes us on a ride following Feinstone's day of revenge. What makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim's perspective we follow Feinstone because he is the main character. We witness how he goes from respected professional to psycho murder in a day. Yuzna manages to give the movie the exact amount of suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie.Most of the success of the premise is in Bernsen's performance as Feinstone. He can make you feel sympathy and hate towards him at the same time and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that aids the film. The rest of the cast is not as good and I think that their sub par acting hurts the film more than it should. A notable exception is Ken Foree as the detective trying to catch Feinstone. While his part is quite small he makes a great job with it.With a dentist as killer gory scenes are expected and Brian Yuzna delivers great SFX in the correct amount. It's good to see that he does not go overthetop with it as he usually do and I dare to say that this is a highlight of the film. It has the exact amount of gore that is expected nothing less and nothing more. Yuzna restrained himself of his common excesses and the result is great.While this is not among Yuzna's most wellknown films I would say that it is one of his best. Sure it is not classic material as his masterpieces but it is a movie that entertains and never gets tiresome or boring. It is a lowbudget simple film but for what it is I think it rocked. 710".

Sure it is not classic material as his masterpieces but it is a movie that entertains and never gets tiresome or boring. It is a lowbudget simple film but for what it is I think it rocked. 710";

Short little summary is this Dr. Alan Feinstone a guy who has a sexy wife nice house and is a great dentist everyone loves. Until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner.

	schema:reviewBody "This would have been so much fun to see in a theater back in 1996. There is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies.The Dentist is panned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters. Maybe the ADA launched a campaign against it since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for The Marathon Man which only has one scene comparable to the many in The Dentist.It's amazing to note that according to the trivia page the movie was shot in 21 days. Of course post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for The Dentist is picture perfect. The quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the Dentist takes care of his wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening. The rest is left to our very fertile imaginations! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has lots of experience playing psychologically off characters and he completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist.For me the pacing of the movie was just right. The film makers reveal the wife's naughtiness in just the right way. All of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office. There's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist's arrival. Meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown! Unlike so many movies of this genre the script is very very tight. All the victims fall into the dentist's trap in very calculated ways. Two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the end.Definitely not for the faint of heart or the dentalphobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests.".

And nobody except for Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors likes going to the dentist. Tooth torture has been done before see The Marathan Man for example but this brings the terror into suburbia.The plot revolves around a dentist Dr. Alan Feinstone Corbin Bernsen who descends into madness. Now our dear doctor wasn't playing with a full deck to begin with but driven by jealousy and an obsessivecompulsive disorder he begins to reek havoc on those around him. The doctors spiraling mental condition is kinda close to what we see in Micheal Douglas's character in Falling Down but with a horror edge.Written and directed by horror stalwarts Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna its witty and has a great flow. Also featured playing a cop is the ever welcome Ken Foree.Now I believe this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance from Corbin Bernsen. Having really only seen him in LA Law before I was blown away by his acting.The sequel The Dentist 2 is also worth watching but slightly under par compared to the original.TTKK's Bottomline  A fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe capped pun intended by a great performance from Bernsen".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't mean to burst anyone's bubble here but the Dentist is not a documentary film delving into the history of dental hygiene. I know that is exactly what you were thinking so don't try any of that crap with me. To be honest with you The Dentist is an educational film where we learn about dentistry tools and their various uses. We learn what each tool looks like how they work and how quickly they can destroy your teeth and gums. As a bonus we get to learn how far a mouth can open before snapping the jawbone. But most importantly we learn what happens if you neglect good hygiene. I tell you folks  I have seen the punishment and it's not pretty.The story of a dentist gone mad is what first intrigued me to watch this film. Just the idea alone is enough to warrant an eyebrow lift. But director Brian Yuzna takes this oddball concept one step further. He approaches it with the utmost care and devotion relishing in every gory detail. Right from the opening scene we see that Dr. Feinstone Corbin Bernsen is obsessively a clean freak. Every wall in his house is white. His shirts are white. The carpet the countertops his car  white. Everything this lunatic owns is white. There is a moment in the opening sequence when the doctor and his wife suck face just after Mrs. Feinstone has been secretly smoking a cigarette. He immediately tastes the smoke and is so repulsed that he excuses himself to washup. The scene is great because we truly understand how gone this guy is. He is a ticking time bomb on the verge of exploding. Wait until he gets to the office  all those cavities. Tick tick I know just when you thought it was safe to go back to the dentist.Corbin Bernsen the master of dual personalities heads up this stellar cast of unfortunate teeth cleaners. Surprisingly I really can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Dr. Feinstone. He was perfect as the nice calm guy who brings smiles to the faces of children and equally great as the drill happy maniac. He delivers really funny lines with the utmost seriousness. One of my favorite lines is You don't know what it's like  the discipline the long hours lack of respect in a world that goes on ignoring dental hygiene. I am laughing even now. He's just nuts! In the supporting cast we have Mark Ruffalo Molly Hagan from Election and Devil's Rejects Kevin Foree just to name a few. Mark is the only marquee name in the film but almost everyone is recognizable.Where The Dentist really shines is in the directing. The film never loses its tone which is quite an accomplishment considering the quirkiness and delicate balance between comedy and drama. Director Brian Yuzna uses this really cool technique when showing how Dr. Feinstone perceives certain situations. A patient will be sitting in his dental chair with a mouth full of pearly whites. We can clearly see this but not the dentist. All he sees are run down wretched green plaque infested teeth and gums. While watching from the doctor's point of view the camera shot distorts similar to that of a funhouse mirror as we hear odd atmospheric sound effects. These moments do an exceptional job of conveying the doctor's inner workings. No wonder he's drilling everything he sees.The only problem I had with The Dentist was the finale. Right from the beginning you know this ride is going to be a crazy one. The film screams quirkiness and when that kind of tone is established you just know the ending will be anything but traditional. It's tough because the ending needs to be smart unpredictable and it needs to surpass everything that has come before it. Unfortunately I don't feel The Dentist accomplished this. The film should have ended fifteen minutes before it actually did. Just something a little more interesting would have done it for me. For example maybe he dies and returns as a bitchy tooth fairy. That would have hit the spot.Overall The Dentist is a great way to spend ninety minutes. The script acting and directing are all above average for the genre. Did I mention the doctor's wife is very hot and very naked? Did I mention teeth will be removed one by one with a set of pliers? If you're not already looking for your video membership card then I give up. What more do you want?".

The film should have ended fifteen minutes before it actually did. Just something a little more interesting would have done it for me. For example maybe he dies and returns as a bitchy tooth fairy. That would have hit the spot.Overall The Dentist is a great way to spend ninety minutes. The script acting and directing are all above average for the genre. Did I mention the doctor's wife is very hot and very naked? Did I mention teeth will be removed one by one with a set of pliers? If you're not already looking for your video membership card then I give up. What more do you want?";

I was like why not so I started watching through it and it started getting creepier by the minute. The Dental Torture scenes are not pleasant and I feel sorry for the creators why they produced this movie as well. It's a little bit of garbage but it's a nightmare to begin with. I don't know why people so creative would put some material like this on the market. It makes me sick actually. I don't think they should even had made a sequel if all the reviews were not well written out. It is much disturbing and the closeups of the mutilation were completely gross. It's quite ashame torture in the first place isn't normal let alone oral torture. That's shocking and no good. It has an edge of black comedy to it but I have to say I don't know why Corbin Bernsen took this role. If I was him I would have said No! They shouldn't have made this because their are dentist out there and it's disturbing to even watch closeups of molars being ruined and such. Oh my gosh this was nothing but nightmares to me. Brian Yunza made this to grapic in the first place. Even watching a little kid in here get cut open was so sad. Do not think about making a sequel. I think you've scared people enough. It even made people physically sickvomiting running out of the theaters when the started watching this I heard. Brian Yunza you did take a chance on this but some advice I don't think making a third installment of this video would be such a good idea. This movie was incredibly disturbing let alone I was scared for all the actors who took part in this.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 90's had quite an interesting list of great and bizarrely overthetop horror flicks and this is one of them! Let's just look at the story. The beloved doctor Alan Feinstone is a dentist and his patients always feel very comfortable with him. He has some mental issues but manages to hold it together... until he sees his wife cheat on him. Does he talk with her about it? Does he demand a divorce? No he goes f u c k i n g nuts! He can barely concentrate at work and is more annoyed with his patients than usual. Because of his delusional thoughts he turns a boy's teeth to crust which is one of several extremely uncomfortable dental gore scenes in the movie. But this is where the movie doesn't make any goddamn sense. Sure the police arrives later but shouldn't it already be you know when he tries to rape someone?! It's almost incredible since he is called out on his s h i t by others as well and still more patients keep rollin' into his little nicely decorated room to get their teeth fixed. However this plothole is for the better good. It gets more and more absurd and there are several unforced moments of black humor when Corbin Bernsen with glee delivers his sleazy unhumanizing lines. What makes the movie even crazier is that instead of taking a break he acts like if there's no problem and still wants to do his job. Jesus Christ. It's hard not to spoil too much but the ending is one of the most memorable ones for a horror movie ever. Most of the other stuff in the movie is ridiculous but that creeped me out for real.Watch this movie if you want to have a good laugh! I'm not a fan of horror movies with copious amounts of gore otherwise but it was used effectively here!".

	schema:reviewBody "Brian Yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gorefests but the truth is that his films actually aren't bad at all. The ReAnimator sequels aren't as great as the original but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned. Return of the Living Dead 3 is the best of the series and Society isn't a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece. This thriller certainly isn't a masterpiece but it shows Yuzna's eye for horror excellently and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging. I'm really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didn't turn up until 1996 as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear  it's running away from a tiger for the modern world. Dentistry doesn't frighten me but surprisingly I would appear to be in the minority. The plot follows perfectionist dentist Dr Feinstone. He has a nice house a successful career and a beautiful wife  pretty much everything most people want. However his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife's affair with the pool cleaner. And his life isn't the only one as it's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger...When it comes to scaring the audience this movie really makes itself. However credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme. The fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that I'm not squeamish about going to the dentist  yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes! The film follows the standard man going insane plot outline only with The Dentist you always get the impression that there's more to the film than what we're seeing. It isn't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level  and while this won't be winning any awards the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot. The acting while Bclass is actually quite impressive with Corbin Bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge. I should thank Brian Yuzna for casting Ken Foree in the movie. The Dawn of the Dead star doesn't get enough work and I really love seeing him in films. The rest of the cast doesn't massively impress but all do their jobs well enough. Overall The Dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies. The gore scenes are sure to please horror fans and I don't hesitate to recommend this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dentist is a really good thriller. And pretty disturbing. I think we can all agree that the chances of running into a psycho dentist are much bigger than running into monsters vampires or zombies. That's exactly why this movie is so scary. During this film you'll probably think about your own dentist a few times. Whether he's capable of doing such things...You better pray his wife doesn't cheat on him. That's what the story is all about. A respected dentist in LA snaps when he finds out his wife is cheating on him with the poolboy.  That must be the greatest profession in the world by the way. Poolboys always take advantage of the housewives when the husband is at his work From then on our dentist Dr. Feinstone can only thing about taking revenge. He can't concentrate on his patients anymore and a couple of them get hurt. Things aren't made easier for our dentist when he's chased by an annoying taxcontroller a curious cop and a suspicious staff member of his. At one point Dr. Feinstone can't take it anymore. Now he's not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him.. The dentist is written and directed by Brian Yuzna and cowritten by Stuart Gordon. You can take that as a recommendation to itself. These 2 persons already gave us a few great horror movies  and personal favorites of mine  like ReAnimator From Beyond and Society. With the Dentist they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller. This film came right on time actually. The decade hadn't brought us many great horror films so far. I'm not at all saying this IS a masterpiece but it's a nice change. Corbin Bensen is great as the dentist obsessed by hygiene. I remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor but he can sure handle a psychotic character. The rest of the cast does good work too. The woman who plays Feinstone's wife is really attractive. Also it was great to see Ken Foree acting again. The actor from my all time favorite movie Dawn of the Dead plays the cop in this film. Yuzna casted him in From Beyond too 15 years ago and I thank him for that. I don't recommend this movie to everyone if you have a weak stomach I'll advise you to skip it but if you do watch it you'll enjoy it very much. You'll be disgusted...but that's an extra reason I think. It's been a while since I was really freaked out by watching a film. It's a great topic to handle in the genre and Yuzna does it in a great way. Too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel. My humble opinion on the Dentist ... 810".

After four quite successful animated films I had high hopes for Vampire Rock. However this film is a drastic departure from those films as Zombie Island was from the original series. There is a nod to those films present in the form of the Hex Girls and the Cyber Chase game but thats it.  The mystery machine is now the old van and Fred has his ascot back.  All that the previous films had built up has gone. On the plus side Velma's orginal voice is back and sounds fantastic. Also worth a mention is the excellent reengineering of the old Scooby Doo Where Are You? incidential music. Overall the piece feels like it is pandering too much to the general populous' preception of Scooby Doo and this does stiffle the creativity. One last thing though please if there is to be another film could have Scoot Innes back as Scooby?".

	schema:reviewBody "Having enjoyed the last several directtovideo installments of the Scooby Doo franchise I have always been impressed by the fact that the writers were keen on what made the original series work and how to translate that to film. Oh sure it was always rather corny entertainment but you're not expecting high art from Scooby. You're expecting FUN.And that was what I wanted from this outing but I was rather disappointed overall. As nice as it was to see the living members of the original cast together again the writing seemed a little stale. The injokes were so thick where they became tiresome by the time the credits rolled. The situations concocted for the cast frequently felt like padding instead of entertainment. Though the real kicker is the fact the conclusion managed to be too unbelievable even by Scooby Doo standards. After the more outrageous events that have transpired the solution to the mystery of the Yowie Yahooie is far too dull especially considering the supernatural events the last several films ended with. While it's nice to see the film end in step with the original series proving the supernatural to be something much more mundane it feels as though the balance isn't even enough between the supernatural facade and the reality.However this installment is not a total loss. Not all the injokes are a waste especially one at Fred's expense when the gang is set to investigate a trailer. The riffs on various genres of music in particular the KISSinspired vampires were appreciated as was the reappearence of the Hex Girls from the second film though they've lost a lot of their character now that they're not suspects. The hideously out of date manager inspired quite a few laughs as well.Unfortunately this does not take away the rather empty feeling at the end of the film. With a new series running it's of course possinble this was more of a pilot for than a continuation of the previous films but it's hoped this is really more of an anomaly in the series of movies and not a trend lest we return to the likes of the franchisetoppling Scooby Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf.".

Especially considering how Warner have decked the characters in their original clothes after fans objected to the modern clothes in the previous efforts. I have no opinion on this matter.It was cool to see the Hex Girls return and the music this time has a slightly hipper more techno feel and lacks the orchestral fantasy of Louis Febre's scores for Alien Invaders and Cyber Chase. It's a shame there's no soundtrack CD for this one. I'd definitely buy it.The extras consist of a childish game and a commentary by Shaggy Scooby and Fred. Which should be fun.

The animation is suburb for a directtovideo and the director knew what he was doing as the film looks like it actually could be transferred into theaters. The voice cast is better than before and the returning actors and actresses have matured well into their roles and the new voices are a welcome addition. The scriptwriter designed a clever and ingenious script and the film moves along at a fast pace never slowing down. It is also never boring and is sure to leave you hooked till the end. The addition of vampires as the monsters is nice and the setting of the outback is used to it's full purpose. This is also very straight forward and that is another bonus and it never detours from what it is supposed to be. My favorite scene has to be where Fred Daphne and Velma going looking for clues in the managers trailer and not only does it have a laugh that gets me every time the whole scene is a reminder of the early episodes with searching for clues or being somewhere your not supposed to be. The running time is short so it doesn't take to much time.The Bad News Several of the jokes where not funny and the revelation of the vampires is a throughly confusing one and takes many times before you finally get it.Conclusion The bad jokes and the confusing ending should not let you stop from seeing this Scooby gem as it is truly one of the best.

	schema:headline " FINALLY! They nearly got it right!";
	schema:reviewBody "With all those madeforvideo ScoobyDoo movies by Warner Bros. Animation usually lacking the spirit of the older cartoons Legend of the Vampire is back to the basics! So far the first three of them were very dark and focused on real monsters while the Cyber Chase one was better going back to the fakemonster villains and containing some references to the older series. However this one is even better! It seems to have been made to appeal to Scooby babyboomers like me. The gang has their classic outfits many of the old HB sound effects are back and the character design is just like classic HB! The old voice talent is back even Nicole Jaffe as Velma at long last! It was a thrill to hear the original Velma we all know again. However I still think Frank Welker's Scooby voice is nice but I prefer Don Messick Scooby's voice even over Scott Innes as Scooby! Welker's Scooby sounds more like Brain the Dog of Inspector Gadget fame. The music is welldone remixes of the classic Scooby underscore it sounds like it was made on an electric synthesizerand the animation is nice and fluid MUCH better than usual Termite Terrace animation. Also they ditched the new HB Scooby logo to remake the classic zooming HannaBarbera end logo with the big abstract orange HB coming up to the screen which I find odd since this film like the other 19982001 Scooby video movies were made at Warner Bros. Animation instead of HannaBarbera. But it is still neat. Also although it is done in a full retromation style they still have modern references such as using the Internet on laptops as well as the YowieYahoo being a gigantic monstrous vampire which makes it a bit more like the previous films. The surprisetwist during the unmasking scene is also cool. However there is a minor flaw with this film. The audio mixing was done very poorly. It's in 5.1 surround but not all of the sound effects come out clearly. You'll need a surroundspeaker set to notice this. So far I discovered nighttime ambiance sounds hidden beneath the music during night scenes and during the big thunderstorm at the beginning among the new digitallyrecorded lightning strikes the old HB Castle Thunder sounds can be heard. That is the only problem so far. This slightly reminds me of how they produced Krypto the Superdog and Spumco produced Ren and Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon reusing most of the old voices and HB SFX classic drawing artwork etc. Plus with the DVD edition here you get audio commentary made by Fred Shaggy and Scooby as well as speciallyproduced outtakes and more! All in all if you like the classic ScoobyDoo cartoons of the sixties and seventies this is the film for you!".

The music is welldone remixes of the classic Scooby underscore it sounds like it was made on an electric synthesizerand the animation is nice and fluid MUCH better than usual Termite Terrace animation. Also they ditched the new HB Scooby logo to remake the classic zooming HannaBarbera end logo with the big abstract orange HB coming up to the screen which I find odd since this film like the other 19982001 Scooby video movies were made at Warner Bros. Animation instead of HannaBarbera. But it is still neat. Also although it is done in a full retromation style they still have modern references such as using the Internet on laptops as well as the YowieYahoo being a gigantic monstrous vampire which makes it a bit more like the previous films. The surprisetwist during the unmasking scene is also cool. However there is a minor flaw with this film. The audio mixing was done very poorly. It's in 5.1 surround but not all of the sound effects come out clearly. You'll need a surroundspeaker set to notice this. So far I discovered nighttime ambiance sounds hidden beneath the music during night scenes and during the big thunderstorm at the beginning among the new digitallyrecorded lightning strikes the old HB Castle Thunder sounds can be heard. That is the only problem so far. This slightly reminds me of how they produced Krypto the Superdog and Spumco produced Ren and Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon reusing most of the old voices and HB SFX classic drawing artwork etc. Plus with the DVD edition here you get audio commentary made by Fred Shaggy and Scooby as well as speciallyproduced outtakes and more! All in all if you like the classic ScoobyDoo cartoons of the sixties and seventies this is the film for you!";

They decide to go explore the outback they come across a rock music festival and go check it out. When arriving in the middle of nowhere to the festival instead of relaxing and listening to good music they hear the legend of the Yowie Yahoo vampire and the missing rock band that have apparently have been turned into vampires after they hear of the legend they are concerned and decide to try and solve the case. Unlike the previous three ScoobyDoo cartoons instead of using villains that are real they are just a man in a mask. Along the way they are met with many unfunny jokes predictable twists and turns and a very predictable ending.The plot and setting return to old fashion way by making the villain just a man in a mask. This is a part of the movie that I actually like it gives the old ScoobyDoo feeling but that does not save the cartoon from being bad.The storyline this cartoon follows is filled with unfunny jokes constant flaws and is very dragged out the characters are not very interesting and the ending is very predictable.Even though this cartoon isn't very good it has a very good all star voice cast such as Frank Welker as ScoobyDoo and Fred Nicole Jaffe as Velma Heather North as Daphne and the returning Casey Kasem as Shaggy. Each voice actor does a great job at the character they are playing.In the end ScoobyDoo and the legend of the vampire isn't the greatest movie ever made but it is far from the worst. Although not all the old big ScoobyDoo fans will like this cartoon many kids will as there are some aspects that are good. So make sure that you read reviews before renting or buying this movie as you may be disappointment but remember everyone has their own opinions.Overall rating  out of   out of ".

I was really really disappointed in this thing because everything that made the TV show entertaining is missing here. I guess you could say this movie was dumbed down for kids but expanding this out of a 30minute running time also hurts thing because often times the mystery is put on the back burner while we see stupid stuff ranging from concerts to other items. The actual mystery that is here seems watered down and gets boring after the first twenty minutes. I wasn't too impressed with the vocals either which is strange since four of the original members were together again for this.".

It was also cool that we get to see the Hex girls again even if they didn't do much. As usual we get some funny scenes here and there and I will admit that the design for the vampire was pretty cool.It doesn't offer much outside of that. The story is typical ScoobyDoo fare and there wasn't anything to make it feel like a real movie. This was really nothing more than an extended TV episode. Several ScoobyDoo movies suffer from this but this is one of the worst cases.It took too long for the plot to get started. There were too many filler scenes that added nothing and felt like they were there only to pad out the movie's length. The supporting characters aside from the Hex Girls were also nothing to write home about.The climax in the mountains is kind of routine and the reveal was nothing shocking. However I kind of liked the gang performing the ScoobyDoo Theme Song at the end.This is definitely one of the most bythenumbers entries in the longrunning franchise. I would say it's okay to watch if you've got nothing better to do. However it isn't really that much worth your time and there are better ScoobyDoo movies out there.RATING C".

It was kind of odd the way the characters had their old clothes the theme music was similar to the original cartoon's music and well the story was kind of bad. I like 'Zombie' because it was original. I liked the way you see where the gang ended up after they split not to mention a great storyline. Another thing that made that film great was the way they kind of spoofed the original cartoon Fred's ascott consideration for his dinner clothes nah...excellent. This movie kind of throws the previous films of balance. But it's okay not horrible but just about watchable. Don't expect anything from the dvd commentary by Fred Scooby and Shag because it's not what you'd expect would've been better for Zombie Island or The Witch's Ghost. Oh well. The movie is definetly the worst of all the latest Scooby Movies all of which are excellent. But if you like Scooby give the movie a chance. 510.".

My notion is that it's always capitalism that ends up being and is constantly fooled  by life.This film lets you laugh at capitalism and it feels good.Capitalism is alienating  like many of Malle's films this film is about unalienating.As I see it There are some wonderful moments where you just laugh I may have laughed most just because I found a somewhat old woman very funny just hilarious. And it was just a brief scene but it just made me laugh longer than the scene lasted stayed with me sort of. This is what's needed for a good comedy isn't it? Small things that make you laugh more than bigger things in part because they're small. There's not a lot of that but it's there and is perhaps all the more funny as a result. In addition there are bigger things notably involving a glass roof.I won't say that much more. Basically if you're an anticapitalist like me surely you'll enjoy it.

Greenaway was inspired visually by paintings of the mid 17th century particularly those of Vermeer. Almost every shot is composed like a painting. Many of the shots are symmetrical walls are filmed flat so that the horizontal lines are parallel with the top and bottom of the frame. Objects are placed on tables as if subjects for a still life. Lighting is used in an alternation of light shadelightshade receding to the back of the picture which is a signature of the type of 17th century Western art that Greenaway is paying homage to.The substance of the film follows weighty themes all of which are explained in great detail through the director's commentary evolution light and twinship.What is lacking is emotion. This is a cerebral film. Your emotional reaction to it will be through the imagery be it beautiful or repulsive. You will not engage with the characters on an emotional level. You'll find them hard to relate to. The performances are stilted and amateur theatrical. It is fortunate then that Michael Nyman provides a fantastic score present on almost every scene and almost outstaying its welcome which prevents the dialogue the script leaves a lot to be desired too rendering everything flat.Rent this if you enjoy visuals for their own sake if you wear spectacles and if you like holding your chin in your hand and frowning. I qualify on all those points so I enjoyed it a great deal.Extra points for an extraordinarily thorough director's commentary on the DVD which serves to pull out all the hidden depths. Though one could make the point that an explanation that adds so much extra understanding leaves you feeling that the film failed adequately to convey much of what was intended.DVD easter eggs worth seeing httpwww.dvd.net.auhidden.cgi?movieid10484".

	schema:reviewBody "How does one define oddness? I'd suggest by starting with two words Peter Greenaway. You can also use those two words to define Unique cinema visions total control beautiful views and don't mess with me. Greenaway is his own world and you're either eager for a visit or you'll insist on staying off the space ship. I'd suggest you prepare for your visit by packing away any compulsion you might have to explain things...such as his meaning his importance...all those categories lists and twos of things...and your own squeamishness. I don't make pictures that have a sellby date Greenaway once said. That's especially true of A Zed and Two Noughts where a good many of the things we'll see have long passed their sellby date. We start the movie with a double death in a car crash by a zoo...death by swan on a lane called Swan's Way. The wives of our two zoologists may be gone but their husbands twins and formerly joined twins Oswald and Oliver Deuce will lead us on an exploration of grief and decay illustrated by their stop motion movies. We will meet a beautiful amputee soon to have her remaining leg off by a mad surgeon probably for issues of symmetry. In addition to wet decay we'll enjoy vomiting frontal nudity Vermeer Greenaway's magnificent color palette black and white animals a white mare named Hortense several interesting fetishes plus the movie's unique chapter headings Mercury Apple Prawn Fish Crocodile Swan Dog Zebra and Escargot. Black comedy indeed. I'll admit I don't think I understood a thing about A Zed and Two Noughts. I started to read what some critics and fans have offered by way of analysis and found much of what they had to say from my point of view largely incomprehensible too detailed or too dull. Greenaway is chilly controlling and all about style layered heavily on top of substance. He can make Stanley Kubrick look looseygoosey. I found a Zed and Two Noughts in a perverse kind of way enjoyable. I suspect that's because Greenaway comes up with such odd intriguing and often disturbing visions. They can almost make you forget what the devil he's getting at. For me Prospero's Books is a perfect blend of style and story The Cook the Thief His Wife and Her Lover is an almost perfect match of style and story The Draughtsman's Contract is an amusing overlay of manners murder style and story. But A Zed and Two Noughts? Well I found it chilly sometimes uninvolving and often amusing. I enjoyed it more or less most of the time. I occasionally used the fastforward button. If ten people can tell me what the movie means beyond the old standbys of death grief and snails I'll bet I'll read ten wildly different opinions. That's no particular criticism of either Greenaway or the film.".

We can also see two women in the back of the car motionless. Who are then imposed on to a newspaper headline SWAN CRASH TWO DIE it says. The deceased women were married to twin brothers zoologists Oliver and Oswald Deuce. After the accident they grieve at the bedside of the stricken survivor of the crash a lady named Alba Bewick who has had her leg amputated. At first they blame her for the accident then later start to both sleep with her. Most of their time is spent photographing dead animals and plants.

A strange figure named Van Hoyten. And also the film features the only feature film appearance of the English comedian Jim Davidson who will be familiar to viewers in England. He plays Joshua Plate an assistant at the zoo. Eventually Alba has her other leg amputated and also has twin babies by the Deuce brothers. Yes she claims they are by both of them. It then leads to a tragic conclusion. It is a fascinating film to watch. Beautiful to look at as always with Greenaway's films. It offers the viewer many layers and textures to explore.

This movie treads  the line dangerously showing grossout images of decaying animals ad  nauseum but no animals were killed on screen. Still excluding animal  snuff films this is about the WORST thing I've ever seen on a screen.  Peter Greenaway may have an eye for symmetry colours contrast and  shadows. Fine. But that's where his talents stop. He has no ability to  write dialogue to tell a story to delve into philosophy or to inspire  our emotions other than disgust. It takes no talent to shock an  audience. My 3 year old nephew can shock an audience by holding a dog  turd. But how many directors can play on our more elevated emotions?  Not Greenaway.  He knows this. So he hides behind sarcasm kind of like the dweeb at  work who has no charm whatsoever so he attempts to compensate by being  the sarcastic guy. Peter Greenaway is that guy. Imagine standing next  to the sarcastic guy at work for two hours at the water cooler whilst  he babbles about nonsensical gross vulgar things. That's the only way  he can have a memorable impact. But all the while you're just standing  there saying I wish he would shut up.  Btw if you don't know what I'm talking about chances are the  sarcastic guy is YOU.  I tried so very very very very hard to like this movie. I ignored  the inane musical score the same 4 chords plucked over  over like  some sort of Philip Glass nightmare. I put aside my revulsion for the  fat naked women and hairy men with little weenies Greenaway's  trademark. And I accepted the histrionic acting as a deliberate  satire. OK fine. But an hour into it I realized that movies are not  supposed to be a chore. They're not supposed to be some sort of  endurance test whereby the audience learns the virtue of patience.  Cripes movies are supposed to be enjoyable orat the very  leastinteresting.  If you browse the discussion boards you'll see that the majority of  Greenaway fans like him simply because HE'S THE MOST SHOCKING DIRECTOR  EVER! or because HIS FILMS ARE SO DISTURBING! AND WEIRD! If these  phrases appeal to you then have a nice time. But if you're sitting  there wondering yeah? what else? Then you like me would profit by  spending your time elsewhere.".

Greenaway delivers a dark but intoxicating tale of decay evolution and the crucial importance of symmetry.The themes of this film emerge not only through Greenaway's script but also through the images produced by his tight clear directing. The choice of images and ability to linger on single shots suggests a creative mind as focused and obsessed as the characters he portrays. As with many of Greenaway's works this certainly isn't a film for anyone wanting a cheap thrill and easy satisfaction. Its particularly dark humour and images of accelerated decay and death are more likely to please those who prefer to view film as a medium of art than those seeking mere entertainment.It is a very long time since a film has impressed me quite as much as this.".

	onyx:emotionText "This fine film is written in an intelligent multilayered way of such a degree and quality as I have only seen in topnotch theatre. Greenaway delivers a dark but intoxicating tale of decay evolution and the crucial importance of symmetry.The themes of this film emerge not only through Greenaway's script but also through the images produced by his tight clear directing. The choice of images and ability to linger on single shots suggests a creative mind as focused and obsessed as the characters he portrays. As with many of Greenaway's works this certainly isn't a film for anyone wanting a cheap thrill and easy satisfaction. Its particularly dark humour and images of accelerated decay and death are more likely to please those who prefer to view film as a medium of art than those seeking mere entertainment.It is a very long time since a film has impressed me quite as much as this.";

Anyone looking for a conventional plot even one as convoluted as found in The Draughtsman's Contract is going to be disappointed. Not that there isn't a storyline  there is and it's important  but to really enjoy the film you need to be open to its symbolism. It's really a moving painting more than a film.

	schema:headline " Annoying and interesting in equal measure";
	schema:reviewBody "For better or for worse A Zed  Two Noughts is a very unusual film. This is hardly surprising given that it was directed by the avantgardist director Peter Greenaway. It begins with a car accident at a zoo where two women are killed when their vehicle collides with a pregnant swan. These women are twins who were in turn married to a couple of twin zoologists Oliver and Oswald Deuce. Shortly afterwards these men start simultaneous affairs with the survivor of the accident the driver Alba Bewick who lost a leg as a result of the crash. She later has the other one removed surgically for symmetrical reasons and falls pregnant to the twins.This strange film features both the good and the bad typical of Greenaway. The good is the visual presentation and distinctive bizarre qualities the bad is more or less any time someone opens their mouths which unfortunately is quite often. Greenaway is really terrible at writing dialogue. His script constantly tries to be clever which is not the same thing as actually being clever. Needless to say the dialogue is painful to listen to and ultimately makes the film hard work and not in a good way. But setting this aside amongst other thing it's an intriguing concoction about symmetry birth and decay. Of the latter are several timelapse films showing a variety of animals and organic matter decaying  films which were fascinating and repulsive in equal measure. We also have excellent cinematography from Greenaway's common collaborator Sacha Vierney with many shots being a joy to behold. The other significant cog in the wheel is the typically persistent minimalist score from Michael Nyman which is sometimes brilliant even if it does border on irritating at others. We also have the most unexpected collaborator in any Greenaway film  none other than Jim 'Nick Nick' Davidson the politically incorrect standup comedian who appears as a zookeeper.In summary A Zed  Two Noughts was an interesting film spoiled by Greenaway's horrible dialogue and awful characters. If you can get beyond those it does offer some fascinating stuff but you sure have got your work cut out with this one.".

Greenaway was my hero then for he had mastery over cinematic form and a unique style that I had never seen before. Added to Michael Nyman's powerful pulsating music this film gave me the shivers and also left me breathless. Looking at the film today it seems barren of emotion intentional and laboured. I struggled to sit through the film and luckily as I was watching it at home I could get up at intervals to make tea have a cigarette and look out the window. I made the effort to watch Greenaway's patronising director's commentary and 'introduction' to the film but it still left me with the feeling that I had largely wasted two hours. I may have learnt something about sumptuous photography and resonating soundtracks but A ZED AND TWO NOUGHTS left me cold sickened and bored. In 1985 this film may have caused a stir being made in the negativity and economiccultural stagnation of Thatcher's Conservative Britain. I remember that was not a good period to live through. A film like this might have caused a sensation among cinemagoers as it is certainly original. But that is its saving grace.".

To describe this film is to describe a work of genius something I am not exactly prepared for. I can only glowingly praise this film and its queer quirks and impressive precision. Almost every shot is in its own odd way by turns beautiful cryptic and unsettling even grotesque at times and these visuals move perfectly to the rhythm of Michael Nyman's perfect score that only further adds to the artistically orgasmic mastery of this film's every moment. It can be argued that the film has elements of pretension but I believe that it is too witty and brilliant a film to dismiss wsuch overused language and although I do not recommend it to everybody I am ready to make the claim that it is legitimately among the greatest art house films of all time. The bleak comedy and absurd tragedy of the grieving process has hardly ever been showcased wsuch a display of stylistic perfection as it is in this film. The way the film moves and glows and darkens and laughs and cries and creeps awkwardly round constantly disturbing and exciting the viewer is pulled off by Greenaway in such a way that I beg of anyone interested to seek out this film almost immediately. It isn't always fun but it is too worthwhile to ignore. It utilizes black comedy surrealism the avant garde philosophy and complete complexity in the most delightfully cinematic manner...it is a true masterpiece.".

Willing to spare no expense he instructs his representative to turn the dream into reality an extraordinary feat that will require the involvement of Britain's leading fisheries expert who happens to think the project both absurd and unachievable. That is until the Prime Minister's overzealous press secretary latches on to it as a 'good will' story. Now this unlikely team will put it all on the line and embark on an upstream journey of faith and fish to prove the impossible possible.";

	schema:headline " Salmon Fishing Makes For An Interesting Ride";
	schema:reviewBody "Enjoying a film like Salmon Fishing In The Yemen is similar to acquiring a taste for actual fishing. Like the sport that some find invigorating while others find it dreadfully dull this film has its draggy moments. However there are also enlightening points to the movie that come when you least expect them.Of course that is not to say that you have to actually LIKE fishing or understand it to enjoy Salmon Fishing In The Yemen. Fishing serves as a crucial plot point but you don't have to be a cardcarrying member of Cabella's or L.L. Bean to enjoy it.The film has elements of romantic comedy environmentalism foreign relations drama and insightfulness that makes it difficult to concretely categorize. Fortunately all these facets combine to create a story that's far from predictable. Just like a current there are times you don't know where the story is going.Ewan McGregor plays Fred Jones a fisheries expert for the British government who receives an odd request from legal representative Harriet ChetwodeTalbot Emily Blunt. Harriet represents a wealthy sheik Amr Waked who resides in both Great Britain and Yemen and has an unusual fondness for salmon fishing. He wants to take a healthy population of salmon from the British lakes and transport them to the Yemen River to live and breed.The reason this plot does not make for good cocktail party small talk or water cooler chatter is because it takes such a long time to describe the rationale behind such an ambitious task. For instance can salmon who thrive in cold water even survive in the Middle East where it's obviously hot? Plus why would people from Yemen even be interested in fishing? The film answers these questions and others very well and allows the story to breathe better as each subplot reveals itself. Nothing is rushed in this movie which while a few parts drag here and there is overall a welcome departure from certain highoctane multiplex drivel that passes as entertainment.Once you actually listen to the characters and hear their reasoning a lot of the story makes sense. This fact is especially true for Amr Waked who is not yet a well known actor but whose character has a profound impact on the film.Western audiences are not used to seeing a Middle Eastern character that is not a terrorist let alone one who credibly connects fishing and faith better than any PBS show even could. Waked who is Egyptian in real life but whose character is Yemeni does so incredibly well and is truly the breakout star of this movie. It's a shame that Oscar season just ended because the early release of this film alone hurts his chances of receiving a Best Supporting Actor nomination although he deserves it.The inevitable love story in the movie is also unpredictable if only because you're not sure whether McGregor and Blunt should be together. McGregor's Fred is married and Blunt's Harriet has a boyfriend who is sent off to fight in the Afghanistan War. There are plot twists for both characters but even you the audience remains unsure whether the two characters working together so well to bring salmon to Yemen means they should be together. It creates a necessary tension few romantic comedies dare to address.As for their performances McGregor seems to play a more mature leading role than in other films he's made before. His character here is more practical than idealist as in Moulin Rouge 2001 more professional than playboy as in Down With Love 2003 and knows where his morals lie unlike Trainspotting 1996. While he was good in those other films he can only play those roles for so long.Emily Blunt also delivered a balanced multilayered performance and worked very well off McGregor. I thought there would be an explanation for why her character's last name was hyphenated as you almost never see characters with two last names in movies. Could there have been a failed marriage in her past perhaps? It wasn't ever explained nor was it really crucial to the plot.Kristin Scott Thomas also provides some unexpected comic relief as a press secretary for Parliament who chats with the British Prime Minister on Instant Messenger. Her character spearheads the campaign to transport the salmon to Yemen in order to divert public attention from the Afghanistan War. Again a crucial subplot but one that has to be seen not explained second hand.Salmon Fishing In The Yemen is enjoyable like some find fishing to be there's a lot of calm to it but when the funny parts happen they can be as surprising and as fulfilling as catching a big fish. Also if you actually listen to Amr Waked's character the same way some expert fisherman have pearls of wisdom the movie's enjoyment may even come as a bigger surprise.".

	schema:reviewBody "A rich sheik has decided that he would like to bring the faith and sport of flyfishing to Yemen. British fisheries expert Dr. Alfred Jones Ewan McGregor thinks it's a joke. But the PM likes the idea of positive AngloYemeni cooperation and the 2 million potential voters who fish. Dr. Jones still thinks it's a joke. The sheik transfers 50 Million over to his consultant's firm and thus the project begins.Dr. Jones still thinks it's a joke. And that is where the film shines. The filmmakers don't really treat it as if it's a true story and keep the humour sharp throughout. It's more closely related to a lighthearted romantic comedy rather than a sharpedged political memoir. But again this is where it shines because it's so much better than a lighthearted romantic comedy. McGregor nails his serious character allowing us to experience his whimsical sense of humour beneath his scientific demeanor. It's a character that I instantly connected with and it has never been better written or portrayed as it was here.To me the second best character was Sheikh Muhammed Amr Waked. Although at this point most people would prefer to mention the foulmouthed press secretary by Kristin Scott Thomas. The sheikh splits his time between the desert of Yemen and the beautiful flowing streams through the mountains and glens of Scotland. He wants to bring the serenity and faith that flyfishing brings to his people in the Middle East. Dr. Jones fishes but he is not religious. The sheikh found this a very confusing dichotomy in his character until they both realized that faith is not the same thing as religion.Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is very funny and approaches political satire level. We know and Dr Jones knows that fish do not survive in the desert. So obviously this is all a big joke but as we also all know money and power outweigh common sense. But it starts becoming clear that this might actually work after we realize that the sheikh is driven by faith  not religion nor money. And the media comes in and creates war heroes and emotions out of nothing. As I said the film is very funny but it doesn't skewer the politicians or media as much as we would want them to. At that point it becomes a romantic comedy.The genre shouldn't really matter though because it's so cute and charming and enjoyable on every level. I'm assuming the book focuses more on the political and engineering maneuvers required to bring salmon to Yemen here we just stuck with the characters. But I loved these characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "This one did snag me with a lure most appealing. Be forewarned that this 2012 romantic dramedy is idiosyncratic and full of whimsy which should come as no surprise as the director is Lasse Hallstrm whose most successful films Chocolat The Cider House Rules My Life As a Dog turn on flights of fancy. Besides it's certainly not every romantic comedy that encompasses hydroengineering environmentalism Middle East tensions and British populism. What holds these disparate subjects together is the pipe dream one Yemeni sheikh has to bring salmon fishing to the wadis of his homeland. Adapted by Simon Beaufoy Slumdog Millionaire from a popular 2006 Britlit book by Paul Torday the story primarily concerns the two people who get caught up in Sheikh Muhammad's dream  tweedy fisheries expert Dr. Alfred Jones Fred to his friends and superefficient public relations consultant Harriet ChetwodeTalbot.They are enlisted by Patricia Maxwell the hellonheels press officer for the British prime minister who is desperate for a feelgood distraction from the bloodshed occurring in Afghanistan. She is immediately drawn to the human interest angle of the salmon fishing story as well as the revelation that there are at least two million anglers in the U.K. Fred thinks the idea is ridiculous and for good reason  the plan is to build a dam which looks as big as Hoover Dam construct an elaborate irrigation system and stock the waters with 10000 North Atlantic salmon all for the hefty price tag of fifty million pounds. Alas Fred gradually succumbs to the deeply spiritual nature and ecological sensibilities of the sheikh's quest as well as Harriet's quiet persistence and demure charms. Complicating matters is the fact that Fred is unhappily married while Harriet is getting serious with a handsome soldier who gets shipped to Afghanistan.Given the attractive leads the romantic sparks are not surprising but their cautious relationship and soulful connection provide much of the movie's unforced charm. The more fanciful events in the last halfhour do bring a level of incredulity for which Hallstrm has become renowned and the terrorist subplot is woefully underdeveloped relative to the love story. However the actors in exchange deliver nicely turned performances with Ewan McGregor Beginners at his most modestly suppressed as Fred. Usually cast in brittle or saucy roles Emily Blunt The Young Victoria brings unfettered charm to Harriet without sacrificing her steely intelligence. Kristin Scott Thomas The English Patient easily steals all her scenes as Maxwell with acidic panache while Amr Waked Syriana brings a charismatic calm to the sheikh. Kudos should go to Terry Stacey 5050 for his handsome cinematography which captures London Morocco subbing for Yemen and especially Scotland in postcardworthy tableaux.".

	schema:reviewBody "You can't catch faith with a fishing rod. After Harriet Blunt contacts Dr. Alfred Jones McGregor about a Shiek from Yemen who wants to bring the sport of salmon fishing to his country he laughs it off. After being given no choice in the matter Jones begins to do just enough to keep his job. After meeting the Shiek and helping Harriet through a crisis his outlook begins to change. He puts everything he has into making the dream possible. The sign of a good movie is one that keeps you interested and makes you like it when you aren't even in the mood to watch it. I wanted to watch this based off the preview but at the time I sat down to see it I really wasn't in the mood for a movie like this. It did start off a little slow but quickly sucked me in and by the end I was so into it that I couldn't remember why I didn't want to watch it. I have fished many times but I'm not what you would call an avid fisherman. The reason I say that is because this movie has the perfect balance of enough fishing to keep fisherman entertained but not enough to make it all about fishing much like the way A River Runs Through It did. The last twenty minutes of the movie makes you feel a proverbial rollarcoaster of emotions. Every few minutes something happens that changes how you feel while not turning into the cheesy and sappy ending that it could have been. Overall a good movie that people who fish and those who don't will both enjoy. I liked it. I give it a B.".

What makes this such a joy is its impish sense of humor irreverence toward the British government the simply delightful acting of leads McGregor and Blunt who has never looked so good as she does here the appealing nature of so many characters and perhaps most of all its unpredictability. The audience enjoyed an awful lot of laugh out loud moments a few tears and a bit of excitement and danger. The film had you rooting for its the Sheik and the two lead characters  and unlike all too many films you don't see where it's going. If you enjoy a whopping good time at the flicks this is a film you should see on the big screen while you still can.".

The audience enjoyed an awful lot of laugh out loud moments a few tears and a bit of excitement and danger. The film had you rooting for its the Sheik and the two lead characters  and unlike all too many films you don't see where it's going. If you enjoy a whopping good time at the flicks this is a film you should see on the big screen while you still can.";

Its a very British film with all the gentle humour irony and brilliant acting you would expect. Kristin Scott Thomas steals it for me as the pushy Press Secretary to the Prime Minister and really deserves recognition as supporting actress. The scene where she is getting her kids off to school and her comments to her son are hilarious in street talk. Emily Blunt is delicious and Ewan McGregor plays his most understated but elegant role yet. Loved the scene with his wife Mary in the bedroom with him wearing flannel blue striped pyjamas Great casting great acting great scriptgreat photography. What's not to likeoh the salmon were fantastic  don't actually know if any were hurt in the filming but bet if they were they tasted great! Lovely movie".

	schema:headline " Mildly amusing tale of New Age Sheikh's bizarre project devolves into sentimental romcom";
	schema:reviewBody "The interesting thing about 'Salmon Fishing in Yemen' is that the title represents the film's subplot and not the main plot. A wealthy Yemeni Sheikh Muhammed seeks to introduce salmon fishing to Yemen. His handler in Great Britain Harriet ChetwodeTalbot Emily Blunt can't convince Alfred Fred Jones Ewan McGregor a government fisheries expert to support the project since he believes that Yemen doesn't have the necessary cold temperatures and water to sustain salmon. But when the Prime Minister's cynical press secretary Patricia Maxwell Kristen Scott Thomas needs a feelgood story to counter all the bad news coming out of Afghanistan suddenly Fred is forced to make nice to Harriet and actually attempt to make the project work.'Fishing in Yemen' works well when it concentrates on all the machinations involving the push to make the Sheikh's project succeed. Various obstacles crop up including the fishing industry's objection to depleting UK's stock of fresh water salmon. In Fred's estimation farm raised salmon still can be utilized and he predicts that those kind of salmon will also swim upstream. There are also local obstacles to the Sheikh's project in Yemen itself. In a rather unlikely scene Fred's thwarts the assassination of the Sheikh by a bumbling militant through the intervention of his fishing reel.But the bulk of 'Fishing' has to do with a love triangle between Fred Harriet and Harriet's new boyfriend Robert who is suddenly missing in action during a secret military mission in Afghanistan. Rather predictably Fred is on the outs with his workaholic wife Mary which opens up the possibility that he can start things up with Harriet. Before you know it Robert is no longer missing and Harriet must choose between the two men at film's end.Instead of directly murdering the Sheikh and his friendly UK supporters the local militants end up destroying his project by letting a dam open flooding the whole area. Fair enough. But what about the resolution of the love triangle? Well it's utterly predictable and sentimentalat the last moment guess who Harriet chooses? And after the whole project is wiped out the two lovebirds decide to remain in order to reignite the ruined experiment ignoring the fact that they might be eventually murdered by the same militants who attempted to wipe the Sheikh out earlier as well as destroying his dream.Time Out's David Fear couldn't have said it better when he describes the Sheikh as an Arabic version of the Magical Negro'. The Sheikh reminds one more of an expert motivational speaker at a New Age Enlightenment convention than a real Middle Eastern potentate from that part of the world. Amr Waked is fine in that role as are the other principals Blunt McGregor and Thomas.I'm told that the original book the film was based on was much more satirical than the romcom we find here. Salmon Fishing is mildly entertaining but eventually devolves into some real gooey sentimental stuff. One viewing really is enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is a charming quirky very British film that despite its flaws notably a number of plot implausibilities is an enjoyable watch. A somewhat eccentric sheikh has the idea of exporting the concept of salmon fishing from his estate in Scotland to the desert areas of the Yemen.

Dr Jones becomes romantically attracted to the sheikh's PA Emily Blunt who is also involved in the scheme.

It is beautifully shot  there are some stunning scenes of the very picturesque Scottish countryside and landscape  and is extremely well acted by the entire cast in particular the three leading actors. The script is also often very witty. Some of the detail of the plot does not stand up to close scrutiny. Dr Jones saves the life of the sheikh in a ridiculously unbelievable manner. And it beggars belief that the one person who unexpectedly emerges alive and unscathed from an otherwise fatally unsuccessful military exercise overseas is Captain Robert Mayers the partner of Harriet the sheikh's PA. His appearance throws a spanner in the works of the burgeoning closeness between Harriet and Dr Jones. There are other farfetched plot contrivances of this sort. But somehow the film survives these difficulties to provide almost two hours of undemanding entertainment that is ideal family viewing. 710.".

	schema:headline " A gentle movie about faiths of different stripes";
	schema:reviewBody "A British fisheries expert is presented with a offer from a Yemenese sheikh to bring the sport of fly fishing to the Sahara in this charming likable drama from Lasse Hallstrom. It features beautiful cinematography even for those who don't particularly care about such things and winning performances by Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen at its heart is not a movie about fish at all it is about different kinds of faith and the degree to which people place their trust in them. Alfred Jones McGregor is an expert in all things ichthyic and works for the UK's version of the Department of the Interior. He is approached by the representative of a idealistic sheikh who loves to fish. The sheikh has it in his head that bringing the art of fly fishing for salmon to the Yemen River would be beneficial to his people the river is dried up in places and is obviously in the middle of a desert. It is not a popular idea and Jones before and after taking a perfunctory meeting with Harriet dismisses it as ludicrous unsound and downright absurd. Dr. Jones is a bit of a straight arrow you see. And it would seem that would be the end of it except that the Prime Minister's press secretary Kristin Scott Thomas sees this as an opportunity to foster ArabAnglo relations at a time when well they're not so good. Long story short  Jones has to make the project work.There are many obstacles to overcome. The water must be the right temperature and with the right amount of oxygen. Fish have to be found somewhere and imported. Negotiations must be had with local tribes who feel that bringing water to the desert is an abomination of some sort. And meanwhile pressure mounts and mounts for Jones to pull it all off since the sheikh is paying handsomely to the British government.Alfred  Fred  and Harriet each have home lives that are in their own unique turmoil. Fred has been married for several years with no children and it's clear that the love he and his wife once shared in full has dwindled considerably she suddenly takes a job in Geneva promising to visit him every so often. As for Harriet the first man she has fallen for is suddenly deployed to Afghanistan. Each takes solace in their Yemen project.What works best in this movie is the chemistry between Blunt and McGregor the former plays an optimist ready for new challenges and the latter is more of a stickinthemud with little sense of humor. Okay you who are reading this know that this is a plain setup as this is not just a drama it a romantic drama. Luckily for all of us the movie doesn't descend into double entendres sideward glances awkward silences and the like. Blunt and McGregor manage to avoid making the romance too light too believable we shouldn't be able to easily guess precisely how things will wind up and we can't. Theirs is a working relationship that neither acknowledges as being anything but and each is torn between their subconscious feelings for each other and for their respective significant others.At one point the sheikh asks Jones if he is a man of faith and the expert replies that he is not. The sheikh rightly points out however that fishing itself relies on faith  the hope that something will occur however improbable. A man puts a lure into the water. The outcome is not predetermined he will most likely reel it in untouched. But he has faith that a fish will nibble at it and take the bait. The sheikh feels the same way about his fishing project. He has faith that doing so will enable the poor communities surrounding the river to thrive.In the end this is a quiet elegant movie about love and hope both of fishing and humanity. Excellent performances by the leads and able direction by Hallstrom make this a sort of softedged drama with romance and a bit of action.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Salmon Fishing in the Yemen";
	schema:reviewBody "With a title like Salmon Fishing in the Yemen it's either a story about the impossible or that which deals with fishing. It's thankfully the former which makes it a little more engaging and less of a focus on what could be a solitary activity and a romancecomedydrama that centers about the theme of hope even though this British film has plenty of elements to keep one entertained especially the good ol British wit and humour that comes fast and furious when the need calls for it.Directed by Lasse Hallstrom whose last film was an adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' Dear John Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is based on the novel by Paul Torday that tells the unlikely romance that sparked between Dr Fred Jones Ewan McGregor and investment consultant Harriet ChetwodeTalbot Emily Blunt while working on a theoretically possible project funded by a rich Yemeni Sheikh Muhammad Amr Waked. Dr Jones the bureaucrat stuck in a dead end job and happily coasting along in spite of having useless superiors is the initial skeptic preferring the status quo than to question and set challenges for himself being the expert on fishing and a mean flyfisher himself while Harriet is that cando gogetting consultant who doesn't take no for an answer herself in a sub story arc involving a British soldier sent to the frontlines in Afghanistan.Together they work under a programme mooted by the Sheikh to bring salmon fishing to his country which of course has plenty of detractors especially from extremists who see this as a waste of resources spent on infidel activities involving the West especially so since Kristin ScottThomas' thrash talking Bridget Maxwell the publicist for 10 Downing Street sees it as opportunity to raise the AngloYemeni friendship and profile. The character of Bridget Maxwell is probably the one bringing in most of the laughs for her potty mouth ways with expletives almost always finding their way into her communications verbal over the internet or otherwise and you'd wonder just how the Prime Minister's Office could have survived one PR disaster after another.Most of the narrative circled around the friendship and relations formed between the trio of Dr Jones Harriet and the Sheikh developing bonds that wouldn't have existed if not for this 50 million pounds project. It's not as if it is about those with plenty of oil money and finding themselves not knowing what to do with it but about the spreading of far larger ideals that go into community bonding. And the romantic tale almost felt like an after thought into the second half finding it irresistible not to have now fellow colleagues fall in love because it's a waste of good looking talent not to. There isn't any threat in the film to put things in a spin other than the battle against nature and elements that get systematically addressed and extremists who don't get air time lest this film gets spun into a war on terror story aside from an assassination and sabotage attempt.It's been too long since Ewan McGregor played an Englishman and one with impeccable manners at that which is something his character will strike you from the onset minding his Ps and his Qs with the penchant for the prim and the proper. The subplot involving a slowly estranged wife was something seen coming since it stood in the way of a possible relationship with Emily Blunt's Harriet and essentially is a weak point in the narrative that could have been done without since it added little emotional depth to the plot. Harriet on the other hand had an equally titfortat plot arc that also didn't do wonders for the story and together they made it feel as if there was a need to throw each character into their respective romance or lack thereof arcs with someone else until work got in the way. It didn't help of course when Kristin ScottThomas was in her element being cast against type.ultimately it's a feel good movie about hope and that leap of faith so long as someone is funding a dream to fruition or failure. The more important central arc of fulfilling the titular dream was the most engaging with sub plots being nothing more than a distraction that didn't offer any emotional depth and padded the story to a feature length one. Thankfully there's comedy thrown in now and then otherwise this would really have been like a solo fishing trip and attempt that calls for plenty of patience for something to finally bite.".

It didn't help of course when Kristin ScottThomas was in her element being cast against type.ultimately it's a feel good movie about hope and that leap of faith so long as someone is funding a dream to fruition or failure. The more important central arc of fulfilling the titular dream was the most engaging with sub plots being nothing more than a distraction that didn't offer any emotional depth and padded the story to a feature length one. Thankfully there's comedy thrown in now and then otherwise this would really have been like a solo fishing trip and attempt that calls for plenty of patience for something to finally bite.";

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Salmon Fishing in the Yemen directed by Lasse Hallstrom starring Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor and put out this year by the BBC is among a very small number of Western productions partially set in the MiddleEastern country at the tip of the Arabian peninsula. However the movie is not at all about the actual country its inhabitants or its current situation rather Yemen is used as a token obscure canvas upon which the producers paint a rather dull romantic comedy. Although some effort was made to accurately incorporate Yemeni customs and traditions the Sheikh played by Amr Waked wading through Scottish waters with his jambiya over formal robes was particularly memorable the use of Moroccan dialect in Arabic dialogue and the absurd assignation of the Tihama coastal region to a fictitious Hadhrami sheikh Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama are immediately apparent to those familiar with Yemen albeit a minority in the West which is what the producers were banking on. The same Sheikh character's English lines are hardly more sensitive to an Eastern audience equating fishing with religion and declaring that he has too many wives to not know when a woman is unhappy. Although technically a British production Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is very much a Hollywood movie and unfortunately can be filed with the many others of its kind that have reduced the Mystic Arabian Sheikh to a stock character and the Middle East to dangerous alien terrain. After all movies are a fantasy world of their own but realistically they are also a major source of information correct or not to the general public. Making a movie about a country as littleknown as Yemen was certainly a gimmick to exotify the movie but making a movie about a fictional fishing project in Yemen a country which is currently undergoing a humanitarian and political crisis because of water scarcity is glaringly socially irresponsible. If half of the thought time energy and of course dollars or pounds that went into the making of another banal romcom vehicle were directed towards Yemen the actual country not the filmmakers' fantasy there might have been a significant improvement in the lives of the inhabitants of one of the poorest countries in the world. Instead throughout the whole absurdist plot about a sportfishing project in a Hadhrami wadi not a single mention was made of Yemen's very real water problems and the attachment of Yemen's name to a movie about water was an exploitation to garner audience's curiosity without a single cent being reinvested in the country's desperate reality all scenes set in Yemen were shot in Morocco which also accounts for the Moroccan dialect in its brief Arabic dialogues. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen may be the most thoughtless morally unaccountable movie of the year and certainly has its place in Hollywood's hall of shame for movies about the Middle East.".

Perhaps the salmon themselves were the metaphor of their long migrations and swimming upstream against the current. I don't know this made no sense to me. Of course it just so happens that the two people working on the salmon project are a man and women each with mate woes. He is the typical boring conservative Brit she the adventurous jaded alpha type. The film has little dynamic and shifts between something that reveals serious drama and soap opera. The glaring thing to me was the lack of chemistry between Blunt and McGregor two actors I genuinely like. When we 1st hear of his love for her I was taken for surprise as I noticed no mutual interest expressed in either dialog or body language. Up until that point I had no idea that there was even a romance element in the film. This is where the film focuses on their romantic feelings but it never comes across.

	schema:reviewBody "The latest heartwarmingly comedic effort from the largely unknown but quite prolific Swedish director Lasse Hallstrm is one of those unusual films that we choose to classify as comedies but are actually very pensive emotional dramas with the odd subtle serving of humour and the occasional wellearned wacky laughoutloud moment. Although these are arguably not as indulgently entertaining as those bombastic screwball comedies they are in the long run far more satisfying because they contain more than just an impulsive frivolous momentum of silliness. Having said that the characters and narrative on offer here don't always carry a watertight dramatic but they never completely lose hold of your interest and it helps to see this film with a sizeable audience as the crowd's empathy for what plays out on screen is infectious.The key personal human element of the story is the charmingly friendly relationship between enthusiastic fisheries expert Dr Albert Jones Ewan McGregor and his colleague Harriet Emily Blunt who ropes him into the seemingly impossible project of introducing the sport of salmon fishing to the very arid desert regions of the Yemen on the request of a very optimistic and eloquent Sheik Amr Waked. Harriet is convinced that their immense undertaking will eventually be successful but Albert insists that he is too scientific to believe that such a thing is practically possible. It takes quite a while for the pair to get along given his rather standoffish nature leading to Harriet making a frustrated comparison between him and those with Asperger's Syndrome. Although he is a far cry away from having that condition he is certainly puzzled by Harriet's frequent offers of friendship. He also with comforting her after her dashing boyfriend Robert Tom Mison the main entity keeping the relationship a tame platonic friendship is sent off to fight in Afghanistan.The events that unfold from this love triangle will hardly surprise any audience member with even the smallest exposure to love stories and the fate of the project follows exactly the same narrative formula employed by most animated family comedies. The main point of interest is the leftfield premise of flyfishing which is handled so well that if ever one questions the level of excitement that can be derived from a film about marine agriculture the enchantment is soon replenished by its insightful philosophical comparisons with religious faith.The two leads perform admirably and convincingly with the occasionally trite but mostly astute dialogue from Simon Beaufoy adapted from Paul Torday's original novel however it is the divine Kristin Scott Thomas who ultimately steals the show. Her character of a ruthlessly shallow press secretary to the Prime Minister who is in full support of this project as a more cheerful Afghanistan news story is not terribly essential to the story and so has been sidelined in my earlier plot description but she is a great asset to the film's entertainment value. Even though critics are constantly praising her performances in serious dramatic roles she is much more dynamic in her comedic outings as deliciously nasty matriarchs. Also noteworthy is an equally vicious characterisation from Rachael Stirling as Albert's classically unlikeable wife with a much less playful tone.Although it is a less effective and hardhitting directorial effort from Hallstrm than Chocolat 2000 and What's Eating Gilbert Grape 1993 and the fact that aside from Scott Thomas nothing else is really deserving award recognition but it does make for very memorable and pleasurable viewing.".

So the film starts off with some quite 'typical' Government type people amazing dry humour expressed who obviously want to lie and cheat and a Sheik who has a 'vision'. NOT though what you'd expect from Ewan McGregor. They all meet Alfred Harriet and the Sheik at his Scottish residence with his entourage included although briefly plus a Scottish butler! The Sheik is played brilliantly with a novel belief he can understand everything. We move to fishing with him as in the Sheik and Alfred. You can imagine Alfred meets Harriet for dinner with the Sheik and you swiftly detect he's falling in love with her at first sight. The Sheik is a good observer but so diplomatic. We move to the latter part of the film. Bad men try and kill the project  and the Sheik! and Alfred is the 'hero'. Harriet's boyfriend is flown in well and safe by the government after hewas believed to be lost in action in Afghanistan for publicity. NOT to give too much away the last three minutes of the film tells it all. Funny whimsical and exceptionally well casted I would say. If you like 'dry' humour then all your wishes will come to fruition. Well filmed produced and I can only say I wish I were Ewan McGregor or in real life or knew Emily Blunt for real! Michael".

	schema:headline " The kind of movie that inspires you";
	schema:reviewBody "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is a movie about making the impossible possible and about having faith in the extraordinary. The premise of the film is as unusual as the title Yes it really is about Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. And the movie is every bit as intriguing as the title would suggest.The story centers on Dr. Alfred Jones a practical man who works as the British Governments Head of Fisheries. A shy but kind man honest and refreshingly downtoearth he is trapped in a difficult marriage to Mary and is somewhat apprehensive at the invitation of a Sheikh to introduce as you may have guessed salmon fishing to the Yemen. Pressured by the British government who see it as a Middle East story not about terrorism Alfred agrees albeit informing the Sheikh that while it may be theoretically possible he cannot believe it. Also joining them is the Sheikh's consultant Harriet ChetwodeTalbot a determined somewhat emotional woman in the early days of a relationship with soldier Robert Mayers.Dr. Jones and Harriet set out for the Sheikh's estate in Scotland where Dr Jones is told by the Sheikh some wonderful things about faith. Through his blossoming friendship with the optimistic Sheikh and the lovely Harriet Jones begins to believe that the impossible is actually possible and so the story begins.I adore this film. Amr Waked deserves the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as an optimistic thoughtful kind passionate and more than anything inspiring character who embodies nobility and goodness. However he is not entirely angelic he understands women's feelings from his many wives...very vocal about their feelings! and has a quirky sense of humour. The brotherly friendship between him and Dr. Jones is to me the nicest relationship in the film a relationship truly based on admiration and respect. The Sheikh says to Dr. Jones that the project isn't really about fish at all. The viewer may be surprised by this initially but on further thought you realise what he means. To the Sheikh it is not about fish but about Salmon fishing in the Yemen. About the impossible being impossible. About having faith enough to make the extraordinary come true. It is less a task than a journey although of course he loves fishing!My favourite quote of the movie comes from the lovely Sheikh. It is to me a wonderful summary of everybody who is a realistAre you a religious man? No But you like to fish? Well yes. And how long is it before you catch a fish? An hour? Ten? It can be hundreds of hours! But you keep going do you not? You keep on trying to catch that fish even though you cannot see it even though you do not know when or even if it will come. You keep trying. Because you have faith. I don't think fish and faith have much in common your Excellency. Ah. But I do.It is the influence the Sheikh has on Dr. Jones that is the highlight he finds freedom and joy happiness optimism and love.Of course there are parts that aren't perfect. It's only a film. But it's a film that explores deep ideas with a lovely lightness not an arthouse thoughthouse film that you can't concentrate on cos you're trying to understand it's meaning it's a film simply about believing in the impossible and embracing all that's possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "An Arab sheikh with more money than sense wants to import the sport andor lifestyle of salmon fishing from cold and rainy Scotland to the barren desert of Yemen. In the meantime the British government is floundering from scandal to scandal and greedily seizes upon the idea of a cultural rapprochement between the West and the Arab world through this fishing enterprise it is even better that the sheik is willing to foot the entire bill. The messy details will be filled in by the Fisheries Department representative Dr. Alfred Jones Ewan McGregor and an investment rep for the sheikh Ms. Harriet ChetwodeTalbot Emily Blunt.Naturally Dr. Jones is incredulous that anyone would think it feasible to move 10000 salmon from Scotland to Yemen and considers his assignment a fool's errand. Harriet's apparent upper class business school education prepared her not to stop and question these silly survivability issues. Oh and out of nowhere see seems to speak fluent Mandarin Chinese. Two characters being inconveniently thrust together like this is a classic setup for the romantic comedy genre. You expect to them to start out at odds grow fond of each other overcome some last second conflict and then float away together with their aquatic metaphors. Well the joke is on the audience and the culprits are the marketing execs.The preview for Salmon Fishing in the Yemen shows it as a joke a minute and lightly conceived romantic comedy however there is barely any noticeable comedy and every scene left out of the preview leans more toward the dramatic. There is an Afghanistan side plot an unhappy marriage tribal terrorism and emotional depression. The character of Dr. Jones is plainly painted as obstinate in the beginning both towards the project and to Harriet because his character arc is required to end up softer and more compassionate. In reality even if the good Dr. considered the salmon project lunacy he would not be so overtly rude to Harriet.The plan's financier Sheikh Muhammed Amr Waked is an obscenely rich man from Yemen prone to waxing philosophic about salmon. That kind of money can only come from oil wealth but Yemen has no oil reserves. The plot never explains the source of the Sheikh's money not because it is not consequential to the plot but because it cannot. The screenplay could never find an Earthly explanation of why a Yemeni sheikh could haphazardly plop down 50 million pounds on a salmon project. The writer Simon Beaufoy most recently adapted 127 Hours and Slumdog Millionaire into scripts and even he chose to leave that tiny detail out of the script.What comedy there is in Salmon Fishing in the Yemen comes from the Prime Minister's press secretary Patricia Maxwell Kristen Scott Thomas. She is very good at what she does knows the angle of the story she wants planted in the papers before the event occurs and moves very quickly to make things happen. Kristen Scott Thomas hasn't played a character this snarky since Four Weddings and a Funeral. Unfortunately Patricia vanishes a quarter ways through the film and when she reappears towards the end the plot has unnecessarily shifted her from comedic to more bureaucratic.The acting in this film is more than capable especially from McGregor since he is able to talk in his native Scottish dialect. Sadly the screenplay is a mess and the tone created by director Lasse Hallstrom resembles nothing from the misleading preview and is much darker than the blindsided audience will be prepared for. Feel free to skip Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.".

Apparently Paddy Chaeffsky John Cromwell and a group of brilliant actors decided to put their efforts together and create this vehicle for one of the greatest actresses that ever lived. I. for one will always be grateful to them for their generous and visionary gesture. The film cost 5.000 but it's worth a fortune as the surviving immortal document of an unrepeatable personality capable and willing to drown into another. Although Marilyn Monroe was not only alive but at the top of her game at the time. This devastatingly sad story seems to reflect Marilyn's own. Kim Stanley is glorious glorious! If you're interested in acting as art. You can't miss this extraordinary movie.".

Apparently Paddy Chaeffsky John Cromwell and a group of brilliant actors decided to put their efforts together and create this vehicle for one of the greatest actresses that ever lived. I. for one will always be grateful to them for their generous and visionary gesture. The film cost 5.000 but it's worth a fortune as the surviving immortal document of an unrepeatable personality capable and willing to drown into another. Although Marilyn Monroe was not only alive but at the top of her game at the time. This devastatingly sad story seems to reflect Marilyn's own. Kim Stanley is glorious glorious! If you're interested in acting as art. You can't miss this extraordinary movie.";

With the publication of her biography there seems to be a renewed interest in her life and career. Unfortunately very little is left in the way of documentation of her talents. She came to movies after a career on Broadway and a number of live television plays. But her film career was not to be owing to the many personal problems she suffered from which seemingly burnt her out. The Goddess was her first film and it remains the most complete testament to her talents. As such it really is a must for anyone who appreciates the art of acting. The title role allows for a huge range from hopeful teenager to jaded Hollywood star. Although clearly too old to play a teenager and definitely no screen beauty worthy of the title goddess Stanley pulls it off with the sheer force of her acting. Her portrayal of the breakdown of the actress is devastating. It's particularly disturbing in the light of the similarity of what would become her very own fate. Paddy Chayevsky paints a bleak picture of the Hollywood Star system as he would later do with network television in Network. Although well written it's not an especially astute script lacking in both scope and depth. There is good support form Betty Lou Holland and Lloyd Bridges but the only reason to seek this one out remains Kim Stanley.".

Of course I'd seen Kim Stanley before and remembered her from television dramas of the 1950s but LAW AND ORDER has been my goto show for comfort because of the presence of Steven Hill as the calm reserved and wise Adam Schiff over the years. Hill was one of those young firebrand actors from the Actors Studio along with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift with great emotional depth and range and too little film remains of him except for his creation of the big boss of all those young D.A's.I enjoyed this clunky filmits flashes of brilliant dialogue by Paddy Chayefsky the simplicity of young Patty Duke's portrayal of lonely childhood the miraculous transformation of Kim Stanley to Emily Ann Faulkner a spectacularly bad name choice I thought a chattery teenager and needy adultbut even more I loved Steven Hill's John Tower. John is neglected as Emmy has been but has turned inward to the point of suicide. Steven delivers the selfloathing monologues without sentimentality or melodrama but as the monumental weight that controls his life. He simply tells his story as a neurosisridden introvert might. His performance is direct uncluttered rather like Adam Schiff's was to be.The movie is worth seeing for the writing and for all the performances. It does not paint a picture of Marilyn Monroelater writers and actresses would go much farther in doing thatand knowing what we now do about Marilyn we'd hardly connect this film to her. But it is an excellent example of the kind of acting that was breaking ground in the 1950s through the proliferation of live television dramas and the excellent teaching of the craft of acting in New York and around the country. Kim Stanley is a virtuoso but Steven Hill was too.".

Twelve years later 1942 she is still there  a religious fanatic and Emily Ann Stanley is the town tramp who desperately dreams of Hollywood fame. When she and some friends run across a drunk who just happens to be the mixed up son of a Hollywood star she sees her opportunity but it only leads to frustration as the first part ends with Emily a young mother voicing the very words her mother said many years before  that she is not ready to be a mother and she just wants to have fun.I also was unfamiliar with Kim Stanley but by the end on viewing it recently I was wondering who was this superlative actress. Marilyn Monroe may have been the character's inspiration but as played by Miss Stanley that was unimportant. Her extraordinary performance made the role her own and seemed to encapsulate all the hard luck unloved actresses  Monroe Garland etc. I do agree Stanley did look a bit old but the magic in her performance was like a sky rocket especially in the scene where she is describing her inner most dreams to a boy who has only asked her out because he thinks she is easy  but I think Ann Sheridan is a true beauty don't you think?. He doesn't care the same as he doesn't care when she is explaining that the only reason she has that reputation is because she wants to be liked. Heart breaking stuff!!That's why I think the film works best in the first half. There was a continuity  the unloved little girl becomes the promiscuous teenager who then marries and becomes her mother all over again. Unlike her mother she does escape to Hollywood and the next part finds her an up and coming starlet contemplating marriage to an over the hill boxer Lloyd Bridges is very good. The second part falls down a bit suddenly she is the Goddess at the top of her profession but already having suffered a severe breakdown and now has her mother living with her. Mother great performance by Betty Lou Holland is even more remote and now only has time for God but Emily doesn't care only knowing that she needs a mother's love and security. When Emily finds religion and her mother leaves that paves the way for a descent into madness.A very strong film remembered for Kim Stanley's powerhouse performance.".

The production had obviously a very limited budget and the Paddy Chayefsky script could have been altered to better fit Kim Stanley's screen persona the actress is obviously too old and does not have the beauty to convincingly play a poor young country girl who becomes a highly successful movie star but in the end that matters little. Kim Stanley's performance is so brilliant so complex so achingly true that one forgets the film's limitations and what remains is a feeling of deep awe in face of so much talent. This is quite possibly the most harrowing emotionally devastating acting job I have ever seen along with Liv Ullman's performance in FACE TO FACE. How wonderful to be able to see it over 50 years later! And what a pity that Stanley was not in films more often!".

The production had obviously a very limited budget and the Paddy Chayefsky script could have been altered to better fit Kim Stanley's screen persona the actress is obviously too old and does not have the beauty to convincingly play a poor young country girl who becomes a highly successful movie star but in the end that matters little. Kim Stanley's performance is so brilliant so complex so achingly true that one forgets the film's limitations and what remains is a feeling of deep awe in face of so much talent. This is quite possibly the most harrowing emotionally devastating acting job I have ever seen along with Liv Ullman's performance in FACE TO FACE. How wonderful to be able to see it over 50 years later! And what a pity that Stanley was not in films more often!";

	schema:reviewBody "Paddy Chayefsky's The Goddess from 1958 stars Kim Stanley one of the great actresses of our time as a Marilyn Monroe type a lonely unloved girl who finds stardom in Hollywood but ultimately selfdestructs. It should be noted that the movie predates Monroe's death by four years.Chayefsky is responsible for such screenplays as Network The Hospital Marty among others and frankly The Goddess is one of his weaker works. There is very little in the way of character development  events happen very quickly skipping over years hitting the high points with very little in between. For instance Emily Ann Stanley talks about her nervous breakdown but we don't see it. She makes reference to past promiscuity while talking to her second husband Lloyd Bridges but all we see is an invitation by a studio head to come to his house.The film is notable for the tour de force performance by Stanley who despite the gaps in the story creates a vivid characterization of a desperate ambitious easily influenced woman looking for someone to love her. Stanley absorbs all of Emily Ann's changes of mood as well as her temperament. When Emily Ann is recently home from the sanitarium she receives a visit from a director Werner Klemperer and his wife. She's hyperkinetic a ticking bomb the next time we see them visit she's found Jesus and acts calm and centered. One can see here that she must have been a magnificent Blanche DuBois a role she performed early in her career.The Goddess seems to have been made on a tight budget it certainly doesn't look like a glossy Hollywood film. Stanley was 40 when she made it and her role begins when the character is 19. There's no attempt anywhere in the film to make her look younger or like a starlet or a movie star. Yet she makes you believe the whole thing.It's a pity Stanley didn't make more films but The Goddess gives us an excellent idea of Kim Stanley's magnificence as an actress.".

THE GODDESS is not one of the them. In order to make a well made play Chayevsky leaves out a great deal of much needed character development. Things happen quickly too quickly in fact to either have a semblance of truth or make us feel anything for any of the characters. Instead of agonizing over the rise and fall of THE GODDESS we spend the whole time trying to piece things together to see if the main character IS based on Marilyn Monroe after all. Look...instead of a baseball player she marries a boxer! Is that supposed to be Joe Mankiewicz talking about her in that scene? Is that Daryll Zanuck inviting her back to his home? Is the film she's talking about supposed to be GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES? ALL ABOUT EVE? What should be a heart wrenching drama turns out to be instead a far from subtle far too short and badly over written Hollywood guessing game.The wonderful Virgil Thompson did the musical score but here it is totally out of sync with the rest of the film. His jaunty melodies put us in mind of the WPA films he did with Pare Lorentz instead of the background to a human drama. To see how good a score can be in illustrating the images on the screen go to Leonard Bernstein's amazing work for ON THE WATERFRONT. But the acting IS good. Thank goodness we see what a fine actress Kim Stanley was. Some of her moments especially the quiet ones are breathtaking. Sometimes alas she is allowed to go over the top. At her best in this film she gives one of the screen's greatest performances at her worst and there are moments she is a caricature of every Tennessee William's female character with a little Eunice from MAMA'S FAMILY thrown in for good measure. Happily the good moments far out number the bad and one should see THE GODDESS to see why Stanley is so justly venerated. Lloyd Bridges and Elizabeth Wilson are also good. THE GODDESS should have been a masterpiece. Instead what we get is nothing more than a fairly good film. No matter how good its pedigree THE GODDESS turns out to be no more than a mixed blessing.".

Characters deliver long wellwritten speeches trusting the viewer both to pay attention and to draw more inferences than than most modern or classic films allow. That said the story feels undevelopedas if Chayevsky was asking us to his work for him. An important character undergoes a religious conversion without explanation. Marriages end offscene. The film moves forward choppily superimposing the year 1930 1942 on screen to ground us  but not very successfully. The camera is on Stanley for almost the entire film and very few performers can sustain our interest for that long  at least not without a very strong script. To end on another positive note a studio exec acknowledges that Stanley's character isn't very pretty but that she has warmth and sensuality with which to engage her audience.

I rather liked Steven Hill's excellent performance as her first husband likewise Lloyd Bridges excellent performance as her second husband!

Kim Stanly plays the part of Emily Ann Faulkner a local girl from rural Maryland who made it big in tinsel town and in the end paid for it. Working her way up in mostly non speaking parts in mostly Bmovies Emily got her big brake after she married former light heavyweight champion of the world Dutch Seynour Llyod Bridges who in fact saw more of Emily Ann then anyone in the movie. This was after a failed marriage with son of major movie star John Towers Steven Hill whom she had a daughter with and who deserted them both to go overseas to fight fascism in Nazi occupied Europe wishing that he'll never come back alive. It's much later that a sober and reformed Towers does come back to Emily Ann together with the couples 14 year old daughter Gial Haworth but by then Emily Ann is so out of it she's in no condition to see her.The film mirrors Marilyn Monroe's career in Hollywood where she became the biggest star in films but paid dearly in the lifestyle she lead off the screen that in the end that's 4 years after the movie was released ended up losing her life at the young age of 36. It's the death of Emily Ann's bible thumping mom Laureen Betty Lou Holland that really pushed her over the edge. We see Emily Ann slowly self destructs and become addicted to pills and booze to the point where the only thing left in life to her is the movies that she stars in that make money for the studios. We get to see Emily Ann go from a beautiful and talented actress to a bed ridden pill popping wino in less then ten years 19471957 not at all caring what will happen to her in the future.SPOILERS It's a true story in many ways of how fame can destroy the person who has it and Kim Stanley does an amazing job of acting to make that point on the screen. We've seen so many similar cases in and out of Hollywood of people who seem to have the world in their hands and at their feet and then end up dead or institutionalized because of the pressure it fame demands of them which they can't handle.".

	schema:reviewBody "Names like Paddy Chayefsky and Kim Stanley still carry some weight  and in this film they have to. It's not a terrible movie but it is a weird little film not the least because Kim Stanley is so completely and utterly miscast. And yet her performance has stirring moments and the film does have a dark energy in its early portions that's dispersed in many vaguely wrong directions as the film winds towards its predictable conclusion.Stanley's miscasting begins with the physical  she was much too old for the role even for the later parts of the film so in the sequences where she's supposed to be a teenager it is really laughable. Sad to say she's also simply not attractive enough to be cast as a movie star. People on this board may be comparing her to Bette Davis but at 40 Bette still had some sexy spark. With Stanley there's no real screen chemistry. I found myself often thinking that Betty Lou Holland as her mother was more attractive in her old age makeup than Stanley was in her young age makeup. There is some movie magic that can be employed in cases like this but the producers apparently skimped.....They also forgot to cast a compelling male in the film  Lloyd Bridges tries awful hard here and it's probably best to just leave it at that. Steven Hill is just a stick of wood just horrible to watch in this film.The film came out just a few years before everybody saw what was so wrong with Marilyn Monroe on whom the film is so clearly based. There's also a bit of Jane Mansfield in there too perhaps. In the sense that this came out in the late 50s instead of the early 60s when Carroll Baker made a minicareer out of these kinds of roles it's a prescient film. But it's not a powerful film because none of the secondary characters are able to match up to Stanley's screen time. It's a confused and confusing movie  I thought occasionally Chayefsky was reaching for dark humor in the sense perhaps of Tennessee Williams' contemporary Baby Doll with the aforementioned Carroll Baker but if he was reaching for this then he forgot to tell director John Cromwell whose work here is just as remote and studied as it was on any of his big Fox productions with Tyrone Power and people like that.".

Tom gets a call from a woman who mistakenly believes he knew her recently deceased son. He goes along with it presumably to save her the added grief of knowing her son had no close friends. Of course Tom's accommodating nature backfires and he's asked to give the eulogy for a man he never knew. This sets up a scene with the kind of dark humor seen throughout the movie that audiences are either delighted with or immediately turned off by.At the funeral Tom meets Julie his unrequited high school crush played with genuine emotion and winsome grace by Gwyneth Paltrow. Thus begins two relationships that play out over the duration of the film one with Grace the bereft mother of the friend Tom never had played by Barbara Hershey and the other with Julie.Yes this movie owes much in terms of plot and characters to The Graduate with Hershey playing the counterpart to Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson. But it turns out to be much more than just an update of the '60s classic. The audience really gets to know the inner turmoil both Tom and Julie are going through  Tom both for the guilt of becoming unwittingly involved with Grace and for also being involved with Julie at the same time and Julie for being torn between striking out on her own to escape her overbearing parents and getting into a deep relationship with Tom.There are a couple of sideplots going on with Tom's friends  Michael Rapaport's character getting married to a woman his friends don't like and Michael Vardan's married character making a move on Julie which obviously infuriates Tom. And Carol Kane as Tom's mom is precious. In one scene he is livid after she bursts into his room unannounced. After she receives a brief scolding for not knocking she replies I only wanted to see if you wanted some ice cream to which he replies A little. Schwimmer nails the role with his underplayed tacit sadness about his sofarfailed attempt at making a responsible life for himself. And Paltrow well can she ever miss? Whether for the dark humor spoton acting or superb soundtrack this one is definitely worth a viewing.".

She is the mother of a dead guy named Bill. Tom did not know Bill but the mother thinks he was his best friend. He plays along. The affair starts but Tom is really in love with a younger girl named Julie Gwyneth Paltrow. So far this is a lot like The Graduate and in my opinion this wasn't a good part of the movie although it had its funny scenes.The comparison with The Graduate holds on in the main plotline may be but The Pallbearer takes a different way in the way it is shown to us. I liked how the movie developed from that moment on. Especially the ending is wellchosen.David Schwimmer was a better lead than I expected he wasn't that bad. Most funny scenes were happening because of him. Gwyneth Paltrow was lovely and for me she made sure I liked the movie a little more. It is not very good but it has a couple of good laughs a nice story and a nice chemistry between Schwimmer and Paltrow.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Pallbearer will be compared with The Graduate. A graduate Tom played by David Schwimmer only one year later has an affair with an older woman. She is the mother of a dead guy named Bill. Tom did not know Bill but the mother thinks he was his best friend. He plays along. The affair starts but Tom is really in love with a younger girl named Julie Gwyneth Paltrow. So far this is a lot like The Graduate and in my opinion this wasn't a good part of the movie although it had its funny scenes.The comparison with The Graduate holds on in the main plotline may be but The Pallbearer takes a different way in the way it is shown to us. I liked how the movie developed from that moment on. Especially the ending is wellchosen.David Schwimmer was a better lead than I expected he wasn't that bad. Most funny scenes were happening because of him. Gwyneth Paltrow was lovely and for me she made sure I liked the movie a little more. It is not very good but it has a couple of good laughs a nice story and a nice chemistry between Schwimmer and Paltrow.";

Schwimmer does an admirable job as a young man almost a virgin in relationships.Then he meets the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and sparks begin to fly. So the plot thickens when he's up against the two ladies in his life. Add another lady Carol Kane his mother who does a brilliant job as she fawns over her son. She's a riot and brings what little comedy there is to the movie.Friends to Schwimmer are played by Michael Rapaport as a groom to be with advice for his friend and Michael Vartan who I have liked since THE NEXT BEST THING. They both add much to this movie.Not really a comedy as the acting is quite real and often touching but enjoyable to watch the two stars in the leads and an excellent supporting cast.".

He is hindered in part by his inability to get past an unrequited love in high school played by Paltrow. Schwimmers's body language is so in tune to the emptiness of his character. His journey reminds me once again of another film  Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate. Tom has three friends who give the appearance of having figured things out but demonstrate their own frailties before the film is done. Barbara Hershey in the role of the mother of the deceased initially earns no sympathy but by end of the film there is more understanding of if not empathy her character. By the way I mean no criticism in comparing this film or its characters to other film.Don't see this film if you're looking for a lighthearted comedy. It's not Friends or Shallow Hall. It's a thoughtful film with an especially sweet performance by David Schwimmer.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Pallbearer' is a somewhat inoffensive film which most people could either take or leave. The film was Schwimmer's first attempt at non'Friends' success but it bombed terribly at the box office and as a result remains unusual and unique in that so far it is his only attempt to carry a picture. I'm hesitant to call a it a star vehicle because it also features Gwenyth Paltrow but that is essentially what it is or at least trieswas meant to be.I actually like this movie but I would have found it ultimately forgettable if it hadn't been constantly shown on one of the more obscure digital TV channels late at night just as I was coming in from work for a 6 month period a few years back.It has a good and recognisable cast which will put an audience at ease. Rappaport is as usual very funny and Schwimmer plays a very 'Ross'esque character given a ridiculous hair cut so that we can obviously differentiate from his 'Friends' persona. Paltrow looks cute and does what she does best.....pouts a lot.The plot itself centres around Schwimmer's character attempting to negotiate a relationship beyond friendship with his high school crush Paltrow who he has not been in contact with for years presumably as he has only recently returned from completing his college studies. This is somewhat hindered though as he has also become intimately involved with the grieving mother of a recently deceased local man played by Barabra Hershey who believes wrongly that Schwimmer's character was her departed son's best  and for that matter only friend at high school. As he is looking for some excitement in life Scwimmer's character was more than willing to maintain this incorrect assumption in order to bed the vulnerable Hershey character but after peddling the deception to the point where he delivers the eulogy at her son's funeral at which he is also a Pallbearer hence the film's title guilt begins to catch up with him and the 'Graduate'esqu style of excitement he had previously felt is replaced by regret. There is also the underlying feeling to which many can probably relate of a post graduate who is struggling to move on with his life. This of course summons further comparisons with the earlier mentioned 'Graduate' from which this picture obviously draws major though not overly obvious influences.Tom Thompson Schwimmer has achieved an architectural degree but is struggling to find employment in the field and is back living in his old bedroom at his mother's house which looks  and where he is treated like he is still at high school. To make matters worse his friends who live near by are all in 95 jobs and have all moved on with their lives to the point they are either married or engaged and are considering starting families. The relationship with Hershey seems to give a feeling of maturity whilst the reemergence of Paltrow has allowed him to recall happier and simpler times in his life where he wasn't under so much pressure to grow up.The story itself can be viewed as simplistic and not very exciting but it was matched by the slow pace. I myself actually appreciated it but maybe thats because I found relevance to my own life. Either way the audience can get some enjoyment out of the actor's performances and some sharp dialogue and set pieces. There are also some nice directorial touches though the film is not what you would call stylistic or a talky for that matter.Shwimmer's deadpan comedic tone and facial expressions worked as well here as they do in 'Friends'. I felt he was just right for the role and enjoyed his performance. Though I accept that he is not to everyone's taste and for that reason many people will probably not enjoy this movie. Being a Shwimmer fan here is not a necessity but it certainly helps.On the whole this is the kind of film which works well at entertaining in a kind of personal way and in a subdued setting IE. late at night in your living room with nothing else on or perhaps a rainy Saturday afternoon. It would have been an extremely unsatisfying cinematic event though and that is probably where most of the bad press for it comes from.Definitely not perfect but none the less a decent film which is made all the more worth while if you approach it with low expectations like I did.The underlying theme is about facing up to the difficulty of that crossroads in life when we realise that perhaps its time to move on from being a carefree youth to a mature adult. If that interests you then I guess this movie you will appreciate.".

Unfortunately The Pallbearer doesn't deliverthere are some moments which are undeniably funny though the eulogy mentioned in the tag line wasn't one of them. The plot is a little thin to hang a movie on in fact it might have been better done as an episode of Friends about twenty minutes could have handled the whole thing. There's an immense amount of filler herelong excruciating shots of David Schwimmer and his goofy expression as he tries to pretend he knows the poor loser from high school recently deceased that he can't remember but is asked to act as pallbearer for. Everyone in this movie seems to be in one form of pain or anotherPaltrow keeps repeating how she has to leave but really doesn't explain why in fact part of the plot seems to be her inability to explain why. Those who like romantic comedies should stay away for those who like just plain dark comedies might want to look elsewhere as well question is whether a couple of funny moments in an otherwise dull bleak movie is worth the time.".

After reading the cover of the VHS copy I watched I expected Pallbearers to be a lighthearted screwball comedy. Although there were comic moments the movie also explored deeper terrain and was all the better for it. I thought Pallbearers presented a seamless blend of humor and some poignant stuff about the angsty turbulent ethos of the early 20's. David Schimmer was neurotic charming endearing and overall fantastic in the lead role shades of Woody Allen and the supporting actors were all convincing in theirs. I also thought that the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly providing the perfect backdrop for tones that were simultaneously wistful bittersweet romantic and humorous. Maybe the movie appealed to me especially because I really connected with some of the experiences and emotions explored nevertheless I give it a solid 8 out of 10.".

Its his fumbling that actually makes this plot line workbecause his character has such lack of confidence in his abilities to do anything successfully you can almost see how he's just completely sabotaging this relationship up almost as a default setting.The plot borrows a strong ingredient from The GraduateIn short order Schwimmer's character ends up bedding a much older womanand a much more dominant one as wellbut i think his relationship with her comes from a different place then Dustin Hoffman's reasons for bedding Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Schwimmer's character feels like a loser so he acts like a loser so he continues to live like a loserperpetuating the cycleits not exactly an act of rebellion or an act of concern about his future the way it was for Hoffmanbut still its a key plot point of The Graduate and the two films similarities in plot and tone are hard to overlookand yet The Pallbearer got to me in a way that The Graduate never did. Maybe its because The Pallbearer is more contemporary although not too contemporaryif it was done todayschwimmer's character would spend all of his time on message boards on the internet for sure. but i definitely felt this film strike a nerve deep within me far more painfully then The Graduate did.This film also was the first one produced by none other then JJ Abrams2 years before Felicity made its debut on TVand a full 8 years before LOST premiered. It was also written by frequent TV writer Jason Katims he of Friday Night Lights Boston Public Roswell and various other rather uncommonly well written television shows concerning modern wayward youth and directed by Matt Reeves who went on to direct Cloverfield and Let Me In which is odd because the only horror this film has is completely in the abstract societal sense. Either waythere was a lot of major talent involved behind the making of this film that was just starting out here for the first timeand i truly believe it to be a far more noteworthy film not only because of that but also because this movie was completely ahead of its time in showing you the whole twenty somethings who don't know what to do with their life stage of lifeand also a truly underrated film on its own merits worthy of study and a true successor to The Graduate and the fact that it'll prob never be seen as such largely sucks.".

To make matters worse Julie who knew the late Bill Abernathy is appalled at the spectacle she sees.The Pallbearer based on David Lipsky's novel which we never read was adapted for the screen by Matt Reeves who also directs and Jason Katims. The film evokes other films specially certain aspects of The Graduate or even the hit television series Friends in which the leading man had a prominent role. After watching the movie we are going to make the point of reading the book because it appears this work didn't quite translate to the screen as conceived by its creator.What the film has going for itself is the interesting cast assembled for it. Never having been a fan of David Schwimmer we have to admit he does a decent job because he is playing against type. Gwyneth Paltrow's take on Julie doesn't quite come across but she always gives good readings in anything she appears. The surprise was Barbara Hershey who as Mrs. Abernathy brings substance to a role that could have been a caricature with another less experienced actress.The excellent supporting role is about the best thing in the movie. Michael Rappaport a versatile actor gives a fine performance as Tom's best friend. The amazing Carol Kane is never seen too long but has a couple of funny scenes as Tom's mother. Tony Collette as a brunette doesn't get to do much also in minor roles Michael Vartan Mark Margolies Elizabeth Franz and the rest contribute to the film.".

I think when the film was marketed it was playing on the growing popularity of Ross from Friends as opposed to David Schwimmer in what is ultimately a glorified indie flic with a Gwyneth Paltrow that reminds you of why she is a bonafide star.The performances ring true and sure there are problems but Barbara Hershey once again proves that she's one of the most underrated actresses of her generation. It's incredibly obvious throughout the film that the photography was guided by the masterful Robert Elswit showing early signs of the brilliance that has made him an Oscar winner and the additional eyes of Paul Thomas Anderson.They incredibly mismarketed this film and thus there was a Friends audience running to the theatre to see something that was far too dark for liking. I stick The Pallbearer into my category of films that includes both Beautiful Girls and The Myth of Fingerprints. I wouldn't say it's superior to these examples of character driven it's time to make some life decisions comedies but it's certainly worth watching and enjoying.".

It's incredibly obvious throughout the film that the photography was guided by the masterful Robert Elswit showing early signs of the brilliance that has made him an Oscar winner and the additional eyes of Paul Thomas Anderson.They incredibly mismarketed this film and thus there was a Friends audience running to the theatre to see something that was far too dark for liking. I stick The Pallbearer into my category of films that includes both Beautiful Girls and The Myth of Fingerprints. I wouldn't say it's superior to these examples of character driven it's time to make some life decisions comedies but it's certainly worth watching and enjoying.";

Dennis Burkley's performance was probably the most unexpected pleasure with Tim Curry's evangelist character a solid entry in his cache of performances. As Tim Curry movies go it's not Tim Curry overdoing it or conversely underperforming but rather a balanced illustration of his range.The plot is pretty entertaining if you derive any amusement from the circus environment of past and present ministries extorting money from hopeless people around the world. I suppose we should see the humor in them somehow even if it is wandering the landscape of stereotypes and taking pages from the real life travesties associated with their own sinning ways. The movie plays with the stereotypes of the characters pretty well both the feature cast and the background nobodies who fund the multimilliondollar church business.Pass the Ammo did a good job in making me laugh which is what this sort of movie is all about. Laughs via misc sight gags lines of dialogue and the situations the characters find themselves in. This is a straight 80s comedy with a typical ending leaving you satisfied with where it goes. It won't leave you hanging out to dry wishing it had gone in another direction. Come for Tim Curry and stay for a special appearance by the best attempted Moonpie robbery ever.".

The thing was I had been meaning to see the film for about oneandahalf years since I first heard of it but this is an example of a film that is very difficult to find. Thank goodness for good old YouTube. So I finally got to see the movie I had been waiting to see for so long recently and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is not the best movie ever made or a masterpiece of cinema but it is a lot of fun. Overthetop yes it is but it is still fun.Before watching a film I sometimes look up some reviews and some of them have been mixed. Some of them have been very complimentary praising Tim Curry and Annie Potts and the film's sense of fun then there were those that criticised it for being overthetop and flabby. I can understand why people would consider this overthetop as it is but it is meant to be not to mention very eccentric the dialogue of Darla especially is evidence of that. But I disagree it is flabby. True Pass the Ammo doesn't have the best pacing in the world in fact some of it is somewhat uneven causing a few scenes towards the beginning to drag a tad.However even with the minor flaws I do consider Pass the Ammo one of the most underrated films out there. And while I adore comedy it has been a while since I enjoyed myself this much. Recently the closest I've come to laughing hysterically in a movie was in Clue Oscar and a few of the Muppet movies. Pass the Ammo is so wonderfully overthetop and eccentric in the plot writing and performances that I found myself letting go and having a good old time.I liked the idea of the plota televangelist his wife crew and audience being held hostage in the studio it mayn't be the most original of all plots but it kept me interested and was well constructed and I loved the sweet little twist at the end. One definite strong point was the writing I loved the eccentric vibe to it. In particular Darla's dialogue like when she accuses Ray of adultery is absolutely hysterical and so were bubba hand your mama that grenade launcher and they're gonna enter obscenity the preacher on live TV.Even the direction was good nothing outstanding but it worked. The costumes sets and scenery are winning as are the wonderfully nutty musical numbers with the angelic choir. Then there is the cast who give it their all. Bill Paxton and Linda Koslowski are appealing in their roles as characters that are rather unorthodox and such but you end up sort of liking them. Tim Curry has been better in my opinion particularly in Rocky Horror Clue Legend Peter Pan and the Pirates and It but he is excellent as Ray. However Annie Potts steals the show she is absolutely wonderful and just hilarious. And I loved the chemistry between her and Curry you could really tell they were friends just by how they acted on screen. Less than ten years later they worked on the equally underrated Over The Top series and they were just as brilliant then together. Anyway back to the film the rest of the cast ranged from competent to good some of them were very good such as Leland Crooke.Overall delightful and I think underrated too. 910 Bethany Cox".

True Pass the Ammo doesn't have the best pacing in the world in fact some of it is somewhat uneven causing a few scenes towards the beginning to drag a tad.However even with the minor flaws I do consider Pass the Ammo one of the most underrated films out there. And while I adore comedy it has been a while since I enjoyed myself this much. Recently the closest I've come to laughing hysterically in a movie was in Clue Oscar and a few of the Muppet movies. Pass the Ammo is so wonderfully overthetop and eccentric in the plot writing and performances that I found myself letting go and having a good old time.I liked the idea of the plota televangelist his wife crew and audience being held hostage in the studio it mayn't be the most original of all plots but it kept me interested and was well constructed and I loved the sweet little twist at the end. One definite strong point was the writing I loved the eccentric vibe to it. In particular Darla's dialogue like when she accuses Ray of adultery is absolutely hysterical and so were bubba hand your mama that grenade launcher and they're gonna enter obscenity the preacher on live TV.Even the direction was good nothing outstanding but it worked. The costumes sets and scenery are winning as are the wonderfully nutty musical numbers with the angelic choir. Then there is the cast who give it their all. Bill Paxton and Linda Koslowski are appealing in their roles as characters that are rather unorthodox and such but you end up sort of liking them. Tim Curry has been better in my opinion particularly in Rocky Horror Clue Legend Peter Pan and the Pirates and It but he is excellent as Ray. However Annie Potts steals the show she is absolutely wonderful and just hilarious. And I loved the chemistry between her and Curry you could really tell they were friends just by how they acted on screen. Less than ten years later they worked on the equally underrated Over The Top series and they were just as brilliant then together. Anyway back to the film the rest of the cast ranged from competent to good some of them were very good such as Leland Crooke.Overall delightful and I think underrated too. 910 Bethany Cox";

Jessie and Claire along with two other friends go into a ministry to rob it because Claire's inheritance went to the church but they accidentally stumble upon the ministry's live TV set while trying to flee.

Then you have the likes of Paxton and Kozlowski as the buoyant young couple. Geary is also quite fun as a freespirited member of studio crew and Leland Crooke as the levelheaded sheriff. The zany plot is a basic standoff but it's the cleverly scathing script that makes good use of the situation to parody these showy religious outings filled with glitz to cover the underlining corruptness. It's a sideshow with overthetop antics especially when some gun toting rednecks and the national army gets involved and neon qualities as characters open up and America watches on.

There's a lot of screen time where nothing's really happening.

It does have moments of hilarity such as the revelations of reincarnation culminating with a bizarre yet somewhat amusing ending when the local rednecks decide that they're going to infiltrate the terrorists.  It just seems like it should have been better.

Since there was a bit of gore and sex in the first movie there is a lot more gore and sex in the second one as if that could improve the quality in any way. We get a lot of clich characters from the corrupt senator to the uncompromising general and the survivors of part one are treated carelessly by the screenplay Helgenberger lends a willing hand to cruel experiments Natasha Henstridge returns as the alien's latest clone but during the whole first hour of the movie she has nothing to do except sit around in a glass cage. Madsen just needs to run around armed and look cool  he understandably gives a lackluster performance. The sequel was definitely not as intelligent as the original and tries to hide the lack of ideas with gallons of blood. I voted 8567 for the 4 parts of the series.".

Preston and Laura team up with a peaceful genetically reengineered Sil Natasha Henstridge to track the monster down.The first film became a cult favorite mostly because of the excessive nudity near as I can tell. The plot was pretty straightforward and it does not stand out as one of those films that needed multiple sequels and its own franchise. And yet here we are.Writer Chris Brancato was working with MGM and knew the studio was interested in making a followup to Species. He pitched an idea to executive Greg Foster where this time two hybrid alien women would strike. Foster liked it but once Brancato went to Species producer Frank Mancuso Jr. he asked to approach this from a different angle so that we don't have a tired retread of the original as sequels often are. So Brancato took inspiration from The Manchurian Candidate where somebody on a mission comes back apparently a hero but actually with some terrible demon inside. We get much of the original cast back and some really fine additional casting including James Cromwell and a memorable role by Peter Boyle. We also get director Peter Medak on board one of the great Masters of Horror given his background in Hammer and The Changeling... and even aliens designed by no less an artistic authority than H. R. Giger. In many ways this film exceeds the original.Having Medak on board brought a few key changes. When Medak was approached by producer Frank Mancuso a condition of Medak's agreement was to hire on composer Edward Shearmur Die Hard. Also Peter Boyle is a friend of Medak's and they have worked together many times since the 1970s so we have Medak to thank for this key bit of casting. Even production designer Miljen Kreka Kljakovic came through Medak. Kljakovic is not a household name but look him up  from Delicatessen on he has made a long list of great films.And yet the critics hated it and even the cast was disappointed. Michael Madsen expressed his opinion saying Species II was a crock of doody. There are a number I'm not very proud of. The movie studios can't mind that much as they haven't contacted me to tell me off about it. I'm honest  if I've made a bad movie I want my fans to know what they're letting themselves in for. Regardless of what Madsen thinks of the film Medak loved working with him.I have to disagree with Madsen. The film is actually intelligent and clever in a way. The special effects were ahead of their time even if they may appear dated today. The head regeneration scene is a bit cheesy but even that allegedly cost 75000. So it was not a cheap effect. I suspect when people look back now 2016 they will see this is a better film than given credit for.The Scream Factory disc has an old audio commentary ported over and it is as good as ever. We also have a new interview with Natasha Henstridge which gives us a bit of a rundown on her career and how she transitioned from modeling to Species. Oh and don't forget new interviews with the effects crew. Whether you think this is a good movie or not these interviews are valuable and really put 1990s horror and science fiction in context.".

	schema:reviewBody "After returning from a mission to Mars a team of experts' tracks down the infected astronaut carrying a parasitic alien before he can meet up and mate with a similar humanalien hybrid.A very rewarding sequel to a fine original this one turned out to be very enjoyable. By adapting a more straightup storyline instead of dealing with all the science and facts there's considerably more action in this one in terms of splattered victims which seems to be the main focus of the first half. With an increase of splatter there's some great kills and creature makeup used during those scenes and the tentacled beings covered in slime generate a lot of fun especially bursting forth from people's stomachs or chasing around the ground which are good times. Several other scenes with the alien children shooting their cocoons together and the effects work there allows even more goopy gory fun in conjunction with a continuation of fun kills miraculous healing abilities from both creatures and copious nudity. There are some flaws here though namely the decision to allow the captured male into the quarantined zone with the girl when there's plenty of knowledge to indicate his goal is to mate with her as well as the film's rather tacky CGI during the finale when the practical effects were working so well. It loses some steam in the middle where they keep coming up short in the quest to stop him rampaging and raping woman as they're always on the other end of it but otherwise there's still a lot to like here.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Nudity several Sex Scenes and attempted rapes".

We have seen what the alien was like in Species. Now it is the other gender as well...NASA's recent mission to Mars brings back an unexpected surprise. For years many scientists have wondered whether there was life on Mars but the astronauts that land on it bring back life with them. Alien life... The soil samples that the astronauts bring back from the planet contain alien DNA that infects the crew. Only one of the crew is fully infected with the alien DNA  Patrick Ross. Once back on Earth Patrick goes about mating with human women and producing offspring on at an alarming rate becoming more alien than human. But with two aliens on Earth it is not long until the two are bound to cross paths. And then it is the end of the world as we know it.The film brings back Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger from the 1st film back to fight the alien menace for a second time. But having a male alien and a female alien out there is bound to cause problems. And even though Eve is half human anyone can see that the other alien half is going to get in the way. But as you will see in the film the scientists get themselves into trouble by firstly creating an alien and then reawakening dormant alien genes in her to find Patrick. It just goes to show how powerful the sex drive is... alien or human.".

Meanwhile a manned mission to Mars returns to Earth unknowingly infected with an alien virus which produces a MALE version of SIL Justin Lazard. Like the first he has to mate with women who get pregnant immediately and the babies FORCE their way out.Now this IS a stupid movieno two ways about it. The plot is dumb full of plot loopholes the dialogue is howlingly stupid I THINK some of the lines were meant as jokes it's VERY gory and contains a large amount of female nudity naturally Lazard is never shown completely nude. BUT as a stupid B movie it does work. I was truthfully never bored. It's only 90 minutes and DOES move quickly. Also the special effects aren't bad...but not as good as the first.The acting like in the first one varies. Herstridge is actually not badshe was terrible in the first one. Michael Madsen walks through his role. Marg Helgenberger was surprisingly good considering she has the worst dialogue. James Cromwell is excellent as a slimy senator. As the main SIL here Lazard triesbut he's given nothing to work with. He is a very handsome man with a very nice body but can't do anything with his character.And it has a silly ending which sets up Species III. There is one very disturbing aspect of this picturethere are MANY views of nude women torn open and dead as their babies come out. We get the idea with the first one but they keep constantly showing other victims. It's unpleasant and sick...it gives the film a very sick edge. Because of that I can only give this a 6. Againthis is NOT a good movie but a very goodbad one.".

Species 2 is a fairly decent example of this phenomenon.Try not to misunderstand me here. I don't mean to imply that this movie is good in a bad way like Plan 9. That attitude gets old after a while. I honestly think this motion picture while certainly not an allout success does qualify as about an hour and a half of gooey fun.When I went to my local theatre to see this one thing I did notice was just how much fun the rest of the people in the theatre seemed to be having. Sure the plot which I won't even bother trying to explain makes no cohesive sense. But while handing over my five dollars to get my ticket I honestly don't recall ever even expecting it to. One thing I certainly didn't expect however was for this to be as incredibly gory as it was. As the various body parts exploded in cascading rainbows of slime I couldn't help but feel refreshed especially when in comparison to Scream and other films of it's ilk where Brandy or whomever else can get stabbed violently but never bleed a single drop. I got the feeling that my fellow viewers in the theatre felt the same way as from my vantage point at the back of the room I watched their silhouetted heads duck and weave as the digital sound made it seem like dismembered alien limbs were flying right past their heads. I watched the ladies present throwing their hands up in front of their eyes to shield themselves from the carnage with their boyfriends nudging them in the shoulder going Look honey Look! One woman in particular after a nasty sequence involving an autopsy actually said out loud That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.ANY movie that can do that can't be and isn't as bad as everyone wants you to think it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is actually a rereview. My original review was over 8 years old and quite harsh. Upon recently rewatching the first two I thought perhaps it was time to polish my review a bit. Don't get me wrong the movie is still trash but it doesn't deserve quite the lashing I originally gave it.The movie starts in space as the first manned mission to Mars approaches the alien world. Patrick Ross sets down on the planet's surface as the Earth rejoices. Upon returning to the ship something from the Martian rock samples infects him and the other astronauts as they make their way back. After receiving a hero's welcome Patrick violates the sexual quarantine with a pair of sisters and quickly in rather nasty fashion becomes a father to two little alien hybrids. We also learn that a more docile clone of Sil from the original exists and becomes extremely aroused when Patrick does the deed. Laura from the original movie who cares for Eve and now runs the program to find weaknesses in the alien species is able to bring Press Lennox back into the fold when it becomes apparently that another alien hybrid is on the loose. Meanwhile Patrick has become more alien after a suicide attempt and starts rapidly expanding his family leaving a trail of gutted women in his wake. Press and Laura are able to determine that Patrick is the cause after the female astronaut dies in nasty fashion and Gamble the third astronaut is found to have avoided infection due to being a carrier for sickle cell anemia the aliens cannot handle genetic disorders. They eventually have to activate Eve's alien DNA in order to track Patrick via a psychic link the aliens possess. But this allows him to sense Eve's existence and almost break her out after turning himself in. He escapes killing his senator father shortly after and returns to his spawn in order to have them cocoon and reach maturity. Eve manages to escape and Press Laura  Gamble follow her to Patrick's hideout. As Eve and Patrick begin to mate the team uses a toxin derived from Gamble's blood to kill the cocooned offspring before the final confrontation. Eve briefly regains her humanity and attempts to help but is killed via phallic tentacle being shoved down her throat. Laura then sprays him with the toxin as Press uses Gamble's blood on a pitchfork to end Patrick. As the place is cleared out the following morning Eve's body is loaded into an ambulance but her abdomen begins to swell as the movie cuts to black.This movie is a very strange contradiction. It is SO bizarre in so many ways yet so painfully dull in others. The direction and most of the acting is just plain meh. Whereas the original had this weird charm to it this one just feels a bit off. The practical effects are amazing but there's the fact that women give birth minutes after sex via uterus eruption. Not to mention the third act alien sex scene and tentacle murder. I'm still stunned that a major studio made this movie for a wide release and it isn't just some strange live action hentai tentacle porn. I also find it weird that in the age of bizarre and so bad it's good movies being popular that something this weird isn't discussed more. But I feel that says a lot about the movie insane and weird but somehow very forgettable. If you have a strong stomach and like strange movies maybe try this. Otherwise just stick to the first one. 310".

The two characters are totally different and it is interesting to notice what common ground circumstances can cause between two such diverse personalities.  The action sequences are exciting and realistic and the prison scenes duly horrific.  It is good to see a film not being afraid to illustrate what has become an alltoofamiliar reallife situation.

She eventually finds him but wasn't really prepared so he gets away. Another bounty hunter Ranger tries to teach her. Eventually she finds Morelli again but he claims he is innocent of the crime he is accused of and he is trying to prove his innocence. Eventually Stephanie thinks he's telling the truth so she stakes out the person who can help him. She only finds herself in trouble and Morelli saves her. She tries to find someone who can prove his innocence but the problem is that shortly after meeting with them they're killed or attacked.";

If you are in love with the twenty or so books you must have known less than two hours worth of movie will never compare ever. I sympathize beloved books are difficult to put on film but this was actually rather amusing. On par with most romantic comedies and even better than some. It's not actually a romantic comedy though an outlandishgirlyactionmysterycomedy is a more accurate description. The previews are representative of the film.I will say the PG13 rating was forced mostly in the language category. Cable TV after 10 pm has more bite. An R rating with a few swearing felons would have been a bit more realistic especially since the sexual situations are more than a 13yearold should be watching and the storyline definitely adult. The writers must have sacrificed 10 swears for 3 bras and a shower curtain or something equally uncreative.The comedy was there sexual and selfdeprecating and physical as advertised. On opening weekend with the 6 groupon the theater was full and the audience was seated throughout and laughing regularly.Eavesdropping the book fans were a little disappointed but mostly because they know so much more about the characters at this point. They wanted more Lula and Grandma and quirky little side scenes they remembered from the novel. Katherine Heigl was not loved as Stephanie Plum but not hated enough to curse. Expectations were met.I will agree it wasn't worth 11.25 but a lot of movies aren't. As a matine or a DVD go for it.".

Oddly it's not about her growing as a character or even about her getting more and more confident about her chosen line of work. It's not even about proving herself to everyone that she is capable.The story is about persistence about how this character is somehow ideally suited for this situation but just lacks the knowledge to be truly successful. If this wasn't such a light and airy movie I would suspect that it was a metaphor for living in the age of the Internet where knowledge is a commodity and anyone who has access to specific areas of knowledge can be an expert. Alas it's a little less than that.Unfortunately for the movie the lack of character depth and the cumbersome boxlike production make it seem very TVish. Like this was the pilot episode of a series. It also suffers from uselessnarrator syndrome. I didn't read the book but I suspect the source material may share some of the blame for that via lazy exposition.Speaking from a guy's point of view about what is essentially a chick movie it doesn't hurt that Heigl is hot has a nice smile and can handle a gun. And is a pretty good actress sure yeah... that. The casting could have been a lot worse. I would watch Heigl in just about anything if she stayed brunette.".

Apparently the author considered Katherine perfect for this role after seeing her in another movie. I'm so glad it was directed by a woman and combines the chick flick aspect with the mysterybounty hunter storyline. Women's dates will be well rewarded by Heigl's charm and beauty for being along for the ride.Heigl proves again what she showed in her television work in Grey's Anatomy and Roswell that she's an excellent and versatile actress. She displays the vulnerability combined with toughness and a certain likable gullibility that are exactly as the book portrays the main character.The movie is only 91 minutes long. Since the book and the movie depend more on the fun of getting to know the characters including the firstperson narrator Stephanie Plum it would have been so easy and would have made it much better IMO to include more scenes with the family especially Grandma Mazur Debbie Reynolds! and with Lula Sherri Shepherd is also wonderful. As it is the action plot takes over in the second half and it left me wishing for more of the fun character interactions.Plum Morelli and Ranger are really well portrayed and quite a lot like I imagined them while reading the book. This is light entertainment with a few quirks and unpredictable points of view like the book and overall a very enjoyable hour and a half.".

It had fantastic source material a writer from one of my favorite shows Nurse Jackie and an actress from what used to be one of my favorite shows Grey's Anatomy but this film could not have been any more disastrous. There was a movie that I hated a few years ago called The Bounty Hunter with Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler. I felt like that film was as contrived as could be and was unfunny unromantic and incredibly unconvincing. I hate to say that One for the Money fell into that same ball park.One of the reasons why I love the book One for the Money by Janet Evanovich is because its heart Stephanie Plum was an unapologetic badass profane and saucy. I always pictured someone like Sandra Bullock playing the lead role a bornandraised Jersey girl who was down on her luck who finds her inner badass through a series of misadventures but ultimately comes out on top in the end.I don't necessarily blame Katherine Heigl for ruining this movie. She did the best she could even though her Jersey accent is laughably bad. She was simply miscast. She should have never discontinued her work on Grey's Anatomy because if these are the kinds of roles she's getting her future's only going to get worse.Julie Ann Robinson The Last Song directed who I blame for the movie's obviously unclear vision. You get the idea that she didn't know what she wanted this movie to be. Maybe she thought that after all of the books that had been written fans don't remember the first chapter of the franchise. Did she and the rest of the filmmakers intend this to be a film franchise as well? You get the idea that no one really cared given the film's messy ending and sitcomy writing.Liz Brixius Nurse Jackie Karen McCullah Lutz Legally Blonde and Kristen Smith The Ugly Truth are responsible for the travesty of a screenplay. Women ARE funny. There have been so many funny and smart movies that had primarily female writers actors and directors so why does this film seem misogynist? It's a mixed message and an implication that I really don't like. Their version of Stephanie Plum is an idiot. She's not a saucy badass like the one I loved in the books. Her profanity is turned down too because of the meaningless desire that the filmmakers must have had to get a PG13 rating. Why would kids want to see this movie? Oh of course...Katherine Heigl's inevitable sideboob.I enjoy the work of Liz Brixius considering that she is the creator of one of my favorite shows Nurse Jackie. She has shown over the years that she knows how to properly illustrate complicated characters. She is not beyond character development and making characters fully realized...so what went wrong here? Why didn't she scream at the other two writers what the hell are you doing?!I can only imagine how bad true fans of the books felt about this travesty. There are eighteen Stephanie Plum novels plus short stories novellas and crossovers. People clearly like this character and there have got to be a bunch of true fans out there. The first book was written in 1994 and there was talk of a movie then. It had been in development hell since then and it's a shame to say that it probably should have stayed there.Grade D".

It is a soft comedy movie and I thought both the script and the delivery were performed very well. My wife who read the book series thought that Carlos the ranger should have been hotter. I thought he delivered the role convincingly. If you are expecting a Bruce Willis action flickthis is not it. If you are expecting Jenna Elfman you will be out of luck. Kathrine played it straight and to the point. The pace was rapid and the scenes were captured realistically good editing. The events in the movie are engineered to appeal to the ladies. It did. My wife really liked the film. I admit I enjoyed it. I would recommend this film.Congratulations to the cast and crew. This film is one in the win column and will no doubt be shown repeatedly on TV in the future with audiences taking time to watch it again and again.Regards Matt".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of the book series I was slightly disappointed with the movie. I liked it a lot but felt they didn't do all the characters justice. Steph was fine quite a bit better than I was expecting from Katherine. Joe was very good liked him a lot. Vinny was better than I thought that actor would be even though it is funny that I had thought of Fisher Stevens for Vinny and what do you know he is in the film as another character. Connie was good Lula was good Steph's parents were pretty good as well. Now I am going to be a bit critical it is a review you know Ranger was only OK no ponytail not as dark and brooding as the book relays. He smiled way too much! Any smile from Ranger should speak volumes! Grandma Mazur I love Debbie Reynolds but she didn't quite capture the little old lady. Benito Ramirez was nowhere near as fear inducing brutal monster as he should have been. I think the movie would have been much better over all if they went for an R rating rather than fluffing it up a bit to be PG13. My biggest complaint as a car guy is Big Blue. You mean to tell me they couldn't find an appropriate 50s Buick?! The point of the car is to represent something that most of the men who see it appreciate it but the women don't get it. A 70s Buick really irked me!!! All in all a good movie 3.5 stars from us!! Look forward to the continuing series!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The trailer would remind you of the forgettable The Bounty Hunter starring Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston with the former being the titular character whose target happens to be his exwife having them bicker and run from various misadventures together. Reverse the roles in order to have a female bounty hunter going after an exboyfriend and the stage is set for more of the same no? Not quite. One for the Money has a lot more going for it predominantly being a film written by and made by females for its intended audience and being an engaging flick chick that wonderfully encapsulates a whodunnit.Katherine Heigl seems to be on a successful roll on celluloid and is in her element here in this romantic action adventure comedy as lead character Stephanie Plum a rookie bounty hunter drawn to the profession only because she's desperate for a job to pay off impending bills. An exlingerie model we follow her transition from girly girl to a somewhat tough cookie ready to hold her own in her cousin's business where an added incentive is to hunt down and bring in her exboyfriend Joe Morelli Jason O'Mara a cop wanted for the gunning down an unarmed felon.Yes one would expect the usual laughs coming from her inexperience in a new field her constantly being outwitted by slier opponents in the big bad town of Trenton New Jersey and having that pitch perfect sexual charisma with her mark since they share a common romantic history before in their youths. But to my surprise One for the Money has a little bit more depth in its story than I would have imagined playing out like a mystery with a crime at hand to solve with Stephanie stumbling her way from fact to fact interacting with various interesting caricatures who don't bore and plays out exactly like an 80s private detective film of old in spirit.Written by Stacy Sherman Karen Ray and Liz Brixius off the well received novel of the same name by Janet Evanovich this probably accounts for a lot of femalecentric focus on elements in the storyline as well as director Julie Anne Robinson's ability to center this very much like a chick flick wrapped around an old fashioned whodunnit. I mean only in a story with an attractive female protagonist would you have other females in the story either old or matronly and having not one but two hunks  Morelli and fellow alphamale bounty hunter Ranger Daniel Sunjata  involved at the crossroads of her life. Plenty of characterization goes into the lead character of Stephanie Plum and Heigl brings a certain sass to the role with little street smarts that cover for her lack of experience in the field.Granted the mystery doesn't quite play out with that kind of tension and suspense as one would expect from a true blur genre film but it does enough with its slight touch and managed to keep interest afloat. While there are 18 novels to date in the series of Stephanie Plum's adventures in bounty hunting with each novel title starting with a number  numerically related reality is that any subsequent film will have to rely on how much this makes at the box office. My bet is that it'll likely be something quite modest with a potential of 17 more films made only if Heigl wants to be stereotyped if not already or typecast. Still One for the Money sits above average on the entertainment scale and can be recommended fare if you'd give it a chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "One for the Money reviewed 9 out of 10 bags of popcorn.Having read all eighteen of the Stephanie Plum books a few of them more than once it is safe to say that I am a big fan of the series even though SP16 was a little disappointing and SP17 was a huge letdown. In any case I went to the multiplex with a clear vision in my mind of how the characters should look act and interact. This is the first movie that I've actually gone to a theater to see in at least two years. Sadly the director seems to belong to what I call the 'mumble school of filmmaking' and the dialogue was very hard to follow at times. And no that's not just my aged ears reacting because the fortythreeyearold I saw it with had a hard time hearing it as well. Best of all we are in Orlando at the moment with some dead time on our hands and went to an early bird special for 5 per head. These days that's a bargain.The movie worked. The chemistry between Plum and Morelli was obvious on screen. Morelli had a nice lithe but tightly muscular body with a wellproportioned butt. Too bad about those disgusting tattoos but that too was probably in character. Lula the street 'ho' was perfectly cast as were Stephanie's cousin Vinnie and the girl in the bail bond office who Janet Evanovich describes as carrying most of her weight in her chest. Stephanie's parents were well done and Debbie Reynolds was a pleasant surprise as Grandma Mazur. I'd always pictured Grandma as sort of wizened and shriveled sort of like the Nanny's grandmother and Reynolds at a couple of months shy of eighty didn't quite fit my preconceived image. That being said Reynolds has a flair for comedy and it worked. The only disappointment was the casting of Ranger hence the one bag deduction. Ranger was believable but a little too personable and maybe even a tad too verbose. Ranger in the books didn't talk a lot and could put a whole sentence into one word when he looked at Stephanie and said Babe. The characters sounded like New Jersey residents and the row houses they lived in looked authentic.Oh and the 1953 Buick that Stephanie frequently borrows from the family is now a huge Buick from the 70s or 80s but that worked quite nicely.My partner and I are both looking forward to the next Stephanie Plum movie assuming this one does well enough at the box office to justify the production.".

Her take would be 50000 if she can bring in Joe Morelli Jason O'Mara a cop wanted in the shooting of an unarmed man. Normally I make sure I see the next Katherine Heigl movie. Usually they are fun witty engaging good oneliners good dialogue and banter great facial expressions some good sight gags and come on look at her she is beautiful and has a very infectious laugh. What's not to like? Well this movie for one thing. So what happened? A bland movie happened. Nothing interesting happened. Not witty not engaging no great facial expressions no good oneliners lame banter no good sight gags but KH is still beautiful and I saw the movie was going nowhere so I star gazed . I prefer her as a blonde but the script called for brunette. Too bad the script didn't call for anything else like a good movie. You know Stephanie is out of her league in a bounty hunter job. And you just know this will bring into focus many things that will go wrong and you will laugh like you did with other KH movies. So you wait and wait and wait some more. Didn't happen. I am reminded of the last Kentucky Derby race where I am still waiting for my horse to finish. To be fair all actors did respectable jobs. It wasn't their fault. They went through their paces in fine fashion as in a trance. They didn't write the script but maybe they should have had some input. And also to be fair Jason O'Mara as Joe did his level best to make this a more animated movie as it all should have been. But he had nothing to work against. OK he did but the script wouldn't allow anyone else to become animated or funny. Bummer. And there I was star gazing at you know who. Very beautiful. Story? What story?So now what? What do I do now? Why wait for then next Katherine Heigl movie of course. What's not to like? And maybe it will be a better movie. Hey she is beautiful has a nice laugh and can act but in here she was definitely in a slump with a bad script. Good athletes go into slumps why not good actresses? Can happen.Let's just say this was a very bland movie good enough as a madeforTV movie which is to say watchable nothing more. Well except for the star gazing aspect. That's something. 510Violence Yes. Sex No. Nudity No. Language No.".

I always pictured Grandma as a little blue haired lady much like the adorable matriarch on the Golden Girls. In my opinion Debbie Reynolds did not fit the bill at all.

Janet Evanovich's first book in the Plum series introduced us to a freshfaced outofherdepth untrained Stephanie and Heigl does her justice complete with the inner monologue vulnerability and Jersey smart ass. Jason O'Mara as Joe Morelli and Daniel Sunjata as Ranger are inspired choices smoldering yet not overbearing to keep the storyline true to the book. I'm glad they eliminated some of the darker elements from the book because it would have taken away from the overall fun of the movie. Although a little more of the backstory with Morelli would have been nice.For the reviewers who hated it I agree its not Jane Austen or Dog the Bounty Hunter. But its not trying to be. Its a great glimpse of family dysfunction funny characters in an old factory town kids who never go far from home and neighborhoods that never change. If you're looking for high literature or heavy storyline you should probably head over to the Keira Knightley section.Daniel Sunjata as Ranger gives some more depth to the early character I'm only thru book 3 so far since its hard to make a movie with a guy who speaks in 2 word sentences. I liked him better than the book version of Ranger who seems a little oily to me.Jason O'Mara as Morelli is just as hot and cocky as originally written especially when he calls her Cupcake. He's got a wicked smile a sharp tongue and charm to spare. I wouldn't make him sleep on the couch. So what if his eyes are blue instead of brown and Katherine Heigl's are brown instead of blue. Artistic license people.Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur was a delight. She plays kooky and offbalance without fault and Mom  Dad Plum were a perfect balance. And I liked the change of the 1975 Buick from the 1953 Buick for Big Blue. It was more realistic for a Trenton townie kid. No different than switching Morelli's Jeep for an Explorer.Ann Reeder as Connie Rosolli and Sherri Shepherd as Lula were excellent supporting characters right on the money as described in the books. As was Patrick Fischler as sleazy cousin Viinie. I'm glad his character development was kept to a minimum after reading the books.Hands down the best minor character was Fisher Stevens as Morty Byers a real scumsucking bottomfeeder type. His famous last words left me laughing hysterically. A memorable 3 minutes on screen.I honestly hope they make a few more of the books into movies and bring back all the characters. Except Morty Byers of course...".

I was excited to find out a movie was made because I wanted to see how well they managed to visualize the characters and storyline. I wasn't completely disappointed and that made me happy. The books make me laugh and so did the movie. I had no real cast expectations so Katherine Heigl as Stephanie was a reasonable choice. In other movies I've seen her in she's silly and cute and a bit of a bumbler so she fit as far as I was concerned. My only wonder was that she seemed a bit tall and a bit too thin. Stephanie is 5'7 and 130lbs. Jason O'Mara as Morelli did nothing for me. He isn't at all the Mediterranean skinned Italian drop dead gorgeous guy needed. Only thing I'll give him is he says cupcake with the just right amount of contempt. I liked that they stuck close to the book in that there is unfinished business between Stephanie and Morelli due to her feeling slighted that he took her virginity without so much as a backwards glance. Daniel Sunjata as Ranger Not exactly what I had in mind but he definitely is Yummy. Ranger is described as Cuban American with Latino good looks and too light for the blacks and too dark for the Cubans in book 12. Many mentions of The Rock were made for playing Ranger which would have completely ruined it for me. He is so NOT who I see in my mind when I think Ranger. I did find Ranger portrayed as not mysterious and dark enough though. He seemed too friendly and too eager to go to Stephanie's rescue. It takes several books for any of his interest to show and even then he's not a talker. I didn't favor Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur. She was mischievous but not thin and wily enough. Other cast members were good. Sherri Shepherd as Lula was perfect. Not using a 1950's Big Blue was a huge mistake. I was looking forward to that. Stephanie hates that car but it's very much necessary and as important as having Rex the hamster. I was expecting Benito to be scary and demented so I was disappointed with how that part of the book was played out. It was a bit fluffier than I thought it might be but close enough to the mark that I will buy it when it comes on DVD. With 18 books and 4 novellas I don't imagine all of them would be made into movies but I would like to see 10 and 12 for sure.".

I never envisioned Kathrine Heigl as Stephanie certainly didn't like the idea of Jason O'Mara playing the sexy love interest he's just not that sexy and in no way does Sherri fit the image I have in my mind of Lula but all in all they seemed to work well on screen.

A former colleague has been murdered. Eastwood will climb the Eiger face and kill the assassin along the way. The only problem is he isn't sure which of the three other climbers is his target.'The Eiger Sanction' is very much a product of the 1970's and comes from a difficult grey area of Eastwood's career. He was transitioning between Westerns and Dirty Harry and films like 'The Eiger Sanction' got lost in the mix. On the surface the film is a spy thriller or a gorgeously shot mountain climbingsurvival film. I think it doesn't get enough credit for being very tongue in cheek. It gently pokes fun at both Eastwood and 70's action movies  Clint giving a female student a playful pat on the rump the foxy brown flight attendantgirlfriend and of course damn that Brando when Clint's Native American trainer pushes him too hard. Throw in the promiscuity and the way homosexuality is dealt with rival gay hitman with the little dog and the film runs pretty nicely as a satire.'The Eiger Sanction' is really about the third act though where the climbing takes place. Brilliantly photographed I didn't find much not to enjoy about this film. Quite possibly the best climbing film that I've ever seen and it is certainly superior to things like 'Cliff Hanger' or 'Vertical Limit'  which owe a great deal to 'The Eiger Sanction.' Clint Eastwood has acted in better movies and he's directed better movies. That said this one is an unpolished gem and worth taking a look at if the opportunity arises.".

I was surprised at how entertained I was despite the fact that it was all means to an end. The spy story itself wasn't exactly mindblowing or extraordinary but the exhilarating mountain climbing finale ..and the training portion as Eastwood's agent prepares for the big climb up the Eiger to me was well worth sitting through the weaker aspects of the film.The movie is really a tale of three halves. The opening sets up why Eastwood's art professor whose past life was that of a hired assassin will be scaling a massive mountain he has failed to climb twice previous the middle shows his Dr. Jonathan Hemlock training under old pal Ben BowmanGeorge Kennedy a delight and wonderful support to the film I thoughtgetting ready for his date with destiny and the final thirty minutes moving up and down the Eiger with three other professional climbers.I think the viewer can look at the film in two ways. As a spy movie it just doesn't cut the mustard..although I must admit that I found the twist amusing regarding the revelation of the identity behind who might've been responsible for the death of Hemlock's former associate an act of betrayal to our country helping hand over germ warfare microfilm to the other sidefor Eastwood is realistic holding a magnum as a San Fran detective or a pistol as a gunslinger staring down opposition but he's not James Bond..the deliberate leisure pace defies the rapid pace that the James Bond movies are known for. I think that's why the story plays second fiddle to the action sequences which are far more exciting and aweinspiring. The camerawork  cinematography is firstrate exceptional in particular once Eastwood is climbing up mountains whether in breathtaking Arizona or Switzerland locations.I think if you look at it as an adventure one will probably consider it one of the greatest mountain climbing movies of all time the precursor to Renny Harlin's Cliffhanger and Martin Campbell's Vertical Limit. Eastwood's insistence on doing his own stunts enhances the climbing sequences adding a realism that is to be admired.The cast is rather fascinating. Eastwood doesn't really stretch his acting muscles but Kennedy is quite engaging as his buddy while Jack Cassidy steals the film as the flamboyant homosexual Benedit Arnold traitor who Hemlock plans to kill when the time is right. Gregory Walcott is Eastwood's foil as agent Pope often embarrassed and humiliated by Hemlock when he assaults him. Thayer David has a strange role as Hemlock's sickly Albino governmental charge Dragon blackmailing him into finding the traitorous rogue responsible for the murder of a former field colleague. Vonetta McGee is Jemima Brown a patriotic whore who works for Dragon falling in love with Hemlock in an interesting interracial love affair. I think it's all about what you enter the film expecting from it. If you looking for phenomenal mountain climbing sequences this delivers the goods but I suggest searching elsewhere for a strong spy story..if you want both try For Your Eyes Only.The incredible difficulty for shooting the scenes up the Eiger at the end shows and you can tell Eastwood took great strides getting the most out of the setting. As the four climbers make their way up I enjoyed how the young lead climber pokes and jabs at Hemlock for his failure to successfully scale the Eiger because this ridicule will come back to haunt him when a decision to continue despite evidence of potential disaster leads to devastating consequences.".

In The Eiger Sanction he plays Dr. Jonathan Hemlock a character completely unlike any other he has played. Dr. Hemlock is in fact the very antithesis of the typical Eastwood character. Although he hides a secret past Hemlock displays a highly cultured knowledge of fine art and jazz in both his professional and personal life. He possesses as highly refined a taste for beautiful women as he does for the most beautiful works of art. Eastwood is both a philosopher and a lover in this film. He is also a humorist. But there are no glib oneliners here. In fact this one film probably contains more dialogue for Eastwood than he has done for any other character he has played in his career.Eastwood is the quintessential strong silent type. As anyone knows who has seen him as a gunfighter hero whether in the Old West or in the big city. In The Eiger Sanction he is a different kind of gun fighter. His character is not drawn on the swift total retribution exacted by the Man with No Name. Instead it is drawn on the suave debonair charm of James Bond. Jonathan Hemlock possesses the same cultural refinement and cosmopolitanism that the Bond character does. In fact Hemlock and Bond are at work and at home in the same element international espionage. I suspect this is why the casual fan of Clint Eastwood typically detests this movie. Clint Eastwood appears to be miscast. But I'd say he pulls it off admirably showing the viewer a side of himself which is rarely seen and exhibiting his versatility as an actor. The story itself is better than average and the movie rates two and one half stars.".

The climbing sequences had a few minor errors but all considered the most accurate movie adaptation of climbing with the possible exception of Storm and Sorrow. I felt like I was there with the climbers cold and scared and forced to continue.

The climbing sequences had a few minor errors but all considered the most accurate movie adaptation of climbing with the possible exception of Storm and Sorrow.

	schema:reviewBody "Let's face it folks either you go for Clint Eastwood's kind of almost pure machismo or whatever comes closest to him as a living walking badass or you feel unnerved or turned off or just tune in for a few minutes here and there. I go for it as it's one of those things that makes Clint what he is he's intelligent about being a star as his figure and persona are rarely changed much so there's a consistency Jack Nicholson may be a more versatile actor maybe even better overall in his craft but he'd have to go in a steel cage with Eastwood to see who'd be the best 70s star. The Eiger Sanction isn't any great shakes as compared to Clint at his best in the 70s it's no High Plains Drifter or Dirty Harry or even Play Misty for Me but it's a helluva lot of fun and probably one of the better pictures done on the danger of mountain climbing.Is the plot generic? Yes and no. Yes because we have seen this many times with the exassassin pulled in for one more job and then finding a way to secure his retirement package with the deal and with notsurprisingly exciting or sometimes not exciting results. And yes we've seen stuff like the guy's girl who comes in and plays a role more or less as the voice of reason in this case Jemimma Black yes the name is basically blaxsploitation in mainstream clothing. Hell there's even the doggone twist yes there's a doggone here about who the killer actually is and it's the sort that is handled this time with some degree of interest not so much in how it's revealed but what's done with it by the actors and the outcome of the climb.But there's a lot more wit and fun in the script than one might give Eastwood and his writers credit for. It's tailormade for someone like Clint who plays this 'Doctor' of assassin time turned art history like it's nothing. He probably doesn't have much difference here in term of delivery of lines or sarcasm or the knack for beating the crap of the bad dude at the nick of time than Dirty Harry. Which is just as well we need an anchor with the plot's likely pitfalls with costar Kennedy the only normal one among the possibly shifty characters save for whoever plays Dragon which is also filmed appropriately creepy and near originally. And it's the combo of humor Screw Marlon Brando! and the suspense that arrives in that final act on the Eiger that makes the picture work. It's not entirely superbly directed you can tell Eastwood is still working his way through doing certain techniques and frankly can't film a love scene at all but for what it's worth it's good underlooked stuff in the cannon perfect for a 'sick day' viewing. 7.510".

George Kennedy is effective as Ben Bowman. Vonetta McGee plays Jemima Black a name that showed no political correctness to the author of the novel or the director. The late Jack Cassidy appears as the effete Miles Mellough no doubt a stretch for this actor lap dog and all.John Williams is the composer of the fine soundtrack of the film.

There are chunks of quotable dialogue vertigo inducing cinematography and the requisite smorgasbord of villains and couldbewouldbe villains. Just don't ask me if its a spoof because I have no idea. I'm pretty sure nobody involved with the picture did either.The intermittent tone seems largely attributable to the fact that at this point in Clint's career the ego had landed. Thus we witness scads of nubile young lovelies attempt to lure the granite hewn stud into bed whilst he disrobes to reveal a finely honed physique at every opportunity. The women are all sex crazed psychopaths ain't it the truth driven to distraction by his squinting cool and formidable musculature. Notice also the number of times both female AND male characters are required to comment admiringly on Eastwood's appearance and caress his form with their eyes. There's no distance to any of this however. Even the popNietzcheian antics of the mountain climbers are served cold. The director star never offers us the merest suggestion that he's mocking the preening machismo at any level.All of this worship plus the fact that the star's performance is WAY WAY over the top  his usual 'snarling and eyerolling alternated with boyish grin' is accentuated to parodic proportions  lends the piece a bizarrely dreamy awkwardly sadistic homoeroticism. If in any other film the hero yelled you're quiet now ain't ya ya little prick? at a dog called 'faggot' after he'd killed it's master I'd be on safe ground in assuming that the makers were nudging my ribs. Here though the surrounding unfettered narcissism and borderline unpleasantness it engenders makes it impossible to tell when the joke is for us or on us.But its fun because of this nonsense. Even the final inconsequentiality of the whole exercise can't diminish that. It's just that this film more than any other in his catalogue lends extreme credence to biographer Patrick McGilligan's central assertion that cinematically speaking at least Clint is a lot less smart than critics allow.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Eiger Sanction 1975 starring Clint Eastwood is a spectacular mountain movie of the sort big in 1920's German classic cinema.The famous 1929 German movie titled The White Hell Of Pitz Palou 1929 Germany starring young Leni Riefenshahl directed by Joseph Pabst is an example of German mountain movies which always included spectacular camera work recording breathtaking icy mountain scenes most often in the European Alps.World audiences were very enthusiastic about mountain movies but few were made after sound movies replaced silent movies.The Eiger Sanction 1975 is an exception and a spectacular one.About 50 percent of the movie is taken up with incredible and spectacular camera work of breathtaking and hair raising mountain scenery both in the USA's famous Monument Valley terrain and also in the Swiss Alps.The Richard Shickel authored biography of Clint Eastwood titled Clint reports that a stunt man doubling for the actorclimbers in the Swiss Alps part of the movie was accidentally killed during the shoot and the entire production was almost shut down as a result.The Eiger Sanction 1975 shows both the beauty and the danger of monster mountains and must be counted as among the best outdoor photography ever provided for a Hollywood feature movie.The movie is historically interesting because it mirrored its times the middle 1970's which were still part of the countercultural revolution and sympathies usually called collectively the 60's but actually a period comprising the last half of the 1960's and first half of the 1970's the 1970's was also countercultural but doesn't get credit for it when the while era is referred to as the '60's.Heterosexual interplay and enthusiasms between Clint Eastwood and various attractive actresses part of the movie are part of the show and are of a sort which later disappeared from movies after the Sexual Revolution of the those countercultural times faded away.The antiCIA antigovernment sympathies and mentality of countercultural times are also seen in The Eiger Sanction 1975 which proposes cynically that CIA ordered and staged assassinations were not always necessary or justified.The Eiger Sanction 1975 is a CIA agent movie which unlike most others of its type does not have a final scene where the good guy and the bad guy duke it out at the end and the bad guy gets his. The main interest of the movie is the wonderful photography....the movie is sort of an ultimate travelogue of spectacular mountains seen in vivid color and from astonishing angles with camera work done from helicopters and small airplanes which gets in close in almost a surgical way.The Eiger Sanction 1975 did not go on to become a famous or honored movie listed among the classics of its time but it deserves to be.Jaws 1975 was made the same year 1975 as The Eiger Sanction 1975 and was also produced by Richard Zanuck and David Brown Helen Gurley Brown's husband! and also included music composed by composer John Williams.The Eiger Sanction 1975 included heavyweight support talent and the result was and still is a true winner.

So Clint does Indiana Bond teaches Art in the college collects priceless paintings of the Artists no less than El Greco Pissarro and such is an accomplished mountain climber and on the side moonlights as an assassin for C2 an international spy organization led by an exNazi albino villain known as Mr. Dragon. By the time the movie starts Dr. Jonathan Hemlock Eastwood is retired from C2 but like so many retired secret agents just when he thought he was out they pulled him back in. His former employer terrifying Mr. Dragon who has to stay all the time in almost complete darkness due to his condition orders him to perform a sanction meaning to kill a man who had killed a friend and a former colleague of Hemlock with C2. To complete the mission Dr. Hemlock has to participate in the attempt to climb one of the most dangerous mountains in Swiss Alps the North face of Eiger  thus the title of the film The Eiger Sanction. While preparing for the mission Hemlock would go to train in Arizona at a mountain resort run by a close friend Ben Bowman. The Arizona sequence allowed Eastwood the director to make some truly magnificent and stunning shots of Monument Valley. The shoot of Eastwood and George Kennedy on top of the Totem Pole is a real spectacle and a symbol of masculinity that Eastwood has been the embodiment of. Besides being breathtakingly beautiful it has historic significance  it was the last time anyone was allowed to climb to Totem Pole.The second half of the film takes place in Alps and covers the preparations of the international group of four famous climbers from France Germany Austria and USA Dr. Hemlock for the ascent to Eiger and the dramatic climb. To make the matter even more difficult for Hemlock one of three mountaineers is the target of The Eiger Sanction and that's all he knows. The name of his future victim was not revealed to him by his bosses at C2.Even with the laughable dialogs onliners and way over the top villains The Eiger Sanction is an entertaining movie which has a lot to enjoy. First of all during his long career Clint Eastwood has always been a strong presence at the screen. Back in 1975 at the age of 45 he looked great and the lustful interest in him from the beautiful exotic girls in the best traditions of the Bond's movies is fully justified. Eastwood did all his stunts in the film. All climbing was real and if anything the film will be remembered for truly astounding scenes of the ascent to the North Face of treacherous Eiger and dramatic descent. I also should admit that the twist in the end was if not unpredictable but satisfying in the way it put the pieces of puzzle together.The music that was written for the film by John Williams and plays in the opening and closing sequences deserves special mention.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must say this from the start. I am a big Eastwood fan both as an actor and director. Therefore I may be a little bias in my review. This has to be one of the greatest looking films ever made. I will so far as to say that some of the scenery is comparable with Laurence of Arabia. It truly is breathtaking. Monument Valley has such vivid warm colours reds oranges and yellows. What really helps is these are perfectly juxtaposed against the cold greys and whites of the Eiger itself. The story itself follows a fairly standard theme IE a retired assassin is being pulled out of retirement for one last job because he is the only one capable of performing the said sanction. The film starts fairly slowly building up Eastwood's character and his relationship with he employer dragon who I must say is a marvellous creation in terms of creepy goodbad guys. After about an hour into the movie Eastwood's Character gets into gear and arrives at monument valley and then finally heads off to the Eiger to climb the mountain and find the assassin. The final hour raced by for me with the breathtaking scenery framing the story beautifully. With a great support cast and a story that in todays culture of remakes is nice and original if only in its setting. A great movie when it gets going".

	schema:reviewBody "Having been a huge fan of Eastwood's modern directorial career I had been somewhat trepidatious approaching his earlier works fearful that they would fall far shy of his current mastery of the art. Fears firmly assuaged by his first three films I was convinced that the man could do no wrong.A retired assassin resigned to a life as an art professor and collector Jonathan Hemlock reluctantly agrees to take on the task of one last sanction when he learns that the targets are responsible for the death of an old friend. Discovering that one of the killersthe other has already been easily dispatchedis among an expedition to climb the Eiger he must discern the identity of the target and take him out all whilst scaling the deadliest mountain in all of Europe.Writing the above plot synopsis I was almost brought to tears of laughter by the absurdity of it. Have another read go on. Sounds absolutely ridiculous I'm sure you'll agree. Complete and utter rubbish right? My thoughts exactly going into the film. I wondered how my beloved Clint was going to manage to turn such a stupid action premise into a compelling film as I had no doubt he would. Alas not even Eastwood could pull such a task off. The Eiger Sanction is a ludicrous film. A key reason for Hemlock's agreement to take on the job is that the government agency which hires him will report his art collection to the IRS if he does not a leverage he wards off by procuring what the film's Wikipedia synopsis rather charmingly names an IRS exemption letter. I'm sorry but that's just funny. As for this secretive organisation it is headed by an albino exNazi who resides in a darkened red room and survives on regular blood transfusions all whilst being sure to crowbar the film's title into his painfully expository dialogue. Because there haven't been quite enough espionage thriller clichs gone through yet let's welcome to the mix an attractive yet ultimately untrustworthy female an extraordinarily camp former adversary and a sequence of our hero demonstrating his masculinity by standing on large things. Stop clambering all over Monument Valley Clint you've lost your right to be there. Startlingly bad it is genuinely worrying to see the film dedicated to a man whose life was lost in its making. More of an insult than a tribute it's sad to consider that some poor bugger died for this a woefully poor interminably dull painfully unoriginal distressingly formulaic achingly uninteresting and indescribably unnecessary piece of actionadventure tosh.The sadly inevitable point at which I realised Mr Eastwood is not infallible The Eiger Sanction is a very poor film which wastes the director's hereabsent talents and the skills of the usually wonderful George Kennedy. Stupid plodding poorlywritten and badly brought to decidedly lifeless life its only redeeming feature is the laugh factor inspired by the sheer scale of its nonsensicality.".

I like bad movies in general but this was just terrible. The plot meanders hither and yon with no purpose or pacing. The only character I even kind of sympathized with was the girl who tried to kill Clint about halfway through. Sadly she was unsuccessful.

	schema:reviewBody "Screw all those crappy reviews!  This is a wonderful film!  First of all I was hoping to one day see a movie about the actors behind a children's TV show who are completely nuts in real life.  Well I got my wish.  I would say that Adam Resnick the writer stole my idea but I had no exact thoughts on where to go with the premise.  Well Resnick went really far with this wonderful premise and in result we have this dark alluring hilarious comedy!The cast is absolutely topnotch!  I read one review slamming Edward Norton's performance in the film saying that he phoned in his performance.  Sure his performance in this film doesn't QUITE measure up to those in Primal Fear and Rounders but he did one hell of a job and I can tell he researched the role very well to the point where he completely disappeared into the character.  Whether it's a dramatic or comedic role Norton always immerses himself in his roles.  Though you can classify him as the straight man in this wacky satire he says and does a lot of things that had me cracking up without any humorous intentions.  The only thing that disappointed me slightly was that Robin Williams didn't have as big a role as I expected.  In the first 45 minutes we only see him intermittently. Actually Norton really has the starring role and if Robin weren't a more popular actor he probably would've been billed first.  Norton's one of my favorite actors but I believe if you're gonna bill an actor as the star he better be the star!  But Robin Williams was still in top form.  Catherine Keener is beautiful yet entirely convincing as an egodriven TV executive. Jon Stewart doesn't have too many funny scenes but his goofy Jerry Lewis haircut was enough to make me crack up.  Danny WoodburnMickey from Seinfeldshows off his fine acting skills playing more than just the little guy.  The alwaysamusing Vincent Schiavelli makes a few appearances towards the end.  Michael Rispoli is both hilarious and likable as the simpleminded exfighter Spinner.  Danny DeVito proves yet again that his skills behind the camera match his talents in front of the camera.I don't suppose Death to Smoochy will be receiving any major Oscars but it should at least be nominated for Best Art Direction.  The sets lighting and color pallette are absolutely incredible.  As grim as it is it's a beautiful film to look at.This is an Rrated comedy with a welldeserved R.  There's tons of profanity and some truly crude though not disgusting thankfully sex gags. If you're in the mood for an oldfashioned Cary Granttype screwball comedyyou will be sorely appalled.  Nevertheless the humor is smart and witty just drenched in cynicism.  When Norton was doing the show and pulled out a cookie shaped like a man's genitals and Robin started screaming at the kids what it really is I was dying with laughter.  You may not feel good about laughing at some of these jokes but the sense of humor doesn't lie. But as cynical as it is I didn't feel the movie was meanspirited. Because I'm often turned off by meanspirited comedies.  I guess it's because as scummy as these characters prove to be there's at least one redeeming quality about each of them.  Sure Rainbow Randolph is a loud obnoxious drunk.  He lost his TV show.  They snatched his dream because of one little bribery slipup.  So he's not a saint.  Is Mister Rogers a saint?  As far as we know but how do we know for sure he wasn't in the same theater as Pee Wee Herman disguised in a fake moustache and beard pleasuring himself as well?  Whatever the public don't know can't hurt them.I was glad to see that the movie averaged a 6.9 rating on the IMDB.  I was expecting a rating much lower after its poor box office records and countless bad reviews from major critics.  Well I had a blast!  It's an energetic upbeat funfilled journey with a ton of laughs.  I surely hope it one day reaches cult status.  And the sequence over the closing credits is perfectly delightful.  If you love Robin Williams and think he's one of the funniest men in the planet if you're a fan of the great Edward Norton if you think Catherine Keener is really hot if you think Danny DeVito is a genius or if you simply wanna have a barrel of laughsDeath to Smoochy will keep you alive with pleasure.My score  7 out of 10".

Of course everything but the kitchen sink gets thrown into the plot from organized crime to Nazis.. and everything is hillarious. A very dark film that is rated R for language this film is bound to be somewhat controversal as some may be offended by the language and view of childrens programming portrayed here but if you have an open mind going in the film is drop dead funny..

	schema:reviewBody "It figures that Death to Smoochy didn't get too much advertisement and recommendations...it handles about a sensible and often occurring topic. Entertainment programs for children that are turned into big business rules and controlled by people who don't care about anything but money fame and commercializing. Death to Smootch shows how it's perfectly possible to cover up a world of bribery fraud and blackmail behind the curtains of a colorful and jolly kidshow. Edward Nortons stars as Smoochy the Rhino. His character is dragged head over heals into the business when oldtimer Rainbow Randolph is convicted of illegal actions. Smoochy is a pure character and his only intentions are to educate children and enlighten them with some important values of life but he soon gets faced with the facts that the producers don't care about this at all. Death to Smoochy really succeeds in critisizing the greed in the mediabusiness and manages to portray the producers and sponsors as a real bunch of vultures.

Certainly recommended for the intriguing story and surrounding but in the very first place for the brilliant characters that are involved in this story. The Irish mobsters impress and entertain the most...The sequences where they're taking care of everything are the funniest parts in this movie. Director DeVito his fifth movie as a director and maybe the best of them all cast himself terrifically as the greedy shorty who introduces himself as the new impresario. Jon Stewart's character is memorable because he has the dorkiest haircut I've ever seen. And then there's Edward Norton of course...needless to say that he's a very solid actor who acts like a true professional no matter if the production is huge or not. Give Death to Smoochy a watch...it'll certainly be one of the most sparklingly satires you'll ever see.".

	onyx:emotionText "It figures that Death to Smoochy didn't get too much advertisement and recommendations...it handles about a sensible and often occurring topic. Entertainment programs for children that are turned into big business rules and controlled by people who don't care about anything but money fame and commercializing. Death to Smootch shows how it's perfectly possible to cover up a world of bribery fraud and blackmail behind the curtains of a colorful and jolly kidshow. Edward Nortons stars as Smoochy the Rhino. His character is dragged head over heals into the business when oldtimer Rainbow Randolph is convicted of illegal actions. Smoochy is a pure character and his only intentions are to educate children and enlighten them with some important values of life but he soon gets faced with the facts that the producers don't care about this at all. Death to Smoochy really succeeds in critisizing the greed in the mediabusiness and manages to portray the producers and sponsors as a real bunch of vultures.

Otherwise this black comedy offers a really wonderful character as the lead good guy Smoochy the Rhino played well by Edward Norton. How Norton could deliver some of these lines with a straight face is beyond me. He must have required numerous takes. He's a real hoot in here.Despite what you might have read from national critics there are a lot of laughs in this film. I also thought the cinematography was interesting with vivid fascinating colors and some nice closeup shots. For a comedy I don't expect photography to be as good as it is in here. Kudos to the director and cinematographer.Williams as the bitter dethroned kiddies TV host  'Rainbow' Randolph Smiley is well.....Robin Williams which means very profane and very funny. I expect that sort of profanity out of him and he gets away with it here and there because of his great comedic talent but I hate to hear it from female leads who are supposed to be likable. That's the case with Catherine Keener who seems to play a lot of these hardlooking foul mouthed women.....although Smoochy finally softens her up by the end of this story.At any rate you have to appreciate black comedy and this kind of almostperverse humor to like this movie. Of acquaintances who have viewed this film I am the only one who liked it".

	schema:reviewBody "I would be wrong if I said that Danny DeVito's films were made with full intent to capture the realisms of life and it is because of his ability to portray an eccentric world or relationship that he is able to made the most original and entertaining characters known to film.For example although he didn't create the character Matilda he was able to portray the girl with telekinetic ability in a very effective manner in the film of the same name. And also the characters in 'War of the Roses' were thoroughly overthetop but it was because of this that the films directed by the short man were so entertaining.'Death to Smoochy' was no exception. It is because of the overthetop characters that it is so funny. Edward Norton's character in particular is hilarious just because of the OTT reactions the 'atrocities' of the world draw out of him and the overlynice attitude he oozes.There are other things that create humour. The lines are hilariously witty and even the facial expressions created by some of the characters give the film replay value. So IS there anything wrong with it?I personally don't believe the dated storyline creates an obstruction but I do feel that there is a problem with the dramatic character arcs. The biggest example of this is Robin Williams' character who goes in one scene from being ridiculously hateful to wanting nothing more than to save his exarchrival. This is where the overthetop obstructs believability although it doesn't do enough to make me dislike the film even partially.The film although flawed only by the very dramatic character arcs is thoroughly enjoyable and DeVito sprinkles just enough dramatic camera angles to support the extremity of the storyline. It is a rare gem battered at the box office but very safe in my collection of favourite DVDs.Enjoy.Stoate.".

Credit to him. All the characters in the film served a purpose and above all did it well!! All seemed believable and Robin Williams was the star.If you watch this film persevere for the first 20 minutes because after which the jokes and plot come in hard and thick.Top stuff rent if you want a comedy with original storyline and a little bit of good humoured smut thrown in for good measure.".

I loved it. You will too.It is very hard to do justice to this movie in a summary. First Smoochy gives a dark twist to children's TV programming and especially to children's charities portraying them more as crime syndicates than dogood organizations. In one scene Sheldon Ed Norton who is Smoochy the Rhino declines to do an ice show thus cutting off expected revenues to a well known children's charity. He is severely warned They are the roughest of all the charities.Ed Norton is superb. You first meet an impossibly sincere saccharine character who sits at a bar drinking orange juice spiked with liquid alfalfaand gets buzzed. And you believe him. But there are a couple of moments when he reveals the potential for insensate rage and you learn that one time in his life he had to learn anger management thus giving an entirely different spin to the character.Norton is exquisitely supported by all the others. Catherine Keener is a revelation. Early in the movie Nora Keener is a hardbitten TV exec who puts Sheldon Nortonin his place I didn't discover you. I delivered you. I have a bigger emotional investment in my nail polish.Later she reveals a vulnerable woman who was used and hurt by the cads all around her in the children's TV business. Rebuffing Rainbow Randolph's Robin Williams suggestion they take up where they left off years ago Nora ripostesNora I was young. And stupid. Randolph And limber.The acting quality runs deep including the bit players. Michael Rispoli is masterful as Spinner Dunn. And for sheer visual impact the prize goes to Vincent Schiavelli. What would a lecherous heroineaddicted clown hired to assassinate another clown look like? He would look like Buggy Ding Dong. You have to see him to believe it. You will burst out laughing.That the critics hated this movie brings up what I call the Bulworth effect which I first noticed around 1998 when that awful movie came out. So Bulworth is to movies what shoe leather is to filet mignon. But for the young Halle Barry Bulworth would be unwatchable. However it is politically correct and that is the only possible explanation for the raves it got from critics.Death To Smoochy is politically very INcorrect. And that is the only possible explanation for the hammering it got from critics. If you have ever wondered why your own impressions of a movie differ so greatly from that of the critics politics is the likely explanation. Movies like Death To Smoochy and Bulworth make it very clear that many of the critics are looking at the movies for something other than a great story and great acting.".

This movie fits the bill and you need to watch it! And that's why the rhino's going to get exactly what he deserves. Death to Smoochy is a mix of Barney the Dinosaur and over the top gangster films. Death to Smoochy is an acquired taste that has since release got a large cult follow. In no way is the movie perfect this movie does take something so sacred like kidtelevisions shows host and turn it incredibly dark. Most of the characters are pretty unlikeable and meanspirited and their turn around to good a bit farfetch but I have to say that the movie isn't trying to be squeaky clean it's trying to show that even the greater of good can still fall in the mud. The movie felt like a remake of 1939's Mr. Smith goes to Washington with its similar plot. The movie is about a goodAll American boy named Sheldon Mopes AKA Smoochy Edward Norton who is hired by a network station to replace corrupt children's television show host Rainbow Randolph Robin Williams whom just got busted for taking bribes. It's seem like the television producers M. Frank Stokes Jon Stewart  Nora Wells Catherine Keener charged with finding a squeaky clean replacement for Randolph underestablish how squeaky clean Sheldon is as he's not willing to forsake any events that is funded by criminals such as the Parade of Hope who hide under a charity organization. Now Sheldon must try to keep his 'I want to do good mentality believable under the pressure of the harsh realism of corruption leaded by attacks from both Rainbow Randolph Parade of Hope and the Network. Making a dark comedy is difficult to write it's so easy to slip into a really depressing drama or horror if not handled correctly. I think the movie is wellwritten. It is crass crude and hilarious. It shows the depths of ugliness but isn't too meanspirited to be unlikeable. Still whatever commentary there was supposed to be about American mass media consumerism didn't really come through right. Without the great gifted acting from both Edward Norton and Robin Williams this movie wouldn't had work. Edward Norton's Sheldon Mopes is a lovable and friendly character that's so nice so friendly so naive he played all those layers of the character so well we start to believe a guy like that can really exist! He was a bit annoying at times but overall he did great as the moral stone needed for this film to work. Robin Williams is just ridiculous most of his jokes were funny as hell. This is the first role in a long time of playing the good guy in the 1990s that he was alright as the rude and irascible with a propensity for violence type of a bad guy. The supporting cast was just as funny as them. I love the character of Spinner Dunn Michael Rispoli. He was such a lovable funny character. The witty oneliners harsh physical comedy and dark biting tone force the audience to laugh out loud while squirming in their seats. Still it's weird that NeoNazis are huge fans of a cartoony rhino. The music that goes with the film is just absurd but great to hear Stepfather one of Moochy's songs about being patient with mom's new husband is pure brilliance. Even the Friends Come in All Sizes song by Robin William is pretty impression with the opening tap dance. The whole ice dance event toward the end was very welldone. I got buzzed off of orange juice watching it. Death to Smoochy is known for its outwardly vulgar and profane humor particularly Williams' profound cursing outbursts throughout the film. I wouldn't say this movie should be watch by children at all. It was unfair of critics to call it one of the worst of the year. Overall Death to Smoochy is screwed up satire but in a squeamishly delightful kind of way. Plus for those of you who harbor a secret pentup homicidal hatred of Barney will love this movie. Death to Smoochy can't change the world but it did made a dent in some people lives. I was surprised to find that this film has so many rabid fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the years of cinema a certain dilemma has remained unresolved how to market a black comedy. Elusive to categorize it remains equally difficult to articulate exactly what such films are offering and to which demographic. Certainly such an obstacle arose when marketing Danny DeVito's Death to Smoochy. With a misleading trailer boasting a broad comedy Robin Williams vehicle the film was greeted as a scornful box office failure that few seemed to know how to approach and proved miles away from what they had expected. Yet this reaction proves all the more disappointing considering the rare treat the film offers  one of a steadily decreasing few which genuinely subvert viewer expectations. While far from perfect Death to Smoochy remains the sort of fundamentally bizarre yet gloriously daring picture which seldom makes it to theatres offering a gleefully warped macabre wit almost guaranteed to please those willing to take it for what it is.The fact that the word 'death' being present in the title of a mainstream comedy is a rarity should be indicative of exactly how offbeat and downright sinister the film is. Despite a sparkly visual palate of pastel colours the film could hardly be more dark tonally with its infusion of frequent brutal violence and sadistic uncomfortable humour making it about the farthest thing away from the safe mainstream comedy its trailer attempted to depict. Yet its shady sensibilities cannot possibly quench the film's manic wickedly sadistic wit and the enormously quotable screenplay delivers such a varied slew of humour that the viewer cannot help but consistently be caught by surprise. DeVito amplifies such an ambiance with bizarre offkilter camerawork and a continuous transitioning from satire to the deadly serious to goofy slapstick and back again leaving the viewer uncertain when to roar with laughter or to cringe uncomfortably. In fact the blurring between the two becomes poignantly indiscernible with DeVito seemingly impishly suggesting that whether cinema makes us laugh or cringe either way it does not deter our fascination with watching and that perhaps the boundary becomes simply redundant in the end. Nonetheless as fresh as such a fusion of the comedic and the grotesque may be the lack of obvious prerequisites also results in Death to Smoochy suffering from certain design flaws. The film starts off as a devilish satire of network television with Norton's sickeningly wholesome entertainer Sheldon Mopes thrust into the fish out of water figure in a sea full of greedy merchandise obsessed execs. Yet about halfway through DeVito loses his pace and the film begins to feel more like a chaotic jumble continually stuffing in new characters and plot twists and with at least three seeming climaxes uneasily leading into further narrative development. Similarly the film's treatment of Robin Williams' vengeance obsessed TV host Rainbow Randolph remains equally indecisive. Perhaps due to Williams' star casting DeVito appears to struggle with exactly what to do with the character whether to situate him as protagonist or depraved quasiantagonist. As such Randolph appears uncomfortably stuck between the two and the film's ensuing rocky focalization makes it harder for the viewer to maintain their emotional bearings. The addition of a rather conventional romantic subplot also feels somewhat out of place in so uniformly dark and vindictive a picture making the third act feel all the more unnecessarily chaotic. Nonetheless despite this mishmash of content somehow DeVito's loopy pace and zany twisted sense of humour never quite loses the audience even at its most imbalanced but instead only becomes more bizarre often appealingly so without sacrificing the entertainment front. DeVito also delights in inverting the typical characters his stars would play resulting in a deliciously unconventional tweaking of expectations. Despite the publicity hyping Williams Edward Norton is the most firmly situated as the film's 'main character' which works as Norton is unreasonably hilarious superbly counteracting his usual intensity as charming yet irritatingly well intentioned children's entertainer Smoochy the Rhino who goes out of his way to refuse merchandising money in favour of promoting organic sugar free foods and respecting hostile stepparents on children's television. Norton is careful to keep the character crucially likable even at his most simperingly moronic crafting an enduring emotional centre and grounding the calamity of the film around him. Similarly fans of Robin Williams' less family sanctioned standup act will be enthralled by his performance as unhinged Rainbow Randolph. Retaining his usual flair for colourful improvisation Williams lets loose in a twisted exceedingly dark fashion barely glimpsed before and while he unquestionably rockets light years past being over the top his slew of bitter incensed profanityfraught rants are just about worth watching the film by themselves.Catherine Keener's credible charisma and warmth also help acclimatize a shaky character transition from nihilistically jaded producer to earnest hopeful young woman making the potentially weakest point of the film instead burst to life with a quirky spark. Danny DeVito himself delivers a familiar but still enjoyable lampoon of the greedy agent figure and an early performance by TV comic Jon Stewart delivers a tantalizing taste of a gestating talent. The film also offers a collection of memorable character bits worthy of the Coen brothers from Michael Rispoli's blustering often incomprehensible lovable nitwit of a former boxer Danny Woodburn's sardonic children's television actor and an utterly hilarious Vincent Schiavelli as a narcoleptic heroin addict assassin.While certainly not for all tastes Death to Smoochy delivers a unique daringly morbid and raucously hilarious product which manages to continually dodge expectations while remaining enjoyable. While its unfavourable reaction is perhaps typical of so unconventional a picture such a rare delight deserves to be enjoyed and appreciated flaws and all and those willing to take in a different kind of comedy are unlikely to be disappointed.810".

But after stumbling upon it on the IMDb several years later and reading numerous rave reviews about it I decided to take a risk and give DTS a shot anyway.For those who have spoken highly of the film's concept acting look or uniqueness I agree with you on those points. DTS throws out most of the conventional comedy mold and attempts to do something different and off the wall. The cast is also a great ensemble including Edward Norton Robin Williams Catherine Keener and Danny DeVitto among others.The problem for me was the delivery of the humor just didn't work. DTS relies too much on the uniqueness of itself to generate laughs. A theoretically good concept can't make up for the lack of substance of the greater product. The movie just drags on and on for nearly two hours despite barely having enough humorous material to fill half that time. The only scene that I really found memorable was Robin Williams's rant about a certain phallic shaped cookie.Maybe I'm overlooking some deep inner meaning or something but for me this film just didn't work and while some will no doubt like it for being different it's a tough sell.".

Over 300 on subjects from the deliciousness of vegetables to the importance of donating plasma.

	schema:reviewBody "Garci's Tiovivo c. 1950 could be considered as a deserving heir to Camus' La Comena based on Camilo Jos Cela's marvelous novel. As its predecessor Tiovivo has virtually no plot and limits itself to representing the lives of a bunch of people in the Madrid of the postwar era. The cast is simply impressive it looks like just any actor who was available was summoned by Garci to star in his film. However we would have liked to see a bit more of some actors who appear in little more than glorified cameos Fernando Fernn Gmez Ana Fernndez or Beatriz Rico to name just a few. There are some extremely fine performances from the likes of Alfredo Landa Tina Sinz Andrea Tenuta or surprisingly enough Elsa Pataky and Francis Lorenzo. All of them make the most of their bit parts in this ensemble piece but the heart and soul of the picture is Aurora Bautista who plays a destitute woman who sells religious stamps.Taking into account that the movie has virtually no plot there is no apparent reason to make a twohourandahalf movie. There are so many great stories but I couldn't help to wonder whether the film would have benefited if Garci had kept a few of them for a further project. The eventual result is overlong and definitely not as good as You're the one or Historia de un beso but it is still worth a watch if only for the great performances. Overall rating 710".

	onyx:emotionText "Garci's Tiovivo c. 1950 could be considered as a deserving heir to Camus' La Comena based on Camilo Jos Cela's marvelous novel. As its predecessor Tiovivo has virtually no plot and limits itself to representing the lives of a bunch of people in the Madrid of the postwar era. The cast is simply impressive it looks like just any actor who was available was summoned by Garci to star in his film. However we would have liked to see a bit more of some actors who appear in little more than glorified cameos Fernando Fernn Gmez Ana Fernndez or Beatriz Rico to name just a few.

	schema:reviewBody "'Tiovivo c. 1950' Jos Luis Garci's new film is a complex story. It has more than 60 actors and all of them perform important roles. They embody those people who had to face the difficult times Spain was living in the middle of the Twentieth Century after the Spanish Civil War.In my opinion the best interpretations belong to Ana Fernndez Elsa Pataky and Andrea Tenuda. My favorite one is Miss Fernndez's since she develops an excellent role in four and a half minutes only.The technical aspects of this film are good but its score is almost inexistent. Although 'Tiovivo c. 1950' has a runtime of two and a half hours it is not a boring production.In short Garci's new film is better than other of his former projects but it is not a masterpiece. 710".

Despite this style Tiovivo is not as good as the movies it is like more boring less charismatic the emptiness of a story makes it too hard to see. In addition the 2h 30min it has does not help to make it easier. Not like la colmena 90 min or Roma 100 min the enormous longness of the movie makes it so hard and so awful that despite the fact it is very well filmed it has most of better Spanish actors and the scenes are interesting the result is a boring neverending film that could have been better if being shorter.".

It's a situation not unlike what Karen Silkwood faced when she tried to investigate a nuclear plant.The film is thus highly political. Its message overpowers the story. Most viewers will sympathize with the message. But what about the story? The characters are not entirely believable. For example the young Mexican woman whom Lauren befriends can't seem to speak English when they first meet. And Lauren says she can't speak Spanish. Yet later the young woman and Lauren chat up a storm both in English and Spanish a dialogue necessity no doubt to placate viewers. The plot's climax is Hollywood sensationalized which detracts from the authenticity of the message.Color cinematography is very high contrast which works well given the good vs. evil theme. Prod design and costumes are quite realistic. The filming in Mexico gives credibility to the story though filming entirely in Juarez was not possible owing to the physical danger. Acting is acceptable. Lopez does a fine job.My impression is that Bordertown was not given a proper theatrical release here in the U.S. because of its tough political message which speaks volumes if true.

And yet there is not other chance than to criticize the filmmakers for the poor work they've done. That is 'Bordertown'.At the Berlin film festival  where 'Bordertown' premiered  director Greg Nava who also wrote the script coproducer Barbara Martinez and Jennifer Lopez who also produced left no doubt how important the movie is to them. A website that accompanies the movie is supposed to raise money for the people in Juarez special screenings should do the same. Plus they hope that 'Bordertown' will bring attention to the killings of so many women at the border between Mexico and the USA. And maybe this attention will help preventing more murders and maybe even help solving some cases. After all according to Nava 400 dead bodies were found throughout the years 3 alone in the last 14 days. 4000 women are still missing. And it's not just that nobody cares for those women they have no 'economical value' Nava said in the press conference and it's true They make 4 bucks a day and even enough woman would be happy to take the jobs. Apparently there are people who didn't want the the film makers to touch the subject Nava received death threats an assistant who worked with the second unit in Juarez got beaten up by police according to Martinez. Somebody broke into her hotel room and when this somebody realized they are not going to stop filming he stole the cameras. Main part of the film were not shot in Juarez but in more supportive Mexican towns and in factories who also were helpful. 'Bordertown' is a movie that deserves to be supported.And still it is heart breaking how bad the movie is. It's not just bad it's also at times pathetic and not very logical. Lopez plays a journalist Lauren who is sent to Juarez to write an article about the murders. She used to live in the area she has a former lover Diaz Banderas there who runs a newspaper in Juarez. He is reluctant to help her until a girl shows up  Eva Maya Zapata who got raped but survived because the guys who did it to her believed she was dead. Eva is able to identify the killers but this puts her and Lauren in serious danger. Still Lauren continues her research...possible SPOILERS ahead'Bordertown' is a Hollywood movie which is supposed to make money at ticket offices. Let's forgive the film makers that a lot of the movie consists of 'run and hide' action typical to these kind of thrillers. But it is simply stupid that Lauren eventually is considering to give up her career because of the tragic events. Nava should have made Lopez a pretty standard journalist which would have made the movie way less pathetic. He also couldn't resist his urge to give Lauren a background which is pretty laughable. And some of the research work she is doing is just unbelievable. end of possible SPOILERSObviously the movie was so important to Nava he failed in the end. A good journalist should never be too involved with the topic he is working on. A good filmmaker neither it seems. Still If this movies actually helps changing things in Juarez if it makes same moviegoers research a bit more  thumbs up to 'Bordertown'. I personally would recommend reading about the killings though.".

	schema:reviewBody "BORDERTOWN is more than a suspenseful film about a tragic reality that has been terrifying Juarez Mexico for years. This film written and directed by Gregory Nava 'Mi Familia' 'El Norte' 'Selena' etc approaches a public service campaign on the part of Nava and the rest of his cast and crew  especially producerstar Jennifer Lopez. After the stunning effect of the film the viewer is encouraged to watch the several excellent featurettes on the DVD  and then try to remain uninvolved.Chicago Sentinel editor George Morgan Martin Sheen convinces the reluctant reporter Lauren Adrian Jennifer Lopez to fly to Juarez Mexico to cover a combustible story about the ongoing rapes and murders of women who work the factories along the border for little pay. Lauren would prefer becoming a foreign correspondent and extracts a promise that if she takes on this ugly assignment 'I don't speak Spanish and I don't know anything about Mexico' Morgan will grant that request. When the beautiful blond Lauren arrives in Juarez she is shocked by the reality a very young factory worker girl Eva the fine young actress Maya Zapata has managed to survive a rape and attempted murder literally climbing out of her grave and escaping. Lauren and Eva bond and Lauren realizes that her story about the 5000 victims of this heinous serial killing may just rest with the information Eva holds she can identify her assailants. With the aid of anxious newspaper owner Alfonso Diaz Antonio Banderas the three begin the dangerous struggle to unveil the truths about the coverup of the deaths the police and government corruption in Mexico are matched by similar deeds in the USA in order to protect the NAFTA arrangement which apparently holds the profit of the megafactories of more importance then the mere lives of thousands of Mexican women. How the trio infiltrates the corruption and the buried secret realities of Lauren's humble beginnings provide the remainder of the film.Nava elects to shoot this film in garish light and emphasizes the tragic filth and mire of the living conditions of the peasants along the border  each hoping to escape the life situations by crossing into the US. He manages to maintain a coarse cinematic effect that enhances the story. Not only Is Lopez in top form but also she is assisted by a fine cast of fellow actors including Sonia Braga Juan Diego Botto Zaide Silvia Gutirrez Rene Rivera among others. Yes the story has been told before but that only means there are many people who want this contemporary tragedy to end. In one of the features on the DVD we are given addresses and names to contact to help stop this horrendous 'feminicide'. Take serious note. Grady Harp".

And it is not a pretty picture by any means. I think that the movie aimed at exposing the ugly truth of what has been going on right at the US border where hundreds of women have been slaughtered for the past decade or so. But that was not all because such nightmare did not and does not come out of nowhere it comes straight out of the disastrous situation that exists in the modernday sweathouses aka as 'manufacturing plants' to the big corporations and the surrounding favelas where their workers live. And the sweathouses are a direct consequence of among the rest 'trade agreements' like the NAFTA. So even though some people might not like it this is a political movie and very rightly so. And now that I think of it it does have some good cinematography in it I find the photography extremely good. I liked the yellowish desertlike tint that pervades the whole movie.".

At the Berlin film festival writerproducerdirector Gregory Nava and his star Jennifer Lopez as well as producer Barbara Martinez were convincing in their mission to fashion a movie loosely based on the facts of continued and brutal rapes with the killing andor disappearance of many young woman victims that came to Juarez. Juarez is located across the USMexican border bridge connecting El Paso New Mexico. Most every feeling being with a conscience will support such an infocational flick and therefore it hurts to say that the filmmakers failed in their stated and otherwise laudable aim. The prescription for Hollywood is simply to demand thrilling action so that the adrenalineseeking crowds will fill the boxoffice coffers even though this movie has the looks feel and production quality that indicate that not much money was spent on it. Besides an aboveaverage amount of goofs the emphasis is made on impreciselyexecuted chaseandrun scenes while the development of characters is almost entirely absent due to a rather phlegmatic script.For instance we find out about the background of the main character the journalist Lauren Adrian Jennifer Lopez during blackandwhite flashbacks that can not possible make sense to the most avid moviegoer until she actually dialogs its meaning during a scene towards the end of the movie. IMDB lists the character name as Lauren Fredericks. Her prior relationship with Juarezbased El Sol journalist Diaz Antonio Banderas is cleverly revealed during dialogs and it becomes obvious that Lauren had dumped him in the past that he now had a family he cared for and that he still loved Lauren enough to keep her out of danger. On the other hand we learn nothing about the police who want to avoid any publicity of the brutal murders and who are shown to be only superficially interested in solving the murders that the movie claims are as many as 4.000 while even Amnesty International describes over 400. Of course if it was one it would be objectionable but why the hype? Is that another sign that the movie wants to built on the surefire success of sensationalism while it can not offer the real goods of a welldeveloped story with two and threedimensional characters who want a better world while materialistic psycho and sociopaths seem to have the upper hand in killing teenage women who come to work in the freetradecreated factories for about 5 bucks a day. Or that the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA is written so that US companies can exploit lacking worker safety virtually nonexistent environmental laws cheap labor and low taxes. To this very day these companies have not instituted safe transportation for their vulnerable and povertystricken women employees during the changing shifts as these factories never close. All this is not meant to recommend that you don't go and watch the movie or better to rent it as a DVD. It has at least entertainment value and the acting is acceptable and probably could not be any better because the script does not give the actors much creative width and depth to reenact. Indeed the movie has the feel as if it was made under time stress. There are reported stories that the film crew was threatened and that many scenes were filmed in other Mexican towns that were more hospitable. It has this letsgetitover feeling that is also reflected in jumpy often confusing editing and a music score that seems to be a onetake offering. This topic is just too important as to trivialize it in an illconceived action flick. But a few scenes are as authentic as they can get. The living conditions of the workers as the heartless and shrewd consequences of companies like DuPont General Electric and Alcoa who must live in slums that are literally created out of cardboard stolen pallets old tires and held into place by nails driven through bottle caps. And the scene were an illegal electric hookup ends into a fire disaster has in reality occurred many times. Hollywood will then stage a scene were many loose their homes in a fastmoving fire and the most evil killer will just show up during such a disaster as the backdrop and try to kill our beloved journalist. For the real story enter the string Juarez murder women nafta in your search engine without the quotes and get a hold of the real story which includes drug lords buying into sweat shops called maquiladoras and using the freezone infrastructure to transport truckloads of drugs across the bridge and with the railroad into the States along with television sets and monitors and all the other sweatshop items produced by mostly young women. Our movie will not tell you that and many other aspects as it busybodies itself with Hollywoodtype often senseless and carelessly executed action. The topic definitely deserved a masterpiece film to get the message of this exceptionally cruel social and economic disaster across. What a real shame that it missed so badly.".

	schema:headline " A failed movie though its worthy intention";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not the kind of movie I usually see and I must admit that while watching it on TV I gradually realized that it was not the documentary film I expected. The story is based on a horrifying and tragic reality of raping and killing of women on the Mexican border of which I did not know anything as underreported throughout the world. The movie has so the laudable merit of bringing to light and denouncing the terrifying drama of thousands of women being raped and disappeared in those waste lands working in those appalling maquilladoras where even the most basic human rights are completely disregarded and where deep economic interests prevail over respect for human dignity. However as the story progressed I realized it was more an actionthriller than a documentary picture standing out for gripping though improbable twists a tense and quick pace intertwined with some more relaxed and relaxing moments which appear as really improbable and above all of bad taste and out of place if we consider the grave topic of the movie. It is as if that worthy aim gives way to more entertaining and market needs. So my doubt was how can such a highly committed movie be bent to the logic of the boxoffice? How can you shift your attention from scenes of rape of terrifying violence to the underlining of J. Lo's perfect silhouette? It is evident that the production aimed at attracting audience through an attractive cast and some shrewd devices such as pacing action a thrillerplot sentimental flashbacks some entertaining music thus losing its seriousness and credibility. I watched it till the end because it was gripping and like all thriller movies you want to know how it ends up but I realize this is not the reason why I should have wanted to see it till the end and in this sense I think it is in the end a failed movie.".

But to laugh and give a negative review to a movie that tells an important story whether or not it stars Jennifer Lopez is awful and shows that there are people who are regulars on this board who are not just stupid. They're complete morons.This is based on a true story about murders of young women that have been taking place in Juarez Mexico for years with a large number of women have been raped and murdered or simply disappeared. The women work in the maquiladoras 247 companies that employ cheap labor usually women and create disposable products. Apparently the women are disposable too. The women are normally attacked as they are going home.Jennifer Lopez plays a reporter who is assigned this story against her will but becomes involved in it protecting a young woman who dug herself out of her own grave and going undercover in a maquiladora herself to uncover one of the murderers.This horrible situation is not dealt with efficiently by the government or the police. In part this is due to political pressure and the fact that mob and drug money is often involved in the ownership of the factories.The North American Free Trade agreement NAFTA was expanded in 1994 and provided new opportunities for the maquiladoras. This was an issue director Gregory Nava wanted to explore and Jennifer Lopez Martin Sheen and Antonio Banderas signed on. Because of the R rating and the opinion of several focus groups it was not released in theaters. It's not a great movie. As a TV movie it would have been much better. It also doesn't look very expensive. I don't happen to think Jennifer Lopez is a horrible actress. Unlike some here I thought her back story shown in flashback was very clear.This is an important story made by sincere people. One can at least appreciate that they wanted to raise awareness of this issue. It's easy to sit and criticize a film it's another to go out and make one. And maybe a few people will think about a rich country like Mexico  rich in minerals tourism manufacturing  that pays people 3 to 5 a day and has a population that lives in poverty while the people that control the money send it out of the country. Is it any wonder they try to sneak into the U.S.? Anything is better than how they are forced to live. And nothing is done to help them. Nothing.".

	schema:reviewBody "This really wasn't the bad film that critics in Europe and on this board are making it out to be!! I saw this movie a few days ago and it was one of the best movies I've seen in 2007. I am in shock at how ignorant people on here are. This movie was meant to show real life situations that are happening right now at the border towns between united states and Mexico. Jennifer Lopez plays Lauren Adrian a reporter for the Chicago Sentinel who wants to be a big time news reporter but has to go to Mexico and report what is going on with the murders of these women in the factories. She almost doesn't take the job because she didn't want to have anything to do with Mexico but is convinced by her boss that she will move on in the business if she does this well. Lopez does a great job in this movie along with Antonio Banderas. The suspense and horror was there in the movie. Every moment you were scared for your life for this woman who survived being raped and buried in the desert and left for dead. This movie is definitely a must see and as I read a lot of the commentaries on this movie on here... I NEVER once in the movie heard a corny line dumb subtlehumor anything like that. I don't know if it was the way the movie was translated into different languages in Europe but I saw the English version and it was great the way it was. Excellent script excellent actors excellent director. Whether it gets recognition for the good work these people did in the movie I don't know I could only hope so. But hopefully this movie will also bring United States the awareness of what is going on in the USMexican border towns. See this movie you will not regret watching this heartfelt dramathriller.".

Secondly the implication that there is some utopian protectionist alternative isn't born about by any evidence. Many people have come to the border area to work in the factories but their wages are generally higher than the areas they came from and lest anyone think Mexico was crime free prior to NAFTA should watch Los Olvidados a film about violent youths in Mexico City in 1950. Also the notion newspapers were somehow unconcerned with the bottom line in the past is also a reach.I will say the film tries to depict the gritty life that exists on the US Mexican border and certainly the murders are gruesome and the police have been ineffective at best in solving the crimes.

It's nice to see JLO do this type of film and I hope very much that she agrees to do other movies in a similar vein.There was not much eyecandy on view  those horrible slacks JLO wore throughout the movie did nothing to show off her fantastic booty and hips and made her look so damn plain.I enjoyed the movie and place it about halfway in my league table of favourite JLO movies.Definitely worth a watch by everyone.".

	schema:headline " Important subject routine film.";
	schema:reviewBody "All these young women are being murdered in and around Juarez. Nobody knows who's doing it or why. True enough though not often noted in the American press. The editor of a Chicago newspaper Martin Sheen sends an ambitious reporter Jennifer Lopez to Juarez to investigate the events and report back to him. In Juarez Lopez hooks up with an exlover Antonio Banderas who now runs the fictional newspaper Sol de Juarez. His is the only local paper taking the wave of murders seriously the others treating them as minor incidents perhaps the result of domestic violence. This is also the view of the police who don't want to stir up any local muck. So Lopez and Banderas run into obstacles all along the way even when they take under their wing a young woman who has almost miraculously survived an attack.The movie suggests that the real culprits here are the Americanfunded factories that were built in the border towns after the passage of NAFTA. The girls who work in these sweat shops the maquiladoras are not worth protecting  not at four dollars a day  and so are expendable because there are always more lining up for the jobs.This is a simpleminded explanation of a revolting complicated tragic and fascinating social problem. Some men somewhere have learned that it is easy to rape and murder a young woman around Juarez bury her body in the desert and walk away from it. And the movie slips us a formula like an an easily swallowed pill along the lines of B is a function of A. Plot aside the development of events is confusing. I lost track of the identity of some of the characters and their motives. The movie never sinks to the obvious level of a stereotypical slasher film though. It's ambition prevents it and presumably the writer and director's taste. The action scenes are handled fairly well.The photography is a distraction. It's in high contrast such that if in a sunlit room a figure moves into the shadows it disappears into the blackness while the rest of the environment remains an eyenumbing glare. And the images are in saturated yellow seeming to overheat all the surfaces and turn them grimy and even more squalid than they already are. At night they are blue but the same effect is achieved.There's nothing wrong at all with the performances. Jennifer Lopez is no longer the sex bomb of yesteryear but she's acquired more character as an actress still has that enduring mandible and cantilevered rear end. Antonio Banderas I like. The guy isn't exactly handsome but has a face and demeanor that are at once masculine and sympatico. Martin Sheen may be a little weak or perhaps it's his formulaic lines being shouted over the roar of giant newspaper printers. Incredible humanity. I wish this wellintentioned film had been better than it is. I think it's a mistake to simplify complex social problems into a conflict between a good side and a simple single bad side. But that generates an even more disturbing thought. Suppose the film makers were right to boil this anfractuous story down into its bundle of two oppositions? Suppose the average viewer is unable any longer to grasp the multivaried aspects of a wave of unrelated murders of young women? Or  well not UNABLE to grasp complexity just unwilling to put out the effort to do so? How much easier to pick a villain and stick to it. How much more appealing to an impatient public. How much more commercial. Even if genuine ambiguity must be thrown out the window.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story opens with a bride and groom kissing at their marriage service but you only get to see the face of the bride. This is a clue for us. We are going to have to figure out as we watch the film which guy is going to end up being the groom. The picture on the front of the video box has already showed us a bride being kissed from one side by Schwimmer and simultaneously from the other by Lee so we know the race for romance is going to be between the two of them. This release with Dutch subtitles has a different picture to the US video IMDb picture.Yet in the first five minutes Linda the publisher tells us not once but twice that she introduced the bride and groom.  We cut to a flashback of her introducing the two of them to each other just in case we still don't get it. Then within another five minutes Jay the writer Lee is introducing Sam his editor Avital to Max the sports caster and general foulmouthed ignoramus Schwimmer. IF the publisher is telling us the truth doesn't this just kinda rule Max out of the contest for the first person to kiss the bride? Or have I missed something here?This film is about as predictable as trying to guess which kind of white meat will feature most often on Thanksgiving dinner tables this year. I'll tell you it will be turkey. And this movie sure is one.But it is not just the plot and direction that are hugely lacking. Schwimmer is totally unbelievable and badly miscast as Max. His mouth moves the words come out but they lack any conviction whatsoever. The character of Jay the writer is such a whiney loser with possibly the worst hairstyle in recent movie history that I began to dread every screen appearance he made. He seemed to communicate in a series of whinging questions What are you doing here? So what?? And?? I have absolutely no idea why the two of them were friends they had nothing in common and were always bitching at each other. The script was very weak in places Jay's explanation of why he had introduced Max to Sam provoked for me the biggest guffaw of the film one of the very few. Best part of the film? The Harry Connick Jr. song over the opening credits.Overall it gets a 3 a waste of my time and money  it was I who was the FOOL for not reading Roger Ebert's review BEFORE going to the video shop. If you are looking for a nice romantic comedy get While You Were Sleeping The Philadelphia Story As Good As It Gets or anything else on the IMDb list of top 50 Romance films.".

	onyx:emotionText "The story opens with a bride and groom kissing at their marriage service but you only get to see the face of the bride. This is a clue for us. We are going to have to figure out as we watch the film which guy is going to end up being the groom. The picture on the front of the video box has already showed us a bride being kissed from one side by Schwimmer and simultaneously from the other by Lee so we know the race for romance is going to be between the two of them. This release with Dutch subtitles has a different picture to the US video IMDb picture.Yet in the first five minutes Linda the publisher tells us not once but twice that she introduced the bride and groom.  We cut to a flashback of her introducing the two of them to each other just in case we still don't get it. Then within another five minutes Jay the writer Lee is introducing Sam his editor Avital to Max the sports caster and general foulmouthed ignoramus Schwimmer.

	schema:headline " Sweet... but ultimately nothing else...";
	schema:reviewBody "by Dane YoussefNow here is a movie that wants to be something successful by combining everything successful. Kissing A Fool wants to be too many things. Can you mix successful ingredients and get the best of every world? Kissing... tries to be a '40'sstyle romantic comedy a modern sex comedy and a sitcom at the same time.CowriterDirector Doug Ellin is a friend of Schwimmer's and Schwimmer has gone on and on about exactly how great it feels to shed his Rossimage and play the complete antiRoss. Jason Lee stars as Jay Murphy a sensitive nice guy who's a romance novelist and is recovering from his latest breakup with a model named Natasha played by TV's Weird Science Vanessa Angel. He has a sweet boynextdoor demeanor about him and his real problem is he's too nice and sensitive for his own good. The worst part about being sensitive is that the world is so full of crap and garbage people are such assholes that your feelings get hurt too often too easy too much. Better to be as cruel as the world or even more so and give worse than you get. Believe me I know of what I speak of. David Schwimmer costars as Jay's best friend Max Abbitt a sportscaster who's a womanizer who plays the field more than the teams reports on. A total creep and always with a dumb expression of his face a selfsatisfied drawl and his own coolguy salutation What' up? Always a toothpick and a too cool drawl dangling from his lip. Mili Avital is unfortunately given the secondtoweakest developed character in the whole film. She's sweet perky and photogenic... but nothing else really. She and Lee could have some great chemistry if only the film allowed it. But this movie is written in a way that's so madetoorder it's embarrassing. Bonnie Hunt plays the narrator that is publishing Lee's book. She's also the narrator. Why does this movie need a narrator? The narration actually manages to make the movie even less suspenseful if that's possible. And Vanessa Angel who broke through in TV's Weird Science and almost stole Kingpin is given the least interesting character. She plays a model and Jay's heartless exgirlfriend who has dumped him and left him a pathetic neurotic mess. Hers is not a character but a plot device. The heartless bitch who is so cruel and horrible to the sweethearted hero so more of our sympathy goes to him. I groaned at her scenes. The movie's dialog is not always plotdriven or cutesypoo like most romantic comedies are although sometimes it is. Most of the script is written in an observational sitcom kind of way. Like Seinfeld or Mad About You or yes even Friends. But the dramaticromantic scenes are embarrassingly maudlin. Is it just me or is the entire cast of Friends been trying to mimic Kevin Smith? The Object of My Affection  Kissing A Fool  Three To Tango Smith's groundbreaking romantic comedy Chasing Amy was revolutionary insightful... and made big waves for Ben Affleck Joey Lauren Adams Lee and Smith himself. A romantic comedy a sex comedy and a relationship story. Not merely a love story but a life story. Lately Hollywood has been trying to make Smithlike slick Hollywood movies. So far they failed terribly. Smith's movies are great because they are daring and avoid formulas. And they master the art of sparkling conversation. This film does neither. Nor do any of the other Kevin Smithwannabes. Lee's character has been through the ringer and things are looking bleaker. I really liked him here and felt for him. And identified with him more than I wanted to.I knew guys like Max in high school but in the outside world? Who knows? I was kind of like the Lee character myself. In a way I still am. Too sensitive. Too easily vulnerable. Such a whipping boy. I did understand what Jay meant when he said You know I wish I had your heart. Then I wouldn't have spent so many sleepless nights.... The plot seems cruel and creepy yet too sitcomlike at the same time. Test my fiance''s fidelity? Almost seems like a sick ploy to throw Jay  Samantha together doesn't it? Oh wait it is...Anyone who has ever seen a movie will know what the ending will be. It's almost like waiting for the coyote to fall off the cliff. Schwimmer's Max Abbit character seems to dumb and dull and annoying to be interesting. He must be sick of playing the same type The Pallbearer Six Days Seven Nights and TV's Friends but this movie will do nothing for him. Still at least he tried. I kept back in 1999 when I first saw this movie seeing a mad Ross trying to be bad whenever I looked at him but now looking back on it and putting Ross out of my head I really dislike the show anyway Schwimmer does an effective job... however he doesn't really have dimensions and depth. He's just not an interesting womanizer. Apparently a lot of Schwimmer fans felt confused by his role here. It feels like Schwimmer wants to play someone completely different without risking losing his hardcore audience. Schwimmer does do a much better job breaking typecasting in the forgettable Since You've Been Gone and the memorable Band of Brothers.MEMO TO Hollywood If you're gonna keep making bad Kevin Smithknockoffs at lest quit putting Friends actors in them.Kissing Off This One Dane Youssef".

Avital deserves better and Bonnie Hunt throws in a oneliner or two as narrator but otherwise she is just the bearer of bad news which is the screenplay.

And I liked Bonnie Hunt as the story's narrator. But the film suffers from a plot that is too predictable and from characters whose behavior is not believable.This is one of those movies that you can see the end coming a mile away. There are virtually no plot twists to deflect the story's straightline trajectory. As such the story is almost too simple and unimaginative to be worth telling. To varying degrees most romantic comedies are fairly shallow. But Kissing A Fool has no subtlety at all not in plot not in characters not in dialogue.Lacking any complexity the story relies on two main characters Jay Jason Lee and Max David Schwimmer whose behavior toward each other is not believable. They're supposed to be best buddies. But they are constantly at each other's throats. Their constant arguing not only is annoying it calls into question their friendship. How can they be best buddies?The two are not at all alike. Jay is bookish and cerebral Max is your typical arrogant cocky selfcentered sports freak jerk. All that animosity between these two guys does not lend credibility to their friendship yet it is the main contrivance that propels the film's plot. Further it renders a story conclusion that is by extension also not believable.The film's acting is a tad exaggerated. I like Jason Lee but he tends to overact in this film. Mili Avital as the girl in between is okay but she doesn't have much to do. And David Schwimmer's performance is something of a hypermasculine strutfest. Some subtlety in acting would have helped a lot.For all that Kissing A Fool is still worth watching once. It has credible production values and there are occasional lines of dialogue that are funny. And I think the film's underlying concept is fine. I just wish the script and the acting could have been a little more nuanced and subtle.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always gave it the benefit of the doubt. Romantic comedies usually can be good if done right. I wouldn't think this film is a total waste but the setup when you think about it is kind of hard to believe. Yet I don't think it is something so bad where it had to be a total boxoffice disaster. When it was released it performed very badly therefore only being in wide release for a couple of weeks and unable to crack the Top Ten. Most of what happens in the movie is told from Bonnie Hunt's character. She basically explains to a couple of people whom one of them is a guy who is quite attractive and delightful don't know his name however. He was the big guy. Anyway while at the wedding of the bride and groom they're going over about how the character's all ended up. She is a publisher of a writer named Jay Jason Lee who suddenly falls for his editor who is involved with his best friend Max David Schwimmer. Max wants to test how faithful his girlfriend really is by getting Jay to somehow seduce her. If you follow movies it'd be easy to understand that David Schwimmer is basically trying to play against type with his bad boy player type character but he basically comes off as sleazy and somewhat creepy. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense that someone like the editor whose character is played by Mili Avital would fall for someone like that and rather quickly too. To me the thing that works about this movie is Jason Lee. It's almost hard to believe that a year before this was released he played Banky in Chasing Amy. I thought he was a promising talent but unfortunately Hollywood and neither audiences saw it that way. But all of this was a long ways before those unfortunately successful Alvin and the Chipmunks disasters. I like Jason Lee as a romantic lead and it works here. He is utterly charming. I think in the end his editor Samantha eventually falls for him which is something that probably would have been more believable had it happened earlier on. By the end though the movie pretty much loses any kind of momentum.".

	schema:reviewBody "Making a movie is a complex affair when many things can go wrong and nobody may care about the things that go right. Filmmakers and studios are driven mad by audiences who embrace crap and turn their nose up at something good. Even given this difficult uncertainty there's no excuse for the litany of plainly obvious mistakes and misjudgments of Kissing a Fool. The things that are wrong with this motion picture are so glaringly wrong that it is inconceivable how no one noticed them. This sort of fiasco doesn't just get people fired it should actually end careers.The plot here is almost as old as fiction itself. A guy falls in love with his best friend's fiance. The guy in this instance is Jay Jason Lee a passive mope who is still devastated after being dumped by his exgirlfriend and is writing a novel about the miserable experience. His best friend is Max David Schwimmer a Chicago sportscaster and all around hound dog who of course is the exact opposite of Jay in every way. The fiance is Sam Mili Avitai the editor of Jay's book. Jay introduces Sam to Max they fall instantly into love move in together and start talking marriage.Let me stop with the plot and explain how this movie goes into the crapper right away and never gets out. First it opens with Sam getting married to somebody but we can't see who. We're then introduced to Linda Bonnie Hunt who claims to have introduced the newlyweds and proceeds to explain how they got together to a couple of fellow wedding guests essentially narrating the story as it appears in flashbacks. The whole point of this structure is to create a mystery as to whether Sam ends up with Max or Jay. Yet before you realize there's supposed to be a mystery Linda says she introduced the newlyweds and then we see her introducing Jay and Sam. So anyone with half a brain has to assume that Jay and Sam are the ones who got married and absolutely nothing not even Max and Sam getting engaged ever causes you to reconsider that assumption. There's never a single second when it seems like Sam might end up with anyone other than Jay but the film still carries out the nonexistent mystery until the very end.Secondly Jason Lee is playing the sympathetic guy in a romantic triangleand he has a unibrow. It's not an ordinary unibrow either. It's one where his eyebrows not only meet but take sharp turns and crawl down the bridge of his nose. It's so hideous you can hardly even notice anything else when Lee is on screen. Lee isn't exactly a matine idol to begin with and here he's made to look physically repellent.Those two blatant errors strangle Kissing a Fool in its crib. It wouldn't have mattered how good everything else was it was doomed from the start by those two awful and inept creative choices. And they're both such easily avoided problems. Simply have Linda say she knows the married couple instead of introduced them and there could have at least theoretically been a mystery. Pluck Lee's eyebrows every morning before shooting began and at least the audience wouldn't have been distracted by looking at Lee and expecting him to start strumming a banjo and squealing like a pig.It ultimately doesn't matter because the rest of the movie stinks on ice. Apparently realizing they weren't talented enough to do anything with the old two people are perfect for each other but neither wants to betray a third person shtick they add in a twist that sounds like something Aaron Sorkin would have resorted to if Sports Night has lasted another season or two. Max wants to test the fidelity of his fiance so he asks Jay to see if he can get Sam to want to sleep with him. The filmmakers also include an appearance by Jay's horrible exgirlfriend and give Max an exgirlfriend he's constantly hanging around with for no explicable reason. They even throw in a female cousin Judy Greer visiting Sam and staying at her house as though giving each main character an annoying chick to deal with somehow made it funny.Compounding the suck is that Max is a far more interesting and dynamic than Jay and also happens to be the one who pushes the narrative along. When the third wheel of your romantic triangle is the most proactive character in the film that's a problem.Bonnie Hunt and David Schwimmer are both quite good here particularly Schwimmer who demonstrates the comedic skills that could have led him to an entirely different career if he hadn't been cemented in the public's mind as Ross from Friends.Kissing a Fool is a misconceived mistake that people should have seen coming a mile away. Unless you have a thing for guys with unibrows don't bother watching it.".

His friend Jay played by former pro skateboarder Jason Lee introduces him to Sam played by Israel native Mili Avital. Max and Sam seem perfect for each other. But Max wonders if he can really keep Sam satisfied longterm and tries to get Jay to see if she can become unfaithful.  Sam and Jay have to work together on a writing project and in the end they begin to realize they are right for each other and Max realizes it also and finds out some things about his personal growth. Overall a very simple and often told story but done so in an enjoyable way. I especially liked Jason Lee's performance. I also saw him in Mumford and he was very good in that. He is a 'natural.'".

	schema:reviewBody "JeanJacques Annaud's film version of Marguerite Duras one of France's most esteemed writers is quite erotic... told from the perspective of a 15andahalfyearold French girl who learns very early about passion love and heartbreak... It's the crossing of the river... The crossing on a ferry of one of the branches of the Mekong in the great plains of mud and rice of southern Indochina... A pretty young girl goes back to Saigon... She is standing on the deck extremely defiant wearing a silk dress a pair of 'cabaret' high heels and a man's hat... She is approached by an elegant dark man from Cholon who is also crossing the Mekong that day towards Saigon... 'I like your hat. It's original. A man's hat on a young girl' he expresses and continues 'If you want I can drive you to Saigon.'The rich Chinese playboy with a black RollsRoyce is 32 years old from that financial minority that owns all the popular housing of the colony... He's back from Paris where he undertook some business studies...The film beautifully shot is a dreamy fantasy of escape through sex... The escape is that of the poor French teenager from the horror of her house in SaDec... While the girl merely abides her innocent mother she loves her younger brother poetically without reserve... Her brother is handsome but not bright romantic but terribly fragile... She fears her elder brother a brutal and lawless dissolute man stupidly dependent on his mother... The inexperienced girl wants to see him in pain... The most remarkable aspect of the story is the strength of character of the young girl who is always a little sad... She finds the strength to proceed against the forbidden with a calm determination... I've never followed anyone into a room yet. she exclaims... The room was dark shipwrecked surrounded by the neverending clamor of the town carried away by the flow of the town... Her body was in that public noise... Their love was erotic immediate unrestrained... It was physical violent devastating... But the girl loves other young woman in the boarding house the 17yearold Helen... Her passion for Helene is intense... Helen is immodest... She don't realize she walks naked in the dormitory... She doesn't know that she's very beautiful... She's innocent lingering on in youth... 'The Lover' parallels the life of Duras herself... The setting in Indochina is one she knows intimately... The story is set mostly in the early 1920s following the decline of French domination of the territory that is now Vietnam... The film is the most exciting journey along a winding river of passion which ultimately flows to the sea... JeanJacques Annaud handles the story with real sensuality romance and dramatic power... He shots much of the film with a distinguished style...Jane March is attractive but not obviously beautiful... Her impressionable teenager's gradual understanding of sexuality is well presented... She was subjected to a close penetrating gaze by Annaud's camera..Tony Leung as the rich Chinaman is the lusty son unable to escape his family's commands...Although unseen Jeanne Moreau jaded voice narrates the action and imparts a special flavor... Her words are poetry as any Duras reader knows...".

Perhaps it's because I needed a little more life experience to know the unexpressed feelings of the female character and the expressed feelings of the male character. Sure this movie is about taboo and tasting forbidden fruit. This movie is about sex. But this movie also has very strong depictions of the other emotions involved in the affair. Shame. Guilt. Racial and social prejudice. Love which is explored when both parties know there can be no future. Emotional detachment born out of necessity as a defense mechanism. Being ostracized by your peers and life in an environment rife with vicious rumors. But mostly the shame and guilt. It's made clearer to me what a former lover of mine may have felt.To live through all that and then to watch this movie makes for a very personal moving experience. I can't recommend it to everyone since every movie experience is unique. But I can say that The Lover is much much more than just an excuse for graphic love scenes. It's a story of a reminiscence... a first time... a shameful secret... a hidden love fostered through hardship and burning into the mind of the narrator an indelible permanent mark of memory of a first lifeshaping lover...".

The characters are perfect and acted in a minimalist way that's refreshing.I see here that the main objections to this film are 1 .. Not enough character development 2 .. The film does not have a clear direction to where it's going 3 .. Too slow 4 .. Too much sex for some people if a film has explicit sex it can't be goodAll these objections are pointless1 .. The characters here are ordinary people not that interesting by themselves. It's the love story that's interesting. Both of them know they have no future and try to pretend it's not love. I am sick of films in which the characters are sure they love each other after 30 minutes of character development.2 .. The fact that this film does not follow a clear path it's one of it's qualities. It adds more drama and the characters themselves are confused and don't know where they're going. The whole film plays like a dream of love and to request clear direction it's pointless.3 .. Ahh! The too slow argument. There are films in this world that make you think about you your life and the world that's around you. Surely you need some TIME to reflect on that. Short attentionspan is a bad thing .4 .. This film is about love. The fact that they are shown having sex makes them real persons with real bodies not some film characters. Sex is an escape from the world around them and I don't think it's too much too explicit or some nonsense like that. It's so hard to have a film with sex it it that's not trivial! This is a masterpiece by this fact alone.The persons who though up these arguments took the main strengths of the film and complained about them. This for me it's proof enough that they didn't understand this film or that the film didn't struck a single chord in their soul. Short attention span is the main plague of films now and the lack of it is the reason the french make such great films! Please try to see it again and not in a hurry. It's not light cinema! It's great cinema!".

It's an exploration of the work of the senses not so much a story with a plot. Therefore it is unique in the history of cinema. Whereas other movies featuring a young girl and an older lover are mostly playful ironic or simply intent on breaking a taboo this movie brings an ode to the senses themselves in a much more subtle way.Difficult as this may be Annaud brings us as close as we can get to the atmosphere of love in a colonial and exotic setting. This delicate setting with its many contradictions race gender age adds to the experience. A young girl who explores her own sexuality couldn't dream of a more wellsuiting context. In fact the colony herself is a major character in the movie the colony with her mighty Mekong River her smells and colors her strange sounds and her enigmatic people.On a more metaphoric level the Colony represents a temporary space a place where Western people only pass through a space that cannot be owned forever a place of love and hate just like the lovers' relationship. And in the end the lovers have to go their own way just like the colonialists have to leave the colony they love.The movie is poetically slow and at times becomes an almost ritual repetition of a single act. Precisely therein lies its 'dramatic content'. Add the beautiful cinematography and you have a nice exercise in film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lover is not just a movie it is sensual breathtaking and intimate sometimes bordering on voyeurism. From the outset the scenery directs the action taking the viewer into a world of a young girl and a Chinese man that embark on a doomed love affair in 1929 Colonial Vietnam. Jane March plays the young 15 year old 'girl'. That is all we know of her as she stands on the front of a ferry cruising the Mekong Dekta. She dressed in a cheap short sleeved dress straw hat and high heels and heavily rouged lips that belie her age. She is on her way back to a girls' school in Saigon when she is first 'seen'. The second time she is summoned to a black sedan where she meets The Chinaman smouldering Tony Leung sitting in the back seat of the car attired elegantly in a tailored white suit. He offers her a ride to her school where a simple impulsive kiss on the window leads to a frustrating passionate love story laced with cultural misunderstandings. This movie is fueled right from the start with sexual tension. March and Leung are perfect as the two nameless leads who are taken on this journey of first discovery through latent but palpable lust then finally to ruin. She cannot love him and he cannot commit without betraying his family's honour and heritage. She will be nothing but his lover never his wife. I felt a deep sadness for these people their isolation evident as they silently scream for their individuality in a world that will not accept either of them together or apart. JeanJacques Annaud has done for The Lover what he did for The Bear and The Name of the Rose gave us characters that are haunting and memorable. The cinematography here is sparse pale so as to give the story a poignant futility. Gabriel Yared's score is sensual almost brutally so as these characters' bodies come together while their souls never connect. This movie is not for the faint of heart. It IS sexual. The scenes border on artful pornography. Annaud never quite goes that far as to allow it to delve into hardcore but the scenes are hard to watch. They are so intimate that we believe the leads are making love before our eyes...but we are compelled to watch transfixed by the intimacy. Throughout we are reminded of the toll the affair has had on the young girl with the tremulous grosgrain narration of the always excellent Jeanne Moreau. She underscores the events and emotions of the sometimes perversely detached lead character. The Lover is based partly on the life of Marguerite Duras of whom March's young girl is almost a deadringer. Annaud imbues this story with every emotional nuance forcing us to use its characters as a mirror of our own hidden desires. This is a movie that made me long for what is hidden deep within my secret heart...and a little afraid of what I might find there.".

It stuck.That image is the one which is used in the promotion and presumably is what the filmmaker considers its essence the 15 year old girl in defiantly nonschool clothes with an incongruous man's hat on the ferry. She is observing and consciously observed. It is we who observe her and enjoy her sensuality then and later just as the Chinese observer does. He is our surrogate defining the strange situation of a being in the wrong place Chinese being then more of a 'minority' in Vietnam than Europeans.Exotic ordinariness. Emerging awarenesses as justification for being. No more revelling in existence. Transition as destination.It is odd how charged this one image is and how competently it justifies the whole project. Just as the lover is left puzzling why so are we. So are we and the fact that no easy answer appears is why this sticks so.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

She cannot hope to be with him..she is also bound by social customs but also in not being able to give her heart to him and these elements transfer over to their affair..They are tender at times but cruel at others. It is the yin and yang of passion...the pleasure and the pain! In the end they learn the tragic truth of it..the Yin and Yang of love and passion..the pleasure and the pain.

This is pretty obvious to me that the critics are unaware of or have ignored the story behind the story and the message the author and the film director are trying to convey.Just because this movie contains scenes that are erotic with nudity and passionate it does not mean that the film is pornographic. Critics need to be aware of this fallacy. Moreover critics have ignored the historical background of life in Frenchruled Vietnam and the general French attitude towards the Vietnamese and the Chinese in the 1920s and 1930s.To paraphrase another fan of this movie who reasoned that if this film is a porn it would not has been nominated for an Oscar and won an award from the mainstream French Cinema. I would add it would be totally ignored bythem.One of my favourite erotic scenes in the movie was when the girl gradually and teasingly pursed her lips on the glass window of the limousine for her lover.Another favourite of mine is the scene in the limo showing Jane and Tony slowly and hesitatingly held hands together without looking at each other.The camera works that captured these two moments were extremely well done. These two scenes were so erotic my heart nearly skips a beat. To do justice to this movie one really needs to watch it to believe what I have just described here.The Story This is a movie about a teenage girl who was physically and emotionally abused by her mother and elder brother. She felt unable to control her predicament.She sought solace and control through her passionate affair with a wealthy Chinese man actor Tony Leung from Cholon.The affair is tragic from the beginning because of the crosscultural conflict experienced by the two lovebirds.On one hand there was the French social restrictions about relationships with the inferior race of Vietnamese and the Chinese. On the other hand it was about the Chinese tradition of arranged marriages.The question is Did she eventually love him?Here are the words of Duras Among all the other nights upon nights the girl had spent that one on the boat....when it happened the burst of Chopin.... There wasn't a breath of wind and the music spread all over the dark boat like a heavenly injunction whose import was unknown like an order from God whose meaning was inscrutable. And the girl started up as if to go and kill herself in her turn throw herself in her turn into the sea and afterwards she wept because she thought of the man from Cholon and suddenly she wasn't sure she hadn't loved him with a love she hadn't seen because it had lost itself in the affair like water in the sand and she rediscovered it only now through this moment of music......By the way the Chopin music did played in the movie.Review by MovieManiac1991".

The story about the initially mainly sexual relationship that  after separation  turns out to be genuine affection is touching and has some interest with the ongoing family conflict and the cultural differences between the lovers.  The sex scenes are absolutely justified in content as well as in length I guess I saw a modified version though since sex is an essential part of the story.  The acting is good enough  especially Jane March needs to be mentioned she gives a credible performance of a teenage girl in love and in trouble.  The development of the plot appears logical the conflict unfolds in a credible way and for instance the atmosphere during the dinner with the girl's family is palpable.  The scenery of colonial Vietnam seems to be caught very well and the cinematography and the melancholic music are excellent.  One of the final scenes  the farewell when the ship leaves the port with the girl  is very moving and unforgettable.  Overall I think this is above average if not even great cinema.  Some people apparently did not tolerate the sex scenes but instead of saying so they try to deny any artistic value of that movie and without any good reasons.  It may very well be that Maguerite Duras the author of the novel which I did not read did not like the movie that she had something else in mind that this movie failed to express  but overall this film is as good that it has its own value independent of the novel.".

This movie is a beautiful recreation of near '30's Colonial Vietnam i don't know how accurate but i was convinced the look of the movie can be summed up with that one scene near the start where the camera pans up on the girl and shes describing her wardrobe her cabaret shoes dress and unique mans hat that no other woman Vietnamese or otherwise is wearing at the time you get an impression of subtle defiance from her that only expands and endures as the movie courses on. The cinematography of 'living' in this movie really draws you in be it when they're washing out the house dancing in the restaurant or my favorite scene when the car overheats and the young brother gets out with a watering pail to get some water from the gutter it just made me smile all these scenes are elevated by the camera work and positioning of the characters. Anyways the dialogue is amazing like when the girl says my brother smokes too much to which the Chinaman replies too too much i just thought that was so naturally clever or when she first makes love to the Chinaman and describes him part of him as the golden novelty this is a prime example of how this movie unlike so many others elevates the eroticism within it to something more than 'porn with a plot' as many other erotic movies seem to be the focus of this movie is the story it just happens to be erotic not that i'm complaining and if all that wasn't enough to get you renting or buying underlying and driving the plot is the brilliant and engaging retrospective narrative by an older Duras Author of The Lover. This movie is a must see it is both sensual and heartbreaking and well worth your time.".

	schema:headline " A French nymphet in a man's fedora thought it wasn't love";
	schema:reviewBody "This exquisitely rendered film adaptation of Margaret Duras' international bestseller weaves a bittersweet story about the most unlikely love affair.An extraordinary love story unfolds in Saigon in French colonial Vietnam in the late twenties. The two protagonists whose budding liaison we follow throughout this melancholic French film are polar opposites. Cultural prejudice the age disparity class difference racial divide dysfunctional family a prearranged marriage a young girl in a man's fedora all stand in the way of the most of elusive of humane pursuits  love. This is a love affair par excellence about love of a very special sort the only kind of love that is forever etched in the lovebirds hearts  the love that leaves both lovers brokenhearted.Veteran filmmaker JeanJacques Annaud Quest For Fire In The Name Of The Rose The Bear gives the stellar screen adaptation of the book  by his frequent collaborator screen writer Gerard Brach  a de luxe treatment. He seamlessly translates the superb screen play to the silver screen in the most effective fashion much like celebrated rendering of Mario Puzzo's 'Godfather' by another cinematic master  Francis Ford Copolla. Both directors have miraculously elevated source materials pop culture international literary phenomenons into cinema classics. This memorable feature is a crowning achievement in the career of an acclaimed artist with imposing international stature.That this flawless cinematic gem has not gotten prominence it deserves on our shores is a lamentable testament to our puritanical society and the crudeness of populist taste. Irrespectful of high cinematic achievements the two subgenres will always encounter sharp scissors of our merciless and hypocritical moral and cultural guardians. Our censors will inevitable relish at any 'sexually explicit' controversial love story that is left of mainstream coffeetable pornography in our righteous film critic's parlance and for different reasons altogether at a serious probing insightful and provocative political picture. These are exactly the two film arenas in which foreign filmmakers are in a league way above the common and the mediocre the two American leagues tackling the respective subgenres.There is a seduction scene at the beginning of this luminous picture that is as sophisticated and erotic as anything written by Stendhal right from a classical French novel. This extremely rich masterfully shot explosively potent scene brimming with subtle eroticism is the meeting in the back seat of a car of suppressed mature desire and the sweet dread of carnal awakening of a nymphet.There are numerous scenes of striking beauty poetically realized throughout the movie but one stands out.

The most exciting scenes end at just the right moments when the viewers anticipation is at its highest. They are always followed by a lingering or tracking shot of magnificent lyrical beauty.Seldom is a closeup as eloquent as it is in the hands of Robert Fraisse the film's Oscar nominated cinematographer he had a misfortune of running against Robert Redford's 'A River Runs Through It. We learn more about the character of The Young Girl from a single protracted closeup of the girl than we learn about characters in many other movies during the whole first act. By the time his camera reaches her old cabaret shoes slowly lingering down her pigtail pausing on a ribbon the essence of her innocent persona is halfrevealed. The whole film is spectacularly shot a picturesque collage of neverending breathtaking images elegantly composed and framed with a finesse full of visual majesty.The film main conflict surprisingly stems from the young girl's a priori approach to the blossoming relationship. Her determination to keep the affair strictly sexual could have come out contrived were it not for the grim circumstances of her family life that had her mature before her time. Not inherent to her age group the determination was way ahead of her times. It would take decades for such attitude to approach mainstream with female liberation movement which emerged in the late sixties.On the opposite end her rich Chinese lover is bound to marry according to his father's wishes and to the tradition of arranged marriages. Born into riches with no profession nor any discernible talents in his own words he is nobody without his money. Seemingly a perfect setup for a guiltyfree sexual liaison gets complicated when the Chinese bon vivant falls in love with the young girl and meets the torments of unrequited love.'The Lover' is a cinematic gem of rare color and unforgettable spark the love story of singular beauty and distinct resonance.".

	onyx:emotionText "This exquisitely rendered film adaptation of Margaret Duras' international bestseller weaves a bittersweet story about the most unlikely love affair.An extraordinary love story unfolds in Saigon in French colonial Vietnam in the late twenties. The two protagonists whose budding liaison we follow throughout this melancholic French film are polar opposites. Cultural prejudice the age disparity class difference racial divide dysfunctional family a prearranged marriage a young girl in a man's fedora all stand in the way of the most of elusive of humane pursuits  love. This is a love affair par excellence about love of a very special sort the only kind of love that is forever etched in the lovebirds hearts  the love that leaves both lovers brokenhearted.Veteran filmmaker JeanJacques Annaud Quest For Fire In The Name Of The Rose The Bear gives the stellar screen adaptation of the book  by his frequent collaborator screen writer Gerard Brach  a de luxe treatment. He seamlessly translates the superb screen play to the silver screen in the most effective fashion much like celebrated rendering of Mario Puzzo's 'Godfather' by another cinematic master  Francis Ford Copolla. Both directors have miraculously elevated source materials pop culture international literary phenomenons into cinema classics. This memorable feature is a crowning achievement in the career of an acclaimed artist with imposing international stature.That this flawless cinematic gem has not gotten prominence it deserves on our shores is a lamentable testament to our puritanical society and the crudeness of populist taste. Irrespectful of high cinematic achievements the two subgenres will always encounter sharp scissors of our merciless and hypocritical moral and cultural guardians. Our censors will inevitable relish at any 'sexually explicit' controversial love story that is left of mainstream coffeetable pornography in our righteous film critic's parlance and for different reasons altogether at a serious probing insightful and provocative political picture.

Jane March is shining in this movie and the role is just perfect for her despite the multiple soft core scenes she was involved in. The movie is based more on the very youth of the feminine character oh her sexual development on the taboo customs of that time society on the fragility and undeveloped feelings of the feminine character and on the maturity and steadiness of the masculine one. If you have the chance to watch this movie when you are at least in your 30's you will have the chance to see more deeply inside the fragility of both characters and pay attention less on the sexual part of it. Generally it's wonderfully made and it is worth watching.".

At first he was infatuated and wanted to love her then he realized she was using him and acting like a child and decided to just use her and not get involved emotionally then he becomes jealous with her and wants to sorta control her because he loves her even though he's trying to fight it.

	schema:reviewBody "There are three interconnected themes in this film an impossible love story in the colonial environment of preWWII Vietnam relationships and the constant crossing of boundaries and borders.I was rather disappointed while reading more than a dozen American reviews of this film penned by professional film critics. Only one reviewer seemed to be knowledgeable about the author and the position she occupies in the world's literature. These film critics concentrated somewhat obsessively on the sexual scenes which take a total of nine minutes or 8 of the film's duration. In my opinion these movie reviews are the result of the genetic puritan attitude that prevails in the American society. Or maybe the reviewers were asleep during most of the film and only woke up for the good parts? The Lover has nothing to do with pornography. It depicts an intense passion where of course sex plays an integral role. Annaud had no choice but to include this aspect of the story and he did it in a meaningful and artistic way.The Chinaman has the advantage of being older male and wealthy but he is Chinese  and she is white. He has lived it up in Paris where he had many liaisons. He is an expert at lovemaking. But he is also vulnerable as an only child orphaned by his mother dominated by his father. The Chinaman uses love and lovemaking to shore himself up against his insecurity. He is the archetypal romantic lover talking to her of love death and eternity. His love while passionfilled and pleasurable is also an agony and physical torment. He is not at all the dominant forceful seducer whom she craves. However we must be careful to remember that we see his desire for the girl only through the narrator's subjective memories.By contrast we know the feelings of the girl even though time has certainly altered her memories. Right from the start the girl refuses to use the language of love denying the romantic concept of being his only love. The girl's desire for the Chinaman's body is firmly grounded in sensuality as well as in curiosity but the first appeal she feels upon meeting him on the ferry is for his wealth his luxurious car his diamond ring. However as she sails back to France we learn that she comes to the realization that she may have loved him all along.As the affair progresses other figures creep into the sexual imaginary the young brother the older brother her friend Helen and of course her mother. There is a motherdaughter lovehate relationship. Duras depicts her mother as an unhappy driven woman. She admires her mother's quality of perseverance yet Duras cannot forgive her mother for the life of poverty and degradation nor for her mother's excessive love for her oldest son and apparent failure to love her two younger children.And of course Duras cannot forgive her mother's opposition to her becoming a writer. With her lovemaking the girl experiences a triumphant sense of separation from and superiority over her mother. She is trying to eradicate the mother to escape the stranglehold of their mutual hatred. The daughter's drive toward the lover toward social disgrace and reputation without understanding it herself is to punish the mother.The girls' love affair with a Chinese man is also a giant step toward her liberation from the tyranny of her elder brother. It is somewhat ironical that the older brother's gambling drugaddiction and social marginalization are mirrored in the way her lover spends his days gambling and smoking opium.Finally there is an undercurrent theme which runs throughout the film which is that of boundaries and borders. The film opens with a ferry ride across the Mekong and ends with an ocean crossing signaling the constant crossing of frontiers and borders geographic of course but also racial cultural and sexual. These are confronted and sometimes dissolved as the poor white girl of French parentage meets her wealthy Chinese lover in the Cholon the ill repute Chinese district of Saigon. She a white girl was raised among natives almost as a native. He is a native who experienced the western culture and somehow longs for it.There is also the transitory period of the girl's adolescence between what remains of her childhood and the onset of her womanhood. On the ferry and on the steam liner the girl wears a child's pigtails but she is dressed in women's clothes. The gender roles are somewhat blurred too she wears a woman's dress but also a man's hat in a color that signifies femininity.

	onyx:emotionText "There are three interconnected themes in this film an impossible love story in the colonial environment of preWWII Vietnam relationships and the constant crossing of boundaries and borders.I was rather disappointed while reading more than a dozen American reviews of this film penned by professional film critics. Only one reviewer seemed to be knowledgeable about the author and the position she occupies in the world's literature. These film critics concentrated somewhat obsessively on the sexual scenes which take a total of nine minutes or 8 of the film's duration. In my opinion these movie reviews are the result of the genetic puritan attitude that prevails in the American society. Or maybe the reviewers were asleep during most of the film and only woke up for the good parts? The Lover has nothing to do with pornography. It depicts an intense passion where of course sex plays an integral role. Annaud had no choice but to include this aspect of the story and he did it in a meaningful and artistic way.The Chinaman has the advantage of being older male and wealthy but he is Chinese  and she is white. He has lived it up in Paris where he had many liaisons. He is an expert at lovemaking. But he is also vulnerable as an only child orphaned by his mother dominated by his father. The Chinaman uses love and lovemaking to shore himself up against his insecurity. He is the archetypal romantic lover talking to her of love death and eternity. His love while passionfilled and pleasurable is also an agony and physical torment. He is not at all the dominant forceful seducer whom she craves. However we must be careful to remember that we see his desire for the girl only through the narrator's subjective memories.By contrast we know the feelings of the girl even though time has certainly altered her memories. Right from the start the girl refuses to use the language of love denying the romantic concept of being his only love. The girl's desire for the Chinaman's body is firmly grounded in sensuality as well as in curiosity but the first appeal she feels upon meeting him on the ferry is for his wealth his luxurious car his diamond ring. However as she sails back to France we learn that she comes to the realization that she may have loved him all along.As the affair progresses other figures creep into the sexual imaginary the young brother the older brother her friend Helen and of course her mother. There is a motherdaughter lovehate relationship. Duras depicts her mother as an unhappy driven woman. She admires her mother's quality of perseverance yet Duras cannot forgive her mother for the life of poverty and degradation nor for her mother's excessive love for her oldest son and apparent failure to love her two younger children.And of course Duras cannot forgive her mother's opposition to her becoming a writer. With her lovemaking the girl experiences a triumphant sense of separation from and superiority over her mother. She is trying to eradicate the mother to escape the stranglehold of their mutual hatred. The daughter's drive toward the lover toward social disgrace and reputation without understanding it herself is to punish the mother.The girls' love affair with a Chinese man is also a giant step toward her liberation from the tyranny of her elder brother. It is somewhat ironical that the older brother's gambling drugaddiction and social marginalization are mirrored in the way her lover spends his days gambling and smoking opium.Finally there is an undercurrent theme which runs throughout the film which is that of boundaries and borders. The film opens with a ferry ride across the Mekong and ends with an ocean crossing signaling the constant crossing of frontiers and borders geographic of course but also racial cultural and sexual. These are confronted and sometimes dissolved as the poor white girl of French parentage meets her wealthy Chinese lover in the Cholon the ill repute Chinese district of Saigon. She a white girl was raised among natives almost as a native. He is a native who experienced the western culture and somehow longs for it.There is also the transitory period of the girl's adolescence between what remains of her childhood and the onset of her womanhood. On the ferry and on the steam liner the girl wears a child's pigtails but she is dressed in women's clothes. The gender roles are somewhat blurred too she wears a woman's dress but also a man's hat in a color that signifies femininity. The boarding school in Saigon is home mainly to the abandoned mixedblood daughters of local women and French fathers. The girl has an intimate friendship with Helene Lagonelle which is ambivalent and perhaps sexually charged. The girl is unable to treat the Chinaman with even a modicum of courtesy when she is with her brothers because he is Chinese not white.

I think the spooky atmosphere doesn't translates as well to the small screen.. but it's still a treat. Joan Davis I Married Joan steals the show! She was a physical comedy genius.

	schema:reviewBody "With today being the first of the month that Halloween takes place in I thought I'd devote all the days before All Hallows Eve to various movies of horror suspense or any comedy with a combination of the two. So with that I decided to rewatch Abbott  Costello's Hold That Ghost which I first saw 30 years ago when I was 11 or 12 staying home late Saturday watching TV at midnight. It was my first time that I observed Bud  Lou in liveaction having previously seen them in HannaBarbera's cartoon series when I vacationed the year before in New York City. Anyway I was a little amused at their antics then but now I find them hilarious especially Lou with his constantly getting soooo excited when he's scared! Unlike the previous two moviesBuck Privates and In the Navythey're not the only ones getting big laughs. Joan Davis also gets her lion's share in slapstick and facial reactions whether with Costellogotta love their classicalrumba dance skitor by herself when going down the stairs with a ghost behind her. There's also Shemp Howard in an amusing cameo as a soda jerk. And the screenplay by Robert Lees  Fred Rinaldo with additions by A  C's own John Grant also provides some witty banter with the romantic leads Richard Carlson and Evelyn Ankers. By the way while Ms. Davis plays a screamer actress on radio though she rarely does it when actually scared Ms. Ankerswho would spend most of her Universal career in horror flickswould become Queen of the Screamers or Horrors depending on the source as a result of this and subsequent movies. Oh and if you're wondering why musical acts Ted Lewis and The Andrews Sisters appear in the beginning and end well when Universal previewed this movie according to Maxene Andrews when the audience filled the preview cards they asked Where are The Andrews Sisters? as they had enjoyed them previously in Buck Privates. In the Navyand Patty Maxene and LaVerne's participation in itwould be hastily filmed while this haunted house comedy would be temporarily halted. Because of their spots they don't interrupt the flow of the comedy which includes such classic bits like the Moving Candle Changing Room and Lou's adlibs with a stuffed moose's head. All in all Hold That Ghost is a most enjoyable Abbott  Costello movie with great contributions from Joan Davis.".

At that time the films were all Realart Releases but it seemed as if they were new productions. When AC meet Frankenstein That was the first new film I saw AC in 1949.

The only thing I have to add is notice how Joan Davis' ghost on the stairs scene echoes Ted Lewis' Me and My Shadow number.No female comedienne has ever matched Joan Davis' marvelous physical comedy including Lucille Ball in my opinion. However Molly Shannon and Tea Leoni come close occasionally The closing musical number Aurora by the Andrew Sisters is marvelous. Besides Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy it is my favorite of theirs. Patty Andrews is still alive at age 89. Its great that she's still around.".

I still marvel at the exacting details used in all the sets making that tavern look like they filmed the scenes on an actual location rather than a set. I once played the organ in an old eatery that looked almost like that old Forester's Club. Lou's various comical antics are well placed in this film such as the skirmish he has with that pesky outdoor water pump or his encounters with the bedrooms that convert into gambling casinos. I also love the lines Lou had with actor William Davidson who played gangster Moose Matson Chuck asking Moose sarcastically Are you a tough guy? Moose thrusting his face out at Chuck YEAH!!. William's character was a tough gangster type yet he played it as being very tollerant of Lou's innocent character. Joan Davis of the later 1950s I Married Joan is so well matched with Lou and I wish she would have been featured in more of the AC vehicles. As far as the music is concerned I was born in 1947 so I could never really know what the Andrews Sisters were like or what Ted Lewis along with his orchestra were like. Thanks to the magic of time travel through old films I now do and I really like them.".

Breaking away from army duty as BUCK PRIVATES and Naval reserves from IN THE NAVY HOLD THAT GHOST ranks one of their more successful features of the period cleverly mixing comedy with suspense along with classic routines associated with Abbott and Costello some that would be repeated again notably for their other spectacularly comedy in 1948 where they meet Frankenstein. The story opens at the Chez Glamour as Chuck Murray Bud Abbott and Ferdinand Ferdie Jones Lou Costello gas station attendants are seen earning extra money as relief waiters. Patronizing the nightclub is Sidney Moose Manston William B. Davidson a noted gangster and bootlegger going over his last will and testament with Bannister his lawyer Russell Hicks. Charlie Smith Marc Lawrence one of Manston's former hoods has been searching for Manston wanting to collect his cut from the Wellington payroll job. The only clue to the whereabouts of the stolen loot is that Moose kept the money in his head. As for Chuck and Ferdie they foul up their jobs causing Gregory Mischa Auer the headwaiter to have them fired. Meanwhile back at the gas station eight gallons for a dollar!Moose Manston drives in for gas. While servicing the car Ferdie encounters Manston's gun in the front seat that accidentally goes off stirring the attention of a passing police car leading to a car chase with Ferdie and Chuck forced to take the driver's seat as Manston shoots at the cops from the back seat. A bullet hits Moose but before he dies takes out his last will and testament. At the reading of the will at Bannister's office Ferdie and Chuck find that because they were with Moose at the time of his death they inherit his entire fortune which includes his country tavern. Suspecting the stolen money to be hidden somewhere in there Charlie pretends to represent the boys hiring Harry Hoskins Milton Parsons to pose as their driver to take them over to the tavern which they do. On the way Bannister makes some extra money by taking some added riders Professor Jackson Richard Carlson a researcher Norma Lind Evelyn Ankers and Camille Brewster Joan Davis an actress whose scream opens up the Tales of Terror radio program. Arriving at the tavern during a stormy night the passengers disembark Charlie included. After entering Hoskins drives off with their luggage luckily the crew has taken a brown bag of food in with them. Stranded for the night strange things begin to occur Charlie Smith disappears during his search for the Manston money later to be found bound gagged and dead in a closet the arrival and mysterious disappearance of a couple of phony detectives who earlier came in out of the rain a mysterious figure covered in a white sheet roaming through secret panels and spooky noises leading some namely Ferdie to believe the house to be haunted.Abbott and Costello are in fine form here with Costello displaying his comedic talent during several of his frightening moments with familiar stock underscoring heard many times in Universal thrillers through most the 1940s. Comedienne Joan Davis benefits to the story as Costello's counterpart with such notable scenes together including their burlesque dancing to The Blue Danube Waltz their observing the candles placed on the table which he sees moving but she doesn't plus the figure of speeches Costello makes Gone with the wind which causes Davis to ask What wind?. A pity that Costello and Davis never worked together again. They were so funny together. Other highlights include Costello's room changing into a gambling casino every time he places his coat on the movable hook. Richard Carlson the intellectual professor of research and Evelyn Ankers the future scream queen of Universal horror of the 1940s each play it straight to perfection as the secondary romantic couple.Although it's unlikely for a haunted house themed comedy to find time for musical numbers the tunes and night club sequences were actually added in after filming was completed. The soundtrack includes When My Baby Smiles At Me sung by Ted Lewis by Andrew B. Sterling and Harry Von Tilzer Me and My Shadow sung by Lewis Sleepy Serenade sung by The Andrews Sisters by Mort Greene and Lou Singer The Blue Danube comically performed by Lou Costello and Joan Davis in Manston tavern and Aurora sung by The Andrews Sisters by Harold Adamson Maria Logo and Roberto Roberti.

Also going three for three with the comedy duo were The Andrews Sisters and Shemp Howard who previously appeared with the boys in Buck Privates and In the Navy. The film style differs somewhat from the military based films in that Abbott and Costello stay away from the skit routines and go more for the sight gags and one liners.In the story Chuck Murray Bud and Ferdie Jones Lou inherit an abandoned inn from mobster Moose Matson as stated in the will they were with Moose at the time of his demise. Of course Moose's cronies have an interest in the place because the money from his robberies are believed to be hidden there. Moose's assurance that the location of the money is 'in his head' proves to be truer than we realize when first uttered. All of this serves as the basic premise for Bud and Lou to deliver their zany antics in what turns out to be a haunted house replete with a dead body levitating candles and observing ghosts.Adding to the fun of the film is Joan Davis a wonderful foil for Lou's character who has just the right blend of good looks and snappy attitude. Richard Carlson is the nerdy Doctor Jackson who misses all the romantic signals thrown his way by pretty Norma Lind Evelyn Ankers.The opening of Hold That Ghost left me considering whether today's concern with political correctness would have allowed the scene to be made today. Crooner Ted Lewis offers a rendition of 'Me and My Shadow' with a black actor uncredited Ralph Brooks mimicking his movement ostensibly as his 'shadow'. As always The Andrews Sisters are delightfully entertaining though not as animated as in the Service films.After 1941's Hold That Ghost Abbott and Costello didn't venture into another horror type film until 1948's Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein possibly their best comedy and my personal favorite by the boys. But then they really got into high gear with the genre with a host of offerings in which they paired with a number of Universal's characters  the Invisible Man Jekyll and Hyde and The Mummy. All are a treat and come recommended for Abbott and Costello fans.".

But then they really got into high gear with the genre with a host of offerings in which they paired with a number of Universal's characters  the Invisible Man Jekyll and Hyde and The Mummy. All are a treat and come recommended for Abbott and Costello fans.";

	schema:reviewBody "Baazigar is a 1993 Indian Hindi film directed by AbbasMustan. Based on Ira Levin's 1953 novel A Kiss Before Dying.Baazigar at the time it came was a sort of trendsetter mainly for the reason it had an antihero in the lead role thus breaking the conventional image a hero seemed to have.The film shocked its Indian audience with the violation of the standard Bollywood formula which was unexpected.It was one of top 5 highest grossing films of 1993.SHahRuKhan received much critical acclaim and tremendous popularity as this film shot him into prominence Some criticism is due to the way Priya is portrayed as behaving when all secrets are revealed though that is surely a minor point.so coming to the film Khan proved to have a great screen presence as well and was good at almost everything which a Bollywood hero should possess. Right from dancing well to excelling in histrionics and those one or two light comedy scenes King Khan was a treat to watch. Though he went overboard more than a couple of times in the climax it showed his energy boiling n popping inside him and coming out with a blast whenever it required.Kajol was quite effective in her role . Though she was not looking vey gorgeous because of lack of make up and beautiful costumes.Shipla shetty gave decent perforamce on her debut and looked cute.Rakhi was good as usual.dalip tahil also did his job well.The comic portions were genuinely funny.I really enjoyed watching.Johny lever was very popular comedian at that time and one of Abbasmustan favorites.Since Khiladi the brothers have cast Johnny Lever in every single one of their movies except Naqaab.The music of movie was superhit of that time and as a result bagged 2 filmfare awards in music department of total of 4.Anu Malik was at his very best there.Movie's various songs rocked the chart for several weeks.At the end i will recommend it to everyone specially for srk fans.I know if u watch it today you may find it somewhat old awkward hair cut and dressing sensedancingetcbut remember when it was released i.e 1993 so from that point of view it was excellent.Rest Its Success Speaks itself.A must watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Baazigar' is probably the first commercial Hindi film that centres around the antihero. It 'loosely' rips off 'A Kiss Before Dying'. It's not a scene by scene copy and the director duo did smartly Indianize it unfortunately a lot of it is too Bollywood e.g. the 'dishum dishum' fight sequences. To an extent as a film it is better than 'A Kiss Before Dying' as the twists are changed to appeal to the Indian audience. The songs are pleasant but some of the tunes are ripped off too. The whole comedy track featuring Johnny Lever and co deserve to be fastforwarded. What mainly makes 'Baazigar' more watchable than it's 'original' source is its performances. The film belongs to Shahrukh Khan who does his first antihero act and blows the audience away with a strong balanced performance of a multilayered character. Kajol is lovably hyper in the beginning but she shows her character's gradual maturity with grace. Shilpa Shetty gives a stunning debut act. Rakhee plays the typical distressed mother again. Johnny Lever is irritating as always. The rest of the cast do not impress much either. Technically the film could have used a lot of improvement but one should keep in mind that this is a film of the early 1990s. The end sequence is a disappointment and it sadly brings the film down by a notch but on the whole 'Baazigar' is enjoyable to watch. In spite of the plentiful plot holes there are some fine moments like the scenes where Ajay manipulates Seema Priya discovering the truth about her sister Priya confronting Ajay...Even though one knows what happens in the end there's something about the film that makes you sit through it.".

It was the first Shah Rukh Khan film I've seen and that is how I liked him and I still do although he played a villain in the film. Baazigar is the most intelligent revenge thriller I have ever seen even comparing to any Hollywood movie because it is directed by AbbasMustan and no one makes better thrillers than them. They are simply one of my most favourite directors and I have always liked their films they are completely unforgettable like Daraar Ajnabee Humraaz Aitraaz 36 China Town and Naqaab.The story is beyond fantastic about Ajay Shah Rukh Khan who steals the hearts of Seema Shilpa Shetty and Priya Kajol the daughters of his greatest enemy Madan Chopra Dilip Tahil. Years ago Madan Chopra snatched away Ajay's family business and property. Now Ajay is grown up and has come back to avenge the death of his father and baby sister. But Ajay didn't plan on falling in love with one of chopra's daughters. Will he forsake all for his love? Or will he forsake his love for the sake of his family? This blockbuster hit will definitely keep you riveted to your seat. It is simply SRH's and AbbasMustan's best film ever. Shilpa Shetty was introduced but also SRK and Kajol have appeared for the first time together and they are a landmark couple of Bollywood. The movie also has excellent comedy mainly by Johnny Lever that is still funny. I have seen it more times than any other film and is about 15 years old and I still love it. Music is also good and the best songs are Baazigar oh Baazigar  Yeh Kali Kali Aankhen.".

His mother is so traumatised she loses her mind. Ajay's anger and thirst for revenge is justified. As an adult he plots Chopra's downfall and Chopra's two daughters are his tools. SRK is so convincing you forget he's not really Ajay. Some of the scenes make you grab your seat and go Wow. Kajol is as usual a dynamic performer. Shilpa is OK. Johnny Lever must be one of the few people who can crack jokes in a serious film and not make you tear your hair out in frustration. His Babu Lal is an effective comic relief.The songs are not too bad. If you've heard Anu Malik's previous songs you'll realize that Baazigar has a number of rehashed tracks. Typical of Anu Malik no? Overall this film deserves at least an 8. I don't understand why its rating is low in here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Baazigar is a wonderful suspense thriller made by Abbas Mastan but the real reason it is wellknown today is quite clear and it's called Shahrukh Khan. Disregarding its unoriginality the film is extremely entertaining and interesting more towards the second half. In the first half the point is a bit unclear and the film does not flow well but the film takes a major plot twist after an hour or so when we get to see a rather shocking scene which is completely unexpected and is the film's most drastic turn. Following this scene it starts getting increasingly thrilling with inflaming and unusual proceedings and great suspense. I appreciated the film for its good script and for its loyalty to the general Hindi film style despite a very distinct and innovative formula but I would still delete several comic scenes which are unnecessary and at times even pathetic. The film quite clearly belongs to Shahrukh Khan who skillfully displays something very disturbing within his personality. It is a very balanced performance and Khan successfully portrays the many sides of his character whether it's the simple guy whose pain motivates him to take revenge the romantic hero or the psychopathic murderer. Kajol is splendid in a performance that is both natural and intense. She comes across as a very brave and smart girl. Shilpa Shetty gives a brilliant debut performance and she is hot!. Raakhee is typecast as the suffering mother who loses her mental sanity and she does it well. Johnny Lever is at times hilarious and at times unbearable Dalip Tahil does not impress much and Siddharth is adequate but he too is a bit annoying in some scenes.Anu Malik's soundtrack is very good Baazigar O Baazigar is lovely Kitaben Bahut Si is wonderful Ae Mere Humsafar is melodious and Yeh Kaali Kaali Aankhen is too cool. Overall Baazigar is an extremely enjoyable flick. While the first half is a bit boring involving all the possible Bollywood masala including action romance and silly jokes the second half enjoys a fantastic development of story involving the most unconventional moves a Hindi film could have at that time. Towards the end the film gets to be even more intriguing. A very sad flashback is followed by an unpredictable ending which is heartbreaking yet satisfying. The final verdict is therefore highly positive. I recommend.".

In the first half the point is a bit unclear and the film does not flow well but the film takes a major plot twist after an hour or so when we get to see a rather shocking scene which is completely unexpected and is the film's most drastic turn. Following this scene it starts getting increasingly thrilling with inflaming and unusual proceedings and great suspense. I appreciated the film for its good script and for its loyalty to the general Hindi film style despite a very distinct and innovative formula but I would still delete several comic scenes which are unnecessary and at times even pathetic. The film quite clearly belongs to Shahrukh Khan who skillfully displays something very disturbing within his personality. It is a very balanced performance and Khan successfully portrays the many sides of his character whether it's the simple guy whose pain motivates him to take revenge the romantic hero or the psychopathic murderer. Kajol is splendid in a performance that is both natural and intense. She comes across as a very brave and smart girl. Shilpa Shetty gives a brilliant debut performance and she is hot!. Raakhee is typecast as the suffering mother who loses her mental sanity and she does it well. Johnny Lever is at times hilarious and at times unbearable Dalip Tahil does not impress much and Siddharth is adequate but he too is a bit annoying in some scenes.Anu Malik's soundtrack is very good Baazigar O Baazigar is lovely Kitaben Bahut Si is wonderful Ae Mere Humsafar is melodious and Yeh Kaali Kaali Aankhen is too cool. Overall Baazigar is an extremely enjoyable flick. While the first half is a bit boring involving all the possible Bollywood masala including action romance and silly jokes the second half enjoys a fantastic development of story involving the most unconventional moves a Hindi film could have at that time. Towards the end the film gets to be even more intriguing. A very sad flashback is followed by an unpredictable ending which is heartbreaking yet satisfying. The final verdict is therefore highly positive. I recommend.";

So apart from the awesome cast the direction of the movie takes it to the next level. Then obviously comes the concept.

It is about a man seeking to avenge his destroyed family by dragging the guilty to a similar fate. Now as we know Revenge is sweet this movie offers a lot more than what you bargain for.

	schema:reviewBody "Baazigar can correctly be regarded as a classic of Hindi cinema for three major reasons. The primary reason that Baazigar works so well as a movie is that the expectation for Hindi films especially romances as this one first appears to be is for the good guy to beat up the bad guys and yet Shah Rukh Khan here assays a malevolently likable character who steals the scene as well as our hearts all while playing a psychotic killer. In all fairness Shahrukh's Ajay Varma is given a fairly sympathetic back story to not completely dehumanize him and yet the victims of his aggression often seem to be innocent and unaware of his background. Secondarily the performance by Kajol as the younger sister of Shahrukh's first victim is so heartfelt and genuine that you could swear that she had been acting for decades. In addition her chemistry with Shahrukh Khan's character leaves the viewer in the unenviable position of wishing the best for these starcrossed lovers even while fully knowing the evil that Ajay has done and plans yet to do to Kajol's Priya. Finally the action and fight scenes depicted in the film while definitely cheesy by todays much more bloated standards are all fairly well choreographed to give true emotion. Unlike the Dabaangs and Rowdy Rathore's of today where visual effects create superhumans out of corrupt cops and serve primarily to distort the laws of physics AbbasMustan have managed to capture so much raw emotion through the fight scenes on a very personal level. This is not to say that Baazigar is without faults. Despite the wonderful acting by both Shahrukh Khan and Kajol we are never quite sure and this actually may be a strength instead of a weakness but that is up to interpretation what Ajay's intentions are for Priya or whether after learning about his true character and so much more within the last 10 minutes of the film Priya still loves Ajay in the end. Also while much of the acting is good some of Shahrukh's scenes especially this early in his career are fairly hammy and overdone. In addition Shilpa Shetty's portrayal of the classic abla naari while decently portrayed does very little to garner support for her character. All in all if you are looking for a pure emotional roller coaster of a film Baazigar is definitely up your alley.

	schema:reviewBody "Baazigar is inspired by the Matt Dillon flick  A Kiss Before Dying which itself is a remake of the 1956 nearnoir classic of the same name. The film revolves around 2 sisters Shilpa Shetty and Kajol and the men that come into their lives.  Both men are played by Shahrukh Khan so you can imagine the complications that will create.  The first one's the typical Indian college student perfect grades dead father sick mother......The second one is a race car driver the cool one.  Each has his own reasons for being with the girl and it's these motives and their repercussions that form the crux of the film.  Now if you LOVE Bollywood movies then stay away from this one.  There is no happy resolution or songs in the Swiss Alps or Designer Clothing for the hero.  In fact the wardrobe and makeup departments seem to be on strike during this movie.  But that's really a blessing because the actors' natural look complements the film's dark tone.  Baazigar is a twisted tale of revenge with much tasteless violence so you wouldn't want your hero cleaning blood off his GAP shirts every ten minutes of course we wouldn't have such concerns if Salman had accepted this role.  That reminds me the acting in this movie is ...... well it varies.  The supporting cast doesn't impress  Rakhee's okay Shetty's pretty weak as are the two fathers and the inspector is just sad.  ON the other hand Kajol gives a sincere performance that's a hint of things to come.  She breathes life and brings restraint to a character that's usually butchered by overthetop Indian actresses who substitute crying for acting.  She's only 17 or 18 but her confidence and chemistry with the Rukhster are quite evident.  But this is Shahrukh's movie.  After Salman wisely turned it down Shahrukh saw this as his big chance and capitalized.  From studying for his exams and manipulating Shilpa Shetty to racking up the body count and bringing down the house with Kaali Kaali Aankhen the man held nothing back.  He was still an actor at this point and played the dual role well.  You're always able to tell which character's onscreen.  This movie is like Darr  which was released a few months later  in the sense that whether you like it or not has nothing to do with the film itself and everything to do with the lead's performance.  The film could have spent more time in the editing room as many portions drag and some scenes feel flat due to the aforementioned lack of funding.  In the end Baazigar may or may not be good filmaking but it's a must for Shahrukh fans.".

	schema:headline " Hopelessly overrated movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Baazigar was suggested to me as a great example of Shahrukh Khan playing a bad guy and generally as one of the better Bollywood movies from the nineties. Although I've seen worse I can't help being disappointed. Baazigar is not a good movie at all.First of all the movie is way too long for such a thin scenario. The first hour is so boring that I had to fight the temptation to switch it off and watch something else instead. Knowing that Bollywood movies can be utterly boring in their first half and then completely smashing in the second I decided to wait a bit and give it a chance. And rightly so because something suddenly starts happening when Ajay throws his girlfriend Seema off a roof. Unfortunately the next hour is equally boring and only the third hour of the movie is worth the effort somehow.Now I am not a fan of Shahrukh Khan at all but I have to admit that in Baazigar he excels. I have seen him play bad guys more than once sometimes better sometimes worse but the psycho in Baazigar is undoubtedly his best creation in the field. It is good to see him in his older work long before he became the professional superstar he is today the Hugh Grant of the Indian screen.And that is about the only positive thing that can be said about Baazigar. All the other roles... completely flat characters and generally poor acting. Granted Kajol does her best to make from her little interesting part whatever she can but Shilpa Shetty's performance as Seema is more than embarrassing one would wonder why she was ever allowed to play in a movie again. Equally irritating are the socalled comic elements in the movie as usual centered around a Johnny Lever who keeps shouting jumping around and trying to be funny. Perhaps there is something about Indian humour that I cannot grasp but in my perception this kind of breaks are just silly annoying and definitely not funny.The idea of the movie is not bad but the resulting scenario is weak and full of holes. The little boy yelling for revenge at the beginning had better been left out. After all it's obvious that this is the young Ajay who else could it be? Without that scene Ajay suddenly throwing Seema off the roof would have come as a total surprise. Instead as soon as they find themselves on the roof we know what will happen. Sure the roof scene works anyway but not as strongly as it could. A missed opportunity for a surprise like in Fanaa. Anyway I don't quite understand WHY he had to kill Seema in the first place except for the fact that it was a bad actress playing a hopeless role. After all Ajay's purpose was taking over Madan's company just like Madan had once done to Ajay's father. What then was the need for killing his daughter as well as two other innocent people? He wanted to take away everything from Madan including his family you say? Okay fine but if so why didn't he kill Priya as well? This is not the only thing I find hard to cope with. Take Priya for example. She makes a horrible entrance as an unsympathetic nasty spoiled and arrogant bitch. Five minutes later she suddenly turns out a nice and sweet dream girl and stays like that till the end of the movie. Why oh why? Or take Ajay's mother. She has been in a heavy shock for many years she hardly speaks does not remember who is who etc. And then just before the end of the movie she just hears Madan's voice and whooooops within less than a minute she becomes a completely normal person who remembers everything recognises everybody and speaks normally... as if nothing had ever happened.And then the finale another example of bad script writing. The story could have gained a little credibility if Ajay had remained a psycho until his very end. Sure he had his reasons we knew that from the very beginning. However in the last minutes of the movie he suddenly becomes a knight of justice essentially a good guy with a more than human face. How can one possibly buy it that near the end everybody greatheartedly forgives him? Even Priya appears to forget with surprising ease that this is the same guy who killed her beloved sister and two other innocent people in cold blood. As if that had just been a minor error on his part.All in all a bad movie from almost every point of view. Shahrukh Khan's work is excellent but not enough to save it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Baazigar was suggested to me as a great example of Shahrukh Khan playing a bad guy and generally as one of the better Bollywood movies from the nineties. Although I've seen worse I can't help being disappointed. Baazigar is not a good movie at all.First of all the movie is way too long for such a thin scenario. The first hour is so boring that I had to fight the temptation to switch it off and watch something else instead. Knowing that Bollywood movies can be utterly boring in their first half and then completely smashing in the second I decided to wait a bit and give it a chance. And rightly so because something suddenly starts happening when Ajay throws his girlfriend Seema off a roof. Unfortunately the next hour is equally boring and only the third hour of the movie is worth the effort somehow.Now I am not a fan of Shahrukh Khan at all but I have to admit that in Baazigar he excels. I have seen him play bad guys more than once sometimes better sometimes worse but the psycho in Baazigar is undoubtedly his best creation in the field. It is good to see him in his older work long before he became the professional superstar he is today the Hugh Grant of the Indian screen.And that is about the only positive thing that can be said about Baazigar. All the other roles... completely flat characters and generally poor acting. Granted Kajol does her best to make from her little interesting part whatever she can but Shilpa Shetty's performance as Seema is more than embarrassing one would wonder why she was ever allowed to play in a movie again. Equally irritating are the socalled comic elements in the movie as usual centered around a Johnny Lever who keeps shouting jumping around and trying to be funny. Perhaps there is something about Indian humour that I cannot grasp but in my perception this kind of breaks are just silly annoying and definitely not funny.The idea of the movie is not bad but the resulting scenario is weak and full of holes. The little boy yelling for revenge at the beginning had better been left out. After all it's obvious that this is the young Ajay who else could it be? Without that scene Ajay suddenly throwing Seema off the roof would have come as a total surprise. Instead as soon as they find themselves on the roof we know what will happen. Sure the roof scene works anyway but not as strongly as it could. A missed opportunity for a surprise like in Fanaa. Anyway I don't quite understand WHY he had to kill Seema in the first place except for the fact that it was a bad actress playing a hopeless role.

	schema:reviewBody "Baazigar is perhaps the first film that i watched as well as understood as a child. From then it had been one of my favorite films I've ever watched. I remember its promos that was something new in India at that time since before that publicity through promos could have hardly been seen as there were rareley few channels apart from Doordarshan.I loved its story line Abbas Mustan's direction and Shahrukh khan's Kajol's and Shilpa Shetty's performances. Abbas Mustan's direction and screen play at many instances resemble the ones that we used to have in 80's Amitabh Bachhan flicks. Specially Rakhi added to what i say by her typical 'ma' performance. Also I love the film's beginning and what follows before casting like 80's movies. That has too much intensity that initially raises expectations about the film and indulges into the story line and 'what would happen next'. Shahrukh Khan had done a superb job and he takes all sympathy even though giving a full fledged negative performance. This proved his potential as an actor and won him well deserved Filmfare Award. It was because of this film that he became favorite to Yash Chopra which catapulted his career. Kajol and Shilpa Shetty are incidentally my favorite actresses since then Kajol in terms of her attraction and natural performances and Shilpa Shetty in terms of her beauty and leaving a great impact on audience even after doing a relatively small role. Music of the film was great but it is difficult to believe how 'Anu Malik' could give such unforgettable tunes and numbers.Overall a must watch film as i've watched it innumerable times but still won't feel bored if have to watch it again.".

Baazigar had an amazing story super music and some good acting by the starcast. Kajol Shilpa Shettyin her debut movie Dalip Tahil Johnny Lever and Raakhi all did true justice to their characters.But the film belongs to Shah Rukh Khan in his breakthrough performance.You can not take your eyes off him whenever he is on the screen. I as a child use to copy his hairstyle his laugh and his expressions.During those times there was no internet so I used to wait for the trailer and songs of this movie on our TV sets. I can not remember how many times I have watched this movie.Such was the impact of Baazigar on me. The movie is first rate with a great repeat value. Some of the scenes which are worthwatching are the Car race Murders committed by SRK in the movie scene where he changes his contact lens SRK's flashback scene in the office Scene where he reveals his true identity to Daleep Tahil and the climax scene. Everything in this movie is perfect to the core. Till date no actor has played the role of an antihero with such a long lasting impression.".

The unconventional script and the brilliant music made this film an instant hit.Ajay SRK and Seema Shilpa Shetty are in love with each other. Vicky SRK again and Priya Kajol fall in love as well. Priya and Seema are sisters. Do both the sisters love twin brothers? Is he the same guy? Is it going to be one of those cheesy love triangles? The intermission which is regarded as on of the most shocking intermission sequences in Indian cinema should answer these questions and raise many more!SRK went out there and did something absolutely different. With Darr ending 1993 for him he was easily the best actor that year. Everyone was talking about the new Baazigar who knew no Darr of trying something new regardless of the Anjaam! Corny I know!   Kajol and Shilpa Shetty did not get as much scope as Shahrukh but both performed super confidently and delivered memorable performances.If Khiladi gave Abbas Mustaan their first hit Baazigar gave them their first Superhit. The talented duo would go on to make many successful suspense thrillers.Apart for the actors and the directors another person benefited hugely from the success of this film. That person was music composer Anu Malik whose struggling days had finally come to an end. With earlier hits that year in Sir and Phir Teri Kahani Yaad Aayi Anu Malik got his first mammoth hit to be followed by many more years of successful music. He received his first Filmfare award and further added to ace composers NadeemShravan's woes. Incidentally NadeemShravan were offered this film. But since Kajol hadn't thanked them for their mediocre score in Bekhudi during the film's release they swore to never compose for a film starring the Bengali actress. Their decision made Anu Malik their biggest competitor.Baazigar is a good film in most respects and even 20 years ahead it is enjoyable. Whether you know the suspense or no watch it! If SRKs act won't entertain you Johnny lever's evergreen comedy will have you in splits again! For first timers this is a great watch.".

With Darr ending 1993 for him he was easily the best actor that year. Everyone was talking about the new Baazigar who knew no Darr of trying something new regardless of the Anjaam! Corny I know!   Kajol and Shilpa Shetty did not get as much scope as Shahrukh but both performed super confidently and delivered memorable performances.If Khiladi gave Abbas Mustaan their first hit Baazigar gave them their first Superhit. The talented duo would go on to make many successful suspense thrillers.Apart for the actors and the directors another person benefited hugely from the success of this film. That person was music composer Anu Malik whose struggling days had finally come to an end. With earlier hits that year in Sir and Phir Teri Kahani Yaad Aayi Anu Malik got his first mammoth hit to be followed by many more years of successful music. He received his first Filmfare award and further added to ace composers NadeemShravan's woes. Incidentally NadeemShravan were offered this film. But since Kajol hadn't thanked them for their mediocre score in Bekhudi during the film's release they swore to never compose for a film starring the Bengali actress. Their decision made Anu Malik their biggest competitor.Baazigar is a good film in most respects and even 20 years ahead it is enjoyable. Whether you know the suspense or no watch it! If SRKs act won't entertain you Johnny lever's evergreen comedy will have you in splits again! For first timers this is a great watch.";

He is unforgettable here as a nottoobright peasant who suffers an excruciating and hopeless case of unrequited love. And Yves Montand who plays his uncle is flawless like an Olivier as he experiences a very cruel turn of fate. Emmanuelle Bart who plays Manon is very beautiful but she is also strange enough to be believable in an unlikely role as a solitary shepherdess of the hills of Provence. Claude Berri's direction is so perfectly paced so full of attention to detail and so unobtrusive and natural that the film just seems to happen without effort. Nothing fancy just show what needs to be seen no more. Use no more words than necessary but all that are necessary. It's almost like magic how easy it looks. The scene near the end when the blind woman reveals the cruel turn of fate to Papet is exquisite in its simplicity and its effectiveness.In a sense this movie is a throw back an earlier era in cinema when careful attention to the construction of a characterdriven story was the essence of the art.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

By no means in either case should one glance at the movie notes on the reverse side of the video box.Almost nothing can be said safely about Manon without giving away the overall plot or this or that twist or turn. Suffice to explain that Jean concerns an urbanite hunchback who relocates to the Provencal countryside with his wife and daughter intent on raising rabbits. Manon picks up some years after the Jean conclusion with the daughter having grown to young womanhood. More prudish prospective viewers need to know that this will be explicitly evident.This is superb moviemaking. Other reviewers accurately call it a masterpiece. The story line dominates not the acting. Even so Yves Montand continues his excellent performance from Jean and Daniel Auteuil as the unsightly nephew is more impressive after one sees him cleancut and sophisticate in something like Un Coeur en Hiver 1992. Emmanuelle Beart and Hipployte Girardot say very little yet it doesn't detract from their respective essential portrayals. Anyone who becomes a Beart fan is advised to rent Nelly  Monsieur Arnaud 1995.The two movies prequel and sequel work as a team. By virtue of its powerful denouement however Manon of the Spring is the standout of the pair. For the same reason in my opinion it is one of the very best films of the 1980s.".

Galinette Auteuil and his uncle Cesar Montard have greatly prospered from the fresh spring water and their carnations grow well. Galinette begins to turn towards ideas of love and steadily falls for the distant Manon. Meanwhile she has discovered the treachery that once befell her father and begins her plan to uncover the culprits.This follows on from the openended story of Jean de Florette. Time has passed and Manon is now a beautiful young woman. This film will satisfy those who felt the bleak ending of the first film was not satisfying. This sees those who acted in greed receive their deserves. As a conclusion to the story it is satisfactory  the film begins quite relaxed and is quite humorous throughout. However the punishment of both Galinette and Cesar is moving. Cesar's fate is particularly impacting and you feel sorry for him and his greediness.The performances are not as strong as before. In the first film both Montard and Auteuil had set characters to play. Here they are less set and act out their roles rather than their characters. Beart is good as Manon but she is too different in heart from the angel of the first  it's understandable why she has changed but where she was since the last film is not clear it's unlikely that her mother would have left her at the farm or that she would have let her leave to return. But this is a minor complaint over a moving tale of deserves. I would say this rather than revenge  because both Galinette and Cesar bring their pains upon themselves.My only problem with this is that it follows the story of the first film. However to me the first film was more about human nature greed  hope specifically rather than the story of the farmland and the spring. Although the end of Jean de Florette was bleak it was perhaps understandable that things should end that way. That said this is a good conclusion to the story if that's what you want  although as a further look at human nature it doesn't convince as well as the first did.Manon des Sources is a good film that has all the visual beauty of the first film and continues the strong emotive story  as a pair of films they are an excellent piece of work. However for me the first film is so strong in all areas that it leaves too much for the second to live up to.A moving sequel that almost manages to live up to what went before.".

I only wish my French was better so that I could have spent more time watching the great actors rather than reading the subtitles but dubbing would never do. And Manon herself I can well see how she would drive someone mad with love. You don't need subtitles for that. I registered just to vote for this film and I gave it 1010. This along with Taxi have really shown me that French cinema can be so good I'm apprehensive about seeing any more nothing could ever come as close surely? It's one of those few films I've seen where after seeing it you want to see it all over again right away even knowing what happens as the atmosphere and acting really draw you in.

What I find most fascinating about this process is that for many of the students it is their first experience in watching a foreign film with subtitles and initially they are not too receptive to the experience.  But very frequently after having seen Jean de Florette  I show it in first year French they are so anxious to see what happens that they go and rent the sequel on their own and want to discuss it in class.This film and its sequel are studies in human nature in addition to being traveloges of some of the most beautiful countryside in the world.  Some of the observations that the students have made about the characters is that they refer to the land and the water with reverential terms.  The characters' downfalls are brought about usually because of their inability to accept their restrictions.If you want two films to use in a French classroom where the scenery is beautiful the dialogue is usually understandable and the storyline is acceptable to the general public since we all have to answer to the school boards and the administration these are the films to use.  In addition if you haven't seen them and you want to just lose yourself in two remarkable films just for the love of good films these are the ones.".

But the surroundings are yet again superb and brilliantly shot by Bruno Nuyttensome of the shots are so beautiful that it seems like a dream.One setting is gone though and that's the house of the guardian of Manon.The location of that house reminded me a lot to the house of General Makabe Toshiro Mufine in the great adventure movie Kakushi toride no san akunin or The Hidden Fortress by Akira Kurosawa.But stillthat doesn't take away the strength of the images in Manon des Sources.Everything comes to an end in one brilliant scene in which the old lady Delphine played by Yvonne Gamy tells Cesar that the hunchback that he betrayed andin a waykilled was actually his son.This confession is so riveting yet beautifully acted that it doesn't seem too much. It is a righteous ending to a very good 4 hour movie experience wisely cut in two.  910  currently number 96 in my all time top 100 list".

I just find these two films so entrancing in every way. It's drama and tragedy of the highest order without a single ounce of melodrama to spoil its earthy and honest depiction of rural life in France. It is as a friend on IMDb said the ultimate Greek tragedy but in France. It is true that I have never seen tragic irony done so well as as at the end of this film. It's pure filmmaking at its very best set against the most rustic scenery and music one could hope for.I am here speaking on behalf of both films which at this late stage of the calender year are currently my favourites this year. The effectiveness of the ending of Manon is owed in huge part to the way the character of Cesar is built throughout Jean De Florette and so together I give these films a resounding 1010".

It was shot on numerous locations in the Vaucluse department of Provence in the southeast of France and is part of a duo logy which was preceded by Jean De Florette 1986. It tells the story about Manon Cadoret who still lives in the highlands of Provence ten years after her and her mother Aime had to sell their property to Cesar Le Papet Soubeyran and his nephew Ugolin Soubeyran. Manon has become a shepherd girl and lives a quiet life but when she one summer day encounters Ugolin who now is a successful farmer bad memories are awakened. Struck by the now grown up Manon who he has not seen since she was a little girl Ugolin falls head over heels in love with her. But Manon still remembers what he and his uncle did to her family and she has found a way to reveal their secret.Like the first part of this epic story this continuation is subtly and acutely directed by French filmmaker Claude Berri 19342009 and with it's ardent milieu depictions and efficient narrative structure it draws an incessantly engaging portrayal of a young French woman who has been waiting several years to get justice for what happened to her family a decade earlier in time. This reverent sequel from the mid1980s produced by French producers Pierre Grunstein and Alain Poir 19172000 is a coproduction between France Italy and Switzerland and has a powerful score by French composer JeanClaude Petit based on Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi's Italian opera The Force of Destiny 1862 which reinforces the film's atmosphere.Notable for it's wonderful production design by production designer Bernard Vzat and cinematography by French director and cinematographer Bruno Nuytten which is as present here as in the first segment this historical period drama becomes an indepth study of character that examines themes such as family relations faith morality and love and is impelled by Yves Montand Emmanuelle Bart and Daniel Auteuil's compassionate acting performances. A memorable moving and humane film which gained among other awards the Csar Award for best supporting actress Emmanuelle Bart at the 13th Csar Awards in 1987 and the KCFCC Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards in 1988.".

As the movie opens we see a small group of mourners clustered at a graveside. Among the mourners is Addie the dead woman's small daughter. Moses Pray  ostensibly of the Kansas Bible Company  approaches the group as the service concludes and two of the elderly women remark that the child bears some resemblance to him and asks if he might be related. If ever a child needed kin it's now one lady says. With no knowledge of who her father is Addie's only haven is her Aunt's home in St. Joseph Missouri. Having identified himself as a traveling man spreading the Lord's gospel in these troubled times Mose is prevailed upon to deliver the helpless child to her Aunt since he's going that way anyway.

	schema:headline " PAPER MOON refuses to cry.";
	schema:reviewBody "PAPER MOON is one of those films which refuses to age or become dated because as director Peter Bogdanovich claims it was dated when it was released.  It has the look and presence of a film from the Golden Thirties with the panache and style that could only come from the Golden Seventies. That extraordinary decade when the Old Hollywood Studio Machine was being rapidly replaced by the rise of the Artist Filmmaker who were young eager and just out of film school.  A wonderful period of flux when anything could and did happen.  A seminal period in filmmaking where new artists were making important new films which would change Hollywood forever. PAPER MOON is outwardly a period road picture set in the mid 30s about a traveling man named Moze Pray Ryan O'Neil who will play any angle if it means a couple of extra dollars in his pocket.  As the story opens he agrees to escort the daughter of a now deceased lover to her Aunt in Missouri. Slick Moze quickly meets his match in the half pint tough little Addie Loggins Ryan's real life daughter Tatum in her first role.  No sentimental tear jerker here this is a great story which refuses to go down the obvious road of a father reunited with his lost little girl we aren't even sure it's really his daughter.  Little Addie is tough as nails at every turn and a whole lot more savvy than Moze could ever be.  At turn after turn she will outsmart and outmaneuver Moze in a way which is a sheer delight to watch. Tatum O'Neil gives an Oscar caliber performance as little Addie but why she was given a Best Supporting Actress award and not nominated for the Best Actress category one can only wonder.  Madeline Kahn What's Up Doc Blazing Saddles in her second film ever also delivers the goods as Miss Trixie Delight who meets up with the pair and sees her own angle. Everyone is playing some angle in this film and we get to enjoy every minute of it.Shot completely on locations in Kansas and Missouri PAPER MOON sparkles with a richness only capable in black and white.  Cinematographer Lazlo Kovacs is a great camera artist and never better than PAPER MOON where he uses black and white deep focus and those great long takes to its best advantage. To the untrained eye it will just appear very sharp but look closely at each frame and notice that everything is in tack sharp focus from the closest object to far in the distance.  This deep focus is very difficult to achieve correctly especially in the night shots but Kovacs does it so well it is seamless.  Watch for the train station sequence where even the children playing in the background are razor sharp.  This is a look that can only be achieved using black and white to its fullest potential.  New filmmakers take notice.  This is how it's supposed to be done. All this cinematic brilliance would be wasted were it not for the wonderful direction of Bogdanovich. In this his third film he proves that he is a consummate filmmaker who knows how to move the actors and camera in perfect concert.  His craftsmanship of each scene is unmistakable as he brings a fresh and very new approach using Hollywood tricks which are decades old. A lesser director might have used process shots and sets to tell the story but not Bogdanovich.  He shot the entire film in real locations to give it the look and feel of a real thirties road picture.  You can almost smell the wide plains and feel the dust as it comes up to slap you in the face. Notice too how he never resorts to sentimentality to move the story along it is told razor sharp and without tears.  This never more apparent than the final sequence where he pays off the film in grand style.There is only one thing about this film which still baffles me.  Why in the night time hotel sequence toward the end of the film were electric lights everywhere but inside the hotel lobby which was lit entirely with kerosine lamps? Was it to give the look and feel of the period or did the real location use them? Small point but interesting. If like myself the last time you saw PAPER MOON was when it was released in 1973 see it again on DVD and be delighted all over again.  The DVD transfer is marvelous and only serves to heighten its visual appeal.  If you have only seen PAPER MOON on broadcast TV do yourself a favor and see the new DVD for a pleasant surprise.  Without the obligatory broadcast TV commercials pan and scan and dialogue cuts this will appear like a new film seen the way it was supposed to be seen.  And if you have NEVER seen PAPER MOON and harbor some prejudice against black and white films please see this film.  Any preconceived notions against this format will quickly dissolve as it takes you along for a rich ride with Addie and Moze in the only format it could  glorious black and white.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paper Moon has to be one of the finest pieces of American cinema to grace the 70's. Bogdanovich's direction bares a strong resemblance to The Last Picture Show but overall this film is much more satisfying and enjoyable. The Black and White photography gives the film a nostalgic beauty that perfectly complements the Depressionera it attempts to recreate. Also notable is the charming Jazzbased score with a wonderful opening title track reinforcing the film's charm. As good as the story direction and music are however the true stars of the film are the O'Neal twosome. Both bring forth their best performances of their careers and share a chemistry on screen that only a father and daughter could. Ryan O'Neal brings forth a subtle charm as the wisetalking but inept hustler Moses Pray. Tatum however even upstages her father with what has to be the best youth performance in history. She is funny and moving when need be and always charming eliciting laughs many times based solely on her malleable facial expressions. Her showstopping five minute shot no matter how long it took to film proves just how fully Tatum was able to embody little Addie Pray. The movie is always entertaining with never a dull spot with a strong supporting performance by Madeline Kahn to help keep things rolling during the middle. This is a true classic that should be seen by people of all ages I can't recommend it enough!".

Set in Depression era Kansas it is story of the relationship between Addie a smart talking 7 year old and Moses a bible selling con man who might be her father. The on screen chemistry between Ryan and Tatum O'Neal is fantastic. Madeline Kahn is great as a side show floosey they pick up along the way and she almost steals the show! Filmed in Kansas and Missouri director Peter Bogdonavich used local people in cameo roles which adds to the authentic feel of the film. Also to the director's credit this film may be one the best to portray 1930's America. All in all Paper Moon is full of great characters and a fine story line. On a personal note I saw this film with my 90 year old grandmother and she laughed throughout the film and said it was one the best films she ever saw. That's not a bad recomendation coming from someone born in 1883!".

	schema:reviewBody "Film directors of the 1970's had an obsession with older films of the 30's and 40's. The director of this movie is Peter Bogdonavich and he really put together a masterpiece of nostalgic film making. Paper Moon is a classic comedy drama that resembles the films of John Ford or Sam Wood. Ryan O' Neal in his best performance stars as Moses pray a con man who sells bibles to recent widows meets up with Addie Loggins played by Academy Award Winner Tatum O'Neal who is wonderful. The cinematography is beautifully crafted. The landscapes and roads of St. Louis and other cities are so expertly filmed. The black and white photography would make todays audiences think this film was released in 1933 not 30 years after in 1973. Now 32 years later this film holds up and stands the test of time. I don't want to give too much away I am sure many of the readers here have seen it. The supporting cast is great John Hillerman in 2 roles a bootlegger and his brother who is a sheriff. Then you have Randy Quaid and Burton Gilliam in smaller roles. P.j. Johnson is hysterical as the maid to Miss Trixie Delight played with such zest by th greatest comic actress of the 20th century the late and great Madeline Kahn. She stole the film. She was nominated for an Oscar for supporting actress and lost out to you know who. I think she should have gotten it because her role really was supporting and also for a small role around 20 minutes with few closeups she gave such a tarnished performance. She makes you laugh so hard and yet is so heartbreakingly touching in her big scene on the hill with Addie. If this film was actually made in the 30's Moses could have been played by maybe James Stewart James Cagney Henry Fonda or John Garfied. Addie could have been played by Shirley Temple and Trixie maybe have been played by Sylvia Sidney Betty Field or Ann Sheridan. But I don't think they could have played them any better than Ryan O'Neal Tatum O'Neal and most especially Madeline Kahn.".

	schema:reviewBody "A sunny charmer with clouds enough to darken the edges of the screen Paper Moon presents us with an entertainment of equal parts wit and sentiment an underdog story that delivered a real underdog outcome in the form of a historic Oscar win for nineyear old Tatum O'Neal.In the time of the Great Depression a little girl named Addie Tatum is left abandoned by the death of her mother a woman who hung around in bars and left Addie with a big mystery as far as the identity of her father is concerned. At her gravesite a dodgy stranger named Moses Ryan O'Neal happens by to pay his respects and is immediately recruited by the other mourners who don't want to be burdened with the girl with the assignment of delivering Addie to her nextofkin.God works in mysterious ways one of the mourners says after Moses reluctantly accepts.Don't He now? Moses replies.God indeed may have some unfinished business with Moses Pray a conman who uses the Good Book as his device for fleecing newlymade widows of a few bucks. Watching the O'Neals work their family chemistry for sparks and laughs while Moses with unexpected help from Addie works his scams is great fun. A lingering question is whether Moses and Addie are in fact related many in the movie point out their similar jawlines but Moses refuses to accept the idea. Addie is more open to it. Clearly Moses for all his faults fills a hole in her life.There was a time when Peter Bogdanovich could do no wrong as a director here he presents us with an assured callback to 1930s period sensibilities by employing a flat Kansas landscape and scenic design that suggests a combination of Norman Rockwell and Grant Wood at once homey and vaguely grotesque. The story moves fast the dialogue is crisp and believable and the O'Neals' performances of such strong quality as to make you wonder why they so seldom impressed in other roles. The talent is there on the screen.Tatum was the real surprise here decades later long after the flash of her career faded it's hard not to be as bowled over by what she gives you as all those critics and moviegoers were so long ago. Avoiding the cutesiness of child actors she plays her character as sharptongued and vinegary with a hint of real beauty beneath the smudges. Ain't she got a sweet little face somehow is the best anyone can manage in the way of compliments but Addie don't need them. She just wants her 200 dollars or two hundra DOLLA as she keeps putting it to Moses.The two of them make such a pair I get annoyed when Madeline Kahn joins them for a time as a conniving cheapjack vixen named Trixie. Unlike the O'Neals Kahn is an actress I usually enjoy in anything so why is she so duff to me here? Trixie is a onenote performance that grates on me I can't wait for the Prays to leave her in their dust.I did enjoy P. J. Johnson as Trixie's putupon maid Imogene. She adds some heart and gives Addie some company for some of the movie's best scenes. So too does a raft of supporting players most of whom like Kahn must have been waiting for Mel Brooks' callbacks for Blazing Saddles at the time of this production.Mostly though this is Tatum's film it rises or falls with her and as a result of her spry performance rises quite impressively. Bogdanovich clearly gambled putting his promising career on her little shoulders unlike later gambles of his this paid off spectacularly and yields dividends to this day.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nineyearold Addie Loggins is the centerpiece of Peter Bogdanovich's affectionate 1973 comedy set during the depths of the Great Depression. The filmmaker was on a roll at the time as he made the comingofage saga 1971's The Last Picture Show and the screwball throwback 1972's What's Up Doc? in quick succession. Cineaste that he is Bogdanovich filmed this episodic characterdriven comedy deliberately in black and white inspired by classics as diverse as Charlie Chaplin's The Kid Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves and even John Ford's The Searchers. The result is charming if a bit overlong for the simple story being told. As the film opens in Kansas Addie just lost her mother and she is to be taken to live with relatives in Missouri. Enter traveling Bible salesman Moses Pray a smalltime grifter who bilks recent widows out of cash under the pretense that their late husbands had ordered personalized Bibles before their deaths. As a chronic womanizer he knew Addie's freeliving mother and promises to take her to her relatives after he extorts 200 from a local business owner.The rest of the story is an entertaining road movie centered on the evolving relationship between Moses and Addie as she shows to have a greater gift for scams than he does. A toughtalking smoker who loves radio Addie is a tomboy frequently mistaken for a boy while Moses constantly resists his paternal feelings toward her even though they are kindred spirits. Complications occur first with the appearance of a tawdry carnival stripper named Trixie Delight who threatens to come between Moses and Addie and then with a bootlegger and his lookalike sheriff brother who are in hot pursuit over a scam around crates of illegal whiskey. As Addie Tatum O'Neal still has the distinction of being the youngest actor to win a competitive Oscar and in her film debut her unprecocious performance reflects refreshingly confident work from a child. Perhaps fearful that his daughter was stealing the movie a wellfounded fear it turns out her father Ryan does some of his best screen work as Moses better cast here than as bumbling musicologist Howard Bannister in What's Up Doc?.As she proved with her hilarious portrayal of Howard's persnickety fiance Eunice in What's Up Doc? Madeline Kahn is an unparalleled scenestealer as Trixie especially as she tries to coax a belligerent Addie off a grassy hilltop. Just before peaking in Mel Brooks' farces and reunited with the elder O'Neal Kahn shows what she can do to maximize less than halfhour of screen time. Almost as funny is the eyerolling cynicism of P.J. Johnson as Trixie's indentured servant Imogene. The 2003 DVD has two substantial extras. First Bogdanovich offers a fulllength commentary full of his personal remembrances and sharing a deep well of cinematic knowledge. The second is Laurent Bouzereau's The Making of Paper Moon an exhaustive makingof featurette divided into three parts which covers all aspects of the film's development and production and includes comments from Bogdanovich his thenwife Polly Platt who did the production design cinematographer Lszl Kovcs and producer Frank Marshall.".

	schema:headline " A singular masterpiece!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult to watch this film with any impartiality as it was one of the formative films of my childhood years. Seeing it now over 40 years after it came out I'm convinced it's one of the finest American films ever made. Many other viewers here have pointed out the main reasons for its greatnessso I'd like to shine a light on perhaps some of the lesscredited components of the film's success. I'm calling them Paper Moon's Unsung HeroesUnsung hero 1 There's been little mention here of the actor who truly anchors this filmand gives the finest performance of his career Ryan O'Neal. He delivers a fullyrealized multifaceted performance more than worthy of an Oscar nomination if not a win in my opinion and he received neither. Try watching Paper Moon with your eye on O'Neal pere rather than his adorable scene stealing daughter. Firstly of course he was one of the handsomest actors of his era which makes such an undertaking a painless effort. But watch the subtlety of his expressions and his nuanced comic turns. For example in the hotel scene where he's having his breakfast when Imogene comes down to tell him that 'Miss Trixie' is having her ladies' time his reaction turning from concerned to mortified as he rapidly sits back down while dropping his voice by an octave...now THAT'S comedy! His comic delivery in his first big scene with Addie the diner scene is also brilliant. In fact I can't think of a single scene where he is not completely trueto character. In the hands of another actor this deceptively difficult role could have been played as 'malevolent'. O'Neal's performance shows 'Moze' to be a lovable rascal who does what he has to do in order to survive during the Great Depression. Imagine say Jack Nicholson in the role...It would certainly have been a different film altogether. Sidebar comment I realize one shouldn't judge a film actor's performance with how they are 'offscreen'but if what Tatum says about him in her books and interviews is true O'Neal is not quiteaslovable a rogue offscreen. She claims that when the Oscar nominations were announced she did sort of a Nahh nahnahnahnahh to him as bratty 10yearolds are known to do and he fully punched her in the face! Gulp. All four of his children are either addicts alcoholics or in major therapy. But I digress. The 2 unsung heroine of this movie is the late brilliant Polly Platt Peter Bogdanovich's first wife and soontobeexwife as he had already taken up with Cybill Shepard when this film was made. Ms. Platt designed the costumes and realized the whole look of the film which Bogdanovich fullycredits her for. I can't think of any other American film of the last 50 years that so completely captures the 1930's in such a flawlessly realistic way. The attention to detail is staggeringlook at any single extra in this film and they are all absolutely spoton correct to the look of that era the hotel clerk in the 'bootlegger hotel' with her perfect '30s Marcelle wave comes to mind. Unsung hero 3 Gary Chason who PERFECTLY cast this film including several firsttime actors Tatum O'Neal of course...as well as Burton Gilliam Floyd the Hotel Clerk P.J. Johnson Imogene among many others. I'm hardpressed to think of another filmever in which every single role is so perfectlyfilled...and often by firsttime actors! Unsung hero 4 Lszl Kovcs the brilliant cinematographer. Every single shot is so perfectly thoughtout and realized. In the hands of a lesservisionary Paper Moon would certainly have been a lesser film than it is and imagine if it had been shot in COLOR!. FINALLYhe's certainly not unsungbut clearly he's under sung PETER BOGDANOVICH! This film is a work of sheer genius and all roads lead back to him. I consider Paper Moon the crowning achievement of his career with apologies to Last Picture Show. It's almost as if his career has followed the same arc as that of his great hero mentor and friend Orson Welles. Both of them had their greatest successes straight out of the gate...and then were rather hungouttodry by Hollywood as if considered pass. I keep waiting for the world to WAKE UP and realize Paper Moon is one of the absolute FINEST films in historyand should be lauded accordingly! Why is Peter Bogdanovich NOT still being given the opportunity to direct major Hollywood studio films?? The man is one of the true cinematic geniuses of our era. And yes he is certainly a 'peer' of his hero Mr. Welles. Could we please give him the reverence he deserves? Special Mention to Tatum O'Neal too! It seems to be common wisdom today that she was simply some kind of human puppet for Bogdanovich to manipulate every word and movement of. I beg to differ strongly. Some of her expressions and line deliveries are so singularly charming and individualisticproving that she is clearly an innatelyskilled and intuitive actress. This performance was no fluke. This girllady deserves more credit than she's given and I say she absolutely deserved that Oscar...though it should have been for Best Actresswith of course Madeline Kahn as Best Supporting Actress!.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's difficult to watch this film with any impartiality as it was one of the formative films of my childhood years. Seeing it now over 40 years after it came out I'm convinced it's one of the finest American films ever made. Many other viewers here have pointed out the main reasons for its greatnessso I'd like to shine a light on perhaps some of the lesscredited components of the film's success. I'm calling them Paper Moon's Unsung HeroesUnsung hero 1 There's been little mention here of the actor who truly anchors this filmand gives the finest performance of his career Ryan O'Neal. He delivers a fullyrealized multifaceted performance more than worthy of an Oscar nomination if not a win in my opinion and he received neither. Try watching Paper Moon with your eye on O'Neal pere rather than his adorable scene stealing daughter. Firstly of course he was one of the handsomest actors of his era which makes such an undertaking a painless effort. But watch the subtlety of his expressions and his nuanced comic turns. For example in the hotel scene where he's having his breakfast when Imogene comes down to tell him that 'Miss Trixie' is having her ladies' time his reaction turning from concerned to mortified as he rapidly sits back down while dropping his voice by an octave...now THAT'S comedy! His comic delivery in his first big scene with Addie the diner scene is also brilliant. In fact I can't think of a single scene where he is not completely trueto character. In the hands of another actor this deceptively difficult role could have been played as 'malevolent'. O'Neal's performance shows 'Moze' to be a lovable rascal who does what he has to do in order to survive during the Great Depression. Imagine say Jack Nicholson in the role...It would certainly have been a different film altogether.

It starts with 9yearold Addie at her mother's funeral where she meets a friend of her mother the con man Moses Pray. Moze gets 200 for Addie in compensation for her mom's death then blows half of it on a new car for himself. The film begins to pick up and become very funny when the little girl demands her money back showing herself worldly and forceful for her age likely a product of being raised by a loose woman. Addie also suspects Moze may be her dad which he denies after a long pause indicating he either knows he is or believes it's possible.What we have from here is an unusual maybe fatherdaughter story in which the two bond but never in a sweet and sugary way. They don't get sentimental instead she picks up Moze's tricks and joins in the fun making his con jobs more equitable by sparing the impoverished and getting more out of the rich. They're on the wrong side of the law but in their own way each does have scruples. In the end Addie is offered a sweet and sugary life in a comfortable home and doesn't want it because she prefers life with Moze because she isn't perfect and doesn't want perfect and the audience can feel that's who she is and can understand.Paper Moon slows down a little in the middle when Madeline Kahn comes into the picture and Moze and Addie mess with a bootlegger. But in my view the big payoff comes when they're arrested and pull off an extremely clumsy escape. It's a good laugh and adds to Paper Moon's many charms.".

Paper Moon is a delightful film about a con man Ryan O'Neal who is forced to take in a girl Tatum O'Neal who won an Oscar for this film who may or may not be his daughter. The film is essentially a road trip movie with a slim plot to carry around events that happen while the two main characters travel across Great Depression America. Both of the characters are utterly charming with the heartfelt Addie forced to ride along with sleazy Moses.I prefer What's Up Doc? as I love Buck Henry's writing on that film.".

Paper Moon is a delightful film about a con man Ryan O'Neal who is forced to take in a girl Tatum O'Neal who won an Oscar for this film who may or may not be his daughter. The film is essentially a road trip movie with a slim plot to carry around events that happen while the two main characters travel across Great Depression America. Both of the characters are utterly charming with the heartfelt Addie forced to ride along with sleazy Moses.I prefer What's Up Doc? as I love Buck Henry's writing on that film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Bogdanovich's 'Paper Moon' is everything a road movie is supposed to be  a lifechanging personal journey a quest a bit oldfashioned and above all a hoot. The story is simple. Young Addie Tatum O'Neal finds herself orphaned with the death of her single  and apparently rather freespirited  mother. The arrival of a man named Moze her reallife father Ryan O'Neal at the funeral provides the other mourners a chance to pack Addie off to her aunt in Missouri. Moze is reluctant to take her along but sees a chance to blackmail some money out of the whole situation. However his dreams of pocketing a windfall of 200 and sending Addie off on a train come to nothing  the wily young girl demands the greatly diminished sum that was meant for her care. As a result he finds himself saddled with this grimly adult child who is fairly certain that Moze is her father as his assistant in a crime spree through the Midwest  a scam involving sale of overpriced Bibles to recent widows. In essence Moze scans obituaries for gullible widows he can convince to pay the balance on Bibles their husbands ordered for them  deluxe editions with the names embossed in gold  before passing on. Unsurprisingly Addie is an adroit if unruly student who upstages both his skill and daring.Yes 'Paper Moon' is about two con artists but not really about their con and that's a relief. The scam is only part of the story which takes a number of turns before reaching its end  including Moze picking up a tart from a sideshow  a carnival dancer named Trixie Delight a cheerfully trampy Madeline Kahn who is accompanied by a long suffering black maid Imogene wonderfully played by P. J. Johnson who later turns out to be Addie's partnerincrime. Bogdanovich takes the con games only as the experience which his two lead characters share and which draws them together in a way that's funny sometimes but also very poignant and finally deeply touching.The film is shot in gorgeous blackandwhite giving it a documentary feel that meshes perfectly with the sweet cynicism of the characters. But what really underscores the film is amazing chemistry between the O'Neals. The fact they are father and daughter in real life helps flavor their working dynamic in an intriguing way. Tatum O'Neal is an absolute revelation  she spends much of the film with a sourpuss expression pasted to her adorable little pixie face but breezes through the film with astonishing confidence. Ryan O'Neal's roguish charm is perfect for the character and the result paired with his daughter is a strong colead dynamic in a tale about their delicate relationship that teeters on fatheranddaughter quality without adopting the name.A true treasure Peter Bogdanovich's Paper Moon belongs to a magical world that has elements of whimsy and noir!".

	schema:reviewBody "In the early seventies director Peter Bogdanovich looked like he would be part of the talented roster of new Hollywood film makers Spielberg Coppola Lucas that had suddenly burst onto the scene. Bogdanovich a film critic and confidante of the likes of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock had like the others learned his chops through the Roger Corman horror school with an impressive debut horror cheapie featuring Boris Karloff called Targets. He then followed up with three straight box office and critical hits The Last Picture Show What's Up Doc? and arguably his best Paper Moon. Moon traverses the same dusty roads of the depression era that the earlier Bonnie and Clyde does and while there's a lot less gun play it's very much the same rollicking bumpy ride.Moses Pray hustles bibles on unsuspecting widows to make a living when he reluctantly agrees to take recently orphaned Addie Loggins to her aunt in Missouri. Addie suspects that Moses could be her father something he wants no part of. Addie it turns out is every bit as streetwise as Pray and the two form an uneasy alliance and con their way across the countryside. For part of the trip Trixie Delight a woman of dubious character and her much put upon maid join them but Addie soon puts a stop to that by devising a clever setup. The two are soon back on the road alone where things get uglier but not enough to destroy this delightful pictures sunny disposition.As he did in Last Picture Show Bogdanovich again displays a deft touch for black and white film composition. Of course it helps to have master cinematographers like Robert Surtees Show and Laszlo Kovacs lensing the work but it is Bogdanovich who manages to convey the very different feel of both films through his actors and the mood he establishes nostalgia without crushing sentimentality that fits so well with the somber monochromatic imagery.The usually dull Ryan O'Neil gives a commendable performance as the flustered conartist Moses. Playing mostly straight man to Addie he is always a step behind her as she indirectly takes charge on more than one occasion to save the day. Argumentative and abrasive as their screen characters are with each other father daughter chemistry has never transferred to screen so well. Tatum O'Neil's Addie can't help but walk away with the show as the orphaned waif priming herself for a life of hard knocks. She's no Shirley Temple or for that matter Little Miss Sunshine. She's observant knows how to play the game and easily outwits most adults she matches wits with. Her tough exterior belies the helpless little girl stereotype making her vulnerable moments all the more powerful. The film ultimately belongs to her character but you never know it when Madeline Khan's Trixie Delight shows up. This terrific supporting actress from the seventies gave any film she appeared in back then a boost and she does here as the brassy mean spirited threat to Addie.Bogdonovich's talent deserted him shortly after this with terrible comedies Nickelodeon They All Laughed dull dramas Daisy Miller St. Jack and an horrendous musical At Long Last Love but if anyone is in search of some of the best BW films of the past 40 years they could start with Picture Show and this little gem.".

But boy do they have something in store for you here.The movie opens with Bible salesman Moses Pray Ryan O'Neal adopting Addie Loggins Tatum O'Neal in a Midwestern town during the Great Depression. It doesn't take her long to figure out that the guy's a con artist. However she turns out to be cleverer than he.I remember hearing about how the novel which I've never read was simply called Addie Pray and didn't feature the scene in which Moses and Addie sit on the title object at the fair. It's debatable as to whether or not it changed the quality to add that object and change the title. But either way you can't deny that this movie remains a timeless masterpiece. Personally I think that Peter Bogdanovich deserves a lot more credit as a director than most people give him he has made some really good movies even if some came out a little lower than we expect. This one is just great.Also starring Madeleine Kahn and Randy Quaid.".

I first saw it when I was about the same age as Tatum O'Neal and I was absolutely thrilled by the adventures she was having in this film. I've since watched it many times and the magic in the movie remains undiminished.The film is set in the American midwest during the Depression years. Philandering Moses Ryan O'Neal winds up saddled with young orphan Addie Tatum O'Neal when he attends her mother's funeral. When she learns that he is a con man she proves herself to be a shrewd and capable accomplice and the two of them form a partnership. When Moses' tendency to chase after questionable women becomes a challenge to the status quo Addie must take action to ensure that her life with Moses remains unthreatened.In terms of a believable performance by a kid I can't think of many others that have come close to Tatum O'Neal in this movie. The photography is astonishing as well. The bleak dusty landscapes in the movie are breathtaking in black  white and the period sets are memorable too. All of the actors in the film hit the perfect note right down to the bit parts and extras although the main players are marvelous. Madeline Kahn is great as usual and so is P.J. Johnson as her overworked personal maid.Paper Moon gives you the impression that this really is what America might have been like in this time period. It would be worth seeing just for the sheer craft of the film alone but the story and the acting make it ten times better than just that. Truly deserves the highest rating a film can get.".

	schema:reviewBody "Come see a fat old man sometime!John Wayne's parting comment in this film is directed as much at us the viewers as it is at the young woman his Rooster Cogburn character is addressing. In a way Wayne throughout the film plays off the image he cemented in dozens of great and neargreat westerns with a nod that by 1969 he along with the western genre had fallen behind the times that his shootfirst approach to law and order had worn thin with the critical establishment just as it does in Judge Parker's courtroom.In that way playing a character of such dogged homicidal cussedness as the harddrinking oneeyed exQuantrill Raider Rooster Cogburn and giving him a teenaged girl seeking justice to play off so as to showcase his essential decency seems a clever means to win Wayne an Oscar which he finally did here a sentimental triumph over some more heralded performances. With such an attitude you might think True Grit would come off a bit of a onetrick pony 37 years on. But it doesn't. In many ways both the film and Wayne's performance come off better than ever.Helping matters a lot is the support Wayne receives from two women. As the heroine Matty Ross Kim Darby provides Wayne with a fantastic foil doughty to the point of rudeness forever finding fault in others but earning your good will through her simple faith in justice and loyalty to the memory of her slain father for whom she wants Rooster's help avenging. As she is told by a horse dealer she banters with I admire your sand.The other is Marguerite Roberts whose adaptation of Charles Portis' novel bristles with good humor and an ear for the period. If ever I meet one of you Texas waddies who ain't drunk water from a hoofprint I think I'll... I'll shake their hand or buy 'em a Daniel Webster ceegar Rooster tells his braggart riding companion a young Texas Ranger played by country singer and exBeach Boy Glen Campbell.Campbell may be a novice and a third wheel in the interplay between Wayne and Darby but he acquits himself well and delivers a worthy performance in a cast stacked with talented actors like Robert Duvall Jeremy Slate and Strother Martin not to mention Dennis Hopper hiding the long hair he made famous in Easy Rider that same year. Some of these actors portray bad guys but Roberts' script and director Henry Hathaway's languid pacing allow them to present some humanizing qualities that go a long way toward making True Grit more than your typical shootemup oater.Even Jeff Corey who plays a noaccount named Chaney who shot Matty's father has a funny scene when he tells Matty how to cock her pistol then whines after she shoots him with it Everything happens to me!About the only fault I can find with the film is Elmer Bernstein's bombastic score which employs overly ornate orchestration like kettledrums when Matty has her showdown with Chaney and is tuneless apart from the title song which is Campbell's best moment here. Hathaway's direction is somewhat pedestrian but serves the script and showcases some incredible autumnal vistas of tall birch and pine where Rooster and Matty search for Chaney photographed by Lucien Ballard in a style akin to but more dreamy than his work on the same year's The Wild Bunch.1969 was the last great year for westerns with this The Wild Bunch Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid Support Your Local Sheriff and Once Upon A Time In the West and its interesting how Ballard Corey and Strother Martin turned up in more than one of them. But good westerns never really go out of style they just sit on the shelf awhile like an old Stetson waiting to be rediscovered. Nobody wore a Stetson better or deserved an Oscar more than John Wayne. True Grit does the double duty of showing why he was a star and further burnishing his luster.".

I don't remember the first time I saw it but I remember how I came to love John Wayne.  When he died in the late 70s I was crushed.  I still watch this movie at least once a year it is on TNT or some other Turner channel at least monthly.  Rooster Cogburn is to me the archetype of all Western heroes. He is the undeniably flawed crochety old man that hides his tenderness behind a facade of toughness.  He roams all over the west in search of bad guys and he drinks to fill the hole inside him that loneliness has created.  It is important to say that he is not a killer or interested in revenge.  His whole being his soul rests on the cause of justice.  He is the bravest character ever created in a writer's imagination.  At the end when he jumps his horse over the fence and tells Maddie to come and see an old fat man sometime I cry.  Everytime. Despite his politics and the fact that he was just an actor to me John Wayne is the lone western hero that will remain in my heart for all my life.".

	schema:headline " The Honor of a Lifetime";
	schema:reviewBody "Now personally there are John Wayne performances in terms of acting that I like better than True Grit. Among others Fort Apache The Searchers Red River The Horse Soldiers to name a few. And certain films like The Commancheros and McLintock and Big Jake I find to be more entertaining.What True Grit does is succeed on both levels being both great entertainment and giving John Wayne the acting role of a lifetime in the person of Rooster Cogburn. Mattie Ross from Darnell and Yell County Arkansas personified by Kim Darby has come to Fort Smith seeking the killer of her father Jeff Corey. Turns out he's also killed a State Senator in Texas so Texas Ranger Glen Campbell informs her. Both of them team up with United States Marshal Rooster Cogburn who resides in Fort Smith with Chin Lee and my favorite movie cat General Sterling Price.Corey is now in the outlaw band headed by Robert Duvall at large in the Indian Nation Territory that became Oklahoma. True Grit's plot is the trio's pursuit of Duvall Corey and the rest of the gang.But oddly enough True Grit isn't really about plot. It's about the creation of a character. Like Margaret Mitchell who wrote Gone With the Wind with Clark Gable in mind for Rhett Butler Charles Portis wrote the novel True Grit with only John Wayne in mind as Rooster Cogburn. It must have been one singular delight for Charles Portis to see the Duke flesh out Rooster Cogburn exactly as he conceived him.Tough old Rooster likes an occasional drink isn't above a little larceny but has one stern moral code about real bad guys. Bring him in dead or alive and make sure you shoot first coming up against them. And he's got quite the colorful past as he relates tales of his younger days to Campbell and Darby on the trail.In other reviews I've said that John Wayne had one of the great faces for movie closeups. You can see a perfect example of that in that scene with John Fiedler who plays Darby's lawyer J. Noble Daggett. A man who rates high in the legal profession in that area having forced a railroad into bankruptcy. The camera is facing Fiedler as he's talking to Wayne about his visit with Darby who's life Wayne saved. Wayne's got about a third of his face to the camera. But even with that third your eyes are focused on the Duke and his reactions and then as the camera slowly pans around to Wayne in full face his reaction shots are hysterical. You don't work with scene stealing character actors like Chill Wills Walter Brennan and Gabby Hayes for 30 years without learning something.John Wayne was up against some stiff competition in 1969 for the Best Actor Oscar. It was his second nomination the first being for Sands of Iwo Jima. He was facing Richard Burton as Henry VIII in Anne of a Thousand Days and a couple of newcomers named Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight for Midnight Cowboy. He was certainly the sentimental favorite.If in no other place in our lives sentiment does have its place in cinema. It was an honor well deserved not just for one performance but for a lifetime of achievement in cinema being the player who put more people into movie seats than any other person ever. So many of the Duke's contemporaries like Edward G. Robinson Errol Flynn Tyrone Power were never even nominated for an Oscar much less win one.Because the Motion Picture Academy has deemed this John Wayne's grandest cinematic achievement it's almost a command to support this fine western and the man who defined the western hero and is still defining it.".

I don't care for them much primarily because I usually can't fall for them.In movies the desire to please as wide an audience as possible seems always to win out effectively robbing most westerns of the motion picture's essential gambit the suspension of disbelief.  It's very hard to lose oneself in a tale of the late 1800's when the female lead's eyeliner and coiff are pure 1950.  Or 1940 1960 whatever.  In True Grit very little of 1969 is allowed to intrude on this rather simple tale of justice and revenge.  This movie is anchored by two very strong themes shared by all the actors across most of the scenes.The first is language.  The dialogue is an absolute delight.  Crack open anything by Mark Twain Henry James or any other late 19th century author and you will see that people really did speak differently 150 years ago. That the dialogue in 99 of westerns is straight from the time of their filming is a travesty at best.Second is innocence.  Not that of any one character however but the innocence of the human race as a whole.  It is probably almost impossible for any of us now in this day and age to truly imagine what it must have been like to live back when.  But one thing's sure people were much more naive.  There was no such thing as masscommunication a good percentage of the population didn't read and newspapers the only organized form of news at the time were hard pressed to report on anything more than a day's ride from town.This basic shared innocence is achingly portrayed by Robert Duvall in two short sentences near the end of the movie when he's caught Mattie and he's attempting to threaten her.  Study those two lines and you'll see that Lucky Ned Pepper the worst villain in the story really has no idea of what he could possibly do to a slip of a girl.  He's totally at a loss.  The unspeakable modernday atrocities we consume every day with our coffee and bagels are so far from contemplation by Duvall's character that all he can do is assure her I'll do what I have to. It's a priceless moment  frighteningly accurate commentary wrapped in two lines of simple dialogue delivered with deadon interpretation.The only other western I can think of at the moment that delivers with such viscerally historic accuracy is Unforgiven.MjM".

	schema:reviewBody "There isn't a false note in this film.  Charles Portis' book of the same name is practically adapted verbatim to the screen this is the purest book to movie transfer I've yet seen and this assures its success.John Wayne worked for 50 years to get to this role and no one else could have played it.  He becomes Rooster Cogburn it revitalized his career and made everyone finally take notice of his skills as an actor.  I love Wayne in anything but this movie has a special place in my heart.Kim Darby is also a surprise.  She's more than capable of handling Wayne in each and every scene.  They made a very good team.  Glen Campbell is not as good as these two but then he really isn't an actor.  He does have his moments though and acquits himself with aplomb as the Texas Ranger. Strother Martin is a real hoot as Stonehill the horse trader he's always a great asset to any film and this must have been his 10th appearance in a Wayne movie.  Robert Duvall is very good and very harried as Lucky Ned Pepper.  He's not a wanton killer he doesn't kill or even hurt Kim Darby. He's just a thief who wants to be left alone and you can see by his worried expression that he knows Rooster won't ever let him go.  Dennis Hopper and Jeremy Slate have a small very fine scene in the middle of the movie where they are partners in crime who don't see things in the same way.A previous review talks about the low amount of votes on this film by people in the US.  I would chalk that up to the age group that saw this film and loved it.  Most of those people are not into computers yet and probably don't know about the IMDB. Believe me it's considered a classic and rightfully so.This is a fine family film that everyone should see.  Rent it buy it or borrow it but do watch it.  It will make anyone a John Wayne fan.  And be sure to read the book I couldn't put it down.".

Robert Duvall is very good and very harried as Lucky Ned Pepper.  He's not a wanton killer he doesn't kill or even hurt Kim Darby. He's just a thief who wants to be left alone and you can see by his worried expression that he knows Rooster won't ever let him go.  Dennis Hopper and Jeremy Slate have a small very fine scene in the middle of the movie where they are partners in crime who don't see things in the same way.A previous review talks about the low amount of votes on this film by people in the US.  I would chalk that up to the age group that saw this film and loved it.  Most of those people are not into computers yet and probably don't know about the IMDB. Believe me it's considered a classic and rightfully so.This is a fine family film that everyone should see.  Rent it buy it or borrow it but do watch it.  It will make anyone a John Wayne fan.  And be sure to read the book I couldn't put it down.";

	schema:headline " More than Just a Fat Old Man";
	schema:reviewBody "True Grit deals with one of the classic Western themes indeed one of the classic themes in all literature revenge. A teenage girl Mattie Ross is looking for someone who will help her track down Tom Chaney the man who murdered her father. The man Mattie chooses is Rooster Cogburn a US Marshal. Cogburn is elderly fat oneeyed and a heavy drinker but Mattie chooses him because she has heard that he has true grit. The two of them set out into the Indian Territory in search of Chaney accompanied by La Boeuf shouldn't that be Le Boeuf? a Texas ranger who wants to arrest him in connection with another murder.This is perhaps best remembered today as the film for which John Wayne won his only Oscar. Halliwell's Film Guide rather ungraciously refers to it as a sentimental Oscar for daring to look old and fat but there is more to Wayne's performance than that. The Academy in fact had tended to overlook Wayne just as they overlooked the Western genre which provided him with most of his roles well over a hundred films had only brought him two previous nominations. Cogburn however was one of his best roles. On the surface a hardbitten irascible old man he has hidden depths to his character not only the courage and determination implied by the phrase true grit but also a sense of humour and a capacity for tenderness. Cogburn is a lonely man divorced from his wife and alienated from his only son and his only friends are a Chinese storekeeper a rare acknowledgement from Hollywood that not every inhabitant of the West was either white or an Indian and his cat. A close relationship however grows up between him and the orphaned Mattie for whom he becomes a substitute father. In turn she becomes the daughter he never had or perhaps even a substitute son.Mattie is a complex character. There is much about her that is androgynous her tomboy looks her short hair even her name which can be short for Matthew as well as Matilda or Martha. She is brave and determined there is a suggestion that the phrase true grit applies to her as well but can also be a pain in the neck especially to Cogburn. She is at times wise in the ways of the world and at others strangely innocent. She is part avenging angel part bookish intellectual shown by her rather formal language and part vulnerable child. It is a role that called for an outstanding performance and got one from Kim Darby who was able to bring out all the various facets of Mattie's character. This is the only film of hers that I have seen but it seems strange on the strength of this that her subsequent cinema career has been so patchy. Unfortunately Glenn Campbell a singer with little previous acting experience made a weak La Boeuf. It is probably as well that John Wayne did not get his way when he wanted Karen Carpenter a singer with absolutely no previous acting experience to play the role of Mattie instead of Darby. Great actors do not always make great casting directors.True Grit does not perhaps have the depth of meaning of some of the truly great Westerns such as High Noon Unforgiven or Wayne's last film The Shootist but it is a very good one. It is a fastmoving and exciting adventure notable for some beautiful photography of mountainous landscapes although it is ostensibly set in relatively flat Oklahoma it was actually filmed in Colorado and California for one of the great iconic moments of the Western the scene where Cogburn gallops alone into battle guns blazing against four opponents and for two excellent performances in the two main roles. 710".

	schema:headline " Wondrous and thoroughly competent western breathing life into a tale of revenge whilst unafraid of going full bore into the souls and minds of the characters it depicts.";
	schema:reviewBody "The film begins on that of the homely often perceived as 'safe' locale of a farm ranch in 1880's Arkansas the Ross family are bidding farewell to their husband and father of the place in Frank eventually seeing him roll on out of there with a lodger after the establishment it would be safer to take a train rather than ride horseback to where they're going. The lodger of whom takes minimal belongings for such a hike and whose reply to such an accusation is dry and understated as if something were brewing in his mind and he were never going to return to here. Away from the more congregated goodbyes sits a young girl inside of an establishment she shares an exchange with her father which is granted a more personalised and lowerkey sense during which she is established to be quite the one for having her own voice rather sharp on the accounting side of things and takes a stance on an issue to do with the purchasing of ponies before stating such a standpoint in a concise manner.The young girl is a certain Mattie played extraordinarily by Kim Darby a character whose role it is to waltz into the male dominated patriarchy of the western genre and upset the balance as this young seemingly frail but ultimately female presence putting her foot down. The crux of authenticity in Darby's quite stunning performance runs in tandem with that of her character's predicament within the film she is somebody whom must confront and often stand up to certain individuals of a hardened and established ilk before often coming to have to dominate proceedings in their presence. This is something in lieu of Darby's own predicament that of having to match up to that of a figure of John Wayne's stature in this a Western and have to match him within the frame as well as the universe of the film.In short Henry Hathaway's bare boned 1969 western is a near faultless masterpiece an exciting unpredictable and more than substantial film balancing several acts at once as it breathlessly tells a tale that is difficult to find anything less than thoroughly absorbing. The film is directed with distinct aplomb make no mistake his film is unafraid to place children on the frontline and in the firing line of a west we very much sense is wild. It is a west that sees animals get caught up and often killed in the ensuing chaos a west that sees an array of lowlifes all intermingling with one another and the elements those of whose actions and motivations we can never take for granted and of which are told amidst a background of brutality lending a great air of ambiguity to proceedings as we wonder if anybody is entirely safe.The catalyst for proceedings is in the tragedy that is Frank's death shot and killed by his accomplice lodger whilst trying to help him in the aftermath of a poker game. In reaction to this Mattie journeys to the town in which he was killed so as to hire a Marshall to find the man and garner some justice her witnessing of several other criminals guilty for similar crimes publicly hung allowing her exposure to what awaits such justice. That Marshall eventually turns out to be a certain Rooster Cogburn John Wayne's Civil War veteran who's living a life of rounding up disparate arrays of crooks and bandits from local territories and holding them in cells overnight so as to take courtroom lectures the following morning over what we perceive to be from Cogburn's perspective negligent intricacies over whom shot what first and in what order thisandthat happened. The manner in which Cogburn kicks an inmate towards the jail house in that lazed manner as if he's done it so many times before that it's become too many times before is prominent a sense of the guy going through motions in rounding these guys up with little pleasure derived from the fact he has helped bring peace to those to whom it matters.Mattie and Cogburn eventually link up his enthusiasm only truly omnipresent when she is able to show him hard cash her smaller sharper posture more colourful display of attire and verbal eloquence in relatively stark contrast to that of his larger build slurred tone more erratic body movements and clothing dulled by months of dirt. Along for good measure is that of a Texan ranger named La Boeuf Campbell somebody who challenges Mattie's transgressions and whose stake for the same man she's after is a lot more on account he's guilty of killing a politician. Where the film is effectively Mattie's as a tale of revenge the film does really well to encompass Cogburn's arc of going out to find a wanted man like he always does but this time identifying what he's doing and for whom he's doing it. Principally the coming to learn accept and acknowledge life or justice as something worth going out and fighting for or battling toward in the action of searching for this man rather than merely treating it as a part of the daily grind is prominent. The film keeps the interplay between the three of them tasty throughout and we enjoy Mattie's ability to bring a sense of the controlled or of the informed to her surroundings as well as to those with whom she interacts in what is a persistently captivating series of clashes Hathaway keeps moving and brooding with and affecting eye on numerous things.".

A bit later I bought a worn paperback copy of the novel in Mrs. Cohen's bookstore in South Windsor Connecticut not expecting much. The dialogue in the movie was stilted.

I looked up in the DARE all those expressions that didn't immediately click with me  blue john that's a big story barlow knife dogfall Christmas gift  and they all work. Portis hit every nail on the head and not only with respect to lexicon. The novel as a whole is beautifully done. Not to denigrate the movie though. Kim Darby and the other players are good. John Wayne is excellent as a character actor. His performance here ranks up there with his Captain Brittles in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. Why in God's name after this did he go back to his usual heroic roles in dismissable efforts like The Train Robbers. Every word he utters here is Rooster Cogburn not John Wayne except for one exchange on horseback about Quantrell. Hoarse drunk smelly weighty  he embodies the part. The cinematography is without equal. Sharp smooth. A viewer almost smells the junipers and pinon pines of the Colorado mountains and feels the nightly chill in the air and whiffs the campfire smoke. A marvelously done novel turned into as good a movie as possible. At one point with nothing much being made of it Kim Darby says of alcohol I would not put a thief in my mouth to steal my brains. Portis shouldn't get credit for that because it is a quote from Shakespeare.I won't identify the play.".

Mattie makes a second attempt after a court hearing at which Cogburn was questioned but Cogburn turns her down again doubting that she actually possesses amount of dollars she offered him as a reward for Cheney's capture . Renting a room at a Fort Smith boarding house she meets a Texas Ranger  LaBouef  Glen Campbell  posterior character performed by Matt Damon and they along with Cogburn go to track down Cheney  Ned Pepper Robert Duvall and hoodlums .Gentle entertainment about a toughminded  hardbitten bounty hunter and a fearless bargainer  stubborn adolescent in the Old West starred by the master of the western  an overthehill John Wayne  he is magnificent expert in the art of conjuring stylish  here stars this atypical but amusing western with a lot of jokes  distinguished moments  comical attitudes but also violence and action . Wayne deservedly won his best actor Academy Award for this 1960 portrayal of the boozy Marshal . Likable Kim Darby as an obstinate teen is very good  she is extremely quickwitted and confident . The enjoyable story is enhanced for entertaining moments developed among main characters and especially on the relationship between John Wayne and Kim Darby . Impressive final scenes dealing with a spectacular showdown between Rooster Cogburn and chief baddie well played by Robert Duvall. The stellar cast is accompanied with familiar hearted features  some excellent secondary actors as Robert Duvall  Dennis Hooper  Strother Martin  Jeff Corey  Jeremy Slate  Dennis Hooper  among others . Splendid musical score by Elmer Berstein in his usual style as 'The Magnificent seven'  'The Comancheros' and '4 sons of Katie Elder' . Coloful cinematography by Lucien Ballard  mostly filmed in Natural parks from Montrose ColoradoOwl Creek Pass Ridgway Colorado Sherwin Summit Inyo National Forest and Durango Mexico . Followed by a sequel titled Rooster Cogburn with Wayne and Katherine Hepburn and a TV movie with Warren Oates and Lisa Pelikan .Well and professionally realized by Henry Hathaway with strong screen presence by John Wayne  both of whom collaborated in various Westerns  they included Five Card Stud  North to Alaska  Rooster Cogburn and 4 sons of Katie Elder . Hathaway himself was only even nominated for an Oscar  but his movies themselves are testimony to his skills to heighten narrative tension and shoot action so exhilarating it made adrenalin run . Henry was a craftsman who had a long career from the 30s with successful films  and especially Westerns  as Brigham Young and Raw Hide . In his 60s Hathaway still got the vigour to make some fiery movies as From Hell to Texas How the West was won Nevada Smith and Shoot out . He was an expert on Western genre as he proved in True grit  Five card stud  Nevada Smith  How the West was won  Rawhide  Brigham Young  Buffalo Stampede Garden of evil and The sons of Katie Elder. Rating  Better than average  nice Western that will appeal to John Wayne fans. Action  interesting plot  topnotch performance and breathtaking last half hour make it fine screen amusement . It's still one of the Duke classics .".

Hathaway himself was only even nominated for an Oscar  but his movies themselves are testimony to his skills to heighten narrative tension and shoot action so exhilarating it made adrenalin run . Henry was a craftsman who had a long career from the 30s with successful films  and especially Westerns  as Brigham Young and Raw Hide . In his 60s Hathaway still got the vigour to make some fiery movies as From Hell to Texas How the West was won Nevada Smith and Shoot out . He was an expert on Western genre as he proved in True grit  Five card stud  Nevada Smith  How the West was won  Rawhide  Brigham Young  Buffalo Stampede Garden of evil and The sons of Katie Elder. Rating  Better than average  nice Western that will appeal to John Wayne fans. Action  interesting plot  topnotch performance and breathtaking last half hour make it fine screen amusement . It's still one of the Duke classics .";

	schema:reviewBody "What is a Western? The genre conjures up images of gun totting cowboys reckless outlaws and fierce encounters in countryside saloons. True this was the setting that prevailed during the 19th century American West.A few directors in the past have tried to present the West in a more refined way giving importance to the settings and the characterization. Among them is Henry Hathaway's True Grit an emotionally charged Western about a fearless oneeyed Marshall named Rooster Cogburn.The film very stylishly brings to fore the Western countryside from the scenario at a public hanging to the courtroom drama. In the latter we see some tense and heated exchange of words between the prosecuting lawyer and the Marshall.The intriguing plot unfolds itself very nicely on the silver screen. The story is simple. Tom Cheney a cowboy kills his employer. Maddie Kim Darby the headstrong daughter of the employer vows to take revenge and get Cheney hanged for the murder of her father. For the mission she enlists the support of one Rooster Cogburn John Wayne. Now this Rooster is the meanest Marshall in the entire territory. Having lost one of his eyes in the war he is totally fearless in disposition talks brazenly and has an unconventional sense of humor. Despite his hardened exterior he is warm and benevolent at heart. This is evident in the conversations between him and Maddie.The third angle to the mission comes in the form of Sgt Lebeof Glen Campbell an enthusiastic Texas Ranger who is after Cheney for his own motive of collecting ransom money. At first instance Maddie has reservations about Lebeof. He comes across as an ill mannered uncivilized guy to her. Convinced that Maddie will not make him a party to the pursuit of Cheney Lebeof secretively unknowing from her teams up with Rooster. He takes Rooster into confidence and through him manages an entry into the chase for Cheney. The character of Lebeof is an interesting study. He comes across as an inexperienced person who has a knack for saying something silly all the times. He is rebuked many times for such uttering by both Maddie and Rooster. Rooster had his own reasons for going after Cheney. It so happened that this Cheney was an accomplice of Lucky' Ned Pepper Robert Duvall and Rooster had some unfinished business with Ned. He recently had shot Ned in the lower lip during a confrontation but Ned had escaped. Now this chase provided Rooster with another shot at Ned. The chase is beautifully picturized. Especially the final confrontation between Ned's gang and Rooster. The action sequence in this scene must be seen to be believed.The reverberating and sweet music score by Elmer Bernstein forms an integral part of the plot. Glen Campbell has rendered the opening title song in his trademark voice. True Grit is a treat to watch for its believable depiction of the life and times of the West. Henry Hathaway a specialist director of the crime western and thriller genre has masterfully directed this flick. Reuniting with Wayne after Sons of Katie Elder 1965 he has managed to extract the very best from his leading man. John Wayne has essayed the role of his lifetime. It is impossible to imagine anybody but him in the lead role as a tough uncouth and drunken Marshall. Interestingly Wayne won his only Oscar for this role in 1970.".

While the film starts and ends very well the film slackens in the pace in the middle. My other flaws are to do with casting. Glen Campbell is adequate in his role but I was never engrossed by his character and he never quite make me believe in him. Worst though was Kim Darby I am not going to go through a debate about whether she was too old for the roleI'll drop a hint I think she was but for me she is one of the blandest and most annoying leading ladies in a John Wayne movie.However the film does look great. Handsomely shot with great scenery True Grit is pleasing to the eye. Elmer Bernstein's score is rousing and very fitting while the story is interesting most of the characters are credible and the script flows well. Also True Grit is very well directed and there is a glorious final shootout. Other than Campbell and Darby the other acting is fine. While I would have not personally given the Oscar to this particular performanceI thought he was better in The Searchers Red River and The Quiet Man John Wayne is excellent here and while he doesn't appear until quite later on Robert Duvall also makes a positive impression.All in all a very good film but could have been better in my view. 710 Bethany Cox".

It has been rightly said that Portis' novel was about a teenaged girl the film is about John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn. That's how I saw the film and I think it works extremely well. Good of Marguerite Roberts to have ended with Rooster riding off with a flourish over the snow. The sequel ROOSTER COGBURN was disappointing though in spite of Katherine Hepburn. The build up is effective the father getting killed and the daughter making all necessary efforts to deal with the situation the family faces before appointing  and riding off behind  the marshal. The adventurewhen it comes is absorbing the violence coming in wellspaced out episodes. The humour is delicious and the slowlygrowing relationship between Rooster and Patty ?is a pleasure to watch.

It probably was another case of Hollywood giving away Academy Awards Wayne for best actor for longevity in the business if nothing else because Wayne is fine but nothing exceptional here. This is the same role he played in Big Jake The Searchers and a number of other films.But he's fun to watch and listen to as usual. The difference between this western and Wayne's others was Kim Darby a freshfaced strongwilled young woman who gives the story its unique angle. Even though Wayne is given the responsibility and chasing down the bad guys it's really Darby doing it as young woman seeking the killer of her father.Darby doesn't come off though as some hardened woman. She's too cute for that but she's feisty doesn't take no for an answer and this role came along right at the beginnings of the feminist movement so it made her a popular figure at that time. Too bad she or Hollywood didn't capitalize more on her looks and talent. I don't know why she never made it as a film star because she certainly had the appeal in this movie.Anyway Wayne played what he played best a crotchetybutlikable old man who delivered a lot of interesting lines. He's always tough on the outside but with a soft spot deep inside.The oddball in here was singer Glen Campbell playing a Texas Ranger and being the third person in the killerhunting trio. He wasn't bad but not being a professional actor he wasn't totally convincing either. I don't really understand that choice of putting him in this role.Check out the actors who have minor roles in here Jeremy Slate Strother Martin Robert Duvall Dennis Hopper and more. Wow!One other question I had. How can this be rated G? I thought that meant nothing offensive was in the film yet Wayne uses a number of damns several bastds and one memorable son of a bith! And it's rated G? Huh? Anyway it's a very entertaining western that I always enjoy watching. As in most westerns you'll see some great scenery too which makes having this in widescreen DVD a good choice.".

His portrayal of Rooster Cogburn deservedly won him an Oscar.Cogburn seems an unlikely Western hero he's old and fat wears the wrong colour of hat and likes to pull a cork. Yet he's the marshall that Mattie Ross hires to bring her father's killer to justice. The fact that she insists on coming along to help him is perhaps the weakest aspect of the story  but the end result is so enjoyable that we can forgive this.Robert Duvall as Lucky Ned Pepper makes a great job of playing the leader of the outlaw band Rooster Ross and Ranger have to confront.The action culminates in a scene that no other western has matched before or since.".

His portrayal of Rooster Cogburn deservedly won him an Oscar.Cogburn seems an unlikely Western hero he's old and fat wears the wrong colour of hat and likes to pull a cork. Yet he's the marshall that Mattie Ross hires to bring her father's killer to justice. The fact that she insists on coming along to help him is perhaps the weakest aspect of the story  but the end result is so enjoyable that we can forgive this.Robert Duvall as Lucky Ned Pepper makes a great job of playing the leader of the outlaw band Rooster Ross and Ranger have to confront.The action culminates in a scene that no other western has matched before or since.";

	schema:reviewBody "True Grit provided John Wayne with a long overdue Oscar for his performance as the crusty old whiskey swilling Marshal Rooster Cogburn. Many feel that this award was given more to honor Wayne's 40 plus years in the business than for this one performance. Maybe so but this film still rates as one of his best.The story starts out with Frank Ross John Pickard being shot down in Fort Smith by hired man Tom Cheney Jeff Corey. Ross' daughter Mattie Kim Darby comes to town seeking justice. To this end she engages a oneeyed boozing overweight marshal named Rooster Cogburn to go after Cheney. A Texas Ranger La Boeuf Glen Campbell also seeking Cheney throws in with the pairAfter unsuccessfully trying to shake off the talkative and persistent Mattie Cogburn and La Boeuf take her along on their quest. It seems that Cheney has been seen running with Little Ned Pepper Robert Duvall and his gang. Pepper captures Mattie when she stumbles across Cheney and tries to bring him in. This leads to the final showdown where.....Wayne is excellent as Cogburn poking fun at his heman image. Campbell who as an actor made a great singer and Darby would appear in Norwood the following year. The film bombed and Campbell's film career virtually ended. Kim Darby is charming as the pesky Mattie and almost steals the picture. The direction by veteran Henry Hathaway is crisp and keeps the story moving. The scenery too is breath taking.Also in the cast are Jeremy Slate and Dennis Hopper in an all too brief appearance as two of Duvall's henchmen Strother Martin in a hilarious sequence as the horse trader trading with Mattie and James Westerfield as Hanging Judge Parker. Appearing briefly in dont blink or you'll miss them roles are Wilford Brimley Myron Healey Hank Worden and Jay Silverheels. And not to forget Rooster's room mates Chen Lee H.W. Gim and General Sterling Price.One can't help but notice the similarity in the hanging party sequence between this film and Clint Eastwood's Hang 'em High 1968.Wayne would reprise his role in 1975's Rooster Cogburn with Katherine Hepburn.".

Kim Darby is really the main character and gives a perfect performance as Madie Ross but the man who puts the spice in Grit is the late great Strother Martin! Although in the movie for a total of 10 minutesclassic Strother is what he isthe best damned character actor ever and never at a loss for words. The bargaining scenes with Darby could be entered in a shortstory movie at a film festival! Never ceases to crack me up. Bottom line the perfect Sunday in the Fall movie  from my experience 40 years of age  up appreciate this movie alot more don't ask me why I'm 37.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just caught this movie on Encore.  I'd never had much interest in seeing it based on the negative comments that have been made about it.  It was much better than I and a lot of other people gave it credit for being.  I came to the IMDB site because the credits went by too fast and I wanted to check some of the actors.  I was surprised to find that so many people really disliked this film.  First of all I'd like to point out that the original show was fantasy.  C'mondoes anyone really think that the series represented what it was like in the South Pacific during the Second World War?  It also doesn't give you much of a starting point except the characters and their interactions.  With apologies to Tim Conway Joe Flynn et. al. the original series had only one starErnest Borgnine.  It was called McHale's Navy for a reason.  So it's fitting that Tom Arnold should be the focus of the movie.  I think they did keep to the spirit of the original series and where these comments started the movie was just as much a fantasy as the series was.  In terms of the plot it too kept with the spirit of the original series.  For those of you looking for plot depth or profound characters missed the point of both the series and the movie. It was supposed to be entertainment escapism with a mild segue into reality.  If you want something profound watch Schindler's List or something by Kurasawa or anything Shakespeare by Brannagh.  But don't ask me to eat the same thing for dinner each nightI'll get tired of it and I'll yearn for cotton candy.  Movies of this type are called guilty pleasures.  They're supposed to be fun.  Having said that one man's fun is another man's Bergman.  This movie isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea but it isn't a bad movie.  Just take it for what it isa little bit of fun a little bit of fantasy.".

The TV station couldn't even get the title right. This is a bad film  a comedy that is consistently and forcefully unfunny. I didn't laugh once throughout the entire hellish running time and only managed the barest ghost of a smile on a couple of occasions. Let's face it  any film in which Tom Arnold is the star is in trouble from the off. For all I know he may well be a wonderful person but he isn't a star and he isn't a comedian. The only time he's funny is during the 'action' sequences and when he tries to act serious his nostrils flare a little and his eyes widen a touch and that's it  it's a kind of onesizefitsall expression for every emotion he is called upon to express. He's supposed to be one of those charismatic types in this film the type of guy everyone warms to the moment he opens his mouth. That's right  Tom Arnold. Did some casting executive read this part and really think to himself 'why that's a part just tailormade for that Tom Arnold chap? Hmmm. Dean Stockwell is also in this he's quite a good actor but he's awful here  in fact he hasn't been much good in anything since Married to the Mob. Tim Curry is just a cartoon character in a flesh suit these days and sleepwalks through his role. The running joke about his being the second greatest terrorist in the world is done to death in the first twenty minutes of the film and then thankfully forgotten. Only the eversolid Bill Campbell is worth a look but his part is woefully small. The TV show was around before my time so I've no point of reference with regard to how accurately this film captures the atmosphere of the show but somehow I can't believe it was as lame as this. If it was the film would never have been greenlighted.Do yourself a favour and do what everyone involved in this mess should have done give it a wide wide berth.".

The film follows her touching emotional journey revealing how her first love came to be and how she copes with the shocking loss. But yikes! This film is bad. It seems more like a shot at giving some Jidols and starlets a chance at big screen time with integrity but just because they don't have to act stupid doesn't mean they act well. Maybe they do act well but the film is so overwrought with phony angst that it's hard to tell. The music and there is lots of it is boring new age dreck and I don't mean just the soundtrack. There are several full on scenes of someone tinkling on the piano for endless minutes of boredom. The direction is of the style that lulls you to sleep by trying to force a pace of real life. In real life hours go by and nothing happens but I don't want to see a movie of that. If I see someone get into their car and drive off down a really long rode at 5 miles per hour it means I can watch them for a very long time but I don't think it makes for whoop dee doo cinma verit.

The story lacked depth.The gap between the chapter 1 and chapter 2 was just too big for us audience to follow. It was impossible for me to comprehend how the protagonist lost her mind because her fianc died because it didn't seem like they were in such a close relationship before his death. Character development was very poor and the movie ended before I connected with any of the characters.Another disappointment was Nagasawa Masami who not only acted as bad as always but lost her youthful charm as well. In fact she looked really stubby in summer clothes.I've seen my share of Japanese films so I would imagine I can handle slow movies better than most viewers but I was bored out of my mind while watching this film.

If the gov't has got nothing to hide then why can't we see all the evidence that we the American public has a right to. So I have to say it is very respectable of them to dedicate this film in memory of those perished in 911 because the victims out of everyone has the right to know what really happened and to be honest the gov't haven't shown us everything.I can't say everything in this film made sense but at least some of it is very convincing. This film has raised a lot of good questions. The American public has a right to know every answer to every question that this film has raised. Like why the small explosions in the Twin Towers after the planes have hit? I'd say that is pretty suspicious. Also where are the bodies of the passengers for the other two planes? Why can't we hear the evidence from the black boxes on the planes? I'm not saying there is any conspiracy here but I think we have a right to know.For those of you who's seen Farenhite 911. I'd say these two films could be linked together. If you knew what the Bush family has invested in the middle east then you know that is a big enough motivation for them to kill anyone in this world. That's why the old Bush went to war in the middle east and then the young Bush went to war in the middle east. No other president in US history has gone to war in the middle east. Why? Use your brains people. Where does all of Bush's money come from? Not from US tax payers thats for sure. Their money comes from the Saudi Royal Family who just happens to be good friends with Bin Laden. Where does Dick Cheaney's money come from? His money comes from his company that invests in communications of the troops in the middle east and home. Every time there's a war his stocks go up. People kill for money. It's plain and simple. We see it everyday in the news around us. For those of you that don't believe someone in our gov't with power won't kill for money. Then I'd say you need get out of your fairytale world and wake up. If you can make a billion dollars and you need to kill 3000 people in order to do it and you had the power to cover it up and no one would ever find out it's you until your dead would you do it? I'd say a lot of people would. Those of you that say you wouldn't because you never had that kind of power. Power is corruption. Wake up people.Last but not least for those of you who is dissing this film I bet you don't know anyone that has died because of 911 and you don't have a son fighting in Iraq. Because if you do you wouldn't be so quick to dismiss this film. You would use your mind and heart and question if all this is worth my loved ones to die for. Is this all worth something?

In this case to accept what Loose Change suggests is to acknowledge that your government doesn't serve the people after all but only its own secret agenda and that voters are just a necessary inconvenience in some sort of twisted Orwellian world we never knew we were part of that need to manipulated to bring them around to accept the rhetoric of the day. Crazy? In all honesty this is similar to most religions that also require blind obedience. For whatever reason there are many who think their leaders deserve their unquestioning unwavering faith and trust to accept everything and anything that is thrust upon them as necessary and true. The path of least resistance is always the easiest and most secure but alas not always right.That said the fact is that much of what Loose Change describes probably is crazy conspiracy rubbish. What it offers is merely an alternative explanation that fits the facts  something that the official account doesn't seem to do all that well. Even if 99 of the material in Loose Change is utter garbage what about that remaining 1? Doesn't that deserve your attention? Alternatively if you feel 99 of the official account is true what about that last 1 that just doesn't fit the data? Like all theories including scientific ones Loose Change will undoubtedly need to be tweaked or even completely overhauled to fit any new or contradictory information as it comes to light. Why is that such a problem? Does the official account offer that sort of flexibility? Who knows what really happened on 911 but it seems fairly clear that certain parties besides the hijackers knew what was going down.".

For those who watch Loose Change with an open mind I suggest going to www.911scholarsfortruth.org for a detailed and evolving discussion of the alternate possibilities. Videos such as Loose Change cannot cover the entire subject nor will it ultimately force the government to conduct a totally unbiased and complete investigation most of the evidence at ground zero has been destroyed anyway. As usual only time and sincere scholarly legwork may eventually reveal to us to what really happened that day. For now however those of us who find grave gaps in the official investigation must continue to question the intent of a government that desperately needed a Pearl Harbor level excuse to once again invade the Middle East. Whether this disturbing video contains truth or not it should be considered amid all the other explanations by anyone who seeks a personal truth amid the mountains of data now available on the internet. To question the official version of this event IS a patriotic act. To allow your government the luxury of unquestioning loyalty is to allow those in power the luxury of corruption.

How can anyone possibly believe this crap when i would take you 15 minutes and an internet connection to find out that more or less every single claim is simply not true.The people behind this mess simply don't have a clue. They seem to have made no actual research of their own. They have just put together a number of other peoples research without even the slightest attempt to even check if the facts are correct. If they had they would have known that Flight 77 had Rolls Royce engines and the wreckage shown in the film DOES match the engines of Flight 77. Or maybe they do know and are just lying about it.And this is certainly not the only time the film makes false claims about evidence presented on screen. They also fail to mention that not a single structural engineer supports the idea that there were bombs in the buildings. Other things such as the gold under the WTC and the faked phonecalls are just ridiculous and makes me wonder what they were smoking while making this film.And as usual with these stupid conspiracy theories they fail to present any coherent theory of what really happened they simply line up a number of lies and imagined anomalies in the official version and claim that this is evidence the government did it.But I wont go into detail about all the errors and lies in this film other websites that have done that already. The stupid message aside even the technical aspects are not that impressive the graphics are pretty ugly the music dull and even the speaker voice gets pretty annoying after a while.".

	schema:headline " A manipulative lie";
	schema:reviewBody "I was at first intrigued by this documentary. Then I researched the subject from both pro and anticonspiracy sites. I found out that this documentary is a manipulative lie.The documentary is only a compilation of old government plans and reports taken out of historical and logically context a bunch of witnessaccounts taken out of context a lot of halftruths a lot of quotes taken out of context a lot of expertsinteviews which are mostly experts in fields which has NOTHING to do with explosions airplanes or buildings a lot of poorly pictures of questionable origin and a no understanding of science. This with a Xfileskindofsoundtrack tries to manipulate the weak mind to believe in Dylan Avery's Jason Bermas' political crusade against reason logic and the established society.One of the lies made in this documentary is that you could not make cellphonecalls from an airplane in 2001 in cruisingaltitude. Because he claims that the people on flight 93 weren't alive at this point that they had been killed and that their voices were faked. THAT IS A LIE. I ask a good friend who travelled a lot back then Buisness. He confirmed to me that he could and did 2000 speak in his cellphone on the airplane  he called his wife who was giving birth. You could speak in airplanes back then the problem was that the calls was cutoff when the plane went away from a transmitter on the ground. It has not occurred for the director Dylan Avery that signals also can work vertical not only horizontally. Plus most of the calls made from flight 93 were made on airline phones not cellphones. Everybody who had just half a brain could research this for one self. This is just another example of the manipulative lies which this documentary consist of. People please do your own research point out all these conspiracy theorists mistakes  most of them don't have an education and if they do it is never technical. Another lie Dylan Avery says in this documentary is that the government used livevoicemorphingtechnology to fake the voices of the victims on flight 93. That is simply yet another manipulative lie from Dylan Avery. A voicemorphingtechnology does exist yes BUT IT IS NOT THAT ADVANCED YET. You cant use it live. It can be used for recorded voices but not live as Dylan Avery so arrogantly claims. Plus you have to have many recordings of the original voices and then calibrate the equipment to do morph voices. So if you think about it then the government would have to have tail all the passengers of flight 93 for several months before 911 if you take Dylan Avery's word. The government would have had to have track all these passengers for months and they would have had to control the will of all of these passengers to make them take an airplane 911. Because the government should have a recording of the voice to make a livemorph of it so they must have tailed them for months because they could not have relied on recording enough of their voice in the airport. And Dylan Avery claims that these supposedly CIAagents used this voicemorphtechnology to call the families of the passengers of flight 93 and then sounded so convincing talking just like them using the words they use accents and favouritecursewords and all and then convinced all the families of the passengers of flight 93? If you try to do this yourself think about how to do it then you'll see how impossible it is. So if you take Dylan Avery's word you will see how retarded his theory really is. Either he is incredible dumb or just a liar.Dylan Avery has no idea on how reality works  he lives in a fantasyworld of fairydragons and conspiracies. But we should not be so troubled by Dylan. He uses poor sources. Most of the sources are taken from the day of the attack  91101. Right back when no one knew anything of what was going on. I can remember 911 my self no one in the media knew anything. The journalists had reports that about 20 planes had been captured then 8 planes. Also we heard from the media that there was 20.000 people in the building at the time of the collapse or at least it was speculated within the first 24 after 911. There was simply massconfusion. A lot of information came to the air which did not happenwas not true. And that is what this documentary is build around  misinformation and misunderstandings. Most other sources that Dylan Avery use in this documentary have been taken from antisemitic and antiAmerican sources. Not very reliable. Because these websites and other sources has a political agenda to discredit USA Jews and Israel. They do this with misinformation and exaggerations. The only thing positive I can say about this documentary is that it is slightly better than Alex Jones' poor trash of documentaries. If you do want to watch this poorly made documentary do yourself a favour research all facts presented in this film so that you will not be mislead into believing that some evilforce is controlling everything. If you do not hold your head cool during this film then you will be taken in by the lies of this documentaries. Joseph Goebbels once said If you tell a lie which is sufficiently big and keep repeating it then people will at believe it is the truth in the end. That can also be said about this documentary and most conspiracy theories.".

	schema:headline " Facts are facts. 911 was an inside job. Period.";
	schema:reviewBody "Loose Change is a thoughtprovoking little documentary that draws attention to and questions the official story of what really happened on 911. It takes a couple of freethinking college kids to put together such a video since the media gets paid to divert our attention from real facts with inane terrorist warnings muscle hijacker tales bogus pancake theories and other heroic schlock. The events which unfolded on 911 were indeed wellcoordinated well thoughtout planned years in advance and executed with just enough to fool the average dummy military precision by not by Osama Bin Laden or Saddam Hussein that's for sure. Complete with knifetoting hijackers pulverized airplanes collapsing skyscrapers and brave firemen Hitchcock couldn't have crafted a better script. You've seen Wag the Dog haven't you? See there are actually people who believe in a 'New World Order' in which the USA is the omnipotent world power. All the Neocons do their part to contribute. The Bushes have at least eight years Clinton's run to plan their 'New Pearl Harbor' event of which the first and biggest hurdle is getting their boy into office. With the election fixed the Patsie in place the biggest hurdle is overcome. Of course this time Cheney and Rummy have to pull ALL the strings cause unlike his daddy Dubya has the IQ of a hockey puck. Once he's elected they waste no time in carrying out 911 The Big Wedding.Neoclan member Giuliani makes his pal Silverstein an offer he can't refuse  sacrifice two asbestosriddled low rent behemoths in exchange for millions in insurance money and a bonus to be determined later when Rudy becomes President? A Bush cousin just happens to be in charge of security for the entire WTC complex offering uninhibited access you WILL want to read more about this. Quite the coincidence! Schedule war games to confuse NORAD have agents at the ready to confiscate evidence immediately following the attacks cart away the thousands of pounds of steel as quickly as possible from ground zero and ship it overseas before it can be examined publish photos of all 19 hijackers within days of the event reinforcing hatred of the 'enemy' before it's even determined who the culprits are. It's genius really until Silverstein slips and admits they pulled WTC 7 on purpose. Whoops! And I doubt if one of those neoNazis realized that using so much Thermate would leave molten steel burning in pools at the foundations of the buildings for weeks. What fire ever gets hotter AFTER millions of gallons of water are poured on it? D'oh! A 757 crashed in an open field. There were no dead bodies found no luggage no seats no wire harnesses no wing sections no tail sections no nothing. Photographers weren't allowed near the shallow pit. See realistic plane crash debris in War of the Worlds. There were no Arabic names on the passenger lists of any of those planes. How were they identified so quickly if they all died and their names were not on the manifests? Hmmm.Subsequently we have been put in fear of our lives by Osama Bin Laden and other terrorists from The Axis of Evil who hate our freedom and may strike again at any time. Yeah right. The anthrax scare that immediately followed 911 was just one more trumped up plan to scare the population even further and intimidate law makers into voting for a policy the republicans needed to push their NWO. There were no mysterious middle eastern men mailing anthrax to democrats! Turns out the anthrax came from a US government lab. Just look at each detail and you will find that it was absolutely planned by the government with no other logical explanation. It's not surprising that so many of you think Loose Change is bull. The government banks on the fact that most people are simpletons who believe everything they read in the paper and take whatever the president spews in his press conferences as gospel truth. Hah! Really the one and only Conspiracy Theory here is the one published by the 911 Commission. I think Barbara Honegger said it best Only a military aircraft would have given off the 'friendly' signal needed to disable the Pentagon's antiaircraft missile batteries as it approached the building. Only the military not al Qaeda had the ability to break all of its Standard Operating Procedures to paralyze its own emergency response system on 911.".

	onyx:emotionText "Loose Change is a thoughtprovoking little documentary that draws attention to and questions the official story of what really happened on 911. It takes a couple of freethinking college kids to put together such a video since the media gets paid to divert our attention from real facts with inane terrorist warnings muscle hijacker tales bogus pancake theories and other heroic schlock. The events which unfolded on 911 were indeed wellcoordinated well thoughtout planned years in advance and executed with just enough to fool the average dummy military precision by not by Osama Bin Laden or Saddam Hussein that's for sure. Complete with knifetoting hijackers pulverized airplanes collapsing skyscrapers and brave firemen Hitchcock couldn't have crafted a better script. You've seen Wag the Dog haven't you? See there are actually people who believe in a 'New World Order' in which the USA is the omnipotent world power. All the Neocons do their part to contribute. The Bushes have at least eight years Clinton's run to plan their 'New Pearl Harbor' event of which the first and biggest hurdle is getting their boy into office. With the election fixed the Patsie in place the biggest hurdle is overcome. Of course this time Cheney and Rummy have to pull ALL the strings cause unlike his daddy Dubya has the IQ of a hockey puck. Once he's elected they waste no time in carrying out 911 The Big Wedding.Neoclan member Giuliani makes his pal Silverstein an offer he can't refuse  sacrifice two asbestosriddled low rent behemoths in exchange for millions in insurance money and a bonus to be determined later when Rudy becomes President? A Bush cousin just happens to be in charge of security for the entire WTC complex offering uninhibited access you WILL want to read more about this. Quite the coincidence! Schedule war games to confuse NORAD have agents at the ready to confiscate evidence immediately following the attacks cart away the thousands of pounds of steel as quickly as possible from ground zero and ship it overseas before it can be examined publish photos of all 19 hijackers within days of the event reinforcing hatred of the 'enemy' before it's even determined who the culprits are. It's genius really until Silverstein slips and admits they pulled WTC 7 on purpose. Whoops! And I doubt if one of those neoNazis realized that using so much Thermate would leave molten steel burning in pools at the foundations of the buildings for weeks. What fire ever gets hotter AFTER millions of gallons of water are poured on it? D'oh! A 757 crashed in an open field.

This yarn has good guys bad guys and a narrative  the basis of all good theatre.What's eminently apparent from watching 'Loose Change 2E' is that the goal of building a coherent message however 'alternative' is achieved with just enough professionalism so as to render it instantly plausible. This plausibility is perhaps not altogether factually credible but it doesn't need to be  it serves to fuel our natural penchant for inquisition seeking flaws and continuity errors and offering us the statusladen opportunity to claim bragging rights with our peers as a result.The narrator asks for answers to well considered questions with effective use of sarcasm but my main criticism is that it sadly falls into the trap of open subjectivism when giving direct opinion later on. This wasn't necessary as the implication was already palpable and the message already well developed. However the effective delivery of narration coupled with a well considered backing track combine to make this a very watchable and interesting production.In terms of the actual content I ask only what the consequences would be if the events of 911 were independently and formally investigated and this line of argument proved to be actually true??

How does a building which nowadays are constructed so very carefully free fall due to a fire in the upper segments. I'm not a great physicist but there's something wrong here. Buildings just don't free fall seriously. These are some of the more interesting discussion points and i feel that they really ought to be discussed. One final fact that they have right is that the Bush government did benefit from the attack. In favour of the sceptics bombs could have been planted by terrorists I do think bombs were planted and went off buildings don't free fall and we all know at the moment that a bomb is one of the terrorists greatest weapons.I was disappointed that they took an opinion at the end as one of the pros of the film was that it just gave evidence perhaps slightly biased and no accusations.

	schema:reviewBody "A few years back I watched the internet phenomena Loose Change 2nd Edition and was impressed a group of college kids could piece together such a convincing argumentconspiracy theory about the attacks of 911. That's not to say this argument was a flawless one in fact it was wrought with innuendo hyperbole and a handful of logical gaps. Regardless of its shortcomings LC strung together a staggering amount of coincidences so many that any reasonablelogical person would be compelled to ask the incredibly important question what really happened on 911?Last night I watched Loose Change Final Cut expecting it to be a less didactic revision of the first two editions. I was wrong. The Final Cut is a completely new reinterpretation of what went down on 911 with new evidence new footage new questions and a refined journalistic emphasis on fact vs. fantasy. FC is not only a dramatic improvement over its predecessors it's a documentary that stresses how far the truth movement has come and how much the filmmakers involved have matured.In the years between the 2nd Edition and the Final Cut writerdirectoreditor Dylan Avery has taken painstaking efforts to correct inaccuracies remove hyperbole and counter his criticsdetractors with a damning pile of evidence that simply cannot be ignored. Instead of leaping to wild conclusions as he did in the 2nd Ed. Avery soberly lets the readily available yet widely ignored facts speak for themselves. In the end the viewer is left shaking hisher head in disbelief by the volumes of questions the government of the United States of America should be forced to answer in a court of law. The bottom line here is that where there's smoke there are usually liars and the overwhelming amount of evidence stacked up that contradicts the findings of The 911 Commission Report causes pause for very serious concern.While the Bush administration may or may not be directly linked to the attacks there is no doubt they should be forced to prove in court and under oath what exactly their role was. Will any of these players ever be forced to reveal the truth? Probably not since they not only create the laws of this land they also enforce them...legally and debatably illegally. Perhaps one day we'll live in a country where the government fears its people but until that day Loose Change Final Cut proves we have should fear our government...if not for anything other than their ineptitude.As a sidebar I watched Screw Loose Change in an attempt to form as objective a stance on this topic as possible. Unfortunately the maker of SLC was never a student of The Art of Reasoning and thus would not only make a pitiful lawyer but also proves to be incredibly incompetent as a documentary filmmaker. Unfortunately SLC wears its bias on its sleeve and loses all credibility as a result. In SLC's zeal to refute everything contained within LC 2nd Ed. it jumps logical barricades with shameless ease. One example SLC attempts to refute LC 2nd Ed.'s first bit of evidence the presentation of declassified files of operation Northwoods. SLC's contention is that LC does not display any effort whatsoever to connect the two events instead it merely describes Northwoods. Instead of making a very basic observation that LC is merely attempting to establish a trendpattern in the actions of the US Government SLC asks LC to do something it later attacks it for reaching unfounded conclusions through leaps in reasoning. Perhaps SLC will follow the lead of LC and go back to the drawing board in an attempt to make a better more truthful film. If not SLC is destined for the garbage heap while LC Final Cut will likely end up being studied in Journalism courses.httpeattheblinds.blogspot.com".

I actually didn't hear of this movie until last night when I watched 911 conspiracy's show on cbc and they mentioned it. One big point is Bulding 7 that they didn't mention about the attacks and I believe that is was a controlled explosion like come on fire cant burn down a steel building in 7 hours and it wouldn't collapse straight down.

The very thought implies that not a single person in the American government have any moral values what so ever  that they would gladly sacrifice 3000 innocent people to loose a war in Iraq. But that simply is an idiotic idea. Such big and horrible secrets always leak. Always. Look at Watergate Someone in the high levels of the US Government leaked the story to the press which lead to the Watergatescandal which lead to that Nixon had to resign as president. And that was only about a simple breakin into a democratoffice what you conspiracy theorists are talking about is the biggest massmurder in modern American history. But I doubt you people know that. Watergate proves that something like 911 could not have been planned by the Government without the public knowing. Also they must have been insane to try something that stupid. Also do you conspiracytheorists really think that the white house could engineer the most elaborate attack on its self without leaving behind any proof  when they could not even hide the fact that Bill Clinton had a blowjob in the oval office?Evidently all the conspiracy claims put forth in this documentary have all been debunked by Popular Mechanics BBC The HistoryChannel 911myths.com and loosechangeguide.com.

	schema:reviewBody "I've never seen the original Loose Change but after hearing so much about it and having seen Zeitgeist The Power Of Nightmares and Freedom To Fascism i figured it was about time i gave the big one a whirl.This Final Cut seems like half a film. It's a well organised neatly structured pseudodocumentary that effectively breaks down the events of September 11th 2001 into easily digestible nuggets of information. Many many fingers are pointed at the 911 Commission's official report and the questions that were or were not in most cases asked of key witnesses. Important stuff indeed for good investigative journalism is one of the keystones of a free democratic society able to challenge its rulers on the balance of probabilities and reasonable doubt. In fact coming away from this film one is puzzled at why the official explanation is still trumpeted around as a gospel account of the tragedy. Undeniably convincing cannily constructed this really puts the administration under an uncomfortable spotlight. So why did I only give it 2 out of 10? The reason is simple. All the mud is hurled across the fence all the holes pointed out and many reasoned logical arguments are deployed in debunking the commission's account of events. But not one alternative is presented. This would be bad enough alone but further than this there are no attempts made to suggest why such a conspiracy could or would exist. There're the usual collection of experts and statistics but in a film hoping to be taken seriously this seems little more than cheap gimmickry utilised in the hope of enforcing the shakiest of arguments. Aspersions are cast as to credibility but the frightening prospect of the inside job oft hinted at is unsatisfactorily left hanging in the air without following it to its own damning conclusions.Ultimately the hole in this argument is context. No context is given to the intelligence that was or was not ignored and no context is really given to the circumstances the administration andor the FAA and FBI were operating under.I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm saying that the polarised onedimensional presentation so totally devoid of context severely undermines most if not all of what is trying to be said.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult to assign an accurate score to this film. As a propaganda piece meant to mobilize the young and the ignorant it's absolutely brilliant. The director does a terrific job at playing on the emotions and insecurities of the audience. He shapes questions as if they were answers thereby creating false assumptions in the mind of the viewer without ever making clear statements or accusations. He throws out questions like a machine succeeding phenomenally in creating a terrifying atmosphere of gloom and paranoia without needing to tie the details together. He manifests a grand conspiracytheory which seems clear and obvious without even having to offer a coherent narrative. It's clear that the authors are masters of propaganda and conspiracymongering  they seem to have an indepth understanding of human psychology and pull no punches in using it to their advantage.On the other hand as a documentary this film is a complete failure. The same points which make it such a successful propaganda piece also make it useless as a source of information. The lack of a coherent narrative means that many of their points contradict each other. The leading questions create erroneous perceptions and no answers are ever provided. The points themselves fall apart the first time you attempt to examine them. Trying to verify the claims of this film after watching it is rather like suddenly discovering the most amazing and complex machine in all of human history ... only to have it crumble to dust the moment you touch it.These shortcomings lead me to conclude that this film would probably fit better in the horror and fantasy categories which is rather apt it turns out that Loose Change was initially meant to be a fictional film and only turned into a documentary once it's authors realized they'd make more money by scamming the gullible.Overall I have to give Loose Change a 2 out of 10 just on principle. Much like with the German classic Triumph des Willens I can admire the skill of the filmmakers and the artistic merits of the movie while protesting the harm it has caused to the people who fell for it. Unlike a film which is marketed as fiction Documentaries have the power to change lives  a power which the makers of Loose Change have wantonly abused.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Loose change tries to prove that George Bush planned 911. But all the claims in this movie have been debunked. Sorry fantasylovers there is no conspiracy about 911. This movie has been debunked by Popular mechanics BBC History Channel and many others. Let me mention some of them.Dylan Avery director of Loose Change claims that airplanes could not have brought down the WTC. Avery claims that controlled demolition brought down the towers. But this is simply not true. It is true that fire from airplane fuel does not burn hot enough to melt the steel of the World Trade Center. But that is not a valid claim. Any Structural engineer would tell you that fire does not have to melt steel to make the building collapse. It only has to weaken the steel so much that the building gives in and collapses. Steel weakens and losses half its strength at 600 degrees Celsius. Fire from Jetfuel burn at 1000 degrees Celsius  do your own math of course that building collapsed because of the fire from jetfuel. It burned even hotter than the 1000 degrees Celsius because the fire also consumed plastics paper and wood so that the fire got even hotter. All the metalcabinets and other metal in the building melted from the intense heat which resulted in the melted steel you see in some footage. Also if explosives where used then they would have been registered in the seismic recorders in the city  but they weren't because no explosives where used. That been debunked next myth.The movie Loose change very arrogantly claims that all calls made from the airplanes used by terrorists on 911 all where faked by the Government using voicemodulators. This claim not only insults the people who lost loved ones on the airplanes but it is also a false claim. Dylan Avery Claims that Cellular Phones in 2001 could not possibly have made such calls from that altitude thereby proving a government conspiracy. But the thing is that almost all calls made from the airplanes on 911 where all made from airphones NOT Cellular Phones. Dylan Avery either is too incompetent to mention this fact or he deliberately lied about it. Airphones are connected by wire to the airplanes communication  which is reliable. That is one of the main claims of Loose Change and yet it is so easily debunked. The few calls from cellphones that were made where also very quickly cut off. And anyone who believes this cellphone theory really lacks common sense if the government had planned all that and did modulate the victims' voices then the Government would have had to spy on the victims for weeks before 911  to get their voices recorded. The Government also had to use really good actors to listen and play the victims over the voicemodulators because a familymember would know if the family member on the airplane did not use the same manner of speaking as before 911. This voicemodulating conspiracy theory is simply so stupid and false that I can't understand why people would believe such nonsense. But then again people do like Xfiles. That been debunked next myth. Another claim of Loose change is that World Trade Center 7 was also brought down by explosives. The reason that this conspiracy theory exist is that a TVstation filmed WTC7 collapsing from a great distance. From a great distance it actually looks like a controlled demolition but it just weren't. Loose Change claims that WTC7 was used by CIA as a controlcentre or bunker to control 911attacks on New York. And that the Government afterwards destroyed WTC7 to cover up its involvement. This is the most stupid claim ever made by any conspiracy theorists. If the government did have a controlcentre in WTC7 then it would be really stupid no RETARDED to blow up the building in front of the world. Any commander in the world world not blow something like WTC7 in front of the world when you had just carried out the biggest terror attack in history  you had just gotten away with it the most stupid thing you could do was to blow up the building. If there was something in WTC7 that could prove a Government conspiracy then they would just simply remove it. Also WTC7 was on FIRE. It was hit by debris from when WTC1 and WTC2 fell. There are tones of photos that show WTC7 on fire. Also almost all of the buildings around WTC12 where damaged on 911. Almost all of them where removed or was destroyed. WTC7 was not destroyed by CIA. Stop spreading these false conspiracy claims. They have all been debunked by big mediaconcerns like BBC History Channel and Popular Mechanics. Also Tieck out 911myths.com and loosechangeguide.com There is no conspiracy about 911  get on with your lives!".

However they are wrong. All the facts of this socalled documentary have all been debunked by Popular Mechanics BBC and the History Channel I.E. people with education which no conspiracy theorists have in fields that can be used to explain 911.The main Evidence of this socalled documentary is building 7 AKA WTC7. This building was not hit by an airplane but it did collapse anyway. The conspiracy theorists take this as proof of controlled demolition and a government conspiracy. They claim that because FBI and CIA among many others had offices in building 7 then they must have destroyed it  to destroy some computers and documents. In conspiracy thinking that is very smart to blow a whole building up just to destroy some computers and filecabinets. But in the real world that is stupid. Why not just destroy it when they world watched WTC 1 and 2. Seriously that Conspiracy theorists claim that WTC7 was brought down by explosives is a very stupid claim. If the evil Jewishilluminatishadowgovernment was behind 911 as all you conspiracy theorists claim  then would it not be stupid to blow up your command centre WTC7 if you had just carried out the biggest false flag operation in human history and gotten away with it? It would be VERY stupid to blow up the building it would have been easier to just remove all the equipment! Also WTC7 was hit by the World Trade Center when it collapsed. Almost all the buildings around WTC 1 and 2 do not stand today. They where all severely damaged when the towers fell. They all had to be torn down. The only reason you conspiracy theorists talk about WTC7 is because of the pictures of it falling. But of the hundreds of film capturing the WTC7 collapse you people only chose to use 1 film of it. You Conspiracy Theorists do not use all the footage seeing WTC7 burning and the pictures of the building damaged before collapse? Typical! But then again you people would have to lie to make people buy your wild theories.But fact is that if I produced a similar documentary where I fabricated evidence that showed that Santa Claus and Bigfoot planned 911 then all you 911conspiracy theorists would believe it blindly. You Conspiracy Theorists lack common sense. If the evil George Bush Government had planned 911 then they would NOT have used 19 Saudis as Patsies they would instead have used 20 Iraqis Afghans and Iranians  to justify the later war on terror.Stop believing in these amateurmovies like Loose Change.

All the facts are laid out in clear fashion and the music soundtrack is thankfully more subdued and muted this time around. The narration by actor Daniel Sunjata is an improvement over director Dylan Avery's sober but somewhat weak turn as narrator of the last Loose Change entry.All in all an impressive polished presentation in terms of the look and sound but more importantly it gets most of the important facts out into the forefront.Foremost amongst these facts are the findings of physicist Steven Jones  PhD who discovered along with his team of scientists explosiveincendiary material in all of the samples of 911 dust they have acquired over 20 from different sources independent from one another and how they have proved that this material is a form of highly powerful Nano Thermite which ignites at temperatures high enough to cut through steel. This material is not Sulfur as one commentator erroneously stated. It exists in the form of small chips  gray on one side red on the other  that ignite at around 430 degrees centigrade and produce tiny spheres of molten iron of the exact same chemical composition as molten iron produced as a byproduct of ignited Thermite. Through a process termed XRay Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy it has been proved by Jones and his colleagues that the microscopic particles comprising the bulk of the red part of the chips are nano particles 11 thousandth the diameter of a human hair of iron oxide and elemental aluminum  the exact key ingredients of Super Thermite or Nano Thermite. This is incendiary material that can be made to be explosive when other elements such as Silicon and Carbon are added and both of those elements were also identified by Jones et al as being intimately mixed in with the Iron Oxide and Aluminum. Their findings have yet to be adequately refuted by any official investigative body. In fact none of the four official investigations including the last and exhaustively carried out investigation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology even bothered to look at the dust nor did they even consider any hypothesis other than collapse due to damage and fire even though it is required by law to test for explosives in any fire investigation. Some investigation.So we have a material found in all the dust samples that consists of the exact ingredients of a known material that can cut through steel that ignites at 430 degrees centigrade and that produces molten iron spheres as a byproduct just like Thermite but it is not Thermite? If this were not enough we have pools of molten metal at the bases of all three buildings six weeks after their collapse and video showing molten metal literally pouring out of the south tower beginning five minutes before it's collapse and the molten metal looks absolutely and positively like the molten iron produced by Thermite go to YouTube and type in Thermite 911 to see for yourself. A fact totally ignored by defenders of the official story is that the heat produced by the fires did not exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit a temperature far too low to even weaken steel let alone melt it. It seems that they never let the facts get in the way of their faith in the official dogma.Then there is the testimony of Housing Authority official Barry Jennings who along with another man by the name of Michael Hess were witnesses to massive explosions inside WTC Seven before either tower had collapsed. As if things were not suspicious enough Jennings died suddenly last August two days before the final NIST report on the collapse of WTC Seven was released NIST said it was due solely to fire  yeah sure  it goes on and on and on and on.Attacks on this documentary and the whole 911 truth movement in general are becoming increasingly ineffectual indeed embarrassing in light of what we now know.Dylan Avery and everyone involved in this production are on the right side of history and will be vindicated in due time along with all other unbelievers of the official story. Good for them.".

As they note in the movie there is no historical precedence for the absence of wreckage into the ground ever prior to that day on 911. And I can tell you as a pilot since we all study plane crashes so as to not repeat the mistakes...this is actually a fact.Just typing this here makes me kind of paranoid because people in power...they are capable of the most heinous crimes against humanity.I for one don't doubt for a single second that men like former VP of the US Dick Cheney would happily expend a few thousand countrymen to further an agenda and line his pockets with gold. Bush didn't seem so smart but the rest of his family including Grandfather Prescott Bush or however it's spelled it's historically known that he was part of a group of fascists who offered Major General Smedley Butler 30 million US dollars to lead a fascist coup in 1934 against the then President of the United States.The Congressmen he took this to actually believed him according to the film and web references and the President apparently made a deal with the fascist group to keep himself in power and alive.I believe power can be this corrupting and even today we see in America an orchestrated effort to stop progress forward by President Obama that has actually been proved to be orchestrated by the GOP and loudmouthed operatives tasked with coming out to town hall meetings in the October 2009 Rolling stone magazine.If you're a fan of Fox news everything the left says is a conspiracy theory and the rightwingers in America are given a pass. Because they would rather jump the gun and sensationalize everything the truth often never comes out and that's okay with them because Rupert Murdoch actually can save money by playing the same garbage over and over and over and other big corporate owned media outlets have followed this example so we almost never see the truth about anything.Example after example after example is given here to show how it quite possibly was an inside job and if it were able to ever be tracked down and proved by the real patriots in America...like I don't believe very many men and women out of the CIA or the FBI would give corporate America a total pass on this just like general after general after general retired from our military so they could speak out against the Bush administration without having to deal with the consequences of making these statements while still in their own seats of power...that tells you something.Not in most of our lifetimes had we seen this but what these men in 1934 were doing was treason something we normally string people up for...or imprison for the remainder of their natural lives.Somebody weakened us and our intelligence operations by naming Valerie Plame as a covert operative in the last administration and it wasn't all about Scooter Libby...I mean who wants to spy for a nation which sells out its own agents for spite? Who? But this was treason and somebody other than Libby was never brought to justice.This is great film and I predict hard to find but you can order it online and the purchase price even if it were a hundred bucks...it would be well worth the price. Nothing is more priceless than the truth today and Americans are next to clueless as to everything in the world today.Even another documentary my pal had...something like Outfoxed which is old news and obviously about Fox news showed what a bunch of liars and fabricators of the the truth the whole organization is...You cannot believe anything coming out of Newscorp.Here they showed Bill O'Lielly as the left likes to call Mr Sextoy Google the case against him by an intern he paid off for sexual harassment...makes Clinton look like nothingreading viewer mail that said something like show a little respect and quit telling everyone who disagrees with you to shutup! to which good old Bill the yarn spinner and liar extraordinaire however it's spelled claimed I've only done that one time in six years and then they played him doing it like fifty times once even at a public event. This guy has zero class. I cannot wait until the day somebody puts this classless piece of trash's head through a wall.I cannot wait. That day is coming...and people like him and Rush Limbaugh and all the rest of the GOP owned operatives will curse the day they were born. Hallelujah!

He has now turned his conspiracy idea into a decade long career... a suspicious feat in it's own right.The Press is supposed to be about informing the electorate in an unbiased way.... Dylan Avery is as far from the press as is conceivable... Why did he need 5 iterations? Because he needed to keep his meal ticket going every time someone proved it to be a farce.Loose change's citations have changed significantly over the years as they've become increasingly obvious fabrications or contextually flawed so he's had to change them constantly to dodge the truth.Avery is outright playing on human psyche to try to say whatever he wants to say to get the most hits on the internet.... he basically hit the lottery by telling an unbelievably BS story. The film's message remains the same though If you don't agree with the extremely biased conspiracy view which focuses on partial or out of context information desperately assembled to keep his 15 minutes going... then you the viewer must be stupid.In fact this version's narration repeatedly takes a manipulative berating and sarcastic tone toward the viewer in essence declaring you a 'nonbeliever' and idiot if you have any momentary thoughts calling into question their conspiracy. There is a wealth of counterpoint to this supposed 'documentary' that you can read by googling 'debunk loose change' ... read with an open mind the entire record then make your own decision about tubeintube construction susceptibility to relatively low temperature fires and the like....It's amazing that Avery can create and refine this piece of propaganda in order to enrich himself for so long and that the masses continue to eat it up without reading for themselves.... but There's a sucker born every minute.... oh and I would bet that most who disagree with my view here reading this think PT Barnum said that... wrong again....".

And to learn that we will never know the full truth since all the debris from the building was removed really insulted me for we will never ever know the full truth thanks to the evidence being removed. Although I never had any connection to 911 I feel as if I do. And along with the families of the victims I too would have protested in removing the crash site.

However some facts remain  Scientists have discovered nanothermite in the dust from the worldtrade collapses.  3 highrise steelreinforced skyscrapers collapsed into their own footprint at nearfreefall speed.This should be more than enough to argue for a real truthful investigation since these facts can not be explained by the pancake theory.Then on top of these facts there are tons of other issues that are just insane coincidences eyewitneses and other questions that are not answered by the official explanation.And remember you can't argue against the facts with questions like Yes but thousands of people should have been involved and so many people can't keep a secret since this is also just speculation.".

Some of their suggestions like the idea of phone calls from Flight 93 being fakes would be laughable if only they hadn't been so insensitive to the families of the soon to be victims.I viewed this at a screening in a venue by the name of 'The Frontline club.' This edition of Loose Change is the best version I have seen. Several of the utterly absurd suggestions that were presented as undoubted fact in the previous releases are gone. The narration is far classier as well.However the dishonesty seen in this 'documentary' is still utterly reprehensible.This film shows no pictures of the remains of flight 77 during the clear up operation and investigation and instead suggests the insane idea of a military plane hitting the pentagon. It focuses on the poor videos and pictures of the impact and prior to the impact and insists there isn't any clear evidence that flight 77 struck the pentagon. But it ignores the flight 77 debris and most of the passenger's DNA that was found at the site of the pentagon.The film suggests that the fireballs and compressed air getting ejected from the towers as they collapsed were actually detonation blasts! It devotes a sizable portion of the film to Stepehn E. Jones the physicist and now retired professor who never and presents his theory of the twin towers being brought down by controlled demolition as compelling evidence. However it ignores that Jones's theory has been met with criticism by people who do have a background in building collapse forensics and by Brigham Young University's The university Mr. Jones served at department of civil environmental and engineering. While it is true that chemicals of thermate were found in the dust there were natural sources for these chemicals to come from. This documentary is incredibly biased in not dealing with questions raised about Stephen Jone's paper and ideas.The coverage of WTC 7 was disgraceful! To suggest as this film did that there were just a few controllable fires in the building while showing footage of only the North face outrageous! While its true most of the footage taken of WTC 7 was taken at the North side there is fortunately some footage from the South side that shows the extent of the raging fires being hosed down by fireman and not showing any let up. But unfortunately none of this was shown.If your looking for a good story and 90 minutes of entertainment then this is fair enough. The music and editing were good the narration was well spoken and dramatic. But if you want an assessment of the conspiracy theories out there I would suggest an impartial program that doesn't deceitfully neglect footage that counters their agenda.".

For one thing I seriously doubt our government would let a European news station in on them being the mastermind behind the worst attack on US soil since Pearl Harbor. Seriously? Also go watch the news reports again everyone was talking about the WTC7 coming down because the firefighters heard it groaning and it was fully engulfed and had a giant chunk taken out of it. The news station misunderstood It will come down for It has come down due to how many people the news passed through on the way to the reporter. They also claim that no plane hit the pentagon and that it must have been a cruise missile despite all the eye witnesses and a number of light post that were knocked down which could have only occurred if the missile did some serious zig zag maneuvering to hit them before striking the pentagon. I think a planes wingspan hitting them seems more logical. Go type in 911 Case Study Pentagon Flight 77 in youtube and you will get a very clear picture of what happened. I could go on and on but if you take some time to research yourselves then it's not hard to find the facts. However if you want a good place to go with a great presentation of the facts then you can visit httpwww.youtube.comuserRKOwens4 . It contains several videos closely examining the different accusations and even sheds some light on new information.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a skeptic of the 911 myth since 9112001 just based on what i saw and heard that day. When i began to learn others questioned the official story i was thrilled to learn more. Then in 2007 when Dylan Avery and Korey Rowe produced their first edition of this documentary i was overwhelmed and have shared the film in its various incarnations with well over a dozen screenings. It always has an impact. I see that other IMDb reviewers have labeled people who challenge the official version of 911 as the tin foil hat brigade but considering the number of times our government has straight up lied to us and then been caught i was say the tin foil club are the people who blindly accept whatever swill our government puts out. As Jesse Ventura recently vented on The View My government killed 58000 of my generation in Vietnam on a lie what makes you think they wouldn't sacrifice 3000 to get what they want? Over the past several years initial smalltimers now transformed into internationally acclaimed activists Dylan Avery and Korey Rowe have challenged the official story of 911 with a series of spectacular documentaries not just reedits but whole new films continuously evolving their presentation as newer evidence comes in. In a scientific approach they have formed hypotheses presented them and then rejected and replaced them in favor of other approaches as different info comes to light. The several different installments of Loose Change have continuously refined the messagetossing aside the more sensational claims made in earlier incarnations and now Avery and Rowe have formed a pretty solid indictment by the time they finished Loose Change An American Coup. The problem for me was i liked the sensational stuff of the earlier versions better. And the breathless narration and the driving music. Once upon a time Loose Change was a sensational knockout that felt as subversive as its subject matter now it's a very good very serious film. The dilemma for us as audience is that veracity has come at a price of entertainment value not by much but enough to where it is worth noting if the viewer hasn't seen any other versions. The second edition i felt was the strongest versionthough it turns out some of their original assertions didn't hold up. But the pacing and the music of the earlier versions of this film series were so much more entertaining it is sometimes hard for me to remember the newer editions are improvements. This most recent edition is also more polished done with a bigger staff more elaborate in establishing its veracity and more historically grounded just not as pulsepounding. Don't misunderstand though this series is one of the most important docs ever to circulate and one of the biggest causes in American history and this edition has the best set of facts presented in the most rigorously evaluated way. Show this version to anyone who hasn't seen any versions since its version of the truth is the most probable.All that said after you've seen their truest vision go back to earlier editions for the more exciting film making. Maybe Avery and Rowe still haven't found all the answers but they make a solid effort with a series of progressively more professional quality films. I don't know if they'll ever get to the bottom of the mysteries around 911 but they've certainly learned how to be movie makes par excellence while on the quest.".

You can't really blame them though as when your premise is so absurd it doesn't leave you a lot to work with. They even go to the steel doesn't melt absurdityhow is it made then you genius. Two pictures of the same area but having completely different landmarks. Lies of when Bush was told about the towers falling omissions of important facts like the short times the flights were in the airby design explosions from the bottom of the buildings while they show video of the buildings falling from the toptake a physics class moron an interview with someone from the Department of Agriculture that supposedly had an odd conversation with one of the hijackers that was never reportedand no video of her saying any of it and a general naivet of life in general. They quote few to none of their sources except the left wing nut jobs that have the same no proof that they have. This is a slap in the face to anyone with common sense the people that died on that horrible day their families and to be honest the United States of America. They should be ashamed of themselves and should not claim to be Americans. This work of fiction could be considered a comedy as most of it is so laughable if it weren't for the screaming you will do at the TV for being insulted and the huge crap they take on America and the families affected. A don't mind a dissenting view in a documentary or otherwise but it should be at least close to fact based. This lacks anything that could be considered fact and leaves you scratching your head wondering if anyone is dumb enough to believe any of this to the point of putting this mindless drivel on film and releasing it. Please if you watch this use your brain on the pathetic obvious things and do research on the rest before you look as dumb as these film makers in public.".

Lies of when Bush was told about the towers falling omissions of important facts like the short times the flights were in the airby design explosions from the bottom of the buildings while they show video of the buildings falling from the toptake a physics class moron an interview with someone from the Department of Agriculture that supposedly had an odd conversation with one of the hijackers that was never reportedand no video of her saying any of it and a general naivet of life in general. They quote few to none of their sources except the left wing nut jobs that have the same no proof that they have. This is a slap in the face to anyone with common sense the people that died on that horrible day their families and to be honest the United States of America. They should be ashamed of themselves and should not claim to be Americans. This work of fiction could be considered a comedy as most of it is so laughable if it weren't for the screaming you will do at the TV for being insulted and the huge crap they take on America and the families affected. A don't mind a dissenting view in a documentary or otherwise but it should be at least close to fact based. This lacks anything that could be considered fact and leaves you scratching your head wondering if anyone is dumb enough to believe any of this to the point of putting this mindless drivel on film and releasing it. Please if you watch this use your brain on the pathetic obvious things and do research on the rest before you look as dumb as these film makers in public.";

Our Government can't even build a functioning website with an army of people and 600 million dollars to do it with. In an age of all out social media the internet and 24 hour news cycles this garbage just proves that the human race especially people who believe this inside Job crap are getting dumber by the day.Let's look at another conspiracy and how dumb people are. When crop circles first started popping up in England everyone thought they were made by UFO's. Idiots everywhere came out in their tin foil hats marveling at how no human could have done something like this over night with out anyone seeing or hearing anything. Whole crazy people industries started popping up around this. Suddenly 2 old British dudes came out and said they had been the ones making them. They showed how they did it and how they did it so fast and their demonstrations came out as perfect replicas of the UFO ones. Not being able to do something that big and that fast turned out to be entirely possible and only needed 2 old pranksters 2 wooden planks and two pieces of rope. Still their are idiots running around refusing to believe that still say it is ufo's and using all sorts of technology to claim radiation is being emitted from them and every thing else. Grow up and put on your big girl panties believers truthers or what ever you call yourselves. At least the Kennedy conspiracy was a small bit believable since most theories talked about a few guys on the grassy knoll. For 911 to be an inside job would have taken hundreds of people to be perfectly organized which if you have ever human beings at work you know that is just impossible.".

One thing that cracked me up  they talked about the people that were on the flight that hit the Pentagon... some of them worked for the ARMY NAVY and many of them worked for LOCKHEED and BOEING!!!! Really? So people that worked in the Washington DC area had some connection to either the military or military contractors? WHAT A SHOCKER!!! Oh but wait almost within the same breath the film is telling us that the Pentagon was not hit with a commercial aircraft. So which is it? Was the plane filled with DOD and contractor personnel or did a missile hit the Pentagon? And what about the eyewitnesses on the ground that SAW a plane flying low and into the Pentagon?Then there's the WTC issues. The 2nd plane that hit the WTC crashed into it very close to a corner of the building. Very soon after that it's PLAINLY seen that about the upper 13 of the building was leaning over. If anyone thinks that a structure can have 13 of it's weight shifted like that and STILL remain upright.... well such a person obviously lacks common sense. Sure enough that building was the first of the 2 to fall.Anyway this movie is so ridiculous in it's omissions. I know there are other documentaries that debunk this movie. I'd definitely recommend that no one waste their time watching this garbage because it's so full of untruths and contradictions. You can ALWAYS tell that movies like this are a piece of crap  if they could rely on the truth to convince us they'd merely tell the truth. But they can't do that  they tell halftruths they leave out all kinds of proved facts they give one version of the story when there are hundreds of people that can give another version.... sheer silliness is what this amounts to.".

And How do three modern concrete and reinforced steel skyscrapers collapse uniformly and into their own footprints because of fires? And Why is there no mention in the '911 Commission Report' of police and firefighter testimony of 'explosions' in all three buildings prior to their collapse and why is WTC 7 not even mentioned in the report? The History Channel's hit piece was flawed and vague providing much conjecture and provided little in the way of forensic facts that adhere to the fundamentals of physics.The writersproducers of the Loose Change series and those 911 Truther documentaries and websites that rose up afterward will all be vindicated.

Hardly surprising since the art directors are George W. Davis and Merrill Pye who worked on some of those films. Those who have seen One Of Our Spies Is Missing for example will know what I mean. For me this is one of the King's more enjoyable movies with a reasonable storyline for Presley's usual standards and he sings Long Legged Woman With The Short Dress On one of my favourite tunes which is proving VERY hard to find on CD. The film also features Norman Rossington the only actor to appear with both The Beatles and Elvis as a hapless diamond smuggler. John Williams is well cast as the smooth and scheming Gerald Waverley. The only downside is the fact that Elvis who is without doubt one of the most important figures in the development of popular music has to sing OLD MACDONALD. But fast forward past that bit and the rest of the film isn't at all bad.".

The film also features Norman Rossington the only actor to appear with both The Beatles and Elvis as a hapless diamond smuggler. John Williams is well cast as the smooth and scheming Gerald Waverley. The only downside is the fact that Elvis who is without doubt one of the most important figures in the development of popular music has to sing OLD MACDONALD. But fast forward past that bit and the rest of the film isn't at all bad.";

Those are some of the highlights anyway. In truth this film is among my very least favorite of Elvis films even judging by the somewhat unique standards of the '60s travelogue Technicolor musicals that became the standard by 1962. The formula had worn thin by 1965 Frankie And Johnnie Harum Scarum Paradise Hawaiian Style to say the least and  other than some bright points in Spinout and the entirety of Easy Come Easy Go like Double Trouble shot in 1966...for some reason I like that crazy film  nothing got better in my opinion until the formula changed radically with 1968's Stay Away Joe and Live A Little Love A Little. The period 19651967 was Elvis' nadir in other words though the May 1966 Nashville sessions that yielded the immaculate How Great Thou Art gospel album and a few stellar secular songs including a definitive take on one of Bob Dylan's songs and recentlysurfaced home recordings from that period show all too well how phenomenal Elvis' talent was at the time a contrast that would anger and frustrate anyone who cared about his place in American and world culture and history. But we have what we have and the criminal waste of talent that to a great extent represented Elvis' film career during this time is undeniable but shouldn't necessarily result in us writing off the results out of hand for that reason alone. There are a few moments in this film that are good and a few when Elvis seems to actually be engaged rather than bored with the whole proceedings and just sleepwalking through it to fulfill contractual obligations. There're some great actors in supporting roles too like Leon Askin General Burkhalter! Chips Rafferty John Williams Norman Rossington the only actor to appear in films with the Beatles and Elvis and Michael Murphy. Annette Day is kind of lackluster in the lead female role. Yvonne Romain is much more like it. And the Wiere Brothers have always irritated the hell out of me in this film  wish they were not in it because they really stupid things up.The songs are not the greatest even compared to other songs from Elvis movies of this time but I do like the title track Long Legged Girl a tasty song actually written by Joy Byers who usually contributed great songs even to otherwise notsogreat movies such as Let Yourself Go in Speedway and the jazzy City By Night. Could I Fall In Love is a nice ballad a duet of Elvis with Elvis but the entire June 1966 session for this movie suffered from sonic problems and I believe it's one that Elvis complained vociferously about. I also believe that Elvis walked out on recording Old McDonald before he'd produced an acceptable master take being totally disgusted by the task and the master was spliced from what the engineers had captured. Not his greatest recorded moment anyway. And darn it it and the rest of the soundtrack was recorded on my second birthday.IMDb mixes up the screen character credits for Chips Rafferty and Norman Rossington but to be fair so does the end title sequence in the film. Oops.".

	schema:reviewBody "Elvis Presley was a hugely influential performer with one of the most distinctive singing voices of anybody. He embarked on a film career consisting of 33 films from 1956 to 1969 films that did well at the boxoffice but mostly panned critically especially his later films and while he was a highly charismatic performer he was never considered a great actor.As said many times a lot of Elvis' early efforts were decent or more his five best films overall being 'King Creole' 'Flaming Star' 'Jailhouse Rock' 'Viva Las Vegas' and 'Loving You'. It was from 'Kissin' Cousins' his first real mediocre at best effort onward when his films became hit and miss or worse. While Elvis certainly did worse like 'Harum Scarum' 'Double Trouble' generally is down there with his weakest.Regarding Elvis himself there is more of the relaxed charisma and the enthusiastic charm than in most of his 19657 output most of which he looked utterly disinterested in the role really doesn't require much but he does his best and while he has looked in better shape he still sounds good. A few of the songs are decent Long Legged Girl is the best of the lot and for a song from an Elvis film from this period is good. City of Night and Could I Fall in Love also fare well.Some of the supporting cast also don't fare too badly considering what they were given to work with. Fun Leon Askin lovable Norman Rossington urbane John Williams and sultry Yvonne Romain come off best. Chips Rafferty is quite good too.However not all the supporting cast and songs work. Annette Day's acting inexperience comes through loud and clear in a performance that neglects any acting ability of any kind. She shares very little chemistry with Elvis either. Michael Murphy in his screen debut does his best and gives a creepiness at times but in a way where the darkness doesn't balance particularly well with the rest of the film. Stanley Adams and Walter Burke try too hard in bumbling roles more at home in a sitcom and the Wiere Brothers are just annoying and don't fit.Apart from a few songs the rest of the soundtrack suffers from being very forgettable very sloppy lipsynchronisation very rarely in time and from being poorly recorded almost like the equipment used was on its last legs and on the verge of breaking down any second. Only one of them reaches risible level though and that's Old MacDonald Had a Farm even Elvis himself looks embarrassed.Norman Taurog's a wildly variable director dependent on the material direction is all over the map. As is the corny even for an Elvis film and wildly disjointed script that is far too busy and a story that is a mess of style structure and tone again trying to do too much and very little of it comes together just didn't see the point of the diamond subplot especially considering how barely remembered it is in the film.Overall not awful but messy. Really strictly for the fans and most likely even they will be pining for a film that lives up to Elvis' considerable talents rather than working against them. 410 Bethany Cox".

Fun Leon Askin lovable Norman Rossington urbane John Williams and sultry Yvonne Romain come off best. Chips Rafferty is quite good too.However not all the supporting cast and songs work. Annette Day's acting inexperience comes through loud and clear in a performance that neglects any acting ability of any kind. She shares very little chemistry with Elvis either. Michael Murphy in his screen debut does his best and gives a creepiness at times but in a way where the darkness doesn't balance particularly well with the rest of the film. Stanley Adams and Walter Burke try too hard in bumbling roles more at home in a sitcom and the Wiere Brothers are just annoying and don't fit.Apart from a few songs the rest of the soundtrack suffers from being very forgettable very sloppy lipsynchronisation very rarely in time and from being poorly recorded almost like the equipment used was on its last legs and on the verge of breaking down any second. Only one of them reaches risible level though and that's Old MacDonald Had a Farm even Elvis himself looks embarrassed.Norman Taurog's a wildly variable director dependent on the material direction is all over the map. As is the corny even for an Elvis film and wildly disjointed script that is far too busy and a story that is a mess of style structure and tone again trying to do too much and very little of it comes together just didn't see the point of the diamond subplot especially considering how barely remembered it is in the film.Overall not awful but messy. Really strictly for the fans and most likely even they will be pining for a film that lives up to Elvis' considerable talents rather than working against them. 410 Bethany Cox";

However they hit upon hard times when Diana's real estate work dries up and soon the pair decide that the only option available to them is a literal last throw of the dice with their last few thousand in Vegas. Despite an early winning streak they end up worse than they started. About to head off Diana catches the eye of gambling billionaire John Gage who uses her as a lucky charm to win another million or so. Afterwards they get together to play some pool and Gage turns the conversation to the idea of what money can and can't buy  specifically offering the Murphy's a cool 1000000 for one night spent with Diana.When this film came out the basic concept was enough to give it lots of free advertising by getting the nation asking itself what would I do? and all the hype over that allowed the producers of the film to avoid people finding out that there really wasn't much worth seeing passed this question. It should have been so different though because it could have been a classic morality tale that went deep within the characters to see what is there. However it doesn't really do this and instead we are left with a rather vacuous affair that is given plenty of gloss but is essentially lacking in interesting things to say. The tensions between David and Diana never get beyond the level of strops and it never even makes an attempt at moral debate.The fact that the characters are so thin doesn't help either. David and Diana are basic but the real failing is in Gage he should be a rather sinister figure who plays with people like he plays with his money but instead he is just a twinkling eye and a sly smile  in fact he is Robert Redford. This is part of the problem because although the material is weak the cast cannot do anything to improve the situation. Redford is far too smooth and playboyish to really convince in the main role  he cannot tap into any darkness or complexity and his failing is just one of the film's failings. Moore doesn't help either with a basic role where she doesn't seem to understand what her character is supposed to be feeling and therefore cannot convince in many of her scenes. Meanwhile Harrelson puffs and blows on cue but adds little. The support cast features turns from Platt Cassel Connelly and Thornton but aside from being recognisable faces they don't add much. Lyne directs with typical glossy style but he has no clue how to get deeper into the characters and story so instead just throws in lots of exploitative but empty scenes in the hope of somehow emotionally engaging his audience.Overall this is not an awful film but it is so superficial and hollow that it is just bland and glossy. It only is made worse when you think of the potential it had to be a complex and insightful modern morally piece. Those happy with the substance and complexity of a slushy music video will enjoy it but the majority will leave it wondering what all the fuss was about and how such an interesting concept was so completely fouled up.".

Redford is far too smooth and playboyish to really convince in the main role  he cannot tap into any darkness or complexity and his failing is just one of the film's failings. Moore doesn't help either with a basic role where she doesn't seem to understand what her character is supposed to be feeling and therefore cannot convince in many of her scenes. Meanwhile Harrelson puffs and blows on cue but adds little. The support cast features turns from Platt Cassel Connelly and Thornton but aside from being recognisable faces they don't add much. Lyne directs with typical glossy style but he has no clue how to get deeper into the characters and story so instead just throws in lots of exploitative but empty scenes in the hope of somehow emotionally engaging his audience.Overall this is not an awful film but it is so superficial and hollow that it is just bland and glossy. It only is made worse when you think of the potential it had to be a complex and insightful modern morally piece. Those happy with the substance and complexity of a slushy music video will enjoy it but the majority will leave it wondering what all the fuss was about and how such an interesting concept was so completely fouled up.";

Indecent Proposal could have been a very thought provoking look at the struggle of love fidelity and morality when money is offered but in the far from expert hands of Adrian Lyne it's become a biased look at prostitution that's shot like an ice cream commercial.Adrian Lyne is known for making films that involve some type of male to female dilemma 9 12 weeks Fatal Attraction et al.  But as in the two mentioned films he always seems to take the male point of view. Woody Harrelson's character is the central character in this film.  After Demi Moore sleeps with Robert Redford who does the film focus on?  Him.  We see his despair his pain not hers.  She seems to take to prostitution like a duck to orange sauce.  So what is Lyne saying? Is he saying its harder to become a pimp than to become a prostitute?  That's the impression I'm getting.  Look at Demi's character before and after her night with Robert Redford.  In all the scenes before she seems awkward and certainly not happy.  In all the scenes after she seems to glow with confidence and contentment.  What is Lyne saying here? Is it that money DOES buy happiness? Also the casting is an expert exercise in marketing.  The concept of sleeping with Robert Redford for a million dollars is definitely one of the things that drew many women to this film.  I think many women would do it for their taxi fair home and no complaints.  Demi and Woody are also gorgeous enough to make it work.  Imagine if the couple were black Hispanic or any minority group and the rich man was some slobbish red neck  the film take on a much darker tone altogether.I can understand why so many women liked this film but the chauvinistic nature of this film is staring you right in the face.  I'd suggest people watch the film again bearing in mind the points that I've made.".

If they stay together it's not because they forget but because they forgive.  This movie explores what can happen to even the most rocksolid couples when they allow money to make them do things they would never dream of doing otherwise.  Somehow when you're dealing with a monetary figure the size of 1000000 it's easy to forget that what you're actually doing to get that money is absolutely no different than what the girls on Sunset Boulevard are doing.  For a much lower price yes but it's still the exact same thing.  In the movie their love in the end was strong enough to overcome the damage they'd caused each other by doing this heinous thing but I don't know that your average couple in real life could overcome it.  What they'd done would always be between them.  Powerful performances by Moore and Redford but the best and most surprising performance comes from Woody Harrelson.  I didn't know he had it in him to show such a broad range of emotion.  Quite a departure from his bartender role at Cheers!  I absolutely love the movie's very appropriate theme song No Ordinary Love by Sade.  Great movie for everyone but is an especially important message to be obtained for those in love.".

The aftermath of that one night is what the movie is really all about. Unfortunately nothing in that aftermath is the least bit entertaining. The script is so predictable you can say the characters' lines before they do. The performances leave much to be desired. Harrelson would be better off sticking to comedies as this attempt at serious acting completely misses the mark. Anguish is not something he seems capable of portraying. And it is quite safe to say that Demi Moore will never have to clear space in her home for any Academy Awards. Why is she a movie star again? In a part that should be full of emotion she conveys none. Only Redford escapes mostly unscathed. He's appropriately slimy yet suave and clearly the best actor of the bunch.

	schema:reviewBody "INDECENT PROPOSAL is a great example of a great premise for a movie  Would you allow your wife to sleep with a complete stranger for one million dollars ? and it's not too difficult to understand why this movie was so talked about on its initial release . Well would you ? The one problem that the movie suffers from is that Robert Redford was cast as John Gage  the middle aged billionaire who desires the company of Demi Moore's character Diane Murphy . Robert Redford who aged in his mid fifties looks about ten years younger and who still female fans to this day . One can't help thinking that Adrian Lyne would have been far better off exploiting the premise further by casting a much more physically repulsive actor as Gage . Some defenders may claim that Redford equals good box office and certainly this movie did superbly as far as world wide receipt's go  but it's a movie whose main selling point must be the simple central idea and would have perhaps ended up a much better film . It's interesting to note that when women in their late 30s to early 50s answer the question  Would you ?  they usually end up replying  Robert Redford ! I'd go to bed with him for free  . INDECENT PROPOSAL isn't a great movie despite the great premise and I found Lyne's directing style a bit too 1980s with a couple of scenes that are a bit too pop video for my liking but despite not being the greatest actors in the history of cinema both Moore and Woody Harrelson do enough to make the audience feel for their characters who find themselves in a dilemma . Yeah maybe it's Hollywood trash but it's engaging Hollywood trash".

	onyx:emotionText "INDECENT PROPOSAL is a great example of a great premise for a movie  Would you allow your wife to sleep with a complete stranger for one million dollars ? and it's not too difficult to understand why this movie was so talked about on its initial release . Well would you ? The one problem that the movie suffers from is that Robert Redford was cast as John Gage  the middle aged billionaire who desires the company of Demi Moore's character Diane Murphy . Robert Redford who aged in his mid fifties looks about ten years younger and who still female fans to this day . One can't help thinking that Adrian Lyne would have been far better off exploiting the premise further by casting a much more physically repulsive actor as Gage . Some defenders may claim that Redford equals good box office and certainly this movie did superbly as far as world wide receipt's go  but it's a movie whose main selling point must be the simple central idea and would have perhaps ended up a much better film . It's interesting to note that when women in their late 30s to early 50s answer the question  Would you ?  they usually end up replying  Robert Redford ! I'd go to bed with him for free  . INDECENT PROPOSAL isn't a great movie despite the great premise and I found Lyne's directing style a bit too 1980s with a couple of scenes that are a bit too pop video for my liking but despite not being the greatest actors in the history of cinema both Moore and Woody Harrelson do enough to make the audience feel for their characters who find themselves in a dilemma . Yeah maybe it's Hollywood trash but it's engaging Hollywood trash";

	schema:reviewBody "What would you do if a billionaire were consenting to pay you one million dollars or more for one night with your wife? This is the titular Indecent Proposal on which millions of viewers men and women have been debating for years placing themselves in the same tricky situation than David Woody Harrelson and Diana Demi Moore the illfated couple who met the devilishly sexy John Gage Robert Redford in Las Vegas. I remember when I was younger there was a guy in my neighborhood who told me that in every woman there was a potential prostitute. To confront him to his own contradictions I carefully asked him whether that statement also applied to his family. The cynical macho nodded but felt the need to reformulate his thought he meant that there was no woman in the world who wouldn't sleep with a man if she needed something that's potential prostitution and I must confess I was almost convinced. And Indecent Proposal is all the more interesting because it confronts this option not to a woman but a couple. The husband is part of the game and that's the strike of genius some distracted critics failed to grasp. Think about it did Jack Engelheard the author of the original novel of the same name take for granted that a single woman wouldn't have thought twice before accepting the deal? I bet he did and I happen to think the same. Refusing wouldn't be honorable but stupid and I'm sure many women would agree with me. We're speaking of one million dollars for a sumptuous night and not with the ugliest man in the world. I bet when today's women visualize the myth of the Charming Prince they rather picture Robert Redford or Brad Pitt as a billionaire than the nameless Princes of Disney classics. We'd all need money to achieve our dreams and selling one's soul for one night with one handsome rich guy and one million dollars isn't too high a price.But the film is cleverly provocative because it already admits the venal nature of women which provoked the anger of feminists. But I'd love to see them in Diana's heels. The question isn't whether they would have accepted the night for one million but how about two or ten how high could John Gage raise the stakes before they'd say yes? That was the point and we got it money can buy a body but how about love? It all comes to David. And that's the subtlety the angry mob of feminists missed just like the intellectually eminent critics the film also highlights the very hypocrisy of men who brand any woman who sleeps with other men as 'broad' or 'whore' by confronting them to the same situation. And I would have loved to ask the question to my macho friend what if he was in David's place? Wouldn't there be after all in every husband or boyfriend a potential pimp?To answer that watching the film isn't even necessary it's all part of cinematic popculture and we all have an opinion on the subject. In fact if Adrian Lyne's film had one merit it was to feature one of the most memorable premises of Cinema's history and handle it with a believable mix of realism and romanticism. It is crucial within the context of the film because the theme is so sleazy it had to be washed up by a poignant love story. And on that level the chemistry between Harrelson and Moore worked and built our empathy toward this couple of sweethearts watching the ashes of their fantasy dreams gone with the wind of the 90's crisis. In many other films that the husband is an architect and the wife a real estate agent would only be details but they're pivotal factd in Indecent Proposal.Indeed after the bursting of the US housing bubble there was no offer for Diana and no demand for David. Inevitably their descent into poverty guide their hopes toward Las Vegas an interesting setting where two worlds coexist people who need money and can't afford losing and those who've got enough to lose one million a night without even caring. The film even succeeds to make a brilliant social commentary behind the appearance of a cheap softporn flick it subtly denounces the pervert aspects of liberalism where free trade is synonym of salvation at the expenses of principles totally worthless when money is at stakes. And the world sunk into liberal lows so eagerly it ended up giving a price to anything and people have been so effectively brainwashed by greed and lust they would look now at the halffull glass. Isn't there one word to say 'crisis' and 'opportunity' in Chinese? I live in a country where many beautiful girls students or salaried go out with mature men because they buy them things they can't afford. Basically they use their charm as an asset to overcome material problems. It's certainly what lured my macho friend into his certitude. But when you take the plot to a larger scope you realize it's less the sellingyour body dilemma than the eternal sellingthesoultothedevil story doing something morally wrong for a payoff. Movies are made to provide some interesting 'what if' situations? What if we lived the same day again and again? What if we hadn't existed? Indecent Proposal is the ultimate 'what if' asker because this time we can respond to the plot and relate to the protagonists even more because we live in a similar economic context and the world is crazy enough to feature such characters as John Gage. And Redford finds the perfect tone for his character subtly obnoxious but always charming one hell of a tempter!And I guess part of the fascination doesn't come from our relief not to be in David and Diana's shoes but from our regret. And that my friends is pure subversive brilliance!".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning may be some spoilersIndecent Proposal is a film that knows exactly how someone feels when it comes to jealousy.  There is a great line in the film after Demi Moore comes back from her encounter with gazillionaire Robert Redford.  Her husband played perfectly by Woody Harlesson is asking her questions that don't need to be answered.  Because if they are it will put a damper in their marriage.  But he persists and finally Demi shouts out to him  If I tell you he wasn't any good then I'm a liar.  If I tell you that he was then I'm a whore.   What a brilliantly written line and it is one that lends a perfect ear to what the film is about in most senses.  Jealousy is a powerful emotion but being broke and in love is just as powerful on the other end of the scale.  What is so great about this film is that is makes us all question what we would do in that exact same situation.  Would you let your wife sleep with a man for one million dollars?  Could you look at it and say that it was only one night and you can deal with it?  Would you say that your marriage is strong enough to overcome something so meaningless?  And that is the key issue right there.  Is it really that meaningless?  If you are married and in love  if you are together in a monogamous relationship is there ever a time when sex is meaningless enough to overlook even if all of your financial problems are solved in the aftermath?Indecent Proposal is a great film in almost every sense.  The actors are great especially Oliver Platt who has a cameo as their lawyer and he gets all the laughs.  The direction is great as it never gets anywhere close to pornographic and it lets the audience decide for themselves what happened on that fateful night.  When you look at the whole concept of the film you know it could get cheesy if handled poorly and irresponcibly.  But it never does.  It stays on course and delivers the goods.  I highly recommend this film and I think it is good to watch it with someone that you love.  It will invoke some very interesting conversations after words.  But don't watch it with them if you are afraid of the answers that you might get.  That to me is good film making.  Something that leaves you discussing it long after it is over.  Indecent Proposal does that.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the biggest pieces of crap I have ever had to watch. I mean seriously. How would anybody else feel if they were in Woody Harrelson's shoes and your wife was even CONSIDERING it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million bucks. After all she was the one talking about it in bed and saying how it would be good for them since he can build his house or whatever with that money. Woody never fully agreed to it until she talked him into it. How CAN you trust her? Who the hell would actually even consider that if they were married? I don't care how desperate they were. That's the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in my life. Then he flips out on her. Apparently he had no right to mistrust her other than the fact that his wife just slept with another dude who is extremely rich and handsome. Oh and wait then he's supposed to apologize to HER after she files for the divorce so she can be with the guy she slept with. Of course Woody has no right to say anything to her or mistrust her especially after she still has Roy Hobb's card in her wallet. Then at the end of the movie she's apparently so in love with Woody still and misses him so much that she was not going to leave Hobbs until he made some ridiculously stupid story up to try to hint to her to leave and she bleeping thanks Hobbs???? Are you bleeping kidding me? Was she under contract as his sex slave or something?? I mean what the bleep?? Oh and wait it gets better.

Smooch smooch smooch even though I'm still married to a guy I left for a rich guy. I have never seen such a piece of crap in my life. How the hell are we supposed to feel good after that horrible ending? What was this movie supposed to represent? NOTHING CAME OUT OF THIS! This was the most pointless movie I have ever seen in my life. Two pathetic desperate people. If I were Woody I would tell her to go drown herself in that body of water they were near.

How would anybody else feel if they were in Woody Harrelson's shoes and your wife was even CONSIDERING it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million bucks. After all she was the one talking about it in bed and saying how it would be good for them since he can build his house or whatever with that money. Woody never fully agreed to it until she talked him into it. How CAN you trust her? Who the hell would actually even consider that if they were married? I don't care how desperate they were. That's the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in my life. Then he flips out on her. Apparently he had no right to mistrust her other than the fact that his wife just slept with another dude who is extremely rich and handsome. Oh and wait then he's supposed to apologize to HER after she files for the divorce so she can be with the guy she slept with. Of course Woody has no right to say anything to her or mistrust her especially after she still has Roy Hobb's card in her wallet. Then at the end of the movie she's apparently so in love with Woody still and misses him so much that she was not going to leave Hobbs until he made some ridiculously stupid story up to try to hint to her to leave and she bleeping thanks Hobbs???? Are you bleeping kidding me? Was she under contract as his sex slave or something?? I mean what the bleep?? Oh and wait it gets better. She bleeping kisses him passionately before she gets out of the car. Yea she's not a whore. Oh thank you for letting me go let me go make out with you one last time for good ole' sake.

	schema:reviewBody "Keeping personal views out of comments are what objectively reviewing a film is all about. I have to say this film is one that can pull at heart strings if you can immerse yourself in the emotion of what is actually happening. The film's premise is Love versus Money. The plot of the film is set to slowly pull you into the characters' who are presented with the temptation of the choice. Woody Harrelson really pulls off a serious character in this one. Having taken the deal from John Gage Robert Redford to give away his wife for one night in return for a Million dollars Harrelson realizes too late that the choice he has made would damage the relationship beyond repair. Let me say this watching Harrelson run to the closed door once he realizes what he has done is a powerful scene if you can put yourself in the situation. As the movie progresses it does a wonderful job of making the viewer have a hard time hating Redford's character. At times the viewer is convinced that Moore's character belongs with Redford. The movie then switches to Harrelson's character that is devastated and living on his own coping with the loss. As Moore's Character is seduced by Redford Harrelson slips slowly into depression. Once again the movie gives the viewer a chance to experience many different emotions. John Barry's Concerto playing throughout this movie really adds to the somber mood. A wonderful placement of this music as the characters slowly move towards the movie's end. Some good acting by all here is evident. Do not sell this movie short because on the outside it seems to be choppy. It was meant to put the viewer in all situations the characters are in. I recommend this one to anyone who is a hopeless romantic.Best Scene There are manyOne that comes to mind is Harrelson's character reflecting on the relationship with Moore as he sits alone in his empty apartment with his dog by his side.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've just come back from seeing what I think is one of the best movies of 2004. I found the story fascinating the look stylish and the music haunting.Wicker Park is a tale of obsession on many levels. It is told partly in flashback so that you have to piece the events together and figure out how far back the action of the film began  what is now and what was then. The director uses splitscreen techniques that enhance the look and feel of the film lifting it from the realm of the ordinary to the plane of art. A haunting theme weaves its way through this labyrinth of lies leading to a satisfying because inevitable conclusion.I saw the film with two friends who were of a very different opinion. They found the film convoluted and clichd. I disagree. It was easy to tell what was flashback and what was hereandnow. But the story is complicated not convoluted and does require some sorting out. As for being cliched I found the film quite the opposite. It could have gone in some trite hackneyed directions but didn't. And while some people might think the ending is the clich of all clichs I thought that emotionally it was absolutely right and the only possible way to end the film.I loved Wicker Park so much that I would willingly see it again to get a better sense of how the story is put together and just for the sheer pleasure of its look and sound. You might say I too am obsessed.".

The acting was quite good albeit with littleknown actors except for Josh Hartnett of Blackhawk Down. The best part of this film was the clever way the story all comes together towards the end including the flashback style which was very well done.".

Most movies including the ones I consider amazing require the passage of several years before I might entertain the idea of watching them again. This was different and will perhaps be better understood once you have seen the movie. It's like a puzzle I want to put back together on my own.SPOILERS Part of what I found most wonderful about this movie was that I was able to walk away from it not really considering ANY of the four major characters as the heavy. Also some preconceived ideas I had did not come to pass. For example MATT Throughout the film you see him balancing his value system against his desires sometimes successfully sometimes not but I got a sense that this guy wanted terribly to do the right things. Matt's going to see the play with Luke just because it mattered so much TO Luke is but one example LISA Didn't want to like her didn't want to understand why Matt's feelings for her were as strong as they were. I had believed it would just be a sexual pull she exerted on Matt  this was not the caseI got it.Luke Played appropriately in places as almost shallow  buffoonish I still got a sense that this guy was a truly good person  despite his fumbling hipness he really wanted to be a great friend and to care about someone at a much deeper level than it appeared at first glance. I liked his forgiveness of Matt for having been out of touch for 2 years.ALEX Her conflict throughout the movie could have played well to her ultimately being labeled a psycho but I felt great empathy for her especially toward the end of the movie at having been caught up in an emotional rollercoaster that drove her decisions throughout the movie. In one of the final scenes where she confesses her sins so to speak to Lisa I felt especially rewarded that she was so much more than just a lunaticand was indeed NOT crazy and that the character was an Anybody who could have been caught up on the thorns of an overwhelming desire.Also I enjoyed the friendship between Matt  Luke and how it remained intact and viable throughout the film. I think Matt's losing touch with Luke for 2 years was also symbolic of his having lost touch with himself.And the final scene between Matt  Lisa was satisfying to meI REALLY wanted them to find each other again and the emotional elements of this moment in the characters' lives was depicted beautifully.Finally what a painfully lovely moment with Rebecca when Matt is telling her what has happened and what has been true for him since he thought he'd lost Lisa when she said and I'm DEFINITELY paraphrasingYou want me to...know WHAT? That I'm not the girl who can break your heart?Haven't we all felt THAT before?".

It's an extremely compelling and unique mystery thriller with intricate characters and a storyline that could easily become absurd and convoluted but feels natural and McGuigan allows the viewer to be fully aware of what's happening. It never gets too far ahead of the audience but it doesn't drag for a second. The editing is flawless and meshes the present with the notsodistant past perfectly. Josh Hartnett delivers a surprisingly emotional performance and adds another strong performance to his recent resume that has really transcended him from the horrific heartthrob clique he was placed in when he first came onto the scene into a serious talented actor. But the real star of the film is the beautiful Rose Byrne who as always delivers a knockout performance that is easily one of the best of the decade. She takes this psychopathic character and somehow makes her immensely sympathetic. I actually found myself rooting for her to be with Matt. Simply with her eyes she portrays this wounded internally saddened character effortlessly. As I always am when seeing her act I was completely entranced and amazed. A stunning performance in a brilliant film.".

But then I got confused because of the scenes following each other like they were put in a random order. After about an hour and a half I regained my grip on the story. That was the moment I started liking the movie because I assumed I understood and wanted it to end happily.This movie reminded me of Hitchcock's Vertigo because of the confusing sequence of scenes. Also He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not popped into my head when after the first hour and a half things were clarified by paradoxically putting scenes even more out of chronological order. The last movie I had to think of was Vanilla Sky with its similar confusion about two different girls.In my opinion the confusion and clarifying of the narrative makes this a surreal but satisfying movie. 8 out of 10.".

The last movie I had to think of was Vanilla Sky with its similar confusion about two different girls.In my opinion the confusion and clarifying of the narrative makes this a surreal but satisfying movie. 8 out of 10.";

It was marketed as a Single White Female type thriller but it's really more of a somber reflection on obsession. If the main characters had email the movie would be over before it started but the character study and emotional investment by the actors overcame the convoluted plot.The movie goes back and forth in the timeline cutting between present day and two years ago. Two years ago Matt Josh Hartnett fell in love at first sight with Lisa Diane Kruger and he would follow her for a while before he had the courage to approach her. In the present Matt is engaged to be married but when he thinks he sees Lisa across a crowded room he loses her but he skips a business trip to try to track her down.As we watch the two timelines we're left wondering. Why did Lisa disappear on Matt the first time? When finally does find Lisa it's a different woman. Have we entered Mulholland Drive territory?Josh Hartnett whom I can take or leave depending on the movie he's in I took him in Black Hawk Down I left him in Hollywood Homicide brings a real sincerity to his character's inner struggle. Rose Byrne is also really good as the darkhaired Lisa. Matthew Lillard is effective as the wiseacre bestfriend showing subtleties the role of Shaggy would not permit. Diane Kruger the blond Lisa is about as forgettable as she was as Helen in Troy.Once it was all over I'd say a good 25 of the audience was laughing at the plot contrivances but sometimes a movie can overcome obstacles as basic as its story. Rated PG13 for sexual situations.".

It kept you guessing until you didn't know what to think. It was a thriller yet had a comedic spark here and there with a twist of romance and a dazzle of drama.

	schema:headline " grave violation of the original version L'appartement";
	schema:reviewBody "When i rented Wicker Park WP because of Harnette was in it i didn't know that it was the remake of my most favorite french film L'appartement which stars Monica Belucci and her husband Vincent Cassel.Since the opening dialog WP brings the spirit of L'appartement with it so I cannot help comparing the two versions. For those who have not seen the original version would probably think that WP is so original on the story and performance. But it is far from original.I got so disappointed as i watched further when I see see the actors in WP do not play as good as the original version. Matthew was supposed to be extremely sad when Lisa the mysterious girl left him and he was supposed to be very curious when he finds out that Lisa is only a phone booth away. But Harnett fails to do so.And in this case Diane Krueger doesn't have the mysterious personality smile nor face that could make Matt wonders where she had gone to for the past 2 years while Monica Belucci's acting was definitely up the film.Something is missing in this film and the actors seems like they don't understand about the plot either. And I think is WP took out the most important thing of the story which is about Matthew's attraction to the fake Lisa a.k.a Alex. In WP it seems that Alex was the one who seduces Matthew and that Matthew was forced to attracted to her in the first place. And since WP eliminates most of the substantial details from the movie such as the diary which Alex wrote that explains her actions LisaAlex's friendship and the suspense of Lisa's rich boy friend Danniel it successfully turns WP into a puzzling unworthy romantic film with Hollywood ending. Especially when Matthew dumps Rebecca on the airport. Like it is so easy to tell your girl friend that you have been not yourself for the past 2 years.I suggest to watch the original version first. But then it would probably blow you away and makes you don't even want to watch any future remakes of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this movie on cable yesterday during my traditional its New Years day and lets watch the worst movies on HBO that you can stand day. I am a sucker for a bad movie and this one is one of the crappiest movies I can stand  try watching the hazing with Brooke Burke that is currently On Demand on Showtime I think. I couldn't get through more than 45 minutes of that stinking pile...Anyway I'm a fan of the original French version of this movie and I wanted to see how crappy we Americans could remake it. It turns out we could do a pretty crappy job! For starters the original is a much darker tale that is interesting to watch and even more interesting in its ending. Wicker park removed the elements that made the original movie work a faked suicide love lost NEVER rekindled love destroyed love broken. Do you catch it??? This was a tragedy in the Greek sense and thats why it was fantastic. It had its balls ripped off in the American version.This movie is a distinctly French movie too. Its creepy in a bad way when Josh Harnett breaks into a woman's apartment. Its creepy in a whats happening next way when Vincent Cassel does it. It's out of place when Diane Kruger climbs out of her window to break up with her boyfriend into her neighbors and seems dysfunctional. I question the type of men she dates when this happens and wonder whether or not Harnett would slice her up like in Boxing Helena if she hadn't got away when traveling to Europe. When Monica Bellucci pulls this same move in the original I think to myself this girl is tough! This movie works in France because the French god bless them can do these things without looking psychotic. In fact I think some of this drama is expected in their relationships.And I don't mean to nit pick but there are many Air France offices in France because it's the state run airline! Those commies have to go stand in line to buy a ticket... but here in the US who has even heard of an American Airlines office?! Let alone actually going to purchase a plane ticket at one! No one because they don't exist! And if they do as an American you are an idiot if you stand in line at one of them. Book online at Orbitz or show up at the airport! The only way this movie could have work as is if it was a softcore porn. It was low budget and had that feel to it. Plus all the scenes would have made lots more sense if there was more skin. Watch the First 9 12 Weeks to see what I mean. I saw that many years ago and it was a nonsensical film that had the same feel to it...only in the end you saw some skin. Maybe I could have handled it if this was the case. However if you looking for some payload like this you will be sorely disappointed.If instead you are looking for your thesis on the difference between French and American film then this movie along with L Appartement is a requisite. We take real film and turn it into castrato.".

There are cinematic clues all throughout this film which really aren't apparent on the first viewing  primarily because they become obvious only after you know the plot.Also the special features with the audio commentary available on DVD are really worth looking at. The director has some unique viewpoints about the Wicker Park story that I found interesting.Absolutely loved Josh Hartnett in this film. He portrayed the whole aspect of maturing into a man versus a boy intelligently and I was genuinely moved by the longing and nostalgia he managed to convey.I think this movie has been seriously underrated in general and deserves to be appreciated as a really quite artistic clever piece of cinema.Was very disappointed that here in Australia Wicker Park was released as DVD only. Would have loved to view this on the big screen..the lighting is second to none.".

I can think of no faults with this film. The acting is convincing and the storyline compelling and Cliff Martinez's music is perfect for the feel of the film. At its heart Wicker Park is a love story but this only adds to how great it is. The plot is just complex enough to enthral the viewer and not confuse them. The soundtrack is also good and fits the film very well. This is a stylish modern and ultimately moving film which would leave a smile on the face of even the most cynical of viewers. I would highly recommend Wicker Park.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've just completed viewing The Apartment L'Appartement and Wicker Park backtoback on the same day and conclude that the original film is almost two times better. I rated The Apartment a nine while Wicker Park earned a 5 in my ratings.I watch a lot of films but don't consider myself a film snob. I don't believe that all film must be high art or CINEMAplain old movies suit me just fine. I will watch foreign films but don't think that they are the beall and endall of movies. Some I find to be very boring and pretentious but will watch them nonetheless hopeful of finding something special and unique. This is how I blundered into The Apartment based upon the recommendation of another.I like many different genres of film including what some men disparagingly refer to as chick flicks. I am a sucker for a good love story and have been since boyhood. Like most Americans raised on our Hollywood traditions I like a happy ending especially in a love story!. The Apartment does not fully embrace this tradition Of course real life does. Right? and there were things about the ending that I would have changed if I could. Soooo...when I learned that Wicker Park was a remake of L'Apppartement I rushed out to get a copy in order that I could compare and contrast the two.What I decided script concerns aside this film was miscast. In particular this film's Alex and Matthew are not up to the standards set in the original film. In L'Appartement the two characters Alice and Max had great chemistry together horrors! almost an equal to the chemistry that existed between the Max character and Lisa. This made for a much more complicated and intense relationship between all of the main characters. I don't get the same sense of obsession and desperation that is a palpable characteristic of the earlier film. I miss it because this provides the level of truth that anyone who has ever been in love is well aware of Love is hard crazy and complicated. I find it interesting that in both films the relationship that makes the most sense and is the most logical fares the poorest in the viewer's analysis. MaxMatthew's fiance should be the clear winner among our choices but garners the least rooting interest. Perhaps we prefer our love wild crazy and dangerous. Just an observation.This is not a bad film. I enjoyed watching it. However if you get a chance rent the L'Appartement and do your own comparison test. I purchased copies of both today but I know which one I will be viewing most often.".

	schema:headline " The first spiritually oriented movie that really works!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was invited to a screening of The Peaceful Warrior in NYC Thursday April 13th having just learned of this film's existence a few days earlier.I was looking forward to the film but with some trepidation considering that prior attempts at communicating spiritually oriented books or ideas had fallen short of my expectations and had fundamentally failed to convey to the audience a transforming inner experience witness What the Bleep Siddhartha Little Buddha and others.Let me say this simply and directly. They got it right this time and they did it in a way which could be embraced by crowds at the multiplexes. By impressing the discovery of bona fide spiritual truths on a recognizable sports template the movie makers will be carrying underappreciated ideas and experiences to the masses. At least I hope so! I actually woke up early the morning after seeing this with my mind full of things I might say in an exhaustive review. Never in my life have I felt that way about a movie before.The reason this movie succeeds is that it follows one of the most basic rules for good storytelling it shows rather than tells. Although some fundamental spiritual ideas are described with words it is the plot and character development that proves the truth of those words. You see the transcendence and the realizations in the faces of the characters and you are not left to wonder why. You understand.The story based on a book by Dan Millman follows a college gymnast who has great potential but whose desire for success is one of the main obstacles standing in the way of that potential. In his mindless pursuit of a goal he becomes sucked into the deep dark hole of lifeiswhathappenswhileyou'remakingotherplans. In its simplest message our hero's real challenge is to find happiness by being present and finding interest and love for what's right in front of him.The film doesn't try to oversimplify the content of a spiritual path into a single dogma there are many other seeds of thought strewn along the path by Socrates each of which could have been the basis for a different struggle to transcend relative unconsciousness.For many years I have been convinced that nonreligious spiritual thought and experience could be something to drive the world in a new direction. This movie provides an example of what life can be like if we ponder these thoughts and implement them in our lives in a concrete and practical way. It's not necessary to be a champion gymnast to derive the fundamental teachings from this film. It is a teaching that anyone can understand. This is why I see that The Peaceful Warrior can inspire those who embrace the possibilities which it offers to become peaceful guerrilla warriors working tirelessly underneath the radar changing the world.This is not only a good movie it's an important one.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was invited to a screening of The Peaceful Warrior in NYC Thursday April 13th having just learned of this film's existence a few days earlier.I was looking forward to the film but with some trepidation considering that prior attempts at communicating spiritually oriented books or ideas had fallen short of my expectations and had fundamentally failed to convey to the audience a transforming inner experience witness What the Bleep Siddhartha Little Buddha and others.Let me say this simply and directly. They got it right this time and they did it in a way which could be embraced by crowds at the multiplexes. By impressing the discovery of bona fide spiritual truths on a recognizable sports template the movie makers will be carrying underappreciated ideas and experiences to the masses. At least I hope so! I actually woke up early the morning after seeing this with my mind full of things I might say in an exhaustive review. Never in my life have I felt that way about a movie before.The reason this movie succeeds is that it follows one of the most basic rules for good storytelling it shows rather than tells. Although some fundamental spiritual ideas are described with words it is the plot and character development that proves the truth of those words. You see the transcendence and the realizations in the faces of the characters and you are not left to wonder why. You understand.The story based on a book by Dan Millman follows a college gymnast who has great potential but whose desire for success is one of the main obstacles standing in the way of that potential. In his mindless pursuit of a goal he becomes sucked into the deep dark hole of lifeiswhathappenswhileyou'remakingotherplans. In its simplest message our hero's real challenge is to find happiness by being present and finding interest and love for what's right in front of him.The film doesn't try to oversimplify the content of a spiritual path into a single dogma there are many other seeds of thought strewn along the path by Socrates each of which could have been the basis for a different struggle to transcend relative unconsciousness.For many years I have been convinced that nonreligious spiritual thought and experience could be something to drive the world in a new direction. This movie provides an example of what life can be like if we ponder these thoughts and implement them in our lives in a concrete and practical way. It's not necessary to be a champion gymnast to derive the fundamental teachings from this film. It is a teaching that anyone can understand. This is why I see that The Peaceful Warrior can inspire those who embrace the possibilities which it offers to become peaceful guerrilla warriors working tirelessly underneath the radar changing the world.This is not only a good movie it's an important one.";

And for fans of the book like me  and people who've never read it  this film delivers. Nick Nolte's performance as Socrates is one of the best he's ever given. Scott Mechlowicz does a great job showing us the transformation of Dan Millman. And the feeling one has when one walks out of the theater of wanting to seize every moment that life offers you is a feeling that we don't get often enough. That feeling is worth the price of admission alone.Peaceful Warrior is that rare film that manages to be hugely inspirational without being cheesy. It's well worth seeing.".

There are many moments which are quite funny. There is much that is quite moving.

One of the best parts of this movie is the studentteacher relationship between Dan and Socrates his mentor. This movie hits home because it almost portrays the classic American Dream and the many people who chase it. Dan Milliman the main character is living the good life he's one of the best athletes on the team popular with the girls still gets excellent grades. In all his life is perfect. Yet in a strange way he's not entirely satisfied with his life and you can see that the way he is living isn't good for his wellbeing. When he meets his mentor he goes through an entire mental cleansing that is portrayed with humor and poignancy.In the end the point of this movie is not whether he reaches his goal or not but the process of going there and thats what makes this movie worthwhile.".

The movie is like a rather poor cliffnotes version of the book. The acting is a bit wooden and you never get to know the main character enough to care much about him. There are some significant changes to the plot from the book to the movie. These are major changes that reduce the importance and context of the lessons and reduce this to a KarateKid as some other reviewers noticed without a good script or decent action sequences and only soso acting. Frankly Sting would have been a better choice for the casting of Socrates.My advice would be to read the book and skip the movie unless you REALLY like one of the actors in it and will see anything they make just because.".

After viewing the first few minutes of this I couldn't think it would be anything else. But it's not that at all. Dan can't sleep one night and goes for a run and ends up at a gas station for some water. He meets Socrates and is moderately impressed with him. Scott leaves the station and sees Socrates walk out of the shop and sit in a chair outside. Scott walks on a couple more steps and looks back. Socrates is now standing on the roof of the gas station. How did he get up there in that short a time? Okay now I was hooked on the movie. You will be too.Yes it almost seems like a Karate Kid movie with out the karate and in some ways it is. Socrates takes Dan under his wing and teaches him about life and new values. Dan feels he doesn't need all this philosophy and preaching and resists for a while but you know he will give in. And you feel better when he does.Nick Nolte is one of the finest actors to come out of Hollywood and here in this movie he transcends everything he has done before. There is no other way to say it. Scott Mechlowicz looks like Tony Perkins in some ways but for some reason I kept thinking this was a Keneau Reeves role.Dan Millman is a real person and has written books on spirituality and enlightenment. Some book titles include The Way of the Peaceful Warrior and The Journeys of Socrates.To be honest this is a movie that we should buy and give as gifts. And the movie is worth seeing more than once and I will do so one day.ViolenceNot really Sex Some scenes actually show makeouts that don't last long Nudity No Language No".

I kept hoping the main character's leg would shatter into a million pieces as in the opening scene so I could leave the theater. It's really too bad because I hoped that the marketing ploy of giving away thousands of free tickets would prove successful so other films would repeat it. But this movie is not worth my time even when the ticket is free. It says a great deal about how bad this film is when I say that the best scenes involve shots of men's gymnastics. I'm sure it's a demanding sport but it's not visually the most exciting thing that ever happened on film.I never developed any empathy for or rapport with the main character. In fact although I don't usually approve of onscreen violence I kept hoping he would crash his motorcycle headon into an 18wheeler just to put us both out of our misery. Pride is a better sports movie. The Shooter is a better action flick. Namesake is a better exploration of spirituality and cultures. I finally left the theater and went home to do something fun like organize my linen closet  the movie is that bad!".

Maybe it'll grow on me if I watch it again but that's my impression so far.We all know that Victor Salva's a total creep but I don't think that makes him a terrible filmmaker despite how creepy it is that he always shows young men with no shirts on in his films. The acting was mediocre at best. Nick Nolte was great as usual but the rest weren't too great especially Amy Smart. I get so annoyed by Amy Smart. On to the story. The story is alright but far too preachy and inspirational for me. The lines were almost hilariously cheesy and I just wanted them to stop. The ending was also cheesy and a little tedious.

	schema:reviewBody "More of a selfhelp guide for the Zen needy PEACEFUL WARRIOR does have some good acting a solid albeit schmaltzy message and some amazing filming using light and shade.Loosely based on Dan Millman's autobiographical novel Way of the Peaceful Warrior the film focuses on Millman's overinflated ego during his time as a supergymnast yet having dark dreams related to failure. Unable to sleep Dan played by Scott Mechlowicz frequents the streets of Berkeley California in the wee hours of the morning only to stumble across a wise Zenlike master with no name whom Dan labels as Socrates. Socrates Nick Nolte OFF THE BLACK sees Dan's misguided spirit as a challenge and eventually allows Dan to see a path to inner enlightenment via the here and now. Initially Dan sees this as shamanistic rubbish but quickly learns that he can apply Socrates' knowledge to help better his gymnastic abilities. Still focused on selfishness wanting to win Olympic Gold Dan finds himself injured after a horrific motorcycle accident and must come to terms with the fact that he may never walk again.With the help of Socrates Dan not only walks but does the impossible.The message of the film is valid if you believe in such things as focusing energy only on the now and throwing out the trash that rattles around in your head every minute of every day. Doing so according to Millman's philosophy will allow you to become not only a better person but a better whateveryouare in your professional life.Mechlowicz and Nolte play well off each other one being the cocky upstart and the other a wise and patient sage perhaps even a ghost.But the real winner here is the light and shading of much of the film's images especially whenever Mechlowicz enters the gas station where Nolte's character works. The dark aspect of the station gradually lightens up as Millman comes to accept what he's being taught. Also the motorcycle crash that injures Millman is done in fine slowmotion action with acrobatics to stop the heart of most movie watchers.All in all it's good film. Not great. But visually it certainly is a treat to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Keep in mind that the era of the movie musical was pretty much in the dust when IT'S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER hit the screens in 1955. Yet the story is an odd hybrid for benign musicals and a rather dark story of three GI's coming home from the war vowing a loyal buddybuddy reunion then upon reuniting years later realizing they have outgrown one another and have virtually nothing in common. There is a reunion dinner at a posh nightclub and try as they might hostility and acrimony flare up among the men as they gradually discern they have now little in common. The movie also teams Dan Daily and Michael Kyd with Kelly a Grade A winning combination for the few but excellent numbers they perform.However this movie should be seen for one and one reason only Gene Kelly's dance on roller skates to one of the most beautiful tunes ever written by Comden and Green. As the story goes Kelly had been searching for just the right opportunity to dance on skates in a film for years. Betty Comden has said she lived close to Kelly in Beverly Hills and that he had purchased skates years before at a hardware store nearby and that she'd watched Kelly take his daughter skating many times. It's not a stretch that Kelly spent a lot of hours imagining just where and when he'd do a roller skates number as he flew around Beverly Hills on wheels.Another delight is the very robust and creative trash can lids number featuring Kelly Dan Daily and Michael Kyd. With a trash can lid stuck to one foot the trio bounce up and down a street to a snappy melody while still in uniform. For those who thought lanky Dan Daily was just another hoofer this number proves he could hold his own with the best of them. I have heard Comden and Green also relate the story that after the movie opened someone told them they had seen the film in a drivein. I knew that the end had come for the movie musical commented Adolf Green.IT'S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER is very much worth seeing for being one of the last studio movie musicals of its kind. Moreover the novelty of watching Kelly teamed with Dan Daily and Michael Kydthe only time those three dancers appeared togetheris supremely enoyable. IT'S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER remains underrated to this day and serves as one of the final signposts for the demise of the great screen musical.Dennis Caracciolo".

	schema:headline " Interesting despite its flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "I was fortunate enough to see this film on the huge screen at the restored deco Silver Theatre in Silver Spring MD now part of the AFI so I took full advantage of the Technicolor  Cinemascope especially the 23 scenes where the camera pans back to show off the huge city set.  The visual quality after almost 50 years is still pretty good but the soundtrack was wobbly.  The film needs some restoration.As others have said the highlights of this film are the clever dance numbers specificallythe garbage can lid dance by the 3 soldiers they also hop crawl and dance around a stopped taxi but nobody has mentioned that onethe wonderful roller skating sequence by Kelly since I'm tired to death of seeing the Singing in the Rain puddle dance this is a refreshing change and an excellent sample of his skills!  He even parodies his Rain dance when he hops off  on the curb with his skates folks those are metalwheeled skates  nowhere as smooth  speedy as the polyurethane ones of today  Somebody mentioned that the skating set features a big piece of the Rain set but I don't agree  we're talking films set 30 years apart  I didn't see any similarities in the Fair Weather setDolores Gray's bizarre number Thanks but no Thanks where she rewards the tuxedoed men bearing jewels and affection who literally vault flip and tumble around her with bullets dynamite and finally a huge trap door where they all slide awayand Cyd Charisse's gym number Baby You Knock Me Outthese last 2 numbers were featured on That's Entertainment IIIIt's interesting to see Michael Kidd mostly known for his wonderful film choreography dance onscreen.  Wish there was more of it. And Dan Dailey I hardly know except for the film There's No Business Like Show Business.  He's the only actor of the 3 to let himself age in the ensuing 10 years and it works.  He does a very good job in the acting department too.You can see why the film is not a lasting classic in league with On the Town and Singing in the Rain  it contains elements of bitterness  disillusionment between the 3 guys.  They seem to get along best when they're either drunk or fighting bad guys. And the film  this is a sign of the times  glamorizes smoking including by Dan Dailey's character who says he won't drink or eat heavily bc of his health yet he lights up often fixed boxing matches gambling and drunken sprees.Still it makes an excellent sequel of sorts for On the Town and they should be paired together on TV or at film fests.Also Previn's tunes are not really memorable  they're OK.The film also pokes fun at early TV  Delores Gray's show is a mix btw a variety show  something like Queen for a Day or This is Your Life. Sponsors in this case laundry detergentwere a huge deal back then. Oddly she's not paired with one of the guys as a romantic interest.  Her diva act gets a bit tiresome however.Cyd only gets 1 dance number and there's no dance between her  Gene.  Wish there were.  They sparked a HUGE amount of chemistry in their dance number in Rain.Look out for familiar actors in small supporting roles like Madge Blake she was a radio gossip at the movie premiere in Singin in the Rain but most of you would know her as dotty Aunt Harriett in the Batman TV series and the actor who plays the sports columnist at the gym is a character actor who has appeared in dozens of TV shows from the 1950s  60s besides movie appearances.  And that's June Foray's uncredited voice in the animated Kleenzrite commercial  she did the voice of Rocky Squirrel among many other voiceovers.Still I do recommend it considering it is not shown very much let alone in the letterbox format which is necessary for the integrity of the movie. Darn that pesky pan  scan! The aheadofitstime plot  the clever dance numbers make this film worth your while.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was fortunate enough to see this film on the huge screen at the restored deco Silver Theatre in Silver Spring MD now part of the AFI so I took full advantage of the Technicolor  Cinemascope especially the 23 scenes where the camera pans back to show off the huge city set.  The visual quality after almost 50 years is still pretty good but the soundtrack was wobbly.  The film needs some restoration.As others have said the highlights of this film are the clever dance numbers specificallythe garbage can lid dance by the 3 soldiers they also hop crawl and dance around a stopped taxi but nobody has mentioned that onethe wonderful roller skating sequence by Kelly since I'm tired to death of seeing the Singing in the Rain puddle dance this is a refreshing change and an excellent sample of his skills!  He even parodies his Rain dance when he hops off  on the curb with his skates folks those are metalwheeled skates  nowhere as smooth  speedy as the polyurethane ones of today  Somebody mentioned that the skating set features a big piece of the Rain set but I don't agree  we're talking films set 30 years apart  I didn't see any similarities in the Fair Weather setDolores Gray's bizarre number Thanks but no Thanks where she rewards the tuxedoed men bearing jewels and affection who literally vault flip and tumble around her with bullets dynamite and finally a huge trap door where they all slide awayand Cyd Charisse's gym number Baby You Knock Me Outthese last 2 numbers were featured on That's Entertainment IIIIt's interesting to see Michael Kidd mostly known for his wonderful film choreography dance onscreen.  Wish there was more of it. And Dan Dailey I hardly know except for the film There's No Business Like Show Business.  He's the only actor of the 3 to let himself age in the ensuing 10 years and it works.

	schema:reviewBody "The folks that brought you Singing In The Rain Gene Kelly Stanley Donen Betty Comden Adolph Green Cyd Charisse and Arthur Freed combined their considerable talents to give us one of the last of the great MGM screen musicals in It's Always Fair Weather. The film got two Oscar nominations for Comden and Green for Best Original Screenplay and for Andre Previn for Best Musical Score. Previn also contributed the music for the original songs in this film.I remember back in 1971 when I did the weekend warrior thing at Fort Polk and Fort Sam Houston I had a number of friends back in the day there. But a few years from now if circumstance ever brought a group of us together we'd find we have very little in common. In fact there are relatives of mine I barely keep up with because of the little we have in common.Thus did army pals Gene Kelly Dan Dailey and Michael Kidd find themselves after ten years earlier in David Burns's bar swearing that they would meet there ten years later and still be best pals in 1945 after VJ Day.Well it's now 1955 and Gene Kelly is a native New Yorker. Michael Kidd actually comes down from Schenectady thinking his two friends will be there. Dan Dailey is an advertising executive working on a third ulcer and happens to be in from Chicago. Both Kelly and Dailey realize the day and half heartedly go to the bar and the three do run into each other. But life has led them down three different paths and they have nothing in common but military service.Dailey's firm advertises on a show hosted by Dolores Gray which seems to be a combination Queen For A Day This Is Your Life and Candid Camera. Her producer Cyd Charisse thinks the reunion of the veterans would be a great show and she contrives to make sure they're all there for the broadcast. Kelly she gives her personal attention to. He's got the most trouble. He's a fight manager whose heavyweight is going into the tank for gangster Jay C. Flippen.Mix all those elements and you have a nice original story idea with some good songs none of which became any kind of hit. The best numbers are by Gene Kelly dancing on rollerskates proclaiming his new found love for Charisse down the city streets just like in Singing In The Rain. I also liked Dolores Gray's numbers as well.But I like her character as the overbearing TV host. I don't think it was any accident she bears some resemblance to Jean Hagen's Lina Lamont in Singing In The Rain as Comden and Green wrote that screenplay also. Hard to believe there were really shows like Madeline's back in the day.It's Always Fair Weather another quality product from the Arthur Freed unit at MGM. You can never go wrong there.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't know why this title was chosen as it doesn't seem to relate at all to the film. Apparently it was intended as a parody on real life for most people as demonstrated by our 3 male stars. It was perhaps appropriate for the theme of the TV show included in the film hosted by Dolores Gray. Originally conceived as a sequel to the hit On the Town possibly with the 3 original male stars. But two were quickly eliminated with Kelly the sole returnee. Dan Dailey was an excellent choice as one replacement having established similar screen skills to Kelly's as a dancer singer and comedian though with a more blase screen personality as demonstrated in his too brief solo 'lampshade' act. Michael Kidd normally an expert choreographer was an unexpected choice as the third male lead. Unfortunately his innovative solo scene Jack and the Space Giants was cut from the film but can be seen as an outtake on the 2006 Warner DVD release.Another very illadvised cut was the only dance featuring Kelly and Cid Charisse the one romantic couple featured! Againthis outtake can be seen on the 2006 DVD. Dolores Gray provides a classylooking hostess for a TV combo variety and This is Your Life  program primarily serving as a parody of the common sugary TV shows and their often inane commercials of the times. She could also sing as demonstrated several times.Despite a number of unusual dance numbers including the 'trash can lid' dance by the drunken trio Kelly's impressive roller skating street dance Dailey's drunken unpredictable 'lampshade' act and Cyd'sBaby You Knock me Out song and dance  I can understand why this film lacked the audience appeal of On the Town.It's not just the obvious fact that the 3 buddies at the beginning of the film realize they have become irrelevant strangers to each other for most of the rest of the film. It's not just that Dailey's and Kelly's characters have led mostly meaningless or shady lives since their GI days. The film mainly follows Kelly after the 3 have had enough of each other. Since the other 2 exbuddies are married we only have one quickie romance to follow instead of the 3 in On the Town and Kelly and Cid never have a 'mating dance' as occurred in On the Town and many other musicals of those times.On the other hand I found the last portion of the film much the best. First we have Kelly's roller skating dance routinefollowed by Dolores's unusual Thanks but no Thanks routine.This is followed by the 3 former buddies being reluctantly forced to meet and tell all on Dolores's over the top 'This is your Life' portion of her TV show and the subsequent brawl with Kelly's mobster associates that brings them together again briefly a hilarious and very clever device for ringing an apparently happy ending out of a largely pessimistic story along with parodying the emerging competing entertainment medium of TV.Incidentally Kelly's impressive roller skating dancecomedy routine was not the first feature film roller skating dance to include some tap dancing. Nearly 20 years earlier Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had done an impressive roller skate duo dance including a bit of tap dancing in Shall We Dance. Also 2 years earlier Don O'Connor did a solo roller skate dance including hopping up a series of stair treads in I Love Melvin.".

For those who appreciate other vocalists such as Julie London check out Miss Gray's album Warm Brandy recently reissued on CD for a real treat.  It's Always Fair Weather also boasts some of the greatest dance numbers of any musical.  Sure Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly are tops but Dan Dailey and Michael Kidd do just fine themselves at keeping up in the dance scenes.  And Dolores Gray's Thanks but No Thanks number rivals Marilyn Monroe's Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend number from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Ironically Miss Gray was called upon to provide the vocals for Marilyn Monroe when contractual restrictions prevented her from singing on her own recordings.  Dailey and Charisse give the standout acting performances here Kelly does an adequate job with acting better than he does with his thin reedy warble but then noone else can dance like him.  It's Always Fair Weather will never have the broad appeal or accessibility of Singin' in the Rain or An American in Paris as it's plot is a bit darker but if you enjoy midcentury musicals it's a little gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just to add to the previous comments who all noted how good this bittersweet mature musical is I think it just missed being a classic  in spite of all of its fine attributes because its score is on the ordinary side. That saidGene Kelly's rollerskate number is as good as his famed soggy solo in Singing in the Rainit is absolutely breathtaking. And the 3 friends dance with garbage cans on their feet is great. The most surprising is the heartbreaking solo of Dan Dailey. What a performance! He is supposed to be a self loathing ad exec who proceeds to get very drunk at a party and even dances with a  cliched lampshade on his head. He never loses his dignity as he dances with grace  and agility all the while  convicing us that he's quite drunk. One thing I noticed in the plot. The old war buddies can only bond again after a huge brawl in which they relive their war days and beat up the gangsters. Then they can drink together and let their sensitive sides show and sing about old friendships. At the movies end Dan Dailey is able to reunite with his unseen wife. He phones her and tells her that he loves her. Kelly is able to go off with Cyd Charisse and Michael Kidd goes back to the sticks and his big Italian family and his hamburger joint. The movie ends on a bittersweet notethe three pals go their separate ways. We don't hear them  make any plans to meet again.Yet we don't feel they need tothey still don't have anything in common in the real world. However in the magical musical world they took from each other what they needed and are now able to accept their somewhat disapointing yet very human realities. They each have grown up and  have found  more mature relationships with their wives and with themselves. The movie's title is ironic It isn't always fair weather and real  life can be disappointing but we can still find contentment.".

The old war buddies can only bond again after a huge brawl in which they relive their war days and beat up the gangsters. Then they can drink together and let their sensitive sides show and sing about old friendships. At the movies end Dan Dailey is able to reunite with his unseen wife. He phones her and tells her that he loves her. Kelly is able to go off with Cyd Charisse and Michael Kidd goes back to the sticks and his big Italian family and his hamburger joint. The movie ends on a bittersweet notethe three pals go their separate ways. We don't hear them  make any plans to meet again.Yet we don't feel they need tothey still don't have anything in common in the real world. However in the magical musical world they took from each other what they needed and are now able to accept their somewhat disapointing yet very human realities. They each have grown up and  have found  more mature relationships with their wives and with themselves. The movie's title is ironic It isn't always fair weather and real  life can be disappointing but we can still find contentment.";

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this again on TCM in the only format it deserves to be viewed in letterbox. While it is a Gene Kelly vehicle and the leads are three buddies from wartime that's pretty much where the On The Town similarities end. It is a surprisingly sharp cynical story in which the heroes' dreams are voiced but not realized at least not at first due to life circumstances. The daring plot of three soldier buddies who part company at the end of the war reunite 10 years later to settle a bet they've made with a barkeep and then realize that they really don't have anything in common except a dislike for each other probably broke amazing ground back in the 1950's when it dared to show what happens to friends who 'don't' live happily ever after. After all musicals are usually free of such cynicism and vulgarity. Betty Comden and the late Adolph Green responsible for so many great film scores as well as the scripts of Auntie Mame Bells Are Ringing and What A Way To Go contribute very witty songs here including the threeway splitscreen dance Once Upon A Time which shows the three buddies reflecting on their wartime friendship and whether or not they'll ever get it back Dolores Gray's wicked Thanks A Lot But No Thanks and the requisite Gene Kelly solo on roller skates I Like Myself. The big revelation however is Cyd Charisse fine as ever but in a rare 'real' acting role which calls upon a bit of cynicism and smug defensiveness. Her cool demeanor is wonderfully thawed by the wiseguy boxers who worship her in the the gymnasium ditty Baby You Knock Me Out. She goes from a diva to a siren in a tight green sweater and skirt in just 2 minutes. Have mercy!!".

I'm glad Donen prevailed and Dailey's number stayed in he's a pleasure to watch. Most songanddance men are small wiry fellows it is SO nice to see a big tall man who can dance with the best of them. In the Up In Smoke number I noticed that his timing was right in tune with Kidd's it was Kelly who was out of sync. As for the women Dolores Gray's parody of a Queen for a Day type host was simply FABULOUS  you can't play that kind of a character straight!  but Cyd Charisse seemed out of place as the program director. Maybe I've got too strong a memory of her as the slinky siren in Singin' in the Rain? Finally I've never liked the dance number on roller skates however difficult it might be Kelly is supposed to be crowing about the girl but instead he's singing a valentine to HIMSELF.

	schema:reviewBody "A truly strange late entry into the musical canon. MGM must've felt the formula was running out of steam or they were attempting more challenging story lines. The musical format hits an early snag long before the difficult late sixties and seventies.Three pals heading overseas agree that they're friends forever and plan to meet after the war. They pursue lives apart but reunite again many years later to appear on a schmaltzy TV show that provides viewers with saccharine emotional payoffs contrived from reallife stories. When they regroup they've changed to the point they can't stand each other and they resent that the TV show will portray them as close friends. After a conflicted day in New York they eventually reteam to upset the TV Show hostess' plans and tell the real story.... which is ???Imagine a movie where the lead characters think Oprah is a force of evil !? and you're supposed to root for her humiliation. It's just not possible to despise a TV personality Dolores Gray who can trump every femmefatale number ever filmed with the uproarious muchloved Thanks a Lot but No Thanks.Fair Weather has it's fans but half a dozen incongruities like this and that elaborate plot!!! leave you puzzled. It's as if they started with one storyline and a different villain but asked everyone to play their part neutrally while the producers mulled swapping villains. Characters are snotty and unpleasant. What does that title mean? Why do the guys agree to be on the show if she's a fraud? They all grow identically in one day to the point that she can be universally reviled? Sure she's a phony but it's not like she personally bombed Dresden. The suggestion that the American Dream has holes in it is surprising for this genre. One wonders who the target audience was... It cannot be the droves who went to the previous sweet light efforts. And it's a decade after the close of World War II. Sure the world is a more realistic place but Singin in the Rain was made after the war too. The departures are provocative but the results are odd. Certainly worth seeing as a change from simplistic romances but even if you're intrigued don't be surprised if you exit with mixed feelings. Gene Kelly's joyful roller skate dance is a pleasure.".

Each begins to go their separate ways again before Jackie Leighton Charisse who works for the same ad agency as Doug has an idea to exploit the soldiers' reunion as a replacement idea for Madeline Bradville's Gray radio show that night. Jackie's a successful working woman whose exceptional brain bores most men and Madeline's an egotistical star who exploits common people for her human interest type program.To keep the former friends occupied until the 11 PM radio show sponsored by Klenzrite Jackie's and Doug's boss Mr. Fielding Paul Maxey uncredited is assigned to keep the artist occupied while Madeline dines with Angie and Jackie takes Ted who's surprised at her sudden interest given her earlier standoffish attitude towards him.

The amazingly collected and flexible radio hostess gets the program she wants and the boys return arm in arm to Tim's bar where he finally remembers them and they win their 4 bet kept overhead in a light fixture to pay the tab. Angie stops putting on airs Doug phones his wife who saw the show such that they're on the mend and Jackie arrives to join Ted.".

Jackie's a successful working woman whose exceptional brain bores most men and Madeline's an egotistical star who exploits common people for her human interest type program.To keep the former friends occupied until the 11 PM radio show sponsored by Klenzrite Jackie's and Doug's boss Mr. Fielding Paul Maxey uncredited is assigned to keep the artist occupied while Madeline dines with Angie and Jackie takes Ted who's surprised at her sudden interest given her earlier standoffish attitude towards him. She goes with him to the gym where the film's best song  dance routine Baby You Knock Me Out featuring Charisse and the gym rats is performed Ted learns from Rocky Hal March uncredited his boxer's planned opponent that night that mobster Charlie Culloran Flippen has fixed the fight.Meanwhile Doug is getting drunk and making a mess of things at Mr. Fielding's house while Angie looks wistfully at the more upscale environs he's experiencing. Ted and Jackie have a hearttoheart during which he learns that she'd been scorned once before also she begins to see him in a new more positive light too which burns even brighter when Ted starts to live up to his old ideals and with her help stops his kid Mariacchi from participating in the fix.Everything leads to a madcap evening on Madeline's radio show beginning with each of the three former war buddies admitting to their disillusionment but ending much more positively as Ted Doug and Angie brawl Culloran and his gang who are eventually rounded up by the police. The amazingly collected and flexible radio hostess gets the program she wants and the boys return arm in arm to Tim's bar where he finally remembers them and they win their 4 bet kept overhead in a light fixture to pay the tab. Angie stops putting on airs Doug phones his wife who saw the show such that they're on the mend and Jackie arrives to join Ted.";

It about wearing garbage can lids on your feet and a lampshade on your head while you're toweringly drunk and finding out you can't stand the guy you used to jump into foxholes with and you may need another ten years just to get over his revolting presence.Besides we all got homes to go to so help Tim put the chairs up so that he can mop the place out one last time while he sings your favorite theme song about friendship to show he's finally got religion.

	schema:headline " Sweet Excellent Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "My observations First of all you know that my favorite movies are song and dance with costuming hair and makeup other favorite areas of critiquing. This movie does not disappoint.Gene Kelly tap dancing on roller skates is one of my favorite dance scenes of all time. I love tap dancing AND roller skating plus ice figure skating. I do all three.I loved Cyd Charisse's dance with all the boxers starting with the fight manager who sang and danced with Cyd. Those boxers could dance and sing too and quite well. Who'da thought it? Cyd's dressy clothing was a colorful contrast to their gym clothes and boxing gloves. I liked the combination of her lighter green blouse with darker green skirt. When she later put on the chartreuse jacket it looked a little much but at least it was a third shade of green  and coordinated with the green blouse and skirt combination.It was good to see Dolores Gray. She did an excellent job. I just loved her slinky red outfit. I liked her divaroutine since I felt it was a satire of real 1950s TVradio hostshostesses. She held the entire audience in thrall and I loved it when she made our three exGIs her guests of the evening. The walking soapboxes reminded me of 1950s TV commercials about Chesterfield Cigarettes when the dancers walked on wearing the giant cigarette packages and had their legs hanging out the bottom.Cyd thought Gene was a dummy but when Gene corrected her Shakespeare she was shocked. I was waiting for him to tell her he was actually a college graduate and former law school wannabe but he only told her about the boxing connection. She was certainly a boxing expert. He called her Einstein.I liked seeing Michael Kidd early in the movie with his Le Cordon Bleu cookbook. I really enjoyed his great dancing and choreography in this movie.I loved Dan Dailey in There's No Business Like Show Business where he played the father of Donald O'Connor Mitzi Gaynor and Johnny Ray plus the husband of Ethel Merman. In Fair Weather in the 1955 sequence he plays a disillusioned man who has the stereotypical ulcers of overworked 1950s admen. As an acting student I really enjoyed where he played drunk and danced his routine at the same time. Not a lot of actorsdancers can pull this off acting drunk is a refined skill  not to mention successfully creating and executing the dance concurrently. Wearing the lampshade just added to the comical drunk stereotype and I feel Dan Dailey did all of it so remarkably convincingly.Finally in the 1945 sequence going backward there was way too much reliance on drinking alcohol the whole night. One writer says the three men drank at Tim's and then parted to meet 10 years later. In actuality they drank tons of booze going to bar after bar after bar. Perhaps the actors actually drank iced tea or colored water or even 12 sips for each different bar scene but it was all very convincing. I thought that all three would fall on their keisters.Men in those days died in their 40s and 50s and some lived to their 60s or even 70s. This movie shows the 1940s1950s strong bad habits like too much alcohol and cigarette smoking IMO. Some of the actors died early from heart attacks. I would bet in those days that actors as well as most people did not get much exercise and loved to subsist on a diet of chicken fried in lard pork chops fried in grease pies made with lard pie crust tons of coffee sweetened with tons of sugar not to mention the proverbial cigarette chain smoking and exceedingly high alcohol consumption. The Fatso guy reminds one of how men were allowed to gain a ton of weight but women always had to watch their figures.The makeup Stage makeup is not just face paint or clown white but actually hair extensions and additions. A writer said Dan Dailey was the only character aged 10 years because of his mustache or brush as Michael Kidd said. In my stage makeup course we tried on stage mustaches beards wigs hairpieces sideburns all I think with a little spirit gum. Dailey's mustache looked natural.Cyd Charisse's makeup looked natural and offset her dark hair. Her bright red lipstick was a nice touch. Dolores Gray's makeup looked like she was a total tart but perhaps for TV cameras this was necessary. At any rate we as viewers saw 1950s actual TV shows shot in glorious black and white.Hair Gene's receding hairline made him look older. He was born in 1912 and Dailey and Kidd born 1915 making Gene three years older. Gene was around 43 years old when this movie was made with Dailey and Kidd being 40. As old as they were I felt that they still did a great job portraying their younger 1945 selves.".

The music by Andre Previn is uninspired. The choreography fares better with a delightful roller skating sequence by Gene Kelly and a fun sequence in a boxing gym by Cyd Charisse. The glamorous Delores Gray sings the heck out of her numbers but her acting unlike in Designing Woman is way over the top more of a stage performance.Despite the spoofing of advertising and early television shows and the singing and dancing the film has a strange edginess when it's dark it's almost too dark and the light moments aren't light enough. There's just something unhappy about it which you don't find in the fabulous Singin' in the Rain. But I suppose you can't ask lightning to strike twice.Dan Dailey has the strongest role and is more than up to it giving the film's best performance.

	schema:reviewBody "I just had my first look at this on DVD with it boasting a restored print and in widescreen CinemaScope. I had only seen this one other time years ago on a formattedtoTV VHS print. The visuals are much better of course in widescreen and even the story seemed although to be honest I only recommend it for fans of of the classic film era or for musicals. If you are used to modernday films this will look and sound way too corny for you. Anyway he's the good and bad of the film as I saw itGOOD  Cyd Charisse is a wow in any era. I just wish I could have seen her and watch her dance in any other decade. The 1950s with the short hair and long dresses have to be the most unsexy era for women's clothes since pre1920. I would love to see what Cyd looked like with long hair and a short skirt and demonstrating her dancing tremendous dancing talents. I enjoyed the lyrics to the songs even though they were so dated I winced a few times. Sometimes they were so bad that's what made them fun to hear. Feminists would hate those and a lot of this movie although Charisse's character Jackie Leighton is an independent woman and before her time in that regard. Gene Kelly as Ted Riley is such an oldfashioned male chauvinist that in today's world women would cringe at some of this lines and actions in this movie.The dancing is very good beginning with Kelly Dan Dailey Doug Hallerton and Michael Kidd Angie Valentine giving us a great opening dance capped off by the three of them hoofing with garbage can lids on their feet. Charisse is mesmerizing in Baby You Knock Me Out and I really enjoyed Kelly's roller skatingtap dancing over the streets and sidewalks. That routine ranks right with his morefamous Singin' In the Rain number. Dolores Gray as Madeline provides a very entertaining number near the end with some great sets accompanying the song and dances.Finally the story the last 20 minutes or so redeems much of the earlier see below darker stuff and you makes you feel good when the film ends. It's a nice message.THE BAD  Earlier I didn't find the story that likable a downer in too many spots for a musical....until the upbeat finish. Three guys have an old Army buddies' reunion and quickly  too quickly  find out they now despise each other. None of the three are shown with many positive character traits although at least they all know their weaknesses. The dialog in many spots might have been the worst part of the film totally sappy and embarrassingly dated in many areas. I was disappointed Charisse's dancing scene was just that  singular one lessthantwominute dance number. That was all they could include in the film? Meanwhile Daily's loudmouth drunk scene and musical number was five minutes. I was sorry to see the guys dancing with cigarettes dangling out of their mouths but that's the '50s. That habit along with drinking were often glamorized.OVERALL  The last segment is so positive so feelgood that it redeemed the film at least to me. And  the dance numbers were definitely worth watching. If you like musicals and you haven't seen this check it out!".

The GIs are Gene Kelly Dan Dailey and Michael Kidd. When they finally part they agree to meet again in Tim's Bar at noon exactly ten years hence. They do and it's an immediate disaster.

And the book  by the always competent Comden and Green  and the direction by Kelly and Stanley Donen  are sometimes witty and keen. But the sharpness of the wit undercuts our enjoyment of the movie. I suppose there's something funny about the guest at a funeral stumbling into the casket but well there's humor and then there's humor. The notion of the heroine having a photographic memory is an old one and often resurrected as a source of puzzled irritation in the male.There isn't a memorable song in the entire movie. One of them about Stillman's Gym sounds as if it had been ripped fresh from the quivering flank of the Broadway hit Guys and Dolls. Baby You Knock Me Out is plain terrible.I guess it doesn't measure up to expectations. Too much talent behind and in front of the camera for too little issue. It gives me a sour stomach.

Meghna became quite successful from the Hit song Kaliyon ka Chaman. Meghna looked extremely Sexy and danced nicely. Unfortunately her acting wasn't appreciated by most critics which is why she isn't having much luck bagging good roles for Bollywood films. The actors of this movie were also First timers with not much good acting skills. Bollywood was suppose to be for family viewing with no nudity and adult scenes. But as time is moving so is Bollywood. Hawas is a start in adult genre in Bollywood after the success of Jism and Murder. Hawas did not do too well because it was released at the same time as Murder. Both movies had same storyline but Murder was more professionally directed and the actress was critically more sexier. Too my opinion i think Meghna is very sexy although she has put some weight I would still bang Meghna from behind like the guy does in the movie.".

OK I am done watching it. I loved the acting part the most. Meghna Naidu's acting is excellent one loves the stopanimated way in which her emotion changes She talks waits for a few seconds and then suddenly outbursts if she needs to change into another mood be it happiness sadness coyness excitement or whatever. She has only two facial expressions one is smiling and the second is squeezing her face. Needless to say it is a fact that Karan Razdan did not make her a heroine for her acting capabilities but rather for her bodily assets which he then somehow does not fully utilize. The other two central characters also have only one expression each the husband has the expression of a robotic assassin sent from the future and the lover is perpetually euphoric and carefree probably a result of excessive and habitual intake of fine grade cocaine.Watch it.

	schema:reviewBody "Regardless of your opinion of NASCAR racing this is an incredibly fun movie for guys.Is it creative? No. It's pretty obvious that it's the same thing as Top Gun. The only difference is maturity. Over the years Tom Cruise had developed into a fine actor and when coupled with Robert Duvall in a spectacular performance and a surprising Randy Quaid Days of Thunder becomes a film which gets pretty much any guy involved in it.I personally hate NASCAR but still I find this film absolutely riveting and every time I watch it I suddenly have a desire to go race my car down the highway. In fact the biggest argument against this movie is that it does get to the testosterone.The music for Days of Thunder sets it up perfectly. Hans Zimmer does an effective job with his second Cruise film in two years Rain Man was the other and The Spencer Davis Group's Gimme Some Lovin' makes some plotless racing scenes worth watching.The script penned by Bob Towne is far more clever than the average action movie and actually creates some serious character depth for Cole and Rowdy although Cary Elwes' character seems excessively evil.But all in all this is an action movie that works for Cruise fans even if they don't like action movies. 8.5 out of 10 On a pure enjoyment basis.".

An escapist sort of entertainment that puts you in a place that you would really never even consider going. I was forced to rent this recently by a friend and after sitting about 15 minutes in to it I just let go and let the colors and sounds wash over me. This movie is the visual equivalent of a music video with dialog. Every scene is short and to the point and if its forward momentum you are looking for in your movies then you've come to the right place. The entire duration of the movies length I kept thinking that I wish there were more movies made that took you to another world the way this one does.

First the fact that Top Gun proved to be such a megahit for Tom Cruise that a similar film was almost dictated to be made by Paramount. But secondly it was reported that on the set of The Color of Money costar Paul Newman got Cruise interested in auto racing so you put those two things together Days of Thunder was almost a film that had to be made.The film certainly has the feel of NASCAR to it and it takes its place along side such racing classics as Grand Prix The Racers and Paul Newman's own film Winning. The story is the teaming of young rookie sensation Cruise and top mechanic Robert Duvall. Tom's character is a whole lot like the young fighter pilot in Top Gun a kid with a world of confidence and the ability to make his brag become fact. He's a driver by instinct not knowing a whole lot about the mechanics of a racing car. That's the way he and Duvall complement each other although it's not an easy relationship.Days of Thunder is also the film on which Tom met Mrs. Cruise number two Nicole Kidman. She's a neurologist who gets to treat Tom after a crash and also drops the hammer on Cruise's rival Michael Rooker and his career after a serious head injury. There are also some nice performances by Randy Quaid as the stock car owner and Cary Elwes as another of Cruise's rival drivers. Fred Dalton Thompson District Attorney of New York County on Law and Order former United States Senator and would be President of the United States is in the cast as the head of NASCAR. If the political thing doesn't work out for Fred he certainly has the presence and authority to be a baseball commissioner. They'll certainly need another Judge Landis in that job to restore some integrity to that sport.Days of Thunder got an Academy Award nomination for Sound Recording and it's a good followup film for Top Gun.".

A hotshot rookie NASCAR driver works his way up gets in a big wreck falls in love with a doctor goes on to win the Daytona 500 after overcoming his trauma from the wreck. This wasn't some shakespearean intellectual masterpiece which is why most people bash it. The Racing scenes are awesome and if you love caraction movies you will watch these scenes over and over. The only thing is the excessive amount of bumping and rubbing. It added some degree of excitement but was unrealistic for NASCAR. The only reason this gets a 910 is because the film and sound quality is not that good compared to other movies at the time. The film seems a bit grainy to me like it could have been shot in the 1970's. Overall great movie watch if your a fan of NASCAR car action or Tom Cruise.

The opening sequence at the Daytona 500 gives me goosebumps and makes me want to crank up the surround sound  a homage to NASCAR the late 80s and Americana.

The movie came out during the height of the Tom Cruise is Cool era. And Cruise is cool in this movie. Robert Duvall who plays his crew chief is even better in the film.That said there were so many errors in this film it's laughable. The racing shots were taken from real races and the film editing did a poor job of disguising real race cars like Dale Earnhardt's No. 3 for fictional ones. The timing is off. There's a scene where Tom Cruise is talking but his lips don't move. There's another scene where a character in the movie calls him Tom instead of Cole  really inexcusable that a error that big was missed. The scenes of cars ramming into one another while leading the race wouldn't be possible in reality they would wreck or cause too much damage to remain at top speed.By conventional standards it's a terrible movie. But somehow it's still a fun movie! Action on the race track is similar to the action in the sky in Top Gun. If you're up for a little escapism and wish fulfillment then Days of Thunder lives up to the billing. But if you're a critical viewer you won't be impressed by this film  unless you're looking for ways to laugh at its mistakes.".

From Tom Cruise's character to the punk that plays his nemesis after Roddy goes down..it's sickening. You want to jump on screen and punch the living daylights out of these guys because this has no plausibility whatsoever. Cruise stinks...really he does. He can't act..you know it and I know it. He is so bad. You can so see right through him when he is on screen. Any race fan will tell you this movie is a mockery of what a real driver's life is like. Talladega Nights is more believable than this Cruise vehicle. And please...Nicole Kidman as a 25 year old Australian speaking brain surgeon working in Charlotte????? P U! Totally miscast. Only Roddy reminds me anything of what it takes to drive these things when he says I'm gonna live forever. That is the mentality needed to race automobiles that can kill you. I am disappointed with NASCAR in recent years since it is so commercial and had lost contact with its roots. I am an open wheel fan deep down but I respect the drivers that run inches from each other at 200MPH....Something any racing critic could never do without soiling their undergarments and killing themselves...but this movie cheapens and disgraces all those driver's heroism. This stinks. So does the ridiculous ending and how he goes from last to second in like 20 laps at Daytona no less and then well just guess what happens on the last turn of the last b.s. lap... Total Hollywood baloney garbage. Please...go rent LeMans made by the great Steve McQueen if you want to see a real racing movie about racing itself not some cheap storyline...".

Yeah if you liked Top Gun and his other prettyboy films of this period  and some were pretty good actually  you might like this. In fact this film might be more popular now since NASCAR is televised so much more these days. This movie may get a new audience. Frankly I could care less about auto racing back then and now but I don't hate it I love most other sports and I like a good movie. This was only fair in all categories. Not bad not good.Racing fans tell me there wasn't a lot of realism with this and actual NASCAR events  mainly involving sponsorship  back then but I was looking an entertaining film....and I like Robert Duvall as actor and don't mind gazing at Nicole Kidman who can also act. Michael Rooker and Randy Quaid usually portray interesting people too.It's basically a story about a guy who wants to prove himself on the race track and I have no problem with that. It's not a memorable but it's not a waste of time either. You should be reasonably entertained.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eager for a winning formula team owner Tim Daland puts together the inexperienced but naturally talented Cole Trickle and the retired but skilled mechanic Harry Hogge to hopefully bounce off each other to create a winning combination. After the expected bumps and friction between the two they seem to blend well and start winning races. However a major accident between Cole and his main rival Rowdy Burns puts them both in the hospital under the care of the professional and leggy Dr Lewicki. But will Cole be able to overcome the physical and mental scars that he got.The comedian Rich Hall did a great routine once where he summed up the films of Tom Cruise by basically saying that each of them involves him being great at his job pilot bartender driver before suffering a crisis of confidence but meeting a beautiful lady who helps him over it in time to come good  hilarious in the telling because he was right and true to form Days of Thunder sets its stall out in the same way. That the plot is formulaic fatherson stuff macho posturing love interest final big race etc and it is a bit tiring at times because it is nothing new and it produces large sags during the film. The fatherson stuff is OK if hackneyed but the romance is so sudden and fake that it left me cool and never engaged once. The racing stuff is fun noisy and fast which I suppose is what most of its audience want but this is still not a great action movie but kudos to Scott for managing to make a load of cars going round a circular track appear exciting.The cast is more impressive on paper than they are in reality. Cruise plays his usual character and does it with no real charm or ability. He is trading off his fame here and his macho nonsense is rather tiresome. Kidman may have been Cruise's offscreen partner but viewers of this film will have seen their divorce coming because they have zero chemistry and she is poor throughout. It's not all her fault though the script gives her nothing to work with. Thank god then for Robert Duvall he may be playing a fairly clichd character but he does it well and steals every scene from his pretty but empty costar. Support is good from Quaid and Rooker but Ewles is given too little time to make anything but a negative impression and Reilly had yet to prove his versatility and doesn't do it here.Overall this is very much painting by the numbers in many regards. The plot is easy and lacks any sort of spark or innovation meaning that when the cars are off the screen it is easy for the film to get dull. The action scenes are OK but as with F1 I find many motor sports to be dull and didn't get drawn into the predictable races as much as I wanted to. The script gives the cast nothing to really work with and only Duvall comes out with any real dignity even if he has a clich as opposed to a real person to play. This has all the failings you would expect and the end result of so little imagination is an average film that is watchable but no more than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cars ! They've got to be the most boring topic of conversation ever . I remember being a teenager and every time someone brought up cars in conversation I'd have an out of body experience  that's how boring I found cars . I'd walk into a busy newsagents and all these bores would be flicking through mags about cars with the front of their trousers looking like a wigwam . I'm telling you newsagent distributors should start wrapping car magazines in plastic bags same as they do with porno magsHave I made my point ? Cars are boring so a movie featuring car racing isn't my gallon of four star but there was nothing else on so I decided to watch DAYS OF THUNDER regardless In many ways DAYS OF THUNDER is similar to TOP GUN . It has the same leading man  the same director and the same producer . It even has the same cynical marketing ploy of fast vehicles for the boys mixed in with a romantic sub story for the girls along with a OST album for the teenage market . The only real difference is that the screenplay is even more shallow than TOP GUN . Cole Trickle ! What sort of name is that for a racing driver ? He sounds more like an unemployed miner . I suppose Cruise plays the role very well since all he has to do is smile a lot and look a little bit moody now and again . No acting required . Robert Duvall is very disappointing but seeing as his character is a shallowly written father figure I suppose he did his best and this movie isn't about characters  It's about people rushing to the cinema then rushing out to buy the soundtrack album . Nothing more nothing less When you've seen one movie featuring fast cars like DRIVEN  THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS  and DAYS OF THUNDER you've seen them all".

Buck Bretherton? Harry Hogge? DID ANYONE LOOK AT THIS SCRIPT?! Didn't Robert Duvall stop and say Hey Harry Hogge sounds like the name of a pig from a lame children's book! Apart from the rhyming names we've got people like Rowdy Burns. Look here's a hint. If you're making a movie about race car drivers do NOT name the bad guy Rowdy. And don't give him such an obvious last name. I mean couldn't they have come up with something subtler than Wheeler? How about Harlem Hoogerhyde? I can't make up my mind. Either he's from Harlem or he's about to snort a booger on Tom Cruise. What do you think? Claire Lewicki rhymes with icky and that's never a good thing. Then we finally come to Cole Trickle. This is probably the lamest name in the movie which is sad considering it's the hero's. It belongs in a gay porno flick.And then there's the title of the film itself... DAYS OF THUNDER!!! Wow that's powerful! Unfortunately it too belongs in a gay porno film. The sequel could be called The Adventures of Cole Trickle and Harry Hogge DAYS OF POUNDING. The only good thing about this film was the inclusion of Guns N' Roses' cover of Bob Dylan's Knockin' On Heaven's Door on the soundtrack.".

	schema:headline " One of His Better Films";
	schema:reviewBody "Although it has the worst title of any Elvis movie Clambake 1967 is actually one of his better films. Which is surprising as it is one of his last and generally speaking each film seemed a bit worse than its predecessor. Clambake's salvation is certainly not in the soundtrack which is at best very ordinary only the title song has any energy. Although there is an actual clambake scene on the beach about midway into the film it seems thrown in just to justify the title more impressive is a cameo of Flipper who had his own television show at that time.I'm inclined to credit Shelley Fabares for the good vibe I got from this film. She plays golddigger with a heart of gold Dianne Carter Elvis' ultimate love interest. I never cared for her uptight Mary Stone character on reruns of The Donna Reed Show and therefore paid almost no attention to her until recently. But since seeing her in Ride the Wild Surf and Clambake I've had a major attitude adjustment. Clambake was the third time she was tapped for the love interest role in an Elvis film so obviously she and the King had grown comfortable working together. Their romance is a little different than the Elvis standard. In Clambake she does not start out hating or ignoring him. Instead they quickly become friends and she is obviously attracted but she puts the brakes on any romance because she is hunting for a rich husband and has tycoon J.J. Jamison Bill Bixby squarely in her sights. She comes around in the end and their chemistry actually feels real much like it did with Ann Margret in Viva Las Vegas.The comfort factor is also apparent between Elvis and Will Hutchins his reallife buddy. Oil tycoon Scott Elvis pulls a Prince and the Pauper and swaps places with drifter Tom Wilson Hutchins. He wants to find someone who loves him for himself. Hutchins is supposed to provide the film's main comic relief as he enjoys the life of the rich and famous driving Scott's Munsters inspired convertible and surrounding himself with gorgeous women who can't dance very well. Although the director had Hutchins overplay the part it is so poorly written that they can't squeeze many laughs out of the premise. But having most of his scenes with Fabares and Hutchins seems to have relaxed Elvis considerably which makes both he and his film more likable. Contrary to most I enjoyed the corny playground scene with the little girl who was afraid of the slide. The Confidence song is not a rip off of High Hopes the whole scene is a variation on the Bounce Right Back number Donald O'Connor did in Anything Goes. While Confidence is not much of a song this surreal scene is priceless. I wonder what longtime fans thought as they watched Elvis and Hutchins do something so totally Guffman? Most entertainers only do embarrassing stuff like this when they are first breaking into the business. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

You know the heavier more serious early ones.No I'll take his later films  you got it the dumb stupid ohso light ones. Films like Tickle Me Girl Happy Spinout and Double Trouble. And Clambake. The plots were always mindless fun and Clambake is no different.Elvis was almost always a moody brooding loner in the early films. He usually played unappreciative guys with chips on his shoulder the size of the Rock of Gibraltar. The characters in those films are guys I'd have little desire to know.However the guys he played in his later movies aren't that way at all. They're nice decent upstanding funloving fellas. I like those guys. I like watching them as heroes as leading characters in fun dumb little movies. Hence I like those movies a lot more. I couldn't give a rat's rear about appraising them as serious films because they're not.In his silly mindless mid'60s films Elvis always had a goofy main sidekick. Here in Clambake it's Will Hutchins who starred in one of Warner brothers' classic '60s television westerns Sugarfoot. And believe me Hutchins can goof it up with the best of them.The two wise sage old guys are 1 old pro James Gregory and 2 Bette Davis' ex Gary Merrill who if you really look often looked as though he hated whatever film he was in.Elvis' Number One girl Shelly Fabares plays the gal Elvis competes for with Bill My Favorite Martian Bixby. There are also plenty of Elvis Girls around as usual.Alas there are no true classics or any memorable songs in the entire film.

When you see Clambakeyou can smell the 60s decadethe inocence and childish happiness before the Vietnam Warthe death of Kennedy and Martin Luther King. The title song shows what you can expect of itits a fun filmwith no intentions to be taken serious by anyone.Its a partywith lots of girlscolor and Elvis Presley.The songs are not so badYou dont know meis a great balladA house that has everythingits a little pearljust like The girl i never loved.

You simply cannot watch clambake without having a lot of fun! You may like it for its inherent MST3K value or you might like it because of the Kings' great singing. Whatever the reason you will love this movie! Don't believe any of the bad reviews because in my opinion if you're watching any Elvis movie you know darn well what to expect. Maybe they don't have great stories and high production values but they all have one thing in common..... They don't take themselves seriously. So stop judging these movies by a serious standard. I guess before I finish I should go ahead and say that this is one of my favorite Elvis movies right up there with Viva Las Vegas. However I like Shelley a lot more than AnnMargaret.   Thanks Elvis!".

	schema:reviewBody "I've read all those negative comments about Clambake from the other users here and I fail to understand what they're all talking about. Maybe it's not rated the best but I think Clambake is Cool with a capital C. Elvis portrays an oil heir that's had a belly full of false friends apparently just because he's rich or actually it's his dad Duster Heyward that's the actual tycoon. His son Scott Elvis is offered the opportunity to change places with a buddy he meets at a hamburger stand who notices the attention Scott gets from a girl once she sees his shiny red convertible. Scott explains to Tom why this is the problem he's having I'd like to know it's myself! Not my car not my money Tom tells Scott That's the kind of problem I'd like to have. So anytime you want to switch places just say the word! Apparently Scott does say the word then Scott becomes Tom Wilson and Tom becomes Scott Heyward. Then it's off to the hotel where Tom meets Diane Shelley Fabares and asks Tom to give her a ski lesson so she could meet the famous boat racer and tycoon James J. Jamison III Bill Bixby who Tom competes with for Diane Carter.  In the end Tom Wilson the King creates a formula to keep the critical boat sturdy which he races in wins the race hopefully and of course what Elvis does in most every other movie wins the girl. The plot is great and the cast and crew are all magnificent. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 9.9.".

Elvis left his daddy's oil company for some independence and they are going now to a swanky Florida hotel where the dude has a job as a waterski instructor. The dude would love to be in Elvis' shoes with all that money and girls fawning over him for his car and all that and Elvis was tired of even thinking about money money money. It's not everything you know? Right? Well anyway Shelley Fabares who starred in three Elvis films this being the last has come to Florida with her own agenda of snagging a millionaire and so is intent on getting Bill Bixby's attention who is a rich snob but who goes for the fast type. I know this is kind of corny in parts why did we need the CONFIDENCE musical number with the children? but I've always considered Clambake to be one of my favorites due to the presence of Shelley the romantic and tender scenes between them and it's just so laidback and unpretentious. And it has some very good upbeat songs along with some romantic songs including You Don't Know Me. I know Elvis wanted to do more than these undemanding and predictable feelgood movies but for what it is it's very enjoyable and entertaining. If one didn't like this kind of movie they wouldn't be watching them. So why be critical? It may be no Viva Las Vegas with AnnMargret but Shelley Fabares is one of the most naturally beautiful actresses I've ever seen with her quiet reserve. It has a cute ending too. Relax and enjoy a Clambake with Elvis and Shelley Fabares.".

	schema:reviewBody "Elvis Presley was a hugely influential performer with one of the most distinctive singing voices of anybody. He embarked on a film career consisting of 33 films from 1956 to 1969 films that did well at the boxoffice but mostly panned critically especially his later films and while he was a highly charismatic performer he was never considered a great actor.'Clambake' has often been considered one of the King's worst despite it being very strongly defended to the point of I'm right and you're wrong defensiveness by some here. To me it is not his worst film which one would expect from the film with the worst title of all the likes of a few of his later efforts 'Paradise Hawaiian Style' 'Double Trouble' and 'Harum Scarum' are worse. But of a notoriously inconsistent film career that started off good but became mostly mediocre at best after 'Viva Las Vegas' it also doesn't fare favourably. Not unwatchable but severely undercooked and dare one say it lazy.There are things that salvage it from being a mustmiss film considering that there are many of the elements that made Elvis' later films so disappointing done pretty risibly to a mediocre one. Most of the songs are below par but A House That Has Everything and The Girl I Never Loved are nice and the best one You Don't Know Me could easily have been a bigger hit.Also thought very little of most of the cast but James Gregory and Bill Bixby enjoy themselves in roles that could have grated yet they show that one can have fun without going overboard something that other cast members could have learnt from. Shelley Fabares has little to do in an underwritten role but does her best to inject some charm and heart fair play to her as the role didn't deserve that degree of effort.While most of 'Clambake' looks cheap even for a later Elvis film what little glimpses there are of scenery looks nice and one wishes there was more.However Elvis gives a very perfunctory performance as a character that plays too secondary to that of Will Hutchins. This is a bad thing as not only does one not see that Elvis was a very capable actor when the material allowed it like in his best films like 'King Creole' 'Flaming Star' 'Jailhouse Rock' 'Viva Las Vegas' and 'Loving You' but also Hutchins spends much of his performance mugging and it grates fast. The rest of the cast go through the motions this includes Gary Merrill who is a halfway decent actor limited to looking annoyed.Three songs aside the rest of the songs are below par. Admittedly the title song is sort of catchy but also gets very repetitive with incredibly simplistic lyric writing. Who Needs Money suffers from Elvis and apparently Ray Walker dubbing Hutchins looking and sounding like they couldn't be bothered as well as not being a particularly good song at all. It's nothing though compared to the embarrassment that is Confidence which in every sense of the word reaches rockbottom depths in the same way the likes of Yoga is as Yoga Does 'Easy Come Easy Go' Old MacDonald Had a Farm 'Double Trouble' Smorgasbord 'Spinout' Petunia the Gardener's Daughter 'Frankie  Johnny' Hello Little Girl 'Harum Scarum' and a vast majority of the soundtrack for 'Paradise Hawaiian Style' do.Unfortunately nice scenery is too far and between with the rest of the production values being of such cheap and made in haste quality it is even for Elvis' later films one of his cheaperlooking films. The colour is garish to the verge of being excessively nauseating the cinematography is full of inyour face close ups in the very unexciting climax and overuse and abuse of the widescreen process that sees CinemaScope at its cheapest and the back projection is also overused and abused and has rarely looked more phoney.Scripting is groanworthy with very little structure or pace and delivered with very little enthusiasm the dialogue itself makes even the strongest cheese in the world bland in comparison. The story is basically a very stale and pedestrian rehash of 'The Prince and the Pauper' a formula tried and tested to death well before 'Clambake' and given next to no variation or momentum. Arthur Nadel's direction lacks steadiness and doesn't seem particularly experienced in film.In conclusion not a complete waste but severely undercooked not even reaching halfbaked overall which is a worrying sign and lacklustre. 410 Bethany Cox".

It's nice to see a film from the period dealing with common working class people caught up in the turmoil of love and everyday life. The main romantic leads initially seem a little mismatched but by film's end the ice has more than melted between them. How many times have we seen the female lead fall too quickly for her suitor. Here it takes its sweet time and plays the better for it. Signoret's titular character seems almost a bit too stoic but considering her numbingly bland and lenghty marital situation it may well be authentic. As many women are in reality Therese is fiercely loyal to her husband whether he deserves it or not. The ruggedly handsome Raf Vallone is ideally cast as the trucker who steals her attention and makes a good contrast to her dishrag of a husband. A blackmailing sailor who appears in the middle of the film before making a menacing reappearance near the end is very effectively played by Rolland leSaffre.

	schema:headline " The stranger in the train";
	schema:reviewBody "Emile Zola's novel about adultery blackmail and murder was adapted for the screen by Marcel Carne and Chales Spaak two men who knew about all the elements that show so prominently in the book. In fact Mr. Carne seems the obvious choice to tackle this work that packs quite a lot. Emile Zola was one of France's best writers of his time. His work always reflected human beings at a crossroad as is the case in Therese Raquin one of his best novels.Therese the young woman at the center of the story is married to her sickly cousin Camille. One look at Therese tells it all she's caught in a no win situation as long as she remains married. Therese is ready to satisfy the sexual desires bottled in her. Enter the dashing young driver Laurent. He likes Therese and she feels for once in her lifetime the spark that brings her to life. It's clear she falls for this stranger with a passion she didn't know she had within her.Zola seems to be a role model for writers like James Cain who also saw what passion could do to sexually repressed individuals. The theme of Therese Raquin evokes some modern novels like Mr. Cain's The Postman Always Ring Twice and Double Indemnity to cite only two of his works also turned into successful films.Camille who senses his wife's betrayal decides to take her away to some relatives where she would be safe away from the temptation of the handsome man that could mean her salvation. Therese and Laurent have another thing in mind as it becomes clear when the young lover happens to be in the same train as the Raquin. Little prepares them for the stranger that is also riding the train and who will come back to haunt them.Simone Signoret makes an appealing Therese. Ms. Signoret was an interesting actress to watch on any of the films she appeared. Therese was one of her best creations as she gives the director a nuanced performance in what remains to be one of her best roles she played on the screen. Handsome Raf Vallone appears as the man who seduces the beautiful woman in an unhappy marriage. Sylvie is perfect as the mother who knew in her heart about her niece's betrayal. Marcel Andre as the blackmailer Michaud also creates the necessary tension for the lovers.Therese Raquin is not seen often theses days but it's worth a look for people who love the genre to watch one of Marcel Carne's best works in the French cinema.".

	onyx:emotionText "Emile Zola's novel about adultery blackmail and murder was adapted for the screen by Marcel Carne and Chales Spaak two men who knew about all the elements that show so prominently in the book. In fact Mr. Carne seems the obvious choice to tackle this work that packs quite a lot. Emile Zola was one of France's best writers of his time. His work always reflected human beings at a crossroad as is the case in Therese Raquin one of his best novels.Therese the young woman at the center of the story is married to her sickly cousin Camille. One look at Therese tells it all she's caught in a no win situation as long as she remains married. Therese is ready to satisfy the sexual desires bottled in her. Enter the dashing young driver Laurent. He likes Therese and she feels for once in her lifetime the spark that brings her to life. It's clear she falls for this stranger with a passion she didn't know she had within her.Zola seems to be a role model for writers like James Cain who also saw what passion could do to sexually repressed individuals. The theme of Therese Raquin evokes some modern novels like Mr. Cain's The Postman Always Ring Twice and Double Indemnity to cite only two of his works also turned into successful films.Camille who senses his wife's betrayal decides to take her away to some relatives where she would be safe away from the temptation of the handsome man that could mean her salvation. Therese and Laurent have another thing in mind as it becomes clear when the young lover happens to be in the same train as the Raquin. Little prepares them for the stranger that is also riding the train and who will come back to haunt them.Simone Signoret makes an appealing Therese. Ms. Signoret was an interesting actress to watch on any of the films she appeared. Therese was one of her best creations as she gives the director a nuanced performance in what remains to be one of her best roles she played on the screen. Handsome Raf Vallone appears as the man who seduces the beautiful woman in an unhappy marriage. Sylvie is perfect as the mother who knew in her heart about her niece's betrayal. Marcel Andre as the blackmailer Michaud also creates the necessary tension for the lovers.Therese Raquin is not seen often theses days but it's worth a look for people who love the genre to watch one of Marcel Carne's best works in the French cinema.";

	schema:reviewBody "Because of the major impact they had as a team on both French cinema and cinema in general we tend to find ourselves speaking of Marcel Carne and Jacques Prevert as Pre and Post their collaboration which spanned approximately ten years and delivered seven films Jenny Drole de Drame Quai des Brumes Le Jour se leve Les Visiteurs du soir Les Enfants du paradis and Les Portes de la nuit which embedded themselves in the memorybanks of movie buffs the world over. Therese Racquin is postPrevert Carne dating from 1953 some seven years after their final collaboration Les Portes de la nuit and although Carne was never to make a wholly satisfying film without Prevert this is not as bad as you might think. It's tempting to find echoes of Double Indemnity inasmuch as there are scenes where 1 an adulterer lover hides behind an open door and 2 the 'inconvenient' husband is murdered on a train. Against this is the fact that in Double Indemnity it was the woman Stanwyck hiding behind McMurray's door as he ushered out Barton Keyes whilst here it is the man Raf Vallone hiding behind Therese's door as she speaks to her motherinlaw and in Indemnity Stanwyck's husband Tom Powers wasn't actually killed 'on' the train but his body was left on the tracks as IF he had fallen off. Here the confrontation between husband wife and wife's lover takes place on the train and results in the husband's death. There was no way that Carne was going to make a BAD film but the Prevert touch is definitely missed. Signoret is of course superb but Raf Vallone was way out of his league in this company. The black and white photography enhances the mood and the 'feel' is about threequarters right but the illcontrived deusex machina lets down all that has gone before. Well worth watching.".

The parallels are certainly obvious. However in The Adultress you actually feel sorry for the wife and given the awfulness of the husband and his mother you CAN sympathize and almost excuse the killingespecially since it was not premeditated. In the other however the wife is essentially an awful conniver and the husband though old is a decent and loving man. I actually think the way The Adultress constructs the story this is better as it's much easier to connect with the characters and care about their fates. You don't so much excuse their actions but understand and empathize a bit for them. Plus Thrse is the opposite of Cora from The Postmanshe DOES have a conscience and she is not exactly evil.Overall The Adultress is an excellent film with exceptional performances. I also loved the moral ambiguities about the filmambiguities that make the viewer think. I also appreciated the very unusual and very surprising endingit's worth it!".

Therese Simone Signoret is so resigned to her life and it's injustices and so misguided in her obligations to it that her story could easily have been subtitled The Misfortunes Of Virtue. Long past quiet desperation Therese has anesthetized herself to a dismal future and when her husband's newfound friend Laurent Raf Vallone falls for her it's impossible for the woman to break free from her selfimposed prison. The love she feels for Laurent nearly stirs her to action but ultimately the affair only emphasizes a No Exit situation. Passion and premeditated murder characterized both the Zola horror novel and Luchino Visconti's James M. Caininspired OSSESSIONE to which Carne's film has been erroneously compared but here they have been eliminated and an inexorable fatalism have taken their place. Therese's existence is selffulfilling prophesy and her bad karma literally and figuratively drain the life out of her husband and his mother her lover and even her blackmailer. Bitter irony is only the natural course of events and the black cat she keeps as a pet symbolizes the bad luck its mistress brings when Therese's lover kills her husband in a fit of anger the attempt to cover it up only hastens their love's preordained end. Adapting Emile Zola is an ambitious undertaking the effects of heredity and surroundings are key in his works but so is the sex and savagery inherent in the human beast and it can't be cut out without emasculating the whole. There's some passion in Vallone's Laurent before Signoret's inverted Emma Bovary begins to have an effect on him but not enough to carry a film. Director Marcel Carne took a theme or two beloved of Zola as well as Film Noir and by having the heroine sleepwalk to her fate created a strangely numbing portrait of dashed dreams in a bourgeoisie trap with no way out. Setting the tale in the present instead of the late 1800s when women's options were far more limited only diluted the theme of an oppressive environment's effects. On the plus side the worldview is very downbeatdark and should have been a noirist's delight because it ended badly for everyone including the peripheral characters and when that happens it's the film's philosophy and universe. Happiness here can only come at the expense of others Therese's husband and his mother's happiness came at a cost to Therese and her shot at happiness was devastating to them. The war heroblackmailer's dreams were extorted from both Therese and Laurent while Laurent's happiness was undercut by the one who made him happy. A truly ugly world ...and honestly why bother living in it? Unhappy fates are a given and not even the ruthless who care nothing for what it costs others can never attain what they really want or if they do get it its not for very long. All of this is great noir ...but what happened in it's filmic depiction? There's some great symbolism that show the care and effort Carne et al put into this The black cat Therese's luckless lot was put outside while the lady entertained Laurent in her room the only happiness she'd ever know but old Mme. Raquin brought it right back to her door Therese doted on the omen which signifies an embrace of her fate. Those weekly games of chance were a metaphor for life and contains a favorite noir theme concerning existence You can't win you can't break even you can't even quit the game. Here if you do win you've either cheated or are accused of it and of course it always comes at a price to someone else. I should have been depressed looking in on their world ...or angry ...or something as the end credits rolled and that's just it I wasn't moved at all. Could that have been what Carne intended all along? To be as deadened to the proceedings as Therese was to her life? There are a few suspenseful moments a superb supporting cast some beautiful Lyon scenery a touch of homo eroticism and train scenes reminiscent of LA BETE HUMAINEHUMAN DESIRE but a Zolainspired tale doesn't guarantee deliciously dark entertainment and the film is neither recommended nor to be avoided.Kino has used a pristine print for its DVD transfer and this weighs in its favor but the lack of extras doesn't.".

Her restrained turn might seem too stoic at first but she exudes volumes through her apathetic veneer. Raf Vallone reminiscent of a brooding Burt Lancaster is convincing as the impulsive truck driver who's determined on unshackling Thrse from her oppressive wretched existence. Roland Lesaffre's addition as the greasy opportunistic sailor further strengthens the elements of suspense in the story. The naturalistic BW photography is excellent and maintains a healthy balance between carefully choreographed claustrophobic scenarios and exquisite exterior compositions.Thrse Raquin represents French filmmaking of the old school where storytelling was paramount and is recommended to connoisseurs of classic filmnoir".

Roland Lesaffre's addition as the greasy opportunistic sailor further strengthens the elements of suspense in the story. The naturalistic BW photography is excellent and maintains a healthy balance between carefully choreographed claustrophobic scenarios and exquisite exterior compositions.Thrse Raquin represents French filmmaking of the old school where storytelling was paramount and is recommended to connoisseurs of classic filmnoir";

	schema:reviewBody "Though I read mile Zola's novel more than 30 years ago I remember Thrse as a more brutal character than presented here. Zola like his naturalistic literary contemporaries Jack London Stephen Crane and Frank Norris from which Greed was derived saw man as a brute guided by naturalistic social or environmental forces beyond their power or control. Maybe the films of the early 50s had to tame their characters a bit to comport with the mores of the time. Nevertheless this film covers most of the elements of the novel and relayed them in a contemporary setting.Thrse Simone Signoret lives in Lyon and is married to her whimpering and sickly cousin Camille Jacques Duby. Their marriage was arranged by her aunt Camille's strongwilled mother Madame Raquin Sylvie after Thrse's parents had died and there was nowhere else for her to turn. Thrse is treated like a servant and waits on Camille and his mother hand and foot both in their little notions shop as a sales clerk and in their home above the shop. While Camille orders her about it is clear that Madame Raquin is the power behind everything in her son's life.Stuck in this sham marriage Thrse's life is dull and routine until one day when her drunk husband is brought home by an affable foreign truck driver Laurent Raf Vallone. Laurent soon becomes one of the family friends and he and Thrse fall in love. When Camille discovers this he threatens Laurent then Thrse then both together. But he is so weakwilled that he is unable to stand up to them. Camille's next attempt to keep Thrse is to take her on a trip to Paris. But when Laurent appears on the same train after being tipped off by Thrse Camille is thrown from the rapidly moving train while he quarrels with Laurent.With no witnesses to prove that they were together the two lovers decide to split up for awhile until Camille's 'accidental death' blows over. What they don't anticipate is that a sailor sleeping in their compartment had witnessed them together and that he Michaud Marcel Andr would later blackmail them. Interestingly when Thrse's motherinlawfromhell hears of her son's death she instantly suffers a stroke that leaves her at Thrse's mercy. Unable to move or communicate Madame Raquin can now be scolded by Thrse without any talk back. Also she has to look on as Thrse and Laurent plan how to deal with their blackmailer.Actually the best part of his soso Zola adaptation is the interactions between the two lovers and their clever blackmailer. The film is worth seeing if only for its bizarre and twisted ending. In spite of the other reviews that I have read of this film I DON'T believe that the ending is conventional nor is it wrapped up the way a traditionalist would think it would be..".

The acting is good from the main players and Marcel Andre has a definite Robert Mitchum look to him if slightly camp. The ending is a mess that doesn't work itself out clearly. You will need to make assumptions as to what is probably going to be the outcome. I suspect that this was not the intention as we are offered the twist at the end.

	schema:reviewBody "Three years ago I took a class called Images in Japanese Popular Culture and within the class we watched several wonderful films including of each from the multitude of Zatoichi and Torasan films a beautiful film titled Furusato by Koyama Seijiro a real tearjerker titled Okaasan and Ichikawa Kon's beautiful rendition of Tanizaki Junichiro's The Makioka Sisters. However I believe the film that truly stuck in my memory was Morita's Family game starring Matsuda Yusaku father of Matsuda Ryuhei and Itami Juzo the brilliant actor and director who would later create such masterpieces as Tampopo and A Quiet Life.Family Game opens by introducing the viewer to the Numata family dad mom older brother Shinichi and younger brother Shigeyuki. While Shinichi is a wonderful student having been accepted to a top high school which has a strong record getting its students into the top universities younger brother Shigeyuki is much closer to the bottom around 8th or 9th. While basically absent from the household except when he comes home after work drunk dad is concerned that his younger son won't get accepted into a top high school. Therefore he hires Yoshimoto a tall clean cut young man who attends a thirdrate university. Many tutors have failed before the arrival of Yoshimoto so dad offers him 10000 yen per class rank Shigeyuki ascends. Therefore if Shigeyuki rises thirty ranks Yoshimoto will receive 300 000 yen. Seems like a good deal yes? Well Shigeyuki is not quite willing to cooperate. With his nonconfrontational mother who prefers leaving bigger decisions to her husband or others Shigeyuki is used to getting his way so when he is told to write the words he does know in Basho's Narrow Road to the North he pulls a stunt in which he writes twilight 228052628612428 over and over again. When Yoshimoto sees page after page of twilight he then proceeds to slap Shigeyuki hard enough to bloody the boy's nose and warns him that if he tries to pull anymore stunts like that again he will be hit and Yoshimoto is not one to pull his punches. Yoshimoto informs Shigeyuki's mother that the reason the boy's nose bled was that he got a bit overexcited but although it is never directly stated she is of course worried but dad thinks the end justifies the means so the tutoring continues. With an absent father and a gentle milksop for a mother Shigeyuki actually does become closer to his tutor and his grades do actually rise but it is not through actual academic assistance Yoshimoto normally looks at books about plants during their tutoring sessions but the closeness and discipline Yoshimoto offers helps the boy. However should Yoshimoto really be the one providing such a foundation? Family Game is completely dominated by the presence of Matsuda Yusaku. With his large size he almost fills the apartment of the Numatas' which is almost at bursting point with its four family members. However it is his aggressiveness that really takes the stage. With no sense of personal space Yoshimoto gets as close as he possibly can to Shigeyuki and often touches him as well including one part of the film in which Shigeyuki is dressed only in his briefs. This scene doesn't have any sexual undertones in my opinion but it is again another example of the magnitude of Yoshimoto's presence. Yoshimoto does other things to excess also including drinking all of his beverages often noisily in on breath. While it is not too popular in the Western world although it pops up quite often in film classes Family Game is a pretty amazing film that should be seen just for the film's last ten minutes but should be seen by those who not only enjoy Japanese films but films in general.".

When Yoshimoto sees page after page of twilight he then proceeds to slap Shigeyuki hard enough to bloody the boy's nose and warns him that if he tries to pull anymore stunts like that again he will be hit and Yoshimoto is not one to pull his punches. Yoshimoto informs Shigeyuki's mother that the reason the boy's nose bled was that he got a bit overexcited but although it is never directly stated she is of course worried but dad thinks the end justifies the means so the tutoring continues. With an absent father and a gentle milksop for a mother Shigeyuki actually does become closer to his tutor and his grades do actually rise but it is not through actual academic assistance Yoshimoto normally looks at books about plants during their tutoring sessions but the closeness and discipline Yoshimoto offers helps the boy. However should Yoshimoto really be the one providing such a foundation? Family Game is completely dominated by the presence of Matsuda Yusaku. With his large size he almost fills the apartment of the Numatas' which is almost at bursting point with its four family members. However it is his aggressiveness that really takes the stage. With no sense of personal space Yoshimoto gets as close as he possibly can to Shigeyuki and often touches him as well including one part of the film in which Shigeyuki is dressed only in his briefs. This scene doesn't have any sexual undertones in my opinion but it is again another example of the magnitude of Yoshimoto's presence. Yoshimoto does other things to excess also including drinking all of his beverages often noisily in on breath. While it is not too popular in the Western world although it pops up quite often in film classes Family Game is a pretty amazing film that should be seen just for the film's last ten minutes but should be seen by those who not only enjoy Japanese films but films in general.";

Had the film been more of an outright comedy I think it would have worked better for me. Instead parts were comedic parts were a bit dull and much of it was just inexplicable.The film is the story of a slacker who is in 9th grade and soon to take his high school exams. While we don't have these in the States I know that in many countries this is a HUGE eventand Japanese families put a lot of pressure on their kids to get into the best schools. Despite this pressure the kid chooses not to even try and is one of the worst kids in his class....and previous tutors were unable to get him to budge. This new one is odd...very odd. In fact much of the time he seems to act for practically no reason and in ways you'd never expect. However when the boy's father offers him a bonus for each ranking the kid improves that's enough to get the odd tutor to actoccasionally slapping or threatening the boy to get results. Then as if my magic the boy improves though how and this whole process seemed to come from no where and instead of everything being wonderful you see through the course of this film that the family is really screwed updistant dysfunctional and bland. So again out the the blue the tutor beats the snot out of all of them and leaves. Then the mom and two sons are shown becoming sleepy and taking a nap...and so the film ends.As I said the film has some wonderful momentsbut too much of the stuff in between looks like outtakes or scenes that should have been deleted. I just kept hoping the film would get really weird or profound...but nothing. Perhaps I was hoping for the film to be like Tampopo or Happiness of the Katakuris all I know is that it left me very flat.By the way although I did not adore the film one thing sure struck me. The kids in the classroom were horriblebadly behaved obnoxious and jerks. I assume this was meant as parody as Jpaanese kids have fantastic reputations for studying and working hard...and NOT being total jerks. These kids were much much worse behaved than any of the high and middle school kids I ever taughtand American kids are famous for being illbehaved slackers. I'd love to hear more from someone who can tell me if Japanese kids ever actually behave like this.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie tells of a Japanese family living in a small apartment. They have two sons one in high school doing well in his studies the other failing miserably because he does not care. Shigeyuki the younger brother is not stupid he is just lazy and a bit of a trouble maker. The family has hired a series of tutors for the boy but none have helped. This changed with the introduction of Yoshimoto the new tutor. He has quite a different look at tutoring including kissing his subject and then smacking him and then rubbing the young man's buttocks. As Shigeyuki begins to flourish under the odd tutor his older brother once considered to be the son that brought pride to the family is beginning to fall behind and cut classes. His once encouraging father insults him and his mother tries her best to hold the family. We not only explore the boys' studies but also the family dynamic. The father works all the time and doesn't care about his family. The mother tries to hold the family together and like many women all over the world is unhappy having to sacrifice her happiness for her husband and children. The film although quite smart is also very funny. Shigeyuki has a habit of fighting with older boys and we hear stories of how he once lost control of his bowels in class. Shigeyuki is given porn mags as a joke and when his tutor sees them he asks 'does looking at them give you a hard on?' to which Shigeyuki replies 'no i don't like girls.' the tutor fires back 'they give me hard ones fast'. The tutor often has dinner with his student's family. During one of the final and most hilarious scenes you see mother and father discussing their family while ignoring the escalating food fight beside them. Not until Yoshimoto pours wine all over their small table do they take notice. This is when the fun really begins. One by one Yoshimoto smacks them all into unconsciousness in hilarious loony toons or three stooges fashion. Kazoku gmu or The Family Game is a hilarious piece of work from Japan. It is HARD to find with English subtitles but worth the search!".

There are so many movies that don't end so happily nowadays but remembering the times with movies that had a character who had to learn a lesson but got something more in the end eg.

Its not the first time the little folks have gotten the shaft from Henry. He lives in a posh New York City apartment with his beautiful wife Annette Bening and sweet daughter. Yet things are strained on the home front between the couple and money goes through their hands like water. However one evening when Henry slips out to buy cigarettes at the shop around the corner he is caught in a holdup and ends up getting shot. There is considerable brain damage and the doctors can not tell Henry's wife just what his future holds. Thus begins a lengthy rehabilitation for the oncebrilliant lawyer that includes learning to speak and write all over again. He makes great strides with the help of a very caring therapist. Most importantly Henry changes from a person with a very dark demeanor to one who is almost innocent in his view of the world. Still many secrets remain mostly from Henry's past life at the law firm. Can Henry and his wife overcome their problems and stay together? This is a very nice movie with plenty of heartwarming scenes. Ford has never been better than he is here for his role runs the gamut from despicable lawyer to a disabled man struggling to speak and relearn basic skills. Bening is also great as the wife who finds a way to fall in love with her husband all over again. The rest of the cast is also quite nice especially the gentleman who plays Henry's therapist. Then too the sets costumes direction and production are very worthy. Still the movie's themes are the most important aspects of the film as the film questions the integrity of the law profession and also ponders whether the best part of a person is his heart or his brain. Regarding all of the films sitting on the shelves of a video store this one is something special. Don't delay in garnering a view for you and your partner soon.".

That said this film really shows him off and also deals with a very real topic.Many people say this film is manipulative but I don't see it and I'm usually the first one to roll my eyes at something being overdone.  The characters were believable though Harrison Ford easily outshines the others.  Playing someone with a disability is very very difficult yet he does it so flawlessly that you really believe that he is braindamaged.The plot Harrison Ford as Henry Turner is a cuttthroat lawyer who seems to have lost sight of life.  Yea he's a total jerk but this first segment is pretty crucial.  This movie has a habit of bringing back seemingly unimportant things for example Henry's opinion of the table.  However one night after winning a case defending a hospital in a malpractice suit Henry is off to buy cigarettes and winds up being shot by a panicked robber at the convenience store The robber is played by John Leguizamo by the wayprobably jealous that Ford is a much better actor.  The bullets hit Henry in the head and he is braindamaged.  Now he must slowly start his life over again trying to relearn speech tying shoes and remembering who he used to be.  Of course once he learns what an ahole he used to be and the rotten people he was associated with he is forced to make some choices about his life.There are some really great scenes in here.  In particular the entire mystery of why Henry remembers the word Ritz actually plays a major role in the film.  Annette Bening is good as the wife who is trying to help her husband regain his own life and aquainting herself with the new Henry.  It cannot be stressed enough how stellar Ford's performance is.  Even if you hate the script you'll have to admit that he is completely convincing as Henry.  This role is a real change for someone wellknown for playing Han Solo and Indiana Jones.This movie is definetly worth a rental if just for seeing Harrison Ford's Oscarworthy acting job.".

When something like this happens the spouse and children have to adjust to a new life and it isn't easy and there's always a part of you that misses the kind of life you had envisioned. But in this awful movie the wife is just pleased as punch that she gets to spend the rest of her life with a mentally challenged man because he was kind of a jerk before he was shot so you see he and everybody else is better off because he was shot in the head and made retarded the wife gets faithful husband and the kids get the little brother they always wanted.They could have made an honest and interesting movie about what some families have to face.If the movie had been about what families really face in a situation like this it might have worked. As it is I am offended by this movie to the Nth degree.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a little odd to see a film like 'Temple of Doom' one day and then seeing Regarding Henry quite soon after. Harrison Ford is not usually an actor thought of for his range but more for his star presence in films of the swaggering sarcastic and allaround badass of Star Wars Indiana Jones the Fugitive and Air Force One someone who can even in his later years open a movie in theaters fairly well. When he ventures out to really give a full performance and expand his talents it can be hit or miss. Regarding Henry displays his skills of going past his usual star persona while showing that there isn't much to reach for in some of these riskier roles. Because the film directed by Mike Nichols and written by JJ Abrams is lackluster in the ways that matter of giving as good as it could promise on its premise and with at least a few contrivances.Henry a successful lawyer gets changed completely when two bullets wipe out his motor reflexes and the majority of his memory. Coming back from scratch to his wife Annette Benning daughter and friends and colleagues proves to be a slow but revealing task as Henry becomes a more enjoyable and open kind of person in his way. It's not without some interest in these early scenes like the first half an hour of the film where the bulk of this transformation takes place. His rehabilitation early on hints at what will come the innocence of Henry childlike at first and then with more on the mind as the past comes back to him for better and worse. Ford accomplishes this performance with subtlety he's not known for but at the same time he also has to play to a certain type which then starts to limit him. It's hard not to watch him on screen as good as he can be in what he does but in subverting himself with this script it grows wearier as the story goes into more predictable territory.Another problem and considering this is Mike The Graduate Carnal Knowledge Nichols there isn't enough dramatic conflict to really get involved with the characters and some performances seem less dimensional than should be Henry's rehab guy the daughter with her same dour face. The borderline of this being a grownup story of an after school special gets on the line and then crosses to and fro that it becomes frustrating. It's ironic though to say I would recommend watching the film just once as it does have enough to it to watch once for Ford and Benning's work. That it's a disappointment though of what could've been is undeniable for me. Still if you want to see Ford doing something nonkicking ass and taking names start here.".

I had many surgeries radiation therapy and survived my crisis. Like Henery's character some things I had to learn over. Although not as quite as severe as the character Henry in the movie. I lost my sense of humor for several years. No matter how funny something was I remained silent for several years. Before my surgeries I had excellent grammar and spelling. After the surgeries I struggled to spell and complete sentences when writing. Just as the story in the movie shows you can relearn and recover. The movie is correct in showing things will more than likely not be the same and it takes time to recover. The scene in the movie with the doctor as his wife as he describes a very slow recovery process is so true to real life. I love this movie because there are people that show you hope and that they never stop believing in you like Henry's wife. Sadly there are also people who belittle you and find fault. The scene in the movie at the party where Henry is described as another child in the family is very true. To hear that from someone with a disability is very emotional downfall. The best thing about this movie is that it starts with showing Henry as a defense attorney who stops at nothing to win a case. This is the kind of guy we all love to hate. Then at the end of the movie he is very likable average Joe anyone would enjoy having a conversation with.".

Well sorry but I wasn't convinced at ALL!When he later returns as a simpleton I find him unsympathetic.E.g. he outrageously steals a document of his client hospital from his firm's files a document inconsistent with the presumed testimony of his nine defendants to deliver to the plaintiff in the malpractice case. We are meant to cheer.Since the plaintiff presumably didn't ask for the document in discovery my thought was that Mr. Turner should now be disbarred for misappropriating the document and deliberately aiding his adversary!Might the document have been already delivered to the adversary and discredited at trial? Might the document have been admitted in evidence but disbelieved in the face of contrary testimony by the jury? Might the document have been mistaken? Presumably the author was placed on the witness stand herself. Might the document have been forged?The movie has no time for any questions it prefers why we were morally wrong because it states something at variance with the defense. The movie is THAT idiotic.E.g. when the new Mr. Turner is hurt that his daughter cannot be pulled from her class at prep school in order to speak to him because his phone call is not an emergency we are meant to cheer when he later pulls his daughter from the school. You see a school that says he should call in the evening when the daughter is free is a school to which only the heartless would send their child. We don't see the grim alternative New York City public school to which he may now be required to send his child. SPOILERS E.g. when we learn that he and his wife were each involved in an affair we are meant somehow to think that this was related to his work  or to his previous affluence. Why? I'm unaware that the rich cheat on spouses more often than the poor. END OF SPOILERS E.g. when we see the lascivious physical therapist roll his eyes his head and his tongue in speaking loudly of the appearance of each woman who passes repeatedly saying gotta get me some of THAT and teaching these words to his patient just learning to speak we are somehow not meant to recoil in sympathy for the demeaned women. Somehow this overly familiar physical therapist to whom Turner is Henry from the first moment and who believes that addressing him as a child is therapeutic is not a raunchy lowlife but a heartwarming friend.I hated the movie.However Harrison Ford's portrayal of the character is wonderful from start to finish. At the beginning one truly believes that this is a successful lawyer. Later one truly believes that this is a man who is struggling to move to speak to read. His portrayal is as fine as Tom Hanks' portrayal of Forest Gump.Donald Moffat is fine as the senior partner of the firm as is Annette Benning in a thankless disease of the week role as nurturing wife and mother. Unfortunately the morose and passive daughter is written so badly that the young actress has little to play.I had thought of recommending this movie for children under ten its presumed real audience but in truth it would only convey ideas that are so moronic and prejudicial that it's not a good idea.The Doctor has a similar theme  but is far superior.".

This would be an excellent family film except for needless profanity and usage of the Lord's name in vain. Much of the language comes out of the mouth of the therapist. It's too bad they didn't tone the language down so more people could have enjoyed this goodmessage film.Warning the film drags in spots too. However the good acting Harrison Ford and Annette Bening provide attractive solid lead performances and the good story make this a good film overall. I wouldn't mind seeing this again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Regarding Henry is the kind of shamelessly manipulative pap that really should have remained true to its Disease of the Week' TV Movie roots. Harrison Ford plays a hotshot lawyer who has little time for his wife and daughter but has to start his life from scratch after being shot and brain damaged. And when I say from scratch I mean as if he has just been born! He has to learn to identify colours learn to walk learn to speak and then rebuild his life and career. The plot employs every single clich that you could thing of. There's a nice black physiotherapist his daughter teaches him how to read again his partners at work don't like him anymore and a few skeletons emerge from his and his wife's lives. But that won't matter because Henry realises that his life before he was shot wasn't so great. He cares for his family much more now and many of the big cases that he won previously he did so by lying and cheating. And that was very very wrong damnit!! By now you'll be thinking that I giving this film 110 but no. I'm actually giving it 610 because for all this calculating schmaltz Regarding Henry is an entertaining and even compulsively watchable film. This mainly because of the star clout that is involved in it. Ford away from his action man charisma is surprisingly convincing as the brain damaged Henry Annette Bening is simply wonderful as his compassionate and sympathetic wife and Bill Nunn is great too as Bradley Henry's physio. Director Nichols has made far better films both before and after this with The Graduate and Primary Colors yet he handles the film well enough and Hans Zimmer has produced another great music score. You get the feeling from all the effort put into the film that these people honestly thought that they were making heavy and profound. On that score they are seriously deluded. But all the same Regarding Henry is quite an effective family drama and if you ignore how cheap it is you could even have a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye.".

His whole life is about work and social status. Then something happens that changes everything and he must decide who he wants to be after all. The movie has a very simple but meaningful message about what's really important in life. It's presented in a dramatic way with comical moments thrown in just as life really plays out. Harrison Ford and Annette Bening are excellent as usual but the real standouts for me were Bill Nunn and Mikki Allen. Bill Nun plays Bradley an amazingly fun and enjoyable physical therapist. Mikki Allen plays the daughter Rachel in a performance way beyond her years that Was just unbelievable. I highly recommend this if you're looking to be inspired or just need a pickmeup when you're down.".

He ends up with brain damage and must now learn how to do simple things all over again. He gets some help from a very charismatic health care worker who helps him walk and talk once again. Henry the name of Harrison Ford's character is a bit hesitant in going home and living with a wife and daughter he has very little recollection in however he does so and they are in for a treat as Henry is now seemingly a more loving and caring person than he was before. Nice story not all drama as there is quite a lot of humor in this one too. I like it when he somehow finds his way into an adult movie theater. He also has troubles adjusting back to his old job where he was a rather ruthless attorney as he keeps finding things that he left out that could have helped the other side. I enjoyed the story and I enjoyed the transformation of old Henry to new Henry. He learns about the old him throughout the movie and he finds he does not really care for who he was either. A nice trip of selfdiscovery.".

The story was intriguing but I couldn't stand the gore and spookiness of the scenes. When I saw the poster of Ichi the Killer I said Forget about it. I put his name under 'mustavoidifIcan' director category.But the poster of Big Bang Love was quite eye catching. The body of a beautiful man covered with tattoo captured my interest strongly enough to visit it at the theater. And it took me totally by surprise. It was powerfully beautiful inexplicably sensual and intellectually provocative.The first scene features three generations of men a boy an old man and a young father whose beautiful body is covered with ethnic pattern tattoo. I assume those tattoo patterns symbolize something about life and universe. This father dances. It's primitive yet sophisticated dance. It's not the type of dance that attracts a mate. It's the dance that brings out something within and throws it out to the world  world of emptiness...After the dance we move to a prison located out of nowhere. But it turns out that this nowhere is everywhere. It's where the past meet the future religion confronts science and hope collides with despair. Rocket and Pyramid are powerful symbols that express all those conflicting ideas. Rocket will lead us to Space which is unknown nothingness while Pyramid will lead us to Heaven which is hopeful solution to human misery. Here Heaven and Hell are not the concepts at the opposite of one spectrum. Life is Hell so Heaven's alternative becomes Space. Otherwise there's no choice in afterlife even though it may be true.Two main characters are also in radical contrast. Ariyoshi and Kazuki are the same and the opposite. Ariyoshi seems fragile and passive but it's just because he wasn't given the chance to act out. We know from the very beginning that he was imprisoned for murder. He murdered a man and murdered his own innocence. He yearns for love but how can he after what he's done and what the world has done to him? Kazuki seems tough and aggressive. He always acts out before a thought enters his mind. But his heart is full of pain and his mind is full of fear. Death is the only comfort for him. He'd rather take a rocket then a pyramid. Heaven is the extension of this gruesome world but Space... we can completely lose ourselves in the space. We're nothing but a tiny fraction of this vast unknownness. That devastating factor is a comfort to many.Miike kept all the gruesome acts off screen. The physical fights were very raw dynamic and beautiful. The sets were also very fascinating. The walk to the jail cell reminded me of the sets of Dogville. The pentagon shaped cell and its pattern on the floor were very impressive. Where Kazuki died is like the ancient podium on which a victim was presented to God. So his death is lead to rebirth but that rebirth defies God and soars to the emptiness of Space. I couldn't quite sleep after movie recapturing some of the images of the movie. I can't wait for DVD so that I can revisit the scenes again and again.".

I found that an intriguing remark as I did nearly nod off during the film which maybe isn't so much a discredit to the film's work as much as my attention span on a late weekday night. But then this is no ordinary prison drama with a slight Rashomon spin  this is the work of someone so in touch with his craft and artistry with his crew that... you almost don't know what's going on half the time! An irony perhaps yet for Miike this is how he usually runs the show and it's not something you can take your eyes easily off from. There is as Miike also points out a tranquility to the picture almost in spite of its truly abhorrent elements of human nature.How can I form a premise to tell you about? Most of the actors didn't even know and apparently were comfortable with this after a short while two inmates Ariyoshi and Kazuki are both brought in to prison on separate murder charges. Ariyoshi is more shy wideeyed a little on the side that makes him out to seem like a 'fresh fish' behind the prison walls while Kazuki won't have any BS as he beats the crap out of anyone who comes near him or makes him do anything. We see these two character brought out in what seems to be very logical means by the actors even when they're not placed in any sort of reality. By the time we see the two characters truly connecting they're out by some pyramid or other in the desert talking about where they'd 'rather be.' This is balanced by the actors both superb in how they look as characters and how they internalize the parts alongside the drama that unfolds where a murder has taken place and an investigation follows of everyone in the prison. But who really did it? Miike doesn't provide any easy answers but then the questions are hard to figure too. This isn't some Shawshank deal but a tale told with mood and lighting color surrealistic moments exposition in a stream of consciousness flow and a sense of the tragic that comes with no way out. As with some of Miike's other films I didn't even mind I couldn't sometimes follow where the story was going or what path it would lean toward in its nonlinear style the first half hour appears to be straightforward but it really wasn't and isn't for much of the rest of the show. But what's most impressive is the use of metaphors and symbols in an intuitive presentation at least in terms of the themes whatever they may be in the wrappings of a beautifully designed and shot and edited film. The colors come off as vibrantly as in Kurosawa with purple and orange hues folding in and then some quintessential horrific imagery i.e. the dead woman curled up like some spider the solace of the butterfly and the harsh yellows and bright overhead yellow lighting of the prison cells. No longer is this simply the cinema verite Miike but someone very comfortable and Godardian in experimentation in a studio environment.While the subject matter isn't easy to take sometimes and the violence is about to par with one expects from the director not even so much showing people beaten though there are or people committing suicide which there are but the impact around it what isn't shown it's still a strong effort. Some will just right out hate it or be too bored to care but for those who give in to its sorrowful corners and impressionist flights of fancy Big Bang Love has the edge of artistic intent amplified like few others in the past several years.".

	schema:headline " A MindBlowing Agent For the Viewer To Perceive On HisHer Terms However Confined To the Film's Implications";
	schema:reviewBody "This voyeuristically expressionistic film is set in an unknown future in which Ryuhei Matsuda plays a soft sad gay bartender imprisoned for his strange and brutal killing of a customer who attacked him and Masanobu Ando is a Yakuza thug packed to the top with pentup anger and violence that makes him tight as a drum till he sporadically bursts. The two arrive in a juvenile detention center on the same day and with nothing in common they become tangled by yearning shared visualizations of flight to an imagined world and a murder of another boy inside the stockade that results in one dead and the other pleading guilty to the carnage. It's a murder mystery of young incarcerated men in lust seen through surreal composition on sets of darkness and illumination and the simplest trace of detail.Two detectives try to expose the indictment. Why did this trigger it? One of them questions as to why the inmate would lead this course of selfruin and devastation seeing a rainbow. Only he himself knows. In the humankind that judges people under the duplicitous laws prearranged as a result of a perversely archaic edition of religious principles Miike bares violence in its most honest form as an instinctive undertaking. It cannot be made clear further than the surface of palpable means of interaction. It's too mysterious and puzzling for anyone beyond of the person perpetrating the action to entirely grasp. Sexual friction and shorttempered violence propel the story to its mindblowing outcome.Takashi Miike puts his heart and soul into his fascinating visual actualization of the morally ambiguous story which is heavily reminiscent of Jean Genet novels like Our Lady of the Flowers. It is avantgarde theater translated onto film voiceover and screened words as the literal point of view of the investigators. The film is punctuated by wonderful infectious closing music and you realize you have just experienced filmmaking in a unique manner a conspicuous trance consisting of definite colors alive in the bounds of a vast universe of an unlit void. Thick with striking images like pyramids a classic scifi rocket ship and an opening dance sequence coming unexpectedly. That's just the tip of the iceberg to all of the creative dexterity Miike affords the viewer.One may come from this film thinking that it wasn't about the story. That's an understandable way to put it put it is not quite correct. Really in order to be a narrative at all it can only be about the story but Miike does not betray the sheer weight of the story's content and ideas. Can there have been a simpler depiction of it? The film essentially is about existence. It is a concept spanning 4.6 billion years! Miike who normally makes cynical if not outright selfdeprecating microcosmic yakuza and horror movies has aggregating all of those impressions into a claustrophobic liferefracting prism of all the world's details and creates a blemish on the face of the world of cinema that audaciously patiently calculatedly tackles humankind and the selfworth behind which it hides selfworth largely created by the belief in God which this film could be read as implicating doesn't exist. The movie's likely metaphors for evolution and faith have very telling differences in outcome as the movie's symbolic image of evolution augments and that of religious conviction remains the way it has since the beginning. The movie is only an agent for the viewer to perceive on their terms however confined to the film's implications. Miike is correct This is his masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beautiful and haunting arthouse with a veneer of a prison movie that is the best description of a movie that is so invested in its self referential imagery that the viewer is either swept away into it or completely alienated. The sets are often minimal echoing some modern theater and also giving an extra emphasis to the characters as such. Golden light pervades the dreamy scenery of cramped cells geometrically shaped insides and an odd pyramid and an equally surprising space rocket that can be seen from the roof of the prison.At the surface the movie is a crime investigation in which two policemen try to unravel the events behind the murder of an inmate since the confession of the presumed killer does not seem to match reality. But that is an excuse for a lavishly artistic movie to structure itself around a plot that gives coherence to the surreal approach so that overall it does not veer into fantasy. Which is not to say that this is a linear movie because it most definitely is not. Flashbacks mingle with fantasy and the feeling of displaced narrative is inherent to the nihilism of the content.Ryuhei Matsuda's performance adds much to the not quite overt sensuality of it all. Emotions are stifled dialogues are left open ended interpretations are left hanging in the air and ultimately unanswered. And that seems to be the heart of this movie solving the crime does not advance a psychological answer to the problem of human interaction or lack thereof. Kazuki is something of a social outcast and Arioshi's obsession with him the only bridge to any kind of human contact. The sexual tension adds another level to the already pressing claustrophobia.In the end not even the revisitation of some lines of dialogue that provide a context is able of truly answering anything. The viewer is left to make some sense of what happened and to fill in the gaps an attempt that may very well be absolutely impossible. After all the movie is fragmented in essence deliberately so. A telling scene is when a shaft of sunlight pierces through Arioshi as an arrow and blood seeps out. Like the movie it is somewhat factual and yet full of meanings that need be projected unto it a literal metaphor.".

While there is some beautiful imagery in the movie particularly the energetic male dance in the opening reel the film is too disjointed and frustrating in its obvious attempts to be artistic.If it is understood that great film directors often bear their soul in their work and this is very true of Takashi Miike it must be said that his treatment of woman as opposed to his adulation of the male suggests possible homosexual obsession. In Bing Bang Love Juvenile A homosexuality is explored and the beauty of the male juvenile physique is lovingly shot yet the only female character is a frightening contorted monster shot in black and white with distorted focus that literally drags her vagina across the floor.A casual admirer of Takashi's films must admit that women are often the helpless victims of male brutality and while the men often suffer male on male torture and death the more vile circumstances are reserved for the women such as drowning in feces sex with animals violent rape and extreme beatings. Takashi's most detailed female character from his classic dishonAudition 1999 is a brutalised and psychotic character yet for the male she is also frightening and at the same time erotic as shown by the sadomasochisticdomanatix wardrobe. What is clear is that Takashi has a deep fear possibly a revulsion for women as Bing Bang Love Juvenile A also clearly demonstrates.Takashi cannot hide his enormous talent even when directing trash or kiddy nonsense. He is a pure filmmaker and arguably one of the greatest directors alive today but I sometimes wish he would take more time between movies or be more selective about choosing his material. Big Bang Love is far from a cinematic masterpiece because it is a conscious art movie that says more about the director than any of the characters shown on the screen.".

I also have way too personal an attachment to pay any heed to other comments or input which I normally enjoy when reading about movies. This is Takashi Miike's selfprofessed masterpiece a statement I wholeheartedly agree with.As I am still a novice to Japanese culture I have to give my impressions with Western references The lighting is Caravaggio and the colours are Rembrandt. Jun's character could easily have jumped out of Camus or Rimbaud while Shiro is absolute Bataille at his most abstract yet violent and carnal. The punctuations of reallife inserted amid the prison scenes are more jarring than any of Miike's more overt attempts to discomfit his viewers in previous films through violence sex or both. The outside world looks like an unwelcome schism in the timeless almost monochromatic prison. Via the character of Shiro the film brutally dispatches all Euclidean and Cartesian occupation of time space and psychology  but crucially does not seek to put anything in its place something that Jun attempts and fails to do repeatedly. All that's left when Shiro has conquered his final opponent himself is the love between the two main inmates.I can see why anyone with the word 'pretentious' as a regular feature in their vocabulary would blank out this film. Probably just as well in my opinion.Favourite bit when Jun and Shiro first see each other in the prison 'waiting room' and Shiro is revealed in extreme outoffocus as a kana form.I've never had a 'favourite film' before in my life and now I do.

Miike has already shown his versatility and has quite a cult following so this movie pretty much sells itself without need to look at the back and figure out what it's about.And that's a good thing in this case because it's gorgeous. Miike has basically gone back to the era of German Expressionism and turned it into a Phantasmagoria of color and setdesign. Reality is thrown out the window in favor of a poetic narrative on 65 billion year love or what happens when two gay lovers in a juvenile detention center want to choose their own escapedo they take the rocket scientific escape into space or climb the temple religious escape into heaven?Of course I'm way oversimplifying things here. For the most part the philosophy isn't very profound but I stress the poetics of it. The film's pastiche and the film's movement is what matters more than the dialog and the action. A moment where a ray of sun pierces through a human body a scene where inmates lean up against nonexistent walls with little of the pretentiousness of Dogville by the way have powerful emotional effects.So Miike's masterpiece? Well I do think he has a lot to live up to considering the uncanny ending of Ichi the Killer. However this is certainly a very effective film and one that stands out as entirely unique in his oeuvre. For more stuff like this look more for Happiness of the Katakuris than Family 2.PolarisDiB".

But if what you wanted to see is a contemplative movie about homoerotic love and violence then this is what you've been waiting for.The movie is set in a prison with the atmosphere of a Buddhist temple. Light shadow heat and flesh are at every corner. The film is quite enigmatic but even if you don't understand the story is busy enough to keep your attention.I think that the film tries to convey some Buddhist reflexions about life. The prison is perhaps a symbolism for the false appearances of the world and the pyramid and spaceship a symbol of enlightenment or escape from the world. There is also a questioning about causality. Kazuka's death blurs the line between murder and suicide. Who's will was it that caused his death? One might be tempted to say his own but then the movie says that it was the rainbow. Isn't this an example of interdependent origination? To take a phrase from the Wikipedia definition This is the understanding that any phenomenon 'exists' only because of the 'existence' of other phenomena in an incredibly complex web of cause and effect covering time past time present and time future. This might also explain the movie's japanese title A love of 4.6 billion years which corresponds to the age of the earth. Anyway perhaps other commenters will make better sense out of this but it is undeniable that this is a contemplative movie that might make you think if you're willing to.As for negatives the movie is short and somewhat unfocused.".

Had the box not mentioned homoeroticism the sexuality of the characters would be impossible to tell for a good deal of the movie.That being said this is really more of a murder mystery whose end is kinda predictable early on.However Miike has grown somewhat as a director largely the film takes place on empty stage like sets with only one or two objects in place like a piece of absurdist theater. There's even an opening interpretive dance sequence which though beautiful ranks up there with Miikes greatest WTF moments. Though some scenes resemble Dogville in their sparseness there's also subtle use of special effects here a small animated image of a man trying to escape and being burnt to a crisp a computer generated impossibly colored sky and the reoccurring images of the space ship and the ancient temple the paths within and without. All of the bargain basement effects which Miike has utilized in the past are integrated well here from out of nowhere fight scenes to awkward muted comedic moments of intimacy. So while the story alternates between aggression and tenderness somewhat awkwardly the visual aesthetics of the movie fill the screen and the eye with both space and discreet details otherwise this probably be a two star affair ratings wise. If you like Takashi Miike movies at their most experimental Gozu Izo etc this is essential viewing or if you happen to be interested in abstract philosophical prison love scifi murder mysteries....and who isn't?".

	schema:reviewBody "Takashi Miike the director has said that Big Bang Love Juvenile A or 4.6 Billion Years of Love is best viewed when in a state of absentmindedness and that is just as easily absorbed and taken in if you happen to be nodding off during its running time. And he may just be right. I have now watched this film three times and fell asleep halfway through on the last two. And I typically try not to do that. This is not because the film is boring but rather due to the lyrical and dreamlike quality the film possesses. It has the ability to lull and carry the viewer away into a meditative trance. So I'm going to go on record right now and say how hard it is difficult to write a review of the amazing film that Miike has crafted.For those who have never heard of Takashi Miike or the creative compelling and controversial features that he produces at an astonishing rate up to 15 a year this may not be the best place to start. Big Bang stands out in Miike's canon oeuvre as one of his most experimental and eloquent and that's saying something. This is a unique film. Most of us will have never seen anything like it. I have a feeling that it is not for everyone. Some will find it utterly incomprehensible others will find it astonishingly beautiful and still some will simply not know what to make of it.The plot what little there is focuses on the budding relationship of two male inmates in a prison in the middle of a vast empty nowhere. Both men are murderers who though complete opposites form a bond of love that transcends the physical realm the sexual realm and even the realm of time. Which sounds totally pretentious but trust me it's not. It's emotionally honest. And did I mention how gorgeous this thing is to look at? It somehow creates the impression of drawings being put into words. It's not driven by narrative it is more a montage of images in steady succession to form an ethereal atmosphere. Something important always seems about to happen but on its own unexpected terms. Miike in the brilliant and flashy but not the kind of flashy that distracts from the meaning of the movie but enhances it brushstrokes of a true auteur attempts to paint the landscape of the human heart with strikingly vivid colours.So while I haven't really explained anything or gotten my true feelings about Big Bang Love Juvenile A or 4.6 Billion Years of Love across you now know about this film and it's director and maybe you'll see love and treasure this film or one of Miike's other greats such as Audition The Bird People of China Visitor Q Dead or Alive Izo or the much vaunted Ichi the Killer.

	schema:reviewBody "Like TVseries Cuntame cmo pas Eres mi hroe is set in the 1970's and tells the story from the point of view of a childteenager. For those who ask for a minimum of realism the good news is that all similarities between Cuntame and Eres mi hroe end up just here.Not that Cuntame is a bad series I actually like it but one should watch it knowing that it is a bucolic retelling of those extremely important years in Spanish history. On the other hand Eres mi hroe gives a more realistic and edgier account of both childhoodteenage life and the Spanish transition. Therefore everyday comingofage problems get mixed with political problems surrounding the protagonist and the eventual result is an entertaining yet acceptably rigorous account of those convulse years.Manuel Lozano the child from La lengua de las mariposas has grown up to be a nice teenage actor who gracefully plays Ramn the main character. Supporting turns from Maru Valdivielso Juan Fernndez and surprisingly Toni Cant are very welcome but the real standout is the discovery of young actor Flix Lpez who plays Ramn's pal David. It's not that often that one sees two believable juvenile performances in the same film and Lozano and Lpez also show great chemistry in their scenes together.The only part I didn't buy was Antonio Dechent's ridiculous part as an Indian Chief a character that adds absolutely nothing to the plot and really takes the focus from more interesting subplots. I understand this is a device the writers use to portray the boy's comingofage process but I really could have lived without it. I would rather have seen more scenes involving priest Toni Cant or the boy's family. Anyway the movie is interesting enough and quite entertaining too. Overall rating 810".

	schema:headline " 13 years old boy and the strong wind of changes.";
	schema:reviewBody "Theme of adolescence and coming of age in difficult times is well known in world cinema and from first look it seems that You're my hero adds nothing new to old formula. However with first shots and scenes of the movie it's easy to realize that you get much more than you bargained for.Incredibly bright and sincere story of a boy on verge of adolescence never leave you indifferent his discoveries and joys disappointments and grief give you chance to endure with our hero all his emotions and struggles. The audience easily becomes a part of the story of Ramon and a part of his little triumphs and tragedies. Sometimes sweet sometimes bitter storytelling never lets you down and immensely attracts you but at the same time the world around the characters is changing. Spain struggles for freedom and democracy and echo of events in the country eventually reaches the boys.It is mid 70s and the last days of oppressive regime Franco. More and more people went to streets demanding changes and all that they were deprived during long years. But for 13 years old Ramon it's time for moving to new place and new school and he already know that it always promises nothing good for him. Sunny Seville becomes a new episode of his life and another test for three main rules which helped him to survive in all years of traveling from one place to another. Every school and every street had its bullies and a new kid was always bound to be their first victim.The first rule don't fight  it just making everything worse and they will beat you up the second rule  don't snitch  they will never forgive you and the third rule  don't cry  that is all what they always want from you. The battle for survival has begun from the first day in new school and playful question of principal about Ramon's favorite football team. After some attacks from classmates the first rule is broken and everything changes but surprisingly help came from outside.Franco dies and it leads to no punishment and an unexpected vacation brings new possibilities for Ramon to look at the world around him with new eyes. What is more unexpected that after his attempt of standing for himself former bullies begin to talk to him and even gradually accept him into their close company. No more trying to be invisible and new friends give a chance for awakening of new feelings and emotions. After watching smuggled Playboys and rather dirty jokes soon come first kisses and first love while the country is also changing. For many years everything about political and sexual freedoms was suppressed by civil and religious authorities and it is time to challenge them. People come to fight for their rights and at the same time new words are coming into world of boys already filled with emotions feelings and tensions freedom and fascism free election civil rights and amnesty.It is so much important that rising of the country and those who care for its future is not just a background for the main story of Ramon and his mates. Director Ramon Cuadri and the actors so skillfully and authentically transmitted that atmosphere of social struggling that the country itself and all those people become important characters in the movie. As you always feel strong sympathy for poignant and sincere Manuel Lozano as Ramon you are also starting to care about people fighting for what is right or for school teacher who is challenging the whole system. Such a strong emotional uplifting for the audience is in my opinion one of the greatest possible achievement for filmmakers and the actors. Bright young Spanish talent Manuel Lozano is absolutely terrific here he successfully conveys to us all strong emotions and feelings of main character without any sighs of uncertainty or overacting. His incredible and mature performance marks him as one of the most talented young actors nowadays and I definitely would like to see more movies with him. Although standout Manuel Lozano is mostly stealing the show the other main characters also have their moments of glory particularly the leader of the boys David also an excellent performance of young Felix Lopes and school teacher Mateo Toni Canto. Both of them did incredibly well in some quite important and poignant scenes. It is worth to mention also that despite very harsh language the movie is absolutely suitable for young viewers in many ways it is even intended for teen audience probably accompanied by adults. It doesn't look crude or repulsive it's just intimate and poignant in tradition of famous Stand by Me and other masterpieces about childhood and adolescence experience. Well written and rather appropriate soundtrack with a couple of songs is a good addition to strong visual part.Here the first steps to adult life mean not only awakening of new strong feelings and losing of childhood innocence. It also brings rediscovery of political freedom and its meaning and sort of soft sexual revolution in society. Adulthood brings new discoveries and disappointments triumphs and letdowns but these bitter and sweet memories of adolescence stay with you forever. You're my hero Eres mi heroe is a very strong and poignant story of adolescence in time of changes and definitely one of the best movies I've seen in last months. It's not perfect and perhaps if you make this as a goal you could find some minor drawbacks but I simply couldn't resist because my emotions during the movie were so immensely strong. When the credits were rolling all that I could do was to cheer and applaud. Congratulations to anyone involved and highly recommended.".

In fairness to them I suspect that their complaints may be valid based on trailers and marketing suggesting this would be the case  the exclamation point in the title probably didn't help either. So I'm glad then that I came to the film without a great deal of knowledge about what the film was trying to be other than it was a slightly comic version of a true case from the 1990's.I am glad because this is what the film is  a comic take on a real situation where the decision to do so as a light comedy appears to have paid off. With Mark Whitacre as the main character we follow him into the case and we immediately start to get the impression that this guy really doesn't have his head in the real world  like he doesn't understand the consequences of anything he says and does which perhaps accounts for his rather cheerful outlook and easy personality. This is true but the full extent of his actions are unveiled nicely across the whole film  leaving me at times a little like the FBI lawyer during the presentation from ADM's attorney mouth open not quite believing it.It is not a hilarious movie by any means but the comic air makes it easy to enjoy and the story is engaging and entertaining. Soderbergh does slightly overdo the wacky feel to and he probably didn't need to have as many recognisable faces from comedy in small roles but he does make it work. A big part of this reason is Matt Damon  showing that while he may be a Hollywood action star now he is very capable as a character actor to. He does channel William H Macy from Fargo a little bit in how he will try and make pathetic lies to get himself out of trouble but I see this as a compliment because Macy is very good at that sort of character performance. Damon nails the cheerful selfdelusion and his narration keeps us on side with him making the comic tone work. The support cast is perhaps a bit too full of wellknown faces but everyone is good working again with the approach.Overall The Informant! appears to be disliked mainly by those who expected something that marketing led them to believe this was. Coming to it on its own terms however this is an engaging story told with a comic air that works and makes the film as entertaining as it is interesting. Not hilarious and one could question if it is fair to handle Whitacre's story in a light manner but it does work and I enjoyed it for what it was.".

And it made a really nasty story somewhat funny because we know within the first half hour or so that there is something hinky about this Whitacre character. Oh boy is there but I won't write a spoiler here. There's no reason to. Even in the book the FBI guys were wondering about Whitacre. Why did he turn traitor to his own company? What did he have to gain? The film is extremely well done an amazingly good adaptation of a book which would probably have you snoozing after fifteen minutes. Matt Damon really shows his stuff in this one even developing a modest middle age belly to complete the image of the nerdy scientist.

Terrific pace involving and surprising. That's more I can say about most movies but The Informant with or without the exclamation mark left me kind of cold. I was far too aware of the intention. Matt Damon is a good actor but his acting is still too much of that acting. I couldn't forget it was him not for a moment. No matter how much extra pounds he had put on the terrible hair do the suits etc. It all felt like the dress rehearsal for something that wasn't quite there yet. I longed for Alec Guinness in that part. Visibly invisible. The story is so outrageous with bumbling sentimental FBI agents that couldn't see through this man until it was too late is a pill hard to swallow and yet we're told the whole thing it's true. I suppose that the Marvin Hamlisch score was enough of a clue as to how to detect and read the tone of the movie but I was confused by it. I also must say I was never bored so I guess that's a recommendation of sorts.".

	schema:headline " Soderbergh's new film brings to life an almost unbelievably true story";
	schema:reviewBody "At its core The Informant! is by no means an inherently funny story. It involves international corporate conspiracies corruption deception and betrayal. Yet somehow Steven Soderbergh manages to turn Kurt Eichenwald's book which depicts the true story of former ADM employee Mark Whitacre in the manner of John Grisham's best legal thrillers into a thoroughly entertaining often very funny movie. This of course is aided by Matt Damon's brilliant spoton portrayal of the corporate executiveturnedFBI informant as well as solid work by the supporting cast.When I first read Eichenwald's book after learning about this movie I was slightly skeptical. Economics and law are far from my forte. However what I found was a story so ridiculous and told in such a compelling way that it was difficult to put the book down. Especially for a nonfiction story the characters felt so welldeveloped and so threedimensional that you cannot help but care immensely about them despite their flaws. And then I heard that Soderbergh planned to make the movie version into a dark comedy. Given some of the subject matter and material involved I was worried that the film would turn into too much of a farce and would not give the reallife story and people the proper respect.To my utter relief I was wrong. While some of the darker elements have been left out and the film is undoubtedly lighter than its source material Soderbergh stayed true to reality keeping the events mostly accurate to what Eichenwald described in his book and hence to what really happened in fact on a side note after seeing the movie the reallife Mark Whitacre commented that the film was very accurate which is a bit of a surprise considering Soderbergh made the decision to not consult any of the people involved in the actual 1990s investigation.Oddly enough while this probably sounds contradictory to the opening statement of my review much of the humor actually springs out of the events and dialogue depicted in the book almost all of which took place in reality rather than jokes or quips written by the screenwriter or improvised by the director or actors. There are so many hidden layers to the tale that in retrospect it is hard to not laugh or at least gap in wonder at how it all unfolded. Of course that is not to say that Scott Z. Burns who adapted Einchenwald's book for the screen did not do any work. The screenplay does an admirable job of adhering to the true events with enough creativity wit and originality to prevent the film from seeming like just a retread of everything Einchenwald accomplished in his narrative.Also impressive is the cast. Naturally as Mark Whitacre Matt Damon stands out. Even though he had not met the person he was portraying before filming he perfectly captures Whitacre's personality mannerisms and attitude making him seem largerthanlife but at the same time completely and utterly human while many other actors might have made him too much of a caricature. The supporting cast does a fine job as well and perhaps the most noteworthy of these actors are Scott Bakula as the benignly professional FBI agent Brian Shepard and Melanie Lynskey who portrays Whitacre's devoted wife Ginger with a sort of Midwestern bubbliness.In typical Steven Soderbergh mode the director adds a quirky unique tone to the movie. Although the whimsical almost cartoonish score is sometimes a bit intrusive this quaint style effectively mirrors the film's subtle and often ironic humor and instead of being distracting the cinematography complete with the intense lighting and vibrant colors that make Soderbergh's films so distinctly his helps emphasize the movie's offbeat wackiness. From the opening credits viewers are immersed in the simple charming vibe of smalltown Illinois this ambiance is benefited by the fact that Soderbergh chose to film in Decatur the very town in which the reallife events occurred. Everything feels authentic from the hairstyles to the ADM office and even the colorful array of ties sported by various cast members throughout the movie.Furthermore by using voiceover narration Soderbergh effectively manages to enter the mind of Mark Whitacre who is to say the least an extremely fascinating personality. Partly thanks to Matt Damon's nuanced performance the audience learns to sympathize with  if not root for  Mark regardless of his moral ambiguity and questionable decisions. Perhaps more than anything else this is because the movie never makes fun of him only at his nearly unbelievable situation. Not once is he made out to be a completely villainous guy or a complete hero he is merely human.".

Which might make it less appealing to a large audience but it wasn't aimed to crack the box office. Soderbergh captures a weird feeling in this movie that leaves you with a weird taste at the end. Of course you could argue that the movie shows too little of Damons wife maybe even too little of his employer. But as it is it's a pretty solid and greatly edited work.Even the voice over which seems and is completely out of place works really good in this movie. I guess even the Team America members would change their opinion of Matt Damon after watching this one. Give it a try but don't expect laugh out loud comedy not the ordinary kind that is.".

	schema:headline " The Informant a satire that might put you to sleep";
	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever wanted to see a comedy about price fixing and corporate embezzlement? If so The Informant might be just the film you're looking for. For some however The Informant might prove to be a crushing bore. I'm somewhere in between but I'll get to that later.The Informant tells the real life story of Mark Whitacre the highest ranked executive to ever turn whistleblower in U.S. history. It's based on the book of the same name published in 2000 by journalist Kurt Eichenwald. This is one of those instances where truth is indeed stranger than fiction. A lot stranger. How does one make sense of a guy who worked his way up the ladder of success at Archer Daniels Midland in Decatur Illinois makes up a story about a Japanese saboteur working at the company hooks up with the FBI to blow the whistle on price fixing that he and others had been involved in all around the world defrauds nearly 10 million from ADM in the years that he was working undercover for the FBI hopes to become CEO of ADM once the case is over with makes up stories about physical abuse against the FBI agent he was working for and then winds up spending more years in jail than the corporate criminals he helped to nab? The film does offer at least one explanation for Whitacre's strange behavior bipolar disorder. I'm not sure if that's enough.Mark Whitacre is portrayed by Matt Damon in another one of those roles that he seemed born to play. He's Hollywood's goto actor for stories about men on the run from the law spies heists or corporate swindling. It's a strange performance in a film filled with odd creative decisions. For example the film contains an ongoing voiceover narration from Matt Damon as Whitacre that is just one stupid non sequitur after another. The narration has nothing to do with anything and only serves to highlight Whitacre's odd behavior. One particular piece of narration as I recall involves Whitacre discussing how he used to mispronounce the word centimeters. The humor in these monologues is very random to say the least. Either you go for this sort of humor or you don't. I didn't but I must admit that many people in the theater that I saw it in were laughing. I got the sense that many of them would probably laugh at anything.Another thing that bothered me about the film is the quirky and eccentric score. The Informant contains one of the most bizarre musical scores I've heard in recent cinema. The composer seemed to spare no expense to remind the audience that we were indeed watching a comedy. Violins whistles and horns are used throughout to the point where I was reminded of a T.V. variety show where the orchestra would provide the necessary comedic cues. Does it work in this film? I don't think so. In fact I was so distracted by it to the point where I was taken out of the film completely. I had to fight to keep my interest in what was going on up on the screen. This underscores my general problem with The Informant. It seemed to be trying too hard to be clever quirky and funny. Whenever the odd voiceover narration showed up or the music reared its head it's as if the filmmakers were putting up a big sign that said look at how funny this is! Satire must be handled right and this film's problem is with its tone. I was constantly taken out of the film instead of being engaged by it.There's still a lot to recommend about The Informant however. The performances are mostly good although Joel McHale seems oddly miscast in the role of an FBI agent the story has some surprising twists and turns and I did find myself laughing a bit towards the end at Whitacre's odd behavior. It's competently directed by Steven Soderbergh Traffic Ocean's Eleven who is no stranger to these kinds of stories. But most of the film takes place in corporate boardrooms and hotels and the screenplay is very talky. And because it's based on a true story its dramatic potential is limited. I think this is the kind of story I would rather read a book about instead of seeing a movie on it. I don't think The Informant ultimately succeeds either at what it set out to do get inside the head of Mark Whitacre. Who was this man really and why did he do the things he did? I never really got a satisfactory answer and the film's quirky demeanor kept me at an emotional distance.".

It is very difficult for me to believe that someone as intelligent and shrewd as Whitacre could actually be so well goofy. But it does add an entertainment element to the film.

Whitacre maintained a degree of honesty and integrity to his work but when he uncovered evidence of price fixing with rival foreign companies he turned undercover informant for the FBI...but as events rolled on it would appear he may have known a bit more about what was going on himself than he was letting on.Playing like a lighter version of 1999's The Insider Steven Soderbergh's dramatization of corporate corruption in the early 90s is amusingly on edge throughout with Damon's constant muted voiceovers gently guiding us along this tale of principles and ethics clashing with corporate greed and deception. Damon is affable enough in the lead role certainly hard to think of any actor who could have done it better and the story is pretty relevant and dynamic. There's nothing about it that really makes it unforgettable or brilliant but it's certainly worth a bit of your time. ".

Even in his most mainstream projects he is exploring some new skill. Here it is the notion of narration.I'll have to see this a second time with a DVD stop button to be able to fully catalog all the various modes that our filmmaker skips seamlessly through. The main device he weaves these modes around is the spine of the untrusted narrator. We have all sorts of layers and nodes of deception with the only ones we can really trust being the guys usually are the bottom of the garbage bin the massive greedy company. We have this fellow being dishonest to everyone including himself. We have no idea where the line is that he actually believes and we hear only from him. Some of the internal dialog is hypnotizing we are lulled into accepting it because so much of it is appealingly funny. It is a great trick of misdirection allowing us to associate with this slippery reality. Folded into this is are the watchers nominally the FBI then various lawyers and the wife but us of course punctuated by a video at the end directly to us with the FBI behind a mirror. A second surprise awaited me beyond the Soderbergh stretching. Matt Damon finally does something impressive. He is truly something worth watching here. I never would have guessed. I never would have believed. In fact this wouldn't have worked at all this suspended belief within the story if he had not so believably become the character.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Probably. How much money did Mark really manage to embezzle? Who knows. One thing I do know is the audience at our local Surpise Sneak Preview wasn't overly impressed and neither was I.

Embezzlement and fraud are serious crimes but when a person committing such serious crimes becomes a star witness for a fullblown government investigation targeting a major international corporation then this cast a huge dark shadow over the credibility of criminal investigation itself. This movie is also about to what lengths government officials are willing to believe such unsavory informants even as these informants continue to flagrantly break numerous laws. Matt Damon gives an excellent performance as the main character Mark Whitacre a man who on his own initiative feeds the government information while he continues to embezzle huge sums of money. The movie shows how the government almost becomes complicit in Whitacre's's criminal behavior and how it causes an incredible and irreparable amount of damage. Does being an informant absolve one of guilt for crimes committed? Watch the movie and find out.".

Whitacre who clearly exhibits a couple of acronym disorders seems trustworthy and noble to take on the role of the whistle blower. But he begins to get caught up in lies and half truths and what seems evident after he flunks a polygraph test takes the FBI nearly a decade  the chronology revealed by Pepto Bismol pink titles done in a Dating Game font to uncover. The Informant is so drab and crass in story line and presentation it leads one to believe that Hollywood heavy hitter Soderbergh's intent is to make a statement about corporate corruption in The Heartland. Not only are they guilty of hypocrisy and greed but also bereft of style and personality. The characters led by Matt Damon's sleepwalking are passionless and of little depth. Much of the time they stand around with blank expressions waiting out the tedious scene stretching that helps drain the film of suspense. The lifeless cinematography is poorly lit an filled with sloppy composition. It's a long way from Vegas and Ocean and void of all the slickness exposes the limited reach of Soderbergh's abilities. In the hands of more accomplished and talented filmmakers such as the Coen brothers see Fargo or Alex Payne see Citizen Ruth the Informant's possibilities as a satiric comic suspense more than likely would have soared. But with Soderbergh at the helm this limp and lifeless story never gets beyond tepid.".

Veteran and now well rounded actor Matt Damon teams back up with Steven as Damon stars as the central character and somewhat antihero Mark Whitacre who as a biochemist for a processing giant ADMArcher Daniels Midlandexposes the greed and dirty corruption as he blows the whistle on the company's alleged global price fixing methods.Set in Illinois taking place from the early 90's till the story wraps up in 2006 you see that from the get go that Mark Whitacre is well rounded a married family man hard working successful yet a mind wandering oddball who's intelligent and he has plans to expose the top company brass. So he gets in touch with the FBI and goes undercover as he's wired for sounds and even tapes meetings for the feds. It was nice to see TV veteran Scott Bakula as the head agent in charge of the case. Anyway this even though a spy film Soderbergh blends the drama and suspense with slapstick humor and funny lines all of which feed off of Damon's crazy character. As some watch they may even classify his undercover work as somewhat cartoon like along the lines of say the agent from Get Smart. Still you as the viewer even with the humor and joke intersection are intrigued by observations of searching for the truth.And you as the viewer want answers especially when it involves exposing corporate crime the truth takes a spin yet really it wasn't that surprising considering the mind and wandering thoughts of Matt Damon's character. Even though Mark has committed wrong doing you cheer for him as he fights the big top dog corporate brass. Overall The Informant! is a well done film with a top notch performance from Matt Damon who's now a sharp polished actor I cheer for the film's telling of the real life tale of corporate fraud and corruption which relates to the times so well with banking wall street and company scandal. Still with Hollywood the films are always blended different which with this vehicle Soderbergh went a little bit to much with the humor and comedy. Still it proves that just when you think you know the truth other lies are exposed and scandals are plenty yet need to be revealed.".

Well at least the visuals were OK. But it wasn't funny other than one scene where Matt Damon fixes his toupee or cute. I found the movie rambling incoherent and just a major disappointment...basically a bore. The acting was fine but the characters were not the least bit sympathetic or engaging. You didn't really care what happened to Damon's character. The only reason we stuck around to watch the end was we kept hoping something big would happen. It didn't. The movie flat lined early and just doesn't recover. I certainly hope the end product isn't what the creative team were going after.On the other hand the visuals were fun to watch. I also liked the kitschy old style music and the old style titles.I understand Matt Damon wants to stretch himself and not just keep doing Jason Bourne characters but he has to do better than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "The beauty of the film is Matt Damon without question. Starring in so many actiondramas of late it's great to see him going the comedy route. The guy was in Kevin Smith films and hammed it up in the Ocean's movies as well but here he has center stage to show the kind of chops he has in the genre. With hair resembling a bad toupee and a pedophilic moustache his Whitacre is mid90s businessman elite only with a conscience  sort of. A lover of crime films and courtroom dramas he begins to live his life as though he is in one himself. When describing what is going on to the FBI at one point he breaks out with the line It's like Rising Sun the Crichton novel or during a voiceover he begins to compare everything to The Firm. He sees that his company a corn producer and therefore having its hands in pretty much every consumer product on the market is criminally involved with competitors to fix prices and steal from their respective publics. Wanting to be the hero and save the dayhopefully with an endgame of being the only person left and in effect handed the companyhe decides to fabricate a story to get the FBI in his sights and then pounces taking part in a two year sting operation to bring Archer Daniels Midland down.Soderbergh was live and in person at the TIFF screening I attended and after being introduced as having been there twenty years previous with his debut feature said There's no sex no videotapes but enough lies to last another twenty years. And boy was he right. As the movie progresses you not only become aware of the lies being told in the company but also the information Whitacre himself is withholding from the FBI then from his lawyers and inevitably from everyone. By the end you can't help but wonder what exactly was the truththe whole thing is just one big lie. I would love to know what the real Whitacre thinks about this representation. Does he enjoy the exaggerated caricature? Does he hate it because the imbecilic nature at the core of Damon's role hits too close to home? The activities portrayed are so off the wall and zany that I have to believe screenwriter Scott Z. Burns and Soderbergh just used the outline of fact and made it completely their own. My only complaint would be that it goes maybe ten to twenty minutes too long finding a repetition that soon becomes obvious and lacking of the witty charm of the start.With a cast of familiar faces and even some comic greatsThe Smothers Brothersit is still Damon that shines above all. His delivery is priceless and his facial expressions genuinely childlike in their enthusiasm. The entire film has him playing this game unaware of how deep he was getting in and unaware that his extracurricular activities to be exposed towards the end made him a hypocrite. As long as he is the center of attention being the man in the white hat taking down the bad guys with his FBI cohorts in tow nothing else matters. Speaking of the agents how great is it seeing Scott Bakula sinking his teeth into a lengthy role again? His straightman to Damon's goof could not be played more perfectly. And then you get Joel McHale of The Soup fame to play the most serious government agent in the world? It's just Soderbergh having fun with preconceptions actually casting many comics in serious roles while Jason Bourne himself schlubs around with a permanent cheesy smile plastered on his face.What transpires is funny enough if just due to the fact a huge criminal investigation is occurring with a moron at its center risking exposure every second. So excited that he is starring in his own version of all the sitcom television and pulp Hollywood movies he enjoys the wonderment of having his own tape recorder hidden in his briefcase necessitates him to show someone how cool it is. He is 0014 after all twice as smart as 007. But what works even better than the actual story is his mind itself. The epitome of Attention Deficit Disorder Mark Whitacre loses his train of thought on a regular basis. At first you think you may be missing something as a character responds to a question and Damon's voiceover drowns it out. While important information is being relayed all we hear are the ramblings of a crazy man the most mundane things popping into his head as he smiles and nods. Some of these oneliners are so great you almost watch what's happening to get to the next tangent his brain wanders off towards.So whether or not the film itself is an accurate portrayal of the subject matter it's based on is a moot point. The real subject becomes finding out what will happen to Whitacre when the dust settles. Nave to the core we all know he is due a wakeup call at some point even if his FBI handlers think he is the bravest man in America doing it all because he has a wife and kids and a sense of moral responsibility. If only they knew he just did it for the rush of excitement and because he couldn't think past step number one. Why comprehend that unearthing all the wheelings and dealings of a company he held a high position with could cost him his career when you can just enjoy the present and have fun living a duplicitous life? Do not feel sorry for him and do not question his motiveshe really doesn't have any. Just take a seat and be ready to laugh hard.".

	schema:headline " awfully badly horrible";
	schema:reviewBody "While it wasn't a horrible movie there was no flow to it whatsoever and the ramblings of Matt Damon's character between scenes was such a distraction from what was a complicated movie to follow as it was. This movie bounced around from topic to topic and having this mumbojumbo in the middle just threw me off beyond believe.A good crime movie keeps the viewer in suspense and makes them want to watch it to the end to find out who dun it. The Informant is not one of these movies. The overall tone of the movie is supposed to be like a knuckleheaded Oceans 11 type movie. The problem is the cast isn't strong enough to support such a film.The theme of this movie is hard to detect. It seems as though it's a morality piece as the central character is trying to blow the whistle on a company that is not playing fair. However we learn as the movie progresses that this is not the case. The whistle blower changes his mind more than a child deciding on nuggets or a hamburger at McDonald's.You can't really call it a crime movie as there is never really any crime show. It's all implied and while normally this may be good enough the movie has to make it obvious that a crime is happening in my opinion to make it a true crime movie. This doesn't happen until the very end of the movie and we don't really know who did what and how and why.It's not a socially conscious movie although I suppose the plot could have been considered a lesson of what not to do in corporate America. Really there wasn't much of a theme that I noticed. At least not one that stood out greater than any other. Again I believe this fact added to the problem with this film.It's comical but not funny. It's suspenseful but not enough to keep a person wondering who the bad guy is throughout the film. It tries to be a bit Noirish but the noir moments are nothing more than the ramblings of a script that is trying to be funny but misses.The Informant never really comes together as a film of any type and I found myself rewinding to see if I had missed something. This should not have to happen in a good movie. A good movie not only makes the viewer want to watch it through to the end but it also makes the viewer want to remember what they just watched.Have you ever seen movie with someone that you liked so much that you talked about it afterwards like a little kid? You find yourself saying things like I loved the scene when.. and That was so cool when he.. I found nothing in the film that made me want to talk about it. In fact I found myself trying to explain it to my wife who made it through the first 20 or 30 minutes then went to sleep.We got this from Netflix and couldn't wait to watch it. Unfortunately we had to wait and believe me this movie wasn't worth the wait. I can think of about 6 other things we could have been doing on a Saturday night 5 of which I won't mention here that could have entertained us more than watching this movie. This is a bold statement and if you knew me you'd think it was even bolder. There's only been one movie I've ever seen that I couldn't stand watching. Dead Ringers starring Jeremy Irons remains the only movie I ever fell asleep watching. The Informant wasn't a snoozer but it came pretty close.Variety Magazine called The Informant The wacky little brother of Erin Brockovich. Are they serious? Saying The Informant is even remotely similar to Erin Brockovich is like saying Wise Guy with Joe Piscopo and Danny Devito is the quirky little brother to The Godfather. I know it was you Variety you broke my heart.At least Erin Brockovich had a point. There was something to look forward to. You wanted to watch the movie to see if the big bad corporation would prevail or would the little no ones from nowhere triumph over their Goliath.I suppose you could say that The Informant is ever so slightly historically relevant as it IS based on a true story. Although looking through the Wiki website it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. The story ends in the movie anyway with the FBI being rather upset with Mark. At least some of them are anyway. In real life some of the FBI agents are actually trying to get a Presidential pardon for him.Now this was some time down the road that the pardon was attempted. But the fact remains that at the end of the movie the FBI was pretty upset at Mark Whitacre. Even the prosecutors were mad at him as well. Then to make matters worse the one FBI guy who wasn't that mad at him found out that he hadn't completely told them the whole truth.Despite all these things the FBI people are trying to get him a pardon claiming that even though he was a convicted criminal he helped them with one of the biggest antitrust cases in history. We don't see that in this movie. For me this movie isn't over. There's not enough for a sequel but they don't tell the entire story. There's no closure. There's no ending. I feel like I got an email from my girlfriend breaking up with me and she never said why.".

	schema:headline " Damon is exceptional and the film around him is quite good as well";
	schema:reviewBody "Prolific auteur Steven Soderbergh's newest film is a corporate crime comedy starring Matt Damon as a reallife informant for the FBI. His goal was to expose the industry he worked in for their price fixing. He comes to the FBI Scott Bakula and Joel McHale in particular as a guy in a white hat just a biochemist who worked his way up to the corporate office and was appalled at the practices he observed. The truth was much less black and white  not only was he thinking that with all his bosses gone he'd be the head of his company but he was also embezzling money from the company just in case that didn't work out. The story is good but the thing that you'll go home remembering is Matt Damon. He's been a very good actor for a long time now  I would even say underappreciated he was the best thing about The Departed for instance and he was barely ever recognized for it. The Informant! is probably his best work to date and I hope his industry recognizes it. It definitely helps that he has a great character to work with. We frequently hear his inner thoughts and we begin to understand him. Or at least we think we do. Even by the end of the film we realize that there are facets to this man that are still hidden. Perhaps he doesn't even know these facets himself. The film itself would probably rank as one of the best of the year but Soderbergh makes one tragic mistake the comic score. Comic scores are difficult. If you make them too goofy you can make it seem like you're trying too hard. And with a drier comedy like The Informant! you run the risk of undercutting the comedy if you underplay it in the score. Unfortunately Marvin Hamlisch makes the former mistake quite terribly. The score plays like its backing a circus performance with frequent corny James Bond parody bits Damon at one point claims he's 0014 because he's twice as smart as 007. It significantly harms the film.".

He comes to the FBI Scott Bakula and Joel McHale in particular as a guy in a white hat just a biochemist who worked his way up to the corporate office and was appalled at the practices he observed. The truth was much less black and white  not only was he thinking that with all his bosses gone he'd be the head of his company but he was also embezzling money from the company just in case that didn't work out. The story is good but the thing that you'll go home remembering is Matt Damon. He's been a very good actor for a long time now  I would even say underappreciated he was the best thing about The Departed for instance and he was barely ever recognized for it. The Informant! is probably his best work to date and I hope his industry recognizes it. It definitely helps that he has a great character to work with. We frequently hear his inner thoughts and we begin to understand him. Or at least we think we do. Even by the end of the film we realize that there are facets to this man that are still hidden. Perhaps he doesn't even know these facets himself. The film itself would probably rank as one of the best of the year but Soderbergh makes one tragic mistake the comic score. Comic scores are difficult. If you make them too goofy you can make it seem like you're trying too hard. And with a drier comedy like The Informant! you run the risk of undercutting the comedy if you underplay it in the score. Unfortunately Marvin Hamlisch makes the former mistake quite terribly. The score plays like its backing a circus performance with frequent corny James Bond parody bits Damon at one point claims he's 0014 because he's twice as smart as 007. It significantly harms the film.";

	schema:reviewBody "In Steven Soderbergh's The Informant! Matt Damon is a guileless agriculture exec who decides to rat out on his superiors for their pricefixing schemes. Or maybe he's not as innocent as he looks and is simply trying to take over the embattled company. Or maybe he's just mentally unstable. But the result is lamebrained and uninvolving as the movie progresses it's clear there's more to things than meets the eye but little reason to care. With a protagonist who isn't convincing as either a victim or a perpetrator The Informant! ultimately tries way too hard to please. Damon's characterizations are difficult to pin down making it impossible to root for him or against him at any point even at the very end.The Informant! is an absurdist piece but it just doesn't work. You get the feeling that if this had been a straightforward industrialwrongdoing bit it could have been a strong acerbic eyebrow raiser about Big Bad Companies. It could have been The Insider an investigative movie that was just as much about the behindthescenes machinations of the good guys and the bad guys as it was about the evils of the smoking industry. But you get little of that in The Informant! which apparently sees itself as a comedy of errors. As the lies of Mark Whitacre Damon  to the FBI to his bosses to his lawyers  pile up all semblance of reality and logic go flying out the window.Damon plays Whitacre with almost unhinged glee but it's as if he's in on the joke and you're not. At times he reminds you of Andy from The 40 Year Old Virgin so innocent in the ways of the world and the next thing you know he's lying his butt off to anyone who will listen. Is it all part of an elaborate scheme or is he just a chronic liar? It might not be evident even by the end of the movie which sort of puts the protagonist's role in a bit of stasis.For me there are people for whom you root people against whom you root and people whose intentions are nebulous. I don't even mind it when there are unexplained actions by the characters it's okay if there are loose plot threads. So it's not that I don't agree with Mark Whitacre being this playingallsides sort of fellow it's just that all of the actions he undertakes whether he's working with the feds interacting with his smarter wife or narrating himself are a colossal bore. That's the crux of it right there  the movie is boring the plot is so straightforward and vanilla that the audience isn't likely to be emotionally invested in Whitacre or his family we hardly ever see the kids anyway and therefore isn't likely to give a hoot what happens to them.".

Anna Wintour must be in her mid 50's similarly or even older Grace Coddington Karl Lagerfeld Jean Paul Gaulthier Giorgio Armani Oscar de la Renta etc etc. And what was also relevant about this discovery as seen in the movie is that these people are NOT wearing the ridiculous outfits they are foisting on the public through magazines such as Voguewhich sets the fashion dictates of a season. Anna Wintour wore only the most feminine attractive figure flattering AGEAPPROPRIATE outfits throughout the moviewhich are damn hard to find in the stores! unless perhaps one is paying top top dollar for designer prices which may cater to an older crowd But the fashion designs that are being interpreted for mainstream America is following the latest trends as written and photographed by Vogue. Secondly this is a movie that attempts to humanize Anna Wintour and does so simply by showing that she is an obsessive human being whose obsession is her magazine. She does show some warmth with her daughter but otherwise she is simply driven and clearly makes no attempt to ease the palpable discomfort of others in her presence. She's not evil nor bitchy but she does seems to take some pride her in tabla rosa facial expressionswhich clearly raises the anxiety level of those submitting work to her. It wouldn't hurt her professionalism to attempt more empathy but I guess she doesn't see it that way. Overall it's a very interesting movie and shows the business side of creating the largest fashion magazine in the world complete with casual references to using Photoshop to enhance an already beautiful woman or the promotion of fur in fashion due probably to the large amount of furriers who buy advertising. Great eye candy throughout!".

	schema:reviewBody "Meryl Streep's character in The Devil Wears Prada is rumoured to be inspired by Anna Wintour the legendary editorinchief of the fashion magazine Vogue and it's not hard to see how so. A cup of Starbucks in hand the bob hairdo the cutting remarks people going into a frenzy whenever her name is mentioned and worse when dazzled by her presence. Even the vogue office does seem quite similar in terms of layout and the number of assistants constantly scurrying around looking busy and executing to her every instruction.It's hard not to see why Wintour and Vogue for that matter became the subjects of a documentary since both are very powerful in setting the agenda for an entire industry with what's being said and featured in the magazine goes. R.J. Cutler's documentary provided that sneak peek into the behind the scenes working of what's to date the largest single issue of the iconic fashion magazine it's September 2007 issue where little interesting nuggets of information get dropped around such as the distinction and importance of the September issue hence the title in trendsetting what's hot and what's possibly not over the next 12 months.There are always people curious about the glamorous industry filled with pretty clothes flamboyant designers glitzy fashion weeks in trendy capitals of the world and of course the beautiful clotheshorse models. It does seem to be this perfect little ecosystem filled with perfect people on the surface though those looking toward this film in digging out some skeletons from the closet will be sorely disappointed. This in part due to the power that Wintour wields where you see not only new designers in awe but veterans from the established fashion houses that come with reverence for possibly fear of offending the almighty the high priestess or so she's called in charge of the bible of the industry.But of course one editor a magazine maketh not. R.J.'s documentary provided a more holistic look at the making of the magazine. And not just any magazine mind you but THE one brand that has been around for more than a century and with that comes trust and influence to make or break designers. R.J. was provided unprecedented access into the behindthe scenes look at the assembling of an issue and with that comes plenty of photo shoots jet setting lifestyles the pursuit of deadlines and enough of office politics. The amount of work is just staggering.However the filmmaker does seem to fall short in eliciting a lot more from Wintour aside from talkingheads styled short interviews which became the bookends of the film. In fact it's more of the Creative Director Grace Coddington's show where you will probably be won over by her sheer genius and eye for creative art form in directing photo shoots and dreaming up storyboards on the fly for the still pictures to tell a story. I admit I was more impressed with Coddington's story wry humour and creative style rather than Wntour's cool demeanour which often sets them up for clashes for the good of the magazine of course in constantly raising the bar though at times it does seem that someone's creative spark do get unappreciated and often doused with cold water. Such is their lovehate professional relationship.Which primes this film with a villain so to speak but of course the boss always has the final say and calls the shots. We do get to see how both of them rose to power they started off as models! through their joining Vogue at the same time and rise through the ranks based on their respective strengths. Filled with countless of fashion celebrities clothes accessories and the occasional cutting remark I do think Wintour seemed to have held back her tongue a lot more since a camera is constantly in her way The September Issue is a superb look into the sheer intense and immense talent and hard work that goes into the publication of every issue and would likely induce you to grab a copy of Vogue right after the show.I'll never look at this magazine in the same frivolous light ever again as they are really taken seriously given the money made available and someone's career probably on the line too.".

Such is their lovehate professional relationship.Which primes this film with a villain so to speak but of course the boss always has the final say and calls the shots. We do get to see how both of them rose to power they started off as models! through their joining Vogue at the same time and rise through the ranks based on their respective strengths. Filled with countless of fashion celebrities clothes accessories and the occasional cutting remark I do think Wintour seemed to have held back her tongue a lot more since a camera is constantly in her way The September Issue is a superb look into the sheer intense and immense talent and hard work that goes into the publication of every issue and would likely induce you to grab a copy of Vogue right after the show.I'll never look at this magazine in the same frivolous light ever again as they are really taken seriously given the money made available and someone's career probably on the line too.";

Once she leaves Vogue is on a fast ride downhill. Wintour's insights as she looks at and discusses potential fashion spreads seem fairly prosaic. She must have gotten the job by gameplaying and the usual machinations of the business world. Outside of standing back somewhat and letting Coddington do her work I don't see what she contributes to the magazine except for making her staff feel compulsively insecure. I enjoyed the few scenes that show her with her twentysomething daughter who wants to be a lawyer. She clearly has the ability to get to Wintour that no one else in the film does. Good for her. Wintour talks about her father and siblings but neglects to mention her American mother an interesting omission. Wintour is a lonely character in a way. There's a revealing scene of her in the back of a town car clutching a Starbucks coffee and staring straight ahead. She's off in her own world most of the time. As is to be expected no one on the Vogue staff actually wears the outlandish clothing featured in the magazine. Wintour wears flattering silk dresses Coddington dresses in various frumpy black outfits and the staff and photographers wear practical work clothes. The exception is Leon Talley the only member of the staff who truly buys into the fashion myth. Since Wintour reveals so little of herself and the filmmaker is as deferential to her as the rest of her intimidated staff ultimately The September Issue is an elegantly made film with no emotional heart.".

The documentary is also a war story between two minds Wintour and Coddington's. Wintour is the general so she gets to decide and in general no pun intended she makes bad decisions. It is impressive that the documentary got made and that Wintour who must have seen it was OK with the image its portrays of her because the source of her power her editorship are nowhere to be found. Wintour behaves like a celebrity because when the veil is drawn there is not much there. Her visual sense is tired and the manner in which she makes her decisions with wimp art director Charlie Churchward is appalling. It is one of those ongoing ironies that editors get to claim the honors for their magazines when the real visual artists in this case Grace Coddington have to play second fiddle to people so clearly less talented. The only one to escape this fate was Fabion Barone who having worked for Harper's Bizaar actually is seen as the force behind the success of the magazine. The other elephant in the room about this documentary is that no one seems very happy. Anna clearly is depressed about being seen as a lightweight in her family i.e.fashion even her own daughter while clearly enjoying the riches of her mothers fame doesn't get it. Grace and her weathered face tell it all it is torture to work with his talentless woman called the editor and all the minions run around in fearof what exactly is the real question...which reveals Anna's only real talent and power she has the ability to fire people.".

	schema:reviewBody "First let me tell you that I am a straight man who is not at all interested at fashion. I have never bought a Vogue September issue nor have I ever even bought a fashion magazine. After realizing this movie got great reviews I decided to see it. The reviews were right and I most certainly was not disappointed. The September Issue is the rare kind of movie that is a combination of documentary with a message and elegance.Many people know about Anna Wintour. If you seen The Devil Wears Prada you'll know that she is pure evil. Although there may be some truth to this statement this movie paints her in a different light. The movie opens with her explaining that people who wear high fashion should not be made fun of just because they were haute couture. Wintour is looked at as more of a person with morals who gets what she wants because she often is right and does what is best for the magazine. She doesn't strive to be mean she does it for the magazine.The star of the movie is not Wintour. It's actually the creative director Grace Coddington. Coddington is not nearly as likable as Wintour ironically but she is central to the movie and the reason it is so good. The movie's message is about how the fashion world is so superficial and perfect. Towards the end the cameraman for the movie is used in a photograph however he is just an average person who is slightly overweight. Coddington urges people not to touch the picture up. She says Nobody is perfect but models are. This is the movie's central idea.Another reason I really enjoyed the movie is that it really does have some great filmmaking. R.J. Cutler really does have some nice shots including my favorite of a couple kissing in front of the Eiffel Tower. It has nothing to do with the movie and yet it is such a moving shot. There are quite a few establishing shots similar to this in the movie and these little things are the icing on the cake.You don't have to be a fashion lover to love this movie. You don't have to be a subscriber to Vogue. You don't have to be a woman. Whatever your preconceptions about this were ignore them. This a movie for anybody that should be seen by everybody. The September Issue opens wide this weekend so make use of it and go see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anna Wintour the subject of R. J. Cutler incisive take on the woman who is a powerful voice in the way women dress seems to be rather shy in comparison to the unflattering portrait of her fictionalized self that came out in The Devil Wears Prada. There are no temper tantrums or any other indication from the way she comes across in the film. One also realizes Ms. Wintour is well aware there is a camera following her at all times so she was perhaps giving a controlled performance about her persona.Of course Ms. Wintour is only interested in bringing high fashion to those that can well afford it. She is not at all concerned in what an average woman say from the America's heartland is going to be wearing next season. After all they could not afford spending a couple of thousand dollars in just a plain cotton schmatte from Chanel or Galiano! Vogue's target is a rich woman with a lot of disposable income not the mere citizen that goes to Target or KMart for the fashions they wear. Our only question to Ms. Wintour and her staff would be where are the women that wear some of those fabulous couture outfits. Obviously they move in a rarefied world where only other rich ladies seem to inhabit.Vogue is the magazine that fashionable people turn to for matters of styles and trends. Much of what one sees is not Ms. Wintour's creation but what her amazing staff had done for her to make it to the printed page. That is the case of one of the most intelligent and down to earth persons in the documentary Grace Coddington who is the woman with an impeccable vision as to how to present fashion in a sophisticated and artistic way. It is ultimately Anna Wintour's decision what makes it into the important September issue.We are invited to follow Ms. Wintour in her journeys from inspecting the upcoming trends from the likes of Oscar De La Renta or JeanPaul Gautier to the fashion shows she attends always seated in the front row her eyes masked by her trademark dark glasses. One never gets a hint of what is going on in her head as she follows the models strutting the fabulous clothes that has either appeared or will appear in the magazine.There is rare moments in which Ms. Wintour comes to being just an ordinary person as she talks about her family. She tells us how her siblings think she is in a funny business since they all have gone to careers of much distinction and importance dealing with world and society problems. It becomes clear Anna Wintour loves her children as we watch her interact with a daughter who does not want to follow her mother into the fashion world.Director R. J. Cutler captured the essence of a complex woman that has gone to the top of her profession.".

After all they could not afford spending a couple of thousand dollars in just a plain cotton schmatte from Chanel or Galiano! Vogue's target is a rich woman with a lot of disposable income not the mere citizen that goes to Target or KMart for the fashions they wear. Our only question to Ms. Wintour and her staff would be where are the women that wear some of those fabulous couture outfits. Obviously they move in a rarefied world where only other rich ladies seem to inhabit.Vogue is the magazine that fashionable people turn to for matters of styles and trends. Much of what one sees is not Ms. Wintour's creation but what her amazing staff had done for her to make it to the printed page. That is the case of one of the most intelligent and down to earth persons in the documentary Grace Coddington who is the woman with an impeccable vision as to how to present fashion in a sophisticated and artistic way. It is ultimately Anna Wintour's decision what makes it into the important September issue.We are invited to follow Ms. Wintour in her journeys from inspecting the upcoming trends from the likes of Oscar De La Renta or JeanPaul Gautier to the fashion shows she attends always seated in the front row her eyes masked by her trademark dark glasses. One never gets a hint of what is going on in her head as she follows the models strutting the fabulous clothes that has either appeared or will appear in the magazine.There is rare moments in which Ms. Wintour comes to being just an ordinary person as she talks about her family. She tells us how her siblings think she is in a funny business since they all have gone to careers of much distinction and importance dealing with world and society problems. It becomes clear Anna Wintour loves her children as we watch her interact with a daughter who does not want to follow her mother into the fashion world.Director R. J. Cutler captured the essence of a complex woman that has gone to the top of her profession.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've worked in and around fashion and the entertainment industry most of my life. I really enjoyed The September Issue as it validated that a lot of work goes into promoting and sustaining the industry.I really liked how Anna Wintour was portrayed and I wholeheartedly agree with what she said about ever leaving the industry...she said she would leave if she found herself getting too mad. I also very much enjoyed Grace Coddington. I think she's probably the most real person in fashion and Vogue and Anna Wintour are lucky to have her.On the other hand I think we all wish we could be like the character Andrea in The Devil Wears Prada. It would be awesome to have access to the greatest fashions in the world and stylists to show you how to wear them hair and makeup tips and unlimited accessories. But as we all can see that's not really the case. Most people working in fashion magazines films TV etc. look like they've never heard of or seen fashion. Most of them show up for work without hair or makeup done and their outfits look as if they came straight off the racks...of Goodwill.That is except for Andre Leon Talley. Have you ever seen anyone with more clich logo accessories? Again he's probably a very nice guy but does he really do anything? He appears to be little more than the office mascot as I have never seen him do any actual work. He always has the latestgreatest swag but he just comes across as a caftan covered caricature of what a fashion editor should look like. He must really have some juicy dirt on Conde Naste. I don't think a female editor would ever be allowed to get away with not doing any actual work. He's closer to The Devil Wears Prada LV and any other free designer labeled swag than Ann Wintour. But hey it's a great job if you can get it! Overall the documentary was very well done and very interesting to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been collecting the hefty September issue of Vogue since I was 16 years old. It's great having this reference to look back at as fashion is cyclical. For me because I love Vogue it was a treat to catch some behind the scenes workings of the September issue. The main motivation behind Wintour's participating in this documentary is probably primarily commercial as she want's Vogue's circulation to increase. Don't view this with an expectation to gain insight into her character. I found the documentary too short but it's because I loved the subject for casual viewers unfamiliar with the Septemeber issues it's a good length. So why do I love Vogue's September issue? The trends brought up in September will echo throughout the fashion year and for years after. This magazine marries culture albeit a more highbrowed selective snobbish commercial culture with genuine talent and artistry. Plus there are actual articles to read in small font throughout the magazine. It's not just a fluffy magazine full of photo's. Through the documentary the viewer can see that the people running Vogue are ageing. These people also refreshingly wear very little makeup and let their wrinkles show. A lot of the documentary features Grace who has wild untamed hair at the beginning I wished she had used product or a straightening iron but Grace is the crone archetype while young she was beautiful and now at old age is again comfortable in her own skin. The September issues of Vogue under Wintour's leadership are memento's of the current golden age of fashion and design. It's interesting that Wintour is of English origin as her sensibility is so French and conservative. In fact London is one of the cities where fashion begins from the individual and fashion there is chaotic and unique and frankly follows no rules. The world we are familiar with where fashion trends echo throughout every country is ending. The timing of this documentary before the US economic meltdown was lucky there is no doom and gloom in this documentary. A must see for those interested in fashion.".

Anna Wintour appears to be much of the first type and Grace Coddington of the second. We follow these two women and a lot of other staff famous photographers and beautiful models through the making of the September issue trekking to Paris London and Rome and back to New York.Sure there is a lot of hard work involved in the creation of beautiful images and in the selection of ethereal sometimes plain crazy outfits. However one can hardly feel much empathy for Ms. Wintour who gives the impression of being an unpleasant selfabsorbed arrogant woman. Apparently she is just confirming all the rumors about her. In the most revealing sequence she is uttering the lines If I get too angry I will quit this job. Indeed one could say that throughout the documentary she makes a big effort to conceal deep seated rage. But what exactly is making her so angry is a mystery.She gets what she wants basically at all times both with staff who does not dare to contradict her and with designers who tremble at the sign of her disapproval. In short she looks like a despotic queen a sort of female Henry VIII who could at any time order to have heads cut off. And yet she is so angry It is difficult to see what people could do to please her more but maybe it is just not in her nature to be happy.Different story about Grace Coddington who is the human face of this elitist fashion world. She actually seems a nice person who really cares about beauty and elegance. The photos she styles are indeed beautiful. Too beautiful for this commercial world indeed. In fact most are rejected by her commander in chief and one cannot but feel sorry for so much creativity compressed within the pages of what is basically just a luxury items catalog.".

Well that's more or less what happens here. One plot involves the title  the simply fact of a magazine deadline. The other is much more interesting although I feel not fully investigated by Cutler.From a character's point of view this film is nominally about Anna Wintour the legendary editor of American Vogue. Indeed Cutler seems to have been given pretty good access. Yet woman and Sphynx are inseparable and her dramatic interventions are rendered more through Cutler's own editorial decisions. The emergent protagonist turns out to be Anna Carrington the inhouse stylist and foil for Wintour's undoubted ruthlessness. The two British noteworthily women barely have a raised voice on screen let alone an angry word but Carrington's enthusiasm provides plenty of casual quotation. It is clear that for all that she is put upon she is the mercurial creative heart of an institution that might otherwise be characterised as reductive or simply censorious.And yet Cutler doesn't make the most of it. He fails to really use this editorial dialectic to get into the psyche of Wintour about whom we know no more at the end than at the beginning. The story of the two women that he pieces together from his footage is coherent but dictated by that footage  not by something that a more perceptive director might perceive within it.Other characters within the industry spice the film up with a cocktail of silly queening and malapropisms but the monotony of working at Vogue is too often just that. 310".

During the course of the documentary we get to know a little more about Grace and Anna than about Andre. Grace has the lovely long red hair and is passionate about a photo shoot of hers that is being edited out of the magazine. During the course we see Anna work hard at her job. But then Vogue magazine is really about the art of fashion. She makes things happen if she really likes you. You wouldn't know it because she's got that poker face and wears sunglasses at shows. Anna makes the final decision of editing a huge magazine. There are many people who make up Vogue but Anna is the Queen who decides on it finally. I do admire the artistic photographs that cover the pages of the magazine like fine art rather than just fashion. Maybe that's what Vogue is to fashion it's high art with a vision. Most of us won't wear designer gowns but we have to admire the presentation to make us want to spend money to look like a fashion model.".

	schema:headline " Does Anna really like fashion?";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not a movie about the making of an issue of a magazine. It's not even about Anna Wintour. It's a movie about the drama between Wintour and Coddington her stylist and friend of 20 or 30 or 40 years.The first thing that I noticed was that Wintour retained her great beauty at age 58. She's living proof that at 58 women can be girly. At the same time when we see pictures of her at age 19 and 21 we notice that she hasn't changed her hair style one iota which is a bit disappointing for someone who's so much into fashion. OTOH Grace Coddington who's 8 years older didn't age as well but she at least evolved from her early twenties when she was stunning to all of her 66 years. Yes they could both do with a bit of botox but perhaps one of the points that the movie is trying to make is that even the Pope of Beauty and her BFF don't really need botox in order to be looked up to. And feared. They can boast leading and steering a 300 billion dollar industry so who really needs superficial beauty then?In the first half of the film the Grace vs Anna story line is pushed and it is pushed beyond the limit. Coddington is totally acting the Wronged Genius the complete righthemispherebraintype the Artistic One who is curtailed by the Evil Mistress. Meanwhile Wintour remains curt and concise as her outward persona prescribes. Indeed Grace Coddington has the most lines in the script.The second half of the movie is about the big photo shoot with celebrity actress Sienna Miller Factory Girl something which was announced throughout the first half. This story line has a somewhat astonishing development and it casts the Anna as the QueenofMean idea a bit in doubt She commissions some Italian photographer to do THE shoot of the issue. But it turns out that an essential part of the photoshoot in the Roman Colosseum simply isn't delivered by this pastaclicker someone who is undoubtedly a good photographer but not very well known or powerful. So why isn't Wintour blowing a gasket when she finds out that he didn't do the shoot just because it didn't feel right? Amazing. Perhaps I'm not artistic enough.There are two surprising revelations in two of the three direct interviews that Wintour does which makes one wonder if Wintour really is proud of what she does for a living. In the first interview in the beginning of the docu she gets all defensive about the whole idea that fashionistas are airheads because they focus on the exterior. A clear case of 'Methinks the lady doth protest too much'. In the second one she tells about her siblings who are all doing charitable work and whom she feels aren't taking HER profession or work very seriously. I don't know whether this is genuine or whether this is passive aggressiveness toward her sister and brothers Wintour is undoubtedly far more successful in what she does than any of her siblings or whether this is an attempt at softening of her aloof and harsh image. Perhaps it's just an example of how complex any person's life can get since it appears from the third interview that she clearly would like her daughter to be a fashion editor which she probably wouldn't do if she wasn't proud of her own accomplishments but DaughterDearest is smart enough not to compete with Mummy.The movie ends with the Grace vs Anna storyline. It seems that Grace has won since it seems that most of her photos are allowed into the magazine by Anna. It's unclear if this has something to do with the fact that the Rome photo shoot was a disaster.We are left in doubt whether the whole GraceAnna dynamic was real. Coddington must know a thing or two about clawing ones way to and staying on top since she's been at the top of her stylistfield for 15 or 20 of the 40 years that she is a stylist.

	onyx:emotionText "This is not a movie about the making of an issue of a magazine. It's not even about Anna Wintour. It's a movie about the drama between Wintour and Coddington her stylist and friend of 20 or 30 or 40 years.The first thing that I noticed was that Wintour retained her great beauty at age 58. She's living proof that at 58 women can be girly. At the same time when we see pictures of her at age 19 and 21 we notice that she hasn't changed her hair style one iota which is a bit disappointing for someone who's so much into fashion. OTOH Grace Coddington who's 8 years older didn't age as well but she at least evolved from her early twenties when she was stunning to all of her 66 years. Yes they could both do with a bit of botox but perhaps one of the points that the movie is trying to make is that even the Pope of Beauty and her BFF don't really need botox in order to be looked up to. And feared. They can boast leading and steering a 300 billion dollar industry so who really needs superficial beauty then?In the first half of the film the Grace vs Anna story line is pushed and it is pushed beyond the limit. Coddington is totally acting the Wronged Genius the complete righthemispherebraintype the Artistic One who is curtailed by the Evil Mistress. Meanwhile Wintour remains curt and concise as her outward persona prescribes. Indeed Grace Coddington has the most lines in the script.The second half of the movie is about the big photo shoot with celebrity actress Sienna Miller Factory Girl something which was announced throughout the first half. This story line has a somewhat astonishing development and it casts the Anna as the QueenofMean idea a bit in doubt She commissions some Italian photographer to do THE shoot of the issue. But it turns out that an essential part of the photoshoot in the Roman Colosseum simply isn't delivered by this pastaclicker someone who is undoubtedly a good photographer but not very well known or powerful. So why isn't Wintour blowing a gasket when she finds out that he didn't do the shoot just because it didn't feel right? Amazing. Perhaps I'm not artistic enough.There are two surprising revelations in two of the three direct interviews that Wintour does which makes one wonder if Wintour really is proud of what she does for a living. In the first interview in the beginning of the docu she gets all defensive about the whole idea that fashionistas are airheads because they focus on the exterior. A clear case of 'Methinks the lady doth protest too much'. In the second one she tells about her siblings who are all doing charitable work and whom she feels aren't taking HER profession or work very seriously. I don't know whether this is genuine or whether this is passive aggressiveness toward her sister and brothers Wintour is undoubtedly far more successful in what she does than any of her siblings or whether this is an attempt at softening of her aloof and harsh image. Perhaps it's just an example of how complex any person's life can get since it appears from the third interview that she clearly would like her daughter to be a fashion editor which she probably wouldn't do if she wasn't proud of her own accomplishments but DaughterDearest is smart enough not to compete with Mummy.The movie ends with the Grace vs Anna storyline. It seems that Grace has won since it seems that most of her photos are allowed into the magazine by Anna. It's unclear if this has something to do with the fact that the Rome photo shoot was a disaster.We are left in doubt whether the whole GraceAnna dynamic was real. Coddington must know a thing or two about clawing ones way to and staying on top since she's been at the top of her stylistfield for 15 or 20 of the 40 years that she is a stylist. So I really don't know if a Coddington is such a victim as she seems and b Wintours praise of Coddington at the end is real.The Melancholic Alcoholic";

Oh once in awhile they open their lipstick lips to utter nonsense about the 'fabulous' September phone book size issue of Vogue. Was that big redhead a former UFC cage fighter.

When I heard about The September Issue I was excited and a teeny bit sceptical. However I was not disappointed in the slightest.It's funny it's at times touching but more than anything it's undutiful a fantastic sneak peek into the little bubble that so many people dream of being a part of. Andre Leon Talley and Grace Coddington to name just a couple of the film's interviewees bring so much more to the movie than written characters ever could. Appearances from fashion's biggest names Jean Paul Gaultier Mario Testino Vera Wang Coco Rocha etc also remind us of how powerful the publication is.And then there's Anna Wintour. For people who have watched The Devil Wears Prada and expect a Miranda Priestly cookie cutout to burst through her office doors laughing at 'the little people' and throwing diva tantrums in a hushed yet stern voice you are sorely mistaken. Instead Wintour is humanised and is shown to have real feelings real ambition and real misinterpretations. I actually find this portrayal of Wintour much more satisfying and less predictable.For those who aren't in to fashion this film may be more up your street than you think. The film does not just focus on fashion being the 'be all and end all' of the world's functions. An interview with the editorinchief's daughter shows just that. Also the themes of loss and change expressed through Grace Coddington's journey in the documentary are truly moving and something that many people could relate to.All in all a fantastic insight in to such an exclusive club alongside a stellar soundtrack and stunning visuals The September Issue is a breath of fresh air which I watch time and time again when I want to laugh cry and be inspired. A great film. Highly recommended.".

Also the themes of loss and change expressed through Grace Coddington's journey in the documentary are truly moving and something that many people could relate to.All in all a fantastic insight in to such an exclusive club alongside a stellar soundtrack and stunning visuals The September Issue is a breath of fresh air which I watch time and time again when I want to laugh cry and be inspired. A great film. Highly recommended.";

But wait!  It gets better!  You can also quite easily predict what will become of essential items such as the generator keeping the electric fence going all the vehicles most of the communication devices the thoughts of the higher up personnel.I personally loved how the Komodo just stood there whenever it was in frame. It opened its mouth and roared with its 1950sish monster movie look and stocksoundeffect roar that's been used in such intimidating places as Scooby Doo sidenote do Komodos roar?.  Might as well make the movie about an oversized Chihuahua that just bounces up and down barking. People shoot at it.  It stands there not even bleeding.  People fire more rounds it still stand there.At this point I think at least one person would try something a little different like aiming for universal softspots such as I dunno the eyes? We have to assume that they're not standing their firing randomly but the director fails to communicate that idea.They get into a truck and drive and now the thing decides to move and try to dine.  Why not charge while they're all just standing there? Characters and creatures do what the plot needs them to do when the plot needs them to despite the fact that the plot defies logic on so many levels that it can't be ignored this coming from a fan of low budget horror films which always defies logic.Let's think about this guns going off and bullets hitting a Komodo is going to provoke it to take a little more action than standing and roaring.  If it hurts or confuses the thing it's probably going to go away.  If it doesn't hurt it it's probably going to pss it off which means its going to attack. You know what?  Even if it is hurtconfused it might still attack actually.  I'm no expert on Komodo dragons maybe they would just stand there and smile . . . but would they still be around then Komodo . . .dodo bird . . . hmmm.Anyway logically wouldn't we see a more curious creature investigating these people before it started eating?  And if the answer is because the creature mutated it would be more aggressive.'  Okay fine . . . so why didn't it show this aggression during a logical moment like being shot at?And to answer the above question  well the Komodo effects were not well designed.  In cinema creature effects become an actor requiring a performance which requires a high degree of articulation not present here. After all we are creating organic beasts with a wide range of expressions gestures that would communicate its intentions.  The plot needs the thing to roar and run so that's all it does . . . hey wait that's not far off from what the cast has to do  talk and run.I waited through the whole film for an intelligent decision and found only one  Let's backup our data so we can let the world know the truth.'  Too bad I couldn't get an intelligent decision and an unpredictable plot element but maybe I'm asking for too much.  Especially in light of the final few scenes involving an air strike which I'm assuming was cut together with stock footage since the planes changed from shot to shot.The high point of the film was the character Jack thanks to the actor. All the actors played this quite stale like they realized they were making a goofy monster movie and just wanted their paycheck so they could get out of there.  Kinda strange that the actor to breath some life into his role was the character stuck in a place he didn't want to be in and just wanted the hell out of there.  Maybe I just detected a hint of ironic honesty in the performance.  Go figure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Curse of the Komodo isn't that bad of a creature feature.SPOILERSAfter the loss of a special military operation on Isle Damas Professors Nathan Phipps William Langlois and Dawn Porter Gail Harris are assigned to clean it up before people find out about it. Trying to get away from a casino robbery Drake Paul Logan Tiffany Melissa Brasselle and Reece Cam Newlin crashland on the island during the middle of a tropic storm. Going inland to find some repair equipment they stumble upon Nathan's daughter Rebecca GloriAnne Gilbert and the rest of the scientific team encountering a giant attacking Komodo Dragon. After fending off the attack they are welcome back to their compound and invited to stay. When the compound runs low on equipment they try to leave to the island before a military operation blows up the island.The Good News Here we go with another SciFi Channel creature feature and here is actually a pretty good one. The one thing that really works is the connection with the giant monster films of the early 50s and 60s. Crashinglanding on an island conducting genetic experiments with creatures and then encountering the creatures along the way screams of a 50s Bmovie plot and it gives the film some familiarity. The look back to the past gives the film a charm that most similar films don't really have and that's a pretty surprising feat to accomplish. However there is a change that works out for the better over the other films. The giant Komodo in this film is a fullygrown animal and isn't the baby of a larger creature that comes back later looking for revenge. That is a common factor in many similar films and the fact that it's missing here with the Komodo being fully grown and attacking is a really original move that needs to be commended and recognized. The action comes across pretty frequently and it keeps the pace going nicely. One sequence involving a chase in a fleeing truck is especially nice and is easily a highlight that is quite exciting and a little thrilling in places along the way. Even more we see the Komodo really and often so even though they look really bad digitally it isn't as terrible as it really should've been. And perhaps one of the greatest aspects is GloriAnne Gilbert's extended topless scene.The Bad News The creatures here look so horrible that it's almost a travesty to call these computer generated creatures the same name as the Dinos created for Jurassic Park. The fact that the same technique was used for the monsters in both films makes it all the more apparent that the Dinos will forever be the standard against which all CG creations will forever be judged. The results here are that bad. There are some pretty gaping plot holes on display here and even though knowing them won't seriously undermine the enjoyment of the film they are still there and pretty noticeable. The fact that the film is also just a giant cheesefest doesn't help matters. There's really no shocks jumps or anything and the film plays out like a giant cheesy good time.The Final Verdict It's a giant cheesefest that's for sure and Dinos from ten years ago still look better but if you like the creature features from the 50s and 60s then this isn't all that bad. Some kinks need to be either smoothed out or fixed but there's far worse ones I've seen out there. Take it for what you will.Rated R Graphic Language Violence and Nudity".

Its a disaster as an action movie but as a comedy this movie is an Aclass one...There are just too many plot holes you don't know where to start and the komodo looks much like a clay lizard incorporated in the movie using stop motion animation. It just runs after the characters and they keep shooting at it with unlimited clips in their guns by the way. When the characters are stuck in a corner it will stand at a distance and enjoy the line of fire as bullets Pierce its scales but if they are running away and shooting at it it continues to run after them for some reason and the bullet holes never appear in its scales yet again for some reason and then a zombie appears at the end of the movie and you have no idea where it came from or what the hell its doing in the movie!!....Just take it from me if you are ridiculously bored or drunk gather some friends and watch this movie....for the laughs and for the breasts scene!".

You ever see Dinosaur Island? In another scene a bunch of robbers pretend to be a documentary film crew. A scientist asks What's the name of the show?. The hot blonde replies Treasure Hunt. Treasure Hunt was another Wynorski flick. There are also references to Cool Hand Luke Ghostbusters and of course Jurassic Park.A bunch of people end up on Komodo Island and run for their lives. There are casino robbers with a hot blonde whose body has been aerobicized to death scientists with a notashot blonde with large breasts and the head scientist's daughter who has extremely large breasts. They must work together to save themselves from the giant Komodo roaming the island.The action scenes are tedious. Basically they involve the cast shooting guns off screen at a giant Komodo. Bullets don't seem to faze the Komodo. He just becomes bored after having been shot a few hundred times and walks away. Soon the people bicker and argue over survival tactics and the viewer yawns. Of course it's all been done before and better but who can ever really get enough of giant monsters? I know I can't. On the plus side Curse of the Komodo hums right along and doesn't hurt you too much. It's a Bmovie and proud of it. We've got a giant Komodo dragon some hot blondes and there you go. We have a movie! The best scene involves the scientist's daughter. She decides to go for a topless swim. This scene was magical. Even with a giant Komodo dragon roaming around she still found time to enjoy herself.

	schema:reviewBody "I thought 'Curse of the Komodo' was decent. Sadly though Jim Wynorski took what could have been a fascinating subject and turned it into a cheesy B movie.The characters' remark that the Komodo Dragon is 'the world's most dangerous reptile' is probably accurate. It is certainly one of the more intimidating. The thought of Komodos being mutated to be larger stronger more aggressive or perhaps less held in check by whatever forces of nature hold them in check is a pretty scary one. A movie in which mutated Komodos grow to be maybe 1.5 or twice their normal size would be scary and feasible enough to be acceptable for a horror movie junkie.However Wynorski seems to be trying to make another dinosaur movie. These gigantic Komodos look an awfully lot like raptors or TRex's! Do Komodos actually walk around on their hind legs? I cannot recall ever seeing a photo of one doing so. The scene that lost me was when the four crooks are sneaking up on the others and see them fighting off the Komodo from a side view. That shot was as cheesy and phony as any I recall seeing from the 1950s! Of course those who touch the Komodo 'venom' turning into murderous zombies is a bit overtheline too! That said the movie wasn't terrible. I disagree with the attacks on the acting. The noname cast isn't bad. I really like William Langlois as the professoralthough he really reminds me more of a high school or college football coach than a scientist! He and his coworker Dawn Gail Harris work well together. I couldn't keep the other 'good guys' straight in one and a half viewings.The crooks aren't bad either. Bad dudebodybuilder Drake Paul Logan is convincing enough although I was never really sure what I thought about him. His girl Friday with her Meredith BaxterBirney neonwhite teeth is a level above the average Bhorror bimbo. I halfway felt myself being drawn to her as the film went on. I can't say the same for the good doctor's whiny bigboobed daughter who really deserved to be Komodo food. I like the other two crooks too. The boozeswilling copter pilot is well played by Ted Monte and Cam Newlin is good as Reese the other crook.Overall this isn't a bad one. I certainly made sure I returned it in time though. This isn't one that's worth paying a late fee on!".

	schema:reviewBody "CURSE OF THE KOMODO is in fact not a sequel to Michael Lantieri's KOMODO from 1999 with the latter being a much better film actually. Being aware that CURSE OF THE KOMODO was directed by Jim Wynorski I got exactly what I expected from this movie a so bad it's good monsterflick with a high cheese  camp factor.Casually I'd like to mention that the comment posted by JaywriterXIII contains some interesting topics raised after viewing this film which are simply deadon and I experienced some of the same things and more while watching this flick so read it folks.The theme of the film is one of those experiments with animals gone awryones. On an island a few scientist have caused komodos to mutate and grow way beyond their normal size. On top that they've become highly aggressive making humans no longer stand at the top of the foodchain. Like if that isn't bad enough it also seems that when one touches the slime produced by the komodos heshe will turn into a rabid zombie capable of spreading the infection. Meantime three criminals who robbed a casino had to make an emergency landing on the island with their helicopter. Things become even more worse when the military decides to pull the plug on the whole project. You guessed it this flick goes way over the top.The komodos themselves are poorly made static CGIcreatures. Their roar is as standard as they come. I personally had no idea those oversized lizards could roar at all. Maybe they also have mutated vocal chords. They also appear to be completely bulletproof 'cause standing next to them and emptying your gun doesn't seem to hurt them. The bizarre thing is that they behave like my cat does when I stand next to her talk to her and throw things at her she doesn't move. She just keeps standing there occasionally roaring mriiaauw at me. But when I take a piece of rope and start running she suddenly comes chasing me wanting to bite everything that moves. The komodos behave in the exact same way. Bizarre.I'm not gonna go into the acting 'cause overall it's as bad as it gets. The lines dialogues and actions throughout this movie are extremely predictable or excel in utter stupidity and often are contradictory. For example Prof. Nathan repeatedly states that komodos don't like heat and only hunt at night. Though most of the attacks occur during the day. And this is one of my favorites When their helicopter crashlands the three criminals start scouting the island. When they stumble upon an abandoned car from the scientists one of them says This is our ticket outta here! They're on a friggin' island for Christ's sake. They're gonna do what? Drive it to the bottom of the ocean and emerge with it on the other side? Way to go scriptwriter!I was also wondering with them being scientists experimenting on an island and all where's the lab? No testtubes no microscopes no nothing. But they did have that fancy blueflashing fence and an expensivelooking mansion. One more thing I learned from CURSE OF THE KOMODO and from PTERODACTYL and a zillion other horrormovies when a blonde bimbo sees water as in a lake or a river she will always immediately take her cloths off and go swimming. Always. In this case the blonde cutiepie was Melissa Brasselle and I feel a little bit sorry for the lady. Her character clearly was inserted in the story for only two reasons switching the securedemergency power button onoff and... showing her boobies and boy what a pair they were.I will end this review on a positive note. There's one jumpscene in the movie that actually worked. It took place in the cabin were they decided to spend the night. I really jumped up from my sofa. I was amazed that a movie that's the opposite of scary managed to pull that off. And I also kinda liked the last shot of the movie. Maybe typical but still...There's only one reason to recommend this movie and that's for its unintentional comedy aspects. So if you don't have the right sense of humor you must avoid this at all costs. Actually there's a second reason to watch this it's a great really bad bmonstermovie flick.".

The lines dialogues and actions throughout this movie are extremely predictable or excel in utter stupidity and often are contradictory. For example Prof. Nathan repeatedly states that komodos don't like heat and only hunt at night. Though most of the attacks occur during the day. And this is one of my favorites When their helicopter crashlands the three criminals start scouting the island. When they stumble upon an abandoned car from the scientists one of them says This is our ticket outta here! They're on a friggin' island for Christ's sake. They're gonna do what? Drive it to the bottom of the ocean and emerge with it on the other side? Way to go scriptwriter!I was also wondering with them being scientists experimenting on an island and all where's the lab? No testtubes no microscopes no nothing. But they did have that fancy blueflashing fence and an expensivelooking mansion. One more thing I learned from CURSE OF THE KOMODO and from PTERODACTYL and a zillion other horrormovies when a blonde bimbo sees water as in a lake or a river she will always immediately take her cloths off and go swimming. Always. In this case the blonde cutiepie was Melissa Brasselle and I feel a little bit sorry for the lady. Her character clearly was inserted in the story for only two reasons switching the securedemergency power button onoff and... showing her boobies and boy what a pair they were.I will end this review on a positive note. There's one jumpscene in the movie that actually worked. It took place in the cabin were they decided to spend the night. I really jumped up from my sofa. I was amazed that a movie that's the opposite of scary managed to pull that off. And I also kinda liked the last shot of the movie. Maybe typical but still...There's only one reason to recommend this movie and that's for its unintentional comedy aspects. So if you don't have the right sense of humor you must avoid this at all costs. Actually there's a second reason to watch this it's a great really bad bmonstermovie flick.";

The only fact that they were united in this project made me sure that it would certainly be a masterpiece. I was not disappointed! I warmly recommend this work of art to everybody... If you happened to like this movie as much as I did I can recommend some other titles that are really worthwhile... First of all Boa vs. Python. I saw it recently and still have not been able to get over it. Besides there are some other classics Treasure Hunt 2003 Raptor 2001 Gargoyles 2004. All of which are directed by Jim Wynorsky. Besides that I'm really looking forward to the release of Komodo vs. Cobra featuring the exquisite GloriAnne Gilbert.".
