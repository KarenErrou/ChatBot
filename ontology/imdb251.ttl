I gave it a high rating in comparison to other Murphy films he has done recently excluding Dream girls ofcourse. It has been a while since I last saw Murphy up to his usual antics and I don't much appreciate the fact many are willing to watch offensive black comedy shows such as the Chappelle show you cannot seriously tell me that show is devoid of any racial offensive humor not with a straight face at lest but are ready to drop a movie that incorporates the same style it had most of the familiar cast from Chappelle show too. As i stands this was one of the most genuinely funny movie and just because a film cracks fat jokes and mild racial remarks which is a base trademark of black humor. I mean we are ready to watch toilet crap such as Mr. Deeds and other overly childish and brain dead level of Adam Sandler movies Mr. Deeds Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo to name a few. This movie is certainly not an excellent movie but in terms of Eddie Murphy's current stream of movies this is a much welcomed addition. It reminded me of Bowfinger mixed with Nutty Professor which was pretty humorous. It is stupid yes I will grant it that but its lot more watchable than the toilet flushed material we seem to be watching everyday of our lives like Adam Sandlers antics Bill Madison ugh... that is even lesser challenging to a mentally handicapped person. People need to lighten up about looks appearances as well. I am definitely on the heavy side and I find the movie mildly entertaining. If you really want to make issue about racism to its extreme how about using something like Borat.".

Just so you know I put in the black because with it comes the black stereotypes typical of this kind of movie. The joke has been done and redone and I just couldn't see how they could make it original and funny. Eddie Murphy was a hoot from start to finish in this movie. I was as well as everyone in the theater busting a gut seeing Eddie play Rasputia Norbit and the Chinaman Mr. Wong. Even though I still feel it had all been done before Eddie Murphy did achieve making a fresh and very funny approach to it. I'm glad I was talked into parting with my bucks to see Norbit. Eddie Murphy should be proud of this fine comic performance that will thrill his fans. The love story is sweet so take your sweetie to see this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "First let me say ... I am an Eddie Murphy fan. I think he's a comic genius. And that's why I was so surprised to see him star in and even write such a low level and offensive comedy.The first few minutes of the film started out with a little promise but it didn't take long for the film to fall to such a low level that I cringed from early in until the movie was over. And even though I watched to nearly the end I demanded my money back. It's only the second time I've ever done that and I'm an avid film goer.What was so offensive? I don't know where to begin. Most obviously every fat gag in the book was used. Eddie Murphy plays an overweight woman who is ugly and evil and every nasty thing you can think to say about her is said. To make it worse the leading lady is Thandie Newton who is extremely thin which only goes to further emphasize the other extreme.Maybe Eddie Murphy thought he could get away with this because he shows in The Nutty Professor how an overweight man can get the girl. But really that just shows the extreme double standard that remains when it comes to overweight men versus women.Now I'm a realist and I know that the double standard is not Eddie Murphy's fault. Still he plays on it here in such a nasty way that it offended me an open minded inshape male. And for those who argue that it's the character's attitude and not her weight that made her the bad guy then why make her fat in the first place. And why have so many nasty fat jokes.The movie was offensive on other levels too. The racial humor wasn't funny. There are some lines with attempts at humor that really go too far. Many of you who have seen it will understand what I mean. And those who haven't I hope you don't support this film out of curiosity. Please wait for cable. There is nothing in this that you can't wait to see.I heard that it was Eddie Murphy's brother who came up with this idea. If EM did this as a favor to his brother he could have done his brother and himself a bigger favor by bringing Charlie in on a better project and tossing this script.On the one positive note Eddie Murphy does put his all into these characters as always. His job as Norbit gets lost in the low class low level comedy. Even though I just saw the film I had to really remember that his performance as Norbit was decent. All I can think about is how offended I was and how thoroughly depressed an overweight woman sitting at the end of my row looked throughout most of the film she left before I did.".

Most obviously every fat gag in the book was used. Eddie Murphy plays an overweight woman who is ugly and evil and every nasty thing you can think to say about her is said. To make it worse the leading lady is Thandie Newton who is extremely thin which only goes to further emphasize the other extreme.Maybe Eddie Murphy thought he could get away with this because he shows in The Nutty Professor how an overweight man can get the girl. But really that just shows the extreme double standard that remains when it comes to overweight men versus women.Now I'm a realist and I know that the double standard is not Eddie Murphy's fault. Still he plays on it here in such a nasty way that it offended me an open minded inshape male. And for those who argue that it's the character's attitude and not her weight that made her the bad guy then why make her fat in the first place. And why have so many nasty fat jokes.The movie was offensive on other levels too. The racial humor wasn't funny. There are some lines with attempts at humor that really go too far. Many of you who have seen it will understand what I mean. And those who haven't I hope you don't support this film out of curiosity. Please wait for cable. There is nothing in this that you can't wait to see.I heard that it was Eddie Murphy's brother who came up with this idea. If EM did this as a favor to his brother he could have done his brother and himself a bigger favor by bringing Charlie in on a better project and tossing this script.On the one positive note Eddie Murphy does put his all into these characters as always. His job as Norbit gets lost in the low class low level comedy. Even though I just saw the film I had to really remember that his performance as Norbit was decent. All I can think about is how offended I was and how thoroughly depressed an overweight woman sitting at the end of my row looked throughout most of the film she left before I did.";

What strikes me about Bardot's powerful sexuality is that cinema really hadn't seen anything like it before she came around.  The closest example I can think of in American film might be Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not but even that misses the mark. Bardot was not only a beautiful woman but she had a fun mischievous and freedomloving spirit and a fiery mind lurking around behind her sometimes poorly written characters and these things make her even more attractive. Plus she had a great voice.  Which is why I was stunned to see a trailer for Et Dieu... cra la femme dubbed into English at the end of the subtitled version.  The woman doing Bardot's voice sounded awful and so much of Brigitte's sexuality was lost. Imagine Bacall telling Bogie You know how to whistle don't you Steve? in a squeaky highpitched voice. Would she be as sexy?  I don't think so.  Yet people watching the dubbed version of this film are getting something similar.  As far as the film itself goes most everything has already been said in other comments.  Bardot does a great job as Juliette  who else could have done the role so well?  and Jurgens was quite good as Eric Carradine.  The setting is luscious and fits perfectly with Bardot's character and the overall mood of the tale.  The music is excellent from the title sequence at the beginning through the dance scene at the end.  The story can be cliched at times and there are definitely machista elements.  But it's not a bad story either with good tension created between the brothers.  The fight sequences as someone else mentioned are laughable and poorly done.  But it doesn't really matter.  It's Bardot's show all the way  from her nude Cinemascope sunbathing shot that opens the film with the witty dialog between her and Jurgens to her erotic dance that serves as the climax of the story.  Along the way we get several nice scenes that show her broader persona including the one where she sets the bird and rabbit free in the field and the scene in the bookstore with the woman from the orphanage. But for the sake of Dieu don't see this movie dubbed.".

In this film she plays an 18yearold named Juliette who marries younger brother Michel JeanLouis Trintignant to spite older brother Antoine all the while being pursued by the wealthy middleaged Carradine Curt Jurgens. It is easy to see why BB proved so popular in this film. She is indeed very beautiful and writerdirectorhusband Roger Vadim shows her off to good effect. OK to address the thought uppermost in the minds of my fellow allAmerican redblooded pigdogs we get to see BB in all manner of formfitting outfits sorry no nude scenes or swimwear seducing Antoine whilst laying in the surf teasing behind sheets and under blankets and most impressively doing a frenzied mambo. I dwell on BB's physique because really it is what the film is all about. Personalitywise and characterwise Juliette is a fairly tiresome repugnant and conscienceless creature. But physically...ooh la la! No wonder Carradine says that she was born to destroy men! The film also boasts location filming in San Tropez a town that here looks nice and quaint if surprisingly rundown. The DVD itself is mighty fine with an impressive widescreen image crisp color and adequate subtitling. Men pair this movie one night with the 1935 Marlene Dietrich vehicle The Devil Is A Woman and you just might give up on females for good!".

	schema:reviewBody "Et Dieu... crea la femme is Brigitte Bardot's breakout film. She explodes on the screen overwhelming the audience the male audience by sure. I bet that women as well are shocked by the thought that such a rivalbomb can exist. The movie itself have always been underrated. It was a scandal at the epoch and we can easily see why. Actually the erotic atmosphere created by BB in Et Dieu... crea la femme is amazing even for today standards immensely superior to that of current movies in my personal opinion. At any rate the scandal made the movie be automatically considered bad needless to say people went crazy to see it. Curiously enough a dozen of years later several ugly movies were automatically considered good by the critics because of the scandal they raised! Now that our modern eyes no longer see the scandal we may judge Et Dieu... crea la femme a nice film made VERY special by Brigitte Bardot's presence. The stunning locations of a still tourismfree Cote d'Azur are beautifully photographed. The story is interesting and entertaining. Melodrama is systematically avoided. The script contains a good deal of typical French wit sharp cynical but with a melancholic subtext. A couple of instances. The mature gentleman Eric Carradine trying to justify Juliete's bad behavior I am the only one to be guilty of that and the old woman Don't delude yourself sir.... Again Carradine I fell in love with a young girl and I gave money for her to marry another man. How do you call it? and a friend I call it wisdom.Bardot brilliantly plays Juliete a remarkably interesting character. Probably more than her free and mindless attitude toward love affairs Juliete's true personality may be described as anarchist selfishness. She doesn't give a damn for others. She just does everything she wants not caring people's opinions prejudices or feelings. She loves animals though. A further point of interest is that according to her own autobiography BB's personality has some in common with that of Juliete's. I don't comment Brigitte's sexappeal. Words are not enough just look at her and enjoy. The life at the village on the sea and the various other characters are described with accuracy. Jurgens Trintignant and the remainder of the cast work well.The cultscene of the movie is Juliete's Mambo dance. Here we understand what Europeans of the 1950s thought to be a torrid scene. We also see that they were right!Seeing the movie many are displeased that seemingly a dose of heavy slaps turns the wild Juliete into a devoted spouse. That looks machist ideology. Well to begin with to beat guilty women is just a realistic and predictable behavior in the low class environment of a village of fishermen in the 1950s. But above all do you think JulieteBrigitte tamed by few hits? Come on! She accepts the slaps only because in that very moment she has thought it good to take them. But who knows the future? Believe me Juliete is far from being tamed and the end of the film by no means coincides with the end of the story... In spite of possible criticism I like Et Dieu... crea la femme. Right or wrong this film has a relevant place in the history of cinema.".

However she is no femme fatale and only a tender teenager who cannot be blamed for having been born so pretty charming and physically well shaped and who sometimes appears almost like a defenceless child. The story involves not the classical triangle but a quadrilateral instead whose vertices are besides Juliette herself her young husband his brother and the rich middle aged businessman who covets her since the beginning. The end of the story is somewhat conventional but acceptable anyway. This movie was received like a bomb in the movie world shaking some moral canons and shocking a lot people although by today's patterns it can be judged as rather innocent.

She is told that she is going to be sent back to the orphanage but Juliette has an older admirer named Eric Carradine Curd Jurgens who is a rich developer and he wants to buy a local shipyard to build a casino. He convinces Michel Tardieu JeanLouis Trintignant to get Juliette to marry him even though she is very much in love with his brother Antoine Christian Marquand.SPOILER ALERTMichel and Juliette get married and she does learn to love him as he does but she still can't help but to flirt with Antoine and this puts friction between them. Finally one day Antoine and Juliette are alone and they make love and when word spreads everyone tries to convince Michel to get her to leave but he doesn't want her to go. Juliette has found someone that is willing to put up with her wild nature despite the fact that even she thinks it's better to leave.This film was directed by Roger Vadim who was married to Bardot at the time and even with the story being simple he knew exactly how to showcase his wife as a sex object since this was a side of her that he was familiar with. This is not a great thought provoking film or story but it's the perfect vehicle for Bardot to star in. There is no film without her and if you look at the type of shots used you'll notice the lack of closeups as the camera seems positioned at a good distance away from a voyeurs point of view. The performances by the male actors seem a bit stiff but a veteran like Jurgens comes out the best and an actor with his talent can actually get away with lines like That girl is made to destroy men. But I do disagree with critics that say Bardot just prances about like a brat and the scene towards the end of the film after she has just cheated on her husband shows her character at real odds with herself but lacks the maturity and self esteem to do anything about it. Vadim captures the colors of St. Tropez beautifully and this is a very colorful film to view. Not only do the colors of the area appear brightly but the blushing fleshtones of Bardot are equally showcased. The opening shot of the film shows a nude Bardot sunbathing and it helps set the mood which is carried through until the very end. While Vadim's marriage to Bardot was dwindling down this film started her on her journey as one of the most famous stars in cinema.".

Errol Flynn's legendarily awful Cuban Rebel Girls which resembles a home movie more than a film has better fight scenes.  In fact I personally am but a communitytheatre actor and even I can fake giving and receiving punches better than Vadim's performers! Two things puzzle me  Why did the people who meticulously restored the film for DVD not upgrade the sound effects to at least partially fix these absurd scenes?

Monsieur Carradine a GermanCurd Jrgens is an older gentleman who flirts with Juliette the beautiful Brigitte Bardot a French Audrey Hepburn. His goal to build a casino. Hers?well we're not quite sure. To live a carefree life. Here comes the heart of the filmwhat is her motive? What makes her happiest? Is it pursuing or being pursued? How innocent is Julietteand how deeply can we look into her character? Juliette is a nave but driven. She must be aware of her stunning beauty. She bikes around town barefoot and holds a steady but boring job as a bookseller. Eighteen she lives with a foster family on the condition that she holds down her job and behaves. A spontaneous young girl Juliette has trouble sitting down or doing anything steadily. But she takes care of a rabbit thoughtfully named Socrates. She decides to release Socrates into nature but when he scampers off she has a change of heart and runs right after him. While she moves from one man to another in the space of an hour she resents overhearing Antoine's Christian Marquand's flippant onenightstand remark. Yet Juliettewho in no ambiguity represents the forbidden fruit perhaps temptation itselfends up hitched with Antoine's brother Michel JeanLouis Trintignant. But when Bardot takes off on a sailboat and the engine catches fire symbolizing Bardot's nascent marriage going up in smoke Antoine rescues and drags Bardot ashore. They make love on the beach offscreen of course. But is Bardot sheepishly immature or an adulteress? The crux of the plot is that Carradine wants to build a casino. He has acquired all the land except for a property on the water. Enter the Tardieu clan. The mother is a stubborn widow who wants to keep the family businessshipbuildingintact. Antoine is a pragmatist and thinks now is the time to cash in. And the other two brothersChristian the younger Michel the middleare indifferent. But the plot is thin. The real attraction here is the hypnotic presence of Bardot.It is a mystery how this film passed the French censors in 1956. While mild by today's standards the film does tastefully leave most of Bardot's bits up to the imagination. But audiences' reaction? Think Elvis' pelvis.So Bardot is a thrill to watch on screen. A mustwatch scene towards the end be prepared the film drags on is with Juliette intoxicated dancing uncontrollably to an AfroCuban big band in the basement of a local watering hole. Wild dynamic camera work. This film is also superb just for the breathtaking unspoiled landscape scenes of the Cote d'Azur.If the film is a retelling of the Garden of Eden then we are left to assume man has come from Bardot's rib. In fact all of the energy and spirit of  And God Created Woman radiates from her youthful vibrancy. The writers of the Cahiers du Cinma were knocked out by it and the film's dazzling quality is not lost over time. A must watch for New Wave enthusiasts or those looking for an early 400 Blows inspiration.".

She bikes around town barefoot and holds a steady but boring job as a bookseller. Eighteen she lives with a foster family on the condition that she holds down her job and behaves. A spontaneous young girl Juliette has trouble sitting down or doing anything steadily. But she takes care of a rabbit thoughtfully named Socrates. She decides to release Socrates into nature but when he scampers off she has a change of heart and runs right after him. While she moves from one man to another in the space of an hour she resents overhearing Antoine's Christian Marquand's flippant onenightstand remark. Yet Juliettewho in no ambiguity represents the forbidden fruit perhaps temptation itselfends up hitched with Antoine's brother Michel JeanLouis Trintignant. But when Bardot takes off on a sailboat and the engine catches fire symbolizing Bardot's nascent marriage going up in smoke Antoine rescues and drags Bardot ashore. They make love on the beach offscreen of course. But is Bardot sheepishly immature or an adulteress? The crux of the plot is that Carradine wants to build a casino. He has acquired all the land except for a property on the water. Enter the Tardieu clan. The mother is a stubborn widow who wants to keep the family businessshipbuildingintact. Antoine is a pragmatist and thinks now is the time to cash in. And the other two brothersChristian the younger Michel the middleare indifferent. But the plot is thin. The real attraction here is the hypnotic presence of Bardot.It is a mystery how this film passed the French censors in 1956. While mild by today's standards the film does tastefully leave most of Bardot's bits up to the imagination. But audiences' reaction? Think Elvis' pelvis.So Bardot is a thrill to watch on screen. A mustwatch scene towards the end be prepared the film drags on is with Juliette intoxicated dancing uncontrollably to an AfroCuban big band in the basement of a local watering hole. Wild dynamic camera work. This film is also superb just for the breathtaking unspoiled landscape scenes of the Cote d'Azur.If the film is a retelling of the Garden of Eden then we are left to assume man has come from Bardot's rib. In fact all of the energy and spirit of  And God Created Woman radiates from her youthful vibrancy. The writers of the Cahiers du Cinma were knocked out by it and the film's dazzling quality is not lost over time. A must watch for New Wave enthusiasts or those looking for an early 400 Blows inspiration.";

Anyway what he wanted to tell with this picture was his own story in which Bardot was at this moment the main character. Carradine Jrgens was i suspect Vadim himself. Bardot is liberal does whatever she wants out of innocence and joy.

He is innocent in all senses before he gets there. But he quickly leans the code of the title.Constance Cummins isn't given much as Huston's daughter but she is appealing. However Boris Karloff gives one of his very finest performances as a tough but decent prisoner. Of course of course he is fine in Frankenstein. And he is wildly brilliant in Lured many years later. Here he gives a solid unadorned moving performance.Clark Marshall a name I do not recognize is also fine. He plays a sniveling conniving inmate.

D.A. Mark Brady is not a man without compassion. He even states how were he the defense attorney he would get the boy off without serving a day. As a result he sends him up for manslaughter rather than murder. However that is still ten years and six years into the sentence Graham is a man who is losing hope and his sanity.In an odd twist of fate D.A. Mark Brady becomes warden of the prison a place inhabited by many of the men he helped convict. The prison doctor comes to Brady with a request  let Graham be Brady's private driver for awhile to get him out of the prison factory. Brady agrees. A few short months later and Graham is beginning to have a new lease in life. Plus there is a complication  he is falling in love with Brady's daughter. However an event soon occurs at the prison that threatens Graham's hope for a better future.As for the lessons unlearned the one quirky thing about this film is how D.A. turned prison warden Brady keeps saying you've go to take things how they break never realizing that in many cases  exhibit A being the case of inmate Robert Graham  Brady is in total control of how things break in particular the fact that Robert Graham a basically square kid is an inmate in the first place. However at least Brady is not a hypocrite since he seems to be willing to take the good with the bad in his own life as well. A pretty complex character for an early 30's film.Of course all classic movie fans are familiar with Walter Huston and his many abilities and roles. However most people will not have heard of Philip Holmes. Partly this is because his early successes in film did not lead to better things as the 1930's progressed and the rest of the reason is that many of his early successes occurred at Paramount whose early films have been largely unseen for decades. This is worth checking out. The screenplay was nominated for an Oscar and the performances are quite good.".

But he does a terrific job. Expectedly good performance from Walter Huston arguably Hollywood's best actor in the early talkies. Also features Boris Karloff in one of his best preFrankenstein roles as a vengeful inmate who hates squealers.Great early Howard Hawks crime drama. Nice Hawksian banter and overlapping dialogue particularly in the early scenes with reporters. Remade twice as Penitentiary in 1938 and Convicted in 1950.

Unfortunately he hits the other guy with a bottle and he soon dies. The district attorney Walter Huston feels a bit sorry for the guy since he isn't criminallyorientedjust some guy who made a very bad choice. But he does his job and convicts Holmessending him to prison for 20 years which does seem excessive. Later the D.A. becomes the warden at the same prison where this young guy has been for six years and Huston feels sorry for himand wants to help him make parole. However before he can do this there is a murder and Holmes may have witnessed it. And since the code of prison is that you NEVER squeal Holmes' refusal to talk puts his freedom in jeopardy. If he talks he could soon be a free manbut he could also be killed just like that dirty squealer! To make things harder for Huston his daughter has fallen in love with Holmes and she pressures him to act.The film has a lot going for it. Its style is simple tough straightforward and effective. It also doesn't hurt that there is a very nice supporting performance by Boris Karloffin one of his best nonhorror roles of his career. He's particularly good at the finale. Overall it's one of the best prison films I've seenwith only a very few select films such as The Shawshank Redemption and Brute Force coming to mind that are better.".

	schema:reviewBody "103 The Criminal Code 1931  released 1331 viewed 62508.DOUG Howard Hawks was no mere studio director looking at his credits he appears to have made at least one great entry in every genre in circulation during the studio era including this provocative look at the prison system in the 1930's. It's definitely a movie of its time a product of the early sound era so there's almost no music the bad guys wield Tommy Guns references crop up to the Great Depression WWI and the rise of organized crime. The standouts are Walter Huston as a nononsense DAturned prison warden Philips Holms as the man wrongly convicted and sent to prison and Boris Karloff as a sadistic convict with a score to settle. Huston easily gives the best performance here with Karloff sneering and growling and chewing scenery while looking really big and scary. Holms our wouldbe hero spends most of the movie looking rather docile and unmemorable while either Huston or Karloff tower over him. I'm hoping for some kind of Howard Hawks DVD box set that would include this movie along with The Crowd Roars.KEVIN This film would've opened 1931 just ahead of Little Caesar. This year morals and ideals are tested to their limits as director Howard Hawks tackles the gritty prison drama. This film is definitely better than The Big House which is campy by comparison. Walter Huston is very good as expected playing a former district attorney who is appointed as the new warden of a maximum security prison. It is never explained why a city District Attorney has been demoted to a prison warden and Huston's performance gives the sense that the character doesn't really consider it a demotion. Portraying the sympathetic face of the wronged convict Phillip Holmes does fine job of selling his character's dilemma although I had a hard time understanding why Graham clings so much to the code of the inmates when letting that go and confessing what he witnessed would allow him to go free. I didn't believe that what he was doing was right but I was convinced that he believed it. Constance Cummings was good too although I think more could've been done with her character. I really wanted to see her turn Graham around and bring him all the way back to the land of truth and morals. And of course I have to mention the excellently creepy Boris Karloff whose character comes through as the lead heartless scumbag. By the way Huston's character does a move here that we would see again in Gabriel Over the White House when he strolls through a crowd of people that despise him without getting a scratch or batting an eyelash. SPOILER I was disappointed with the climax. Graham doesn't confess but he still manages to come through clean. It seemed like a missed opportunity.END SPOILER.Last film viewed Monte Carlo 1930. Last film chronologically Morocco 1930. Next film viewed The Smiling Lieutenant 1931. Next film chronologically Little Caesar 1931.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although when Howard Hawks died in 1977 his reputation was described as legendary when he was actually making movies he was often referred to as a good all round director specialising in men's movies ie The Dawn Patrol and Red River. The Criminal Code is one of his lesser known films maybe because he was uncredited as director. It is simply a superlative film that is dominated by powerhouse performances by Walter Huston Phillips Holmes and Boris Karloff. Holmes acting was occasionally flat in films but when he was given the right role he was fantastic as he definitely was here. The Criminal Code which opened on Broadway in 1929 and lasted a very respectable 179 performances was another acting honor for Walter Huston. He plays Mark Brady a wiley District Attorney who finds himself Warden of the State Prison populated by many of the men who he had sent up. One of these is Robert Graham sent to prison for 10 years for manslaughter only because Brady feels compassion for Robert do they ever call you Bob knowing he killed in self defence.After six years Robert is at breaking point  he is desperate to experience freedom and when his cell mate talks of escape Robert wants to go with him. When Adams becomes Warden on the doctor's advice that he sees something fine in Robert Adams takes him out of the jute mill and puts him to work as a chauffeur. Within three months with the help of Mary Constance Cummings the Warden's daughter Robert is mended. The escape still goes ahead without Robert but is thwarted  thanks to a stool pigeon Runch Clark Marshall. When Runch is killed the officers and Warden try to break Robert who saw the murder but he is standing by the criminal code  not the book that happens to be Adam's bible but the code of the criminal that he will not rat on his comrades.I felt that Walter Huston's best scenes were  1. when he was interviewing Robert's dance partner Mary Doran and with a few yeahs and you don't say strips off her innocent facade to expose her as the floozie she is. 2. On his first day braves a yammering from the hostile men to walk into the prison yard. Boris Karloff seemed to have more a variety of roles in the early 30s. Here he plays a menacing but essentially decent criminal albeit with a grudge who from the first tries to help Bob. An unintentionally funny scene occurs when he is serving tea to Mary's aunt?. She says something about not creeping up on her like that and he replies Sorry Madam in his best Frankenstein's Monster voice. Apparently James Whale saw Boris Karloff in The Criminal Code and thought he would be the perfect Monster!!! Constance Cummings was excellent in her first film even though the film essentially belonged to the three male stars. She played her role in a very understated way and she was noticed.Highly Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "DA Brady sends young Graham to prison unjustly and must redeem himself once he becomes the prison's warden.The credits indicate icon Howard Hawks as the director IMDb uncharacteristically lists no one while Hawks' biosite states he's the uncredited helmsman. I include this rather puzzling movie pedigree because I see very little of Hawks' characteristic style on screen. He may well have been adjusting to the new factor of sound as others point out but whatever the reason the screenplay could have been filmed by any number of solid Hollywood craftsmen. The movie itself has been made several times over so the material is familiar. But except for Huston's dynamic performance and Karloff's formidable presence there's not much to recommend beyond the story itself. The prison yard scenes are riveting with their marching phalanxes of inmates. Sort of like a nonmusical Busby Berkeley. I also like that early scene where DA Brady Huston strips away shady lady Gertie's thin faade of respectability. To me its spirited air bespeaks Hawks' guiding hand as does Brady's surprisingly intense grilling of Graham. However what should be a highlight Ned's Karloff revenge killing of the squealer is unnecessarily downplayed for this preCode period.Note how we're led to respect the inmates' code of conduct even though they are convicted criminals. Both the law and the inmates have their respective codes but more importantly the codes may well be linked by a common sense of justice. When for example those codes are broken by the squealer on one hand and by head guard Gleason on the other we're led to sympathize with the respective acts of retribution bloody though they undoubtedly are. And since both acts are carried out by the hulking Ned he becomes something of an avenging angel despite his gruesome appearance. It's the ambiguities of the two codes united perhaps by a common sense of justice that suggests an interesting subtext to the story.Anyway in my little book this is a Walter Huston showcase proving again that an actor of less than handsome appearance could carry a Hollywood movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Criminal Code The 1931  out of 4Terrific acting highlights this precode prisondrama about an overbearing D.A. Walter Huston who sidelines an innocent man Phillips Holmes into prison where he learns the criminal code way of doing things. The D.A. eventually becomes the prison warden where he runs into contact with many of the men he sent away including the innocent one who will once again find himself at the wrong place during the wrong time. There's no question this Columbia film was made to cash in on the previous years THE BIG HOUSE but that doesn't mean we get a watereddown copy. Instead director Hawks takes a pretty simple storyline and adds various dimensions simply by showing the stuff in a raw and realistic detail. THE BIG HOUSE is certainly a classic but to me this is the better film of the two. What makes this film work so well are some amazing performances with Huston leading the way. There was no one in Hollywood better for a role like this and God knows that Huston played his fair share of hottempered my way only type of characters. He brings a lot of energy to the role and manages to make the character very memorable with a performance that many would copy in the future. Another major plus is the supporting performance of Boris Karloff who pretty much steals the film. Karloff has an uncanny and natural performance that brings a certain rawness as well as a coldness that is a real joy to watch. He's the type of bad guy here you just want to love. Constance Cummings plays Huston's daughter and she's pretty good even though the screenplay offers her very little except to be a love interest for Holmes. As for Holmes I think he gives a good performance but I'd say he's several notches below both Huston and Karloff. Again it's a fine performance but at the same time if they had someone on the same level as the other two men the film might have been even better. Hawks makes the film as realistic and as raw as he can which I guess you could say was a trademark during this early portion of his career. I think the film gets off to a somewhat slow start but picks up at the twentyminute mark and pretty much sails home. The final thirtyminutes are pure Hawks magic and are the most powerful of these early prison films.".

Every performance is dead on with moments of tension that are brilliantly scripted. It gets even grittier than MGM's hit prison movie The Big House. For a film made by B studio Columbia before they moved to near the top this is a total classic of the crime drama genre giving an indication of what film noir would look like more than a decade later.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Criminal Code explores the issue of turning a normal person who made a mistake into a criminal through time spent in prison and ends up abiding by the criminal code itself. The same subject matter is also explored in the movie Caged made 19 later nothing seems to change. Robert Graham Phillip Homles is a sheltered pretty boy who got a rotten break similar to Robert Montgomery in The Big House. However unlike Montgomery in The Big House Graham is put in a cell with two guys including Boris Karloff's Galloway who look out for him. Although you do have to suspend your disbelief a bit over the movie fast forwarding six years and Graham not being remotely criminalised within that time. Among the film's examination of the American legal and penal system Walter Huston explains how it would be possible for someone to get off the hook for a crime such as manslaughter A year's delay a new trial the witnesses would fade away they always do the whole mess would get cold the papers would have something else to yap about. I'd get him off he'd never serve a day. Great thought provoking stuff.Walter Huston plays the warden of the unnamed prison. He is stern but fair and a real Yes sir! type as evident from his first appearance with the manner in which he addresses a female witness Never mind that pull down the shade. The man is one lightningfast talker who can interrogate like a boss but his greatest moment of badassery comes from the scene in which he goes into the prison yard to confront protesting yammering prisoners face to face without any guards. Just look at the way he walks into the yard and lights up a cigar. As he approaches the prisoners the yammering stops and they don't lay a hand on him. Simply put this guy is badass. Perhaps unrealistically so but that's why we have movies.The Criminal Code was Boris Karloff's first significant screen role in the part of Galloway. With his dominating tall lanky figure he steals the show his monologue on why's he's in the slammer with the shadows across his face is hairraising stuff. Galloway has a vengeance with a guard named Gleason which gives the film some dark comic relief such as the two awkwardly passing each other on the stairs to Karloff's recurring use of the lines I don't like you and I got an appointment with you. Likewise the other memorable cast member albeit in a very brief role is Andy Devine who is very hard to miss with that highly distinctive voice of his.The Criminal Code uses the same set created for MGM's The Big House released the year before. With its more intricate cinematography the film doesn't capture the sense of claustrophobia seen in The Big House but still captures the mundanity of prison life. As an early talkie there is no music present in The Criminal Code but rather the sound of prisoners marching along with various other sound effects are just as effective as any music score could be.The Criminal Code is also host to one of the most shocking moments in precode cinema and was even featured in Karloff film Targets from 1968. When Galloway chases a squealer into a room while yammering is going on in the background from the prison yard Galloway walks into the room with the squealer cornered as he slowly closes the door as the squealer looks on in terror. What happens next is up to the viewer's imagination.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie as a kid when I was about 10 or 11 yrs old and it was always my favorite movie because of Emily Lloyd's Madonnaesque style and her bad girl attitude in this film . At the time I had no idea who Peter Falk or Emily Lloyd were but have since learned they are both great actors. I saw Wish You Were Here with Emily LLoyd years later after seeing Cookie. I had a huge crush on Adrian Pasdar after this movie also didn't know who he was or how great of an actor he was until years later either. The Kylie Minogue song Lucky in Love that plays at the end of the movie has stuck in my head for years and I still love it to this day. FYI Trivia I just read on Wikipedia that supposedly Emily LLoyd and Peter Falk did not get along while filming this movie and he reportedly slapped her because he got frustrated with her. I also had no idea Emily LLoyd was English. Every movie I ever saw her in she always seemed to pull off a really good American accent.".

Cookie is a wild rebellious teen. Her mother Lenore Dianne Wiest is the secret mistress of imprisoned gangster and her father Dominick Capisco. He's getting paroled and forces Cookie to get a mob job. She eventually becomes his driver. Bunny Brenda Vaccaro is his unhappily mobmarriage wife. He wants his money and get out of the business but his partner Carmine Michael V. Gazzo has squeezed him out. U.S. Attorney Richie Segretto Bob Gunton has set his sights on Dominick mistakenly assumes him to have returned as a mob boss.This is directed by Susan Seidelman and written by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen. This female group has created a mob movie with a few quirks little tension and even fewer surprises. It's led by two mannered performances from rebellious Emily Lloyd and old tough guy Peter Falk. I like both actors but the movie is rather forgettable. It's not as quirky or funny as it thinks it is. The writing really doesn't have an edge. It has a few action scenes but the intensity is not terribly high. There are better mob comedies elsewhere.".

I only sat through this because I will watch ANY film starring Peter Falk but the picture still stinks like if someone had saved that wrapped up package of fish from THE GODFATHER.

So don't you ever make the same mistake that I did and let the names of Peter Falk Jerry Lewis or even Nora Ephron fool you and lead you to a wrong picture ! It's very average and too bad as long as we speak about Adrian Pasdar with his everlasting coldness moreover memorably strange eyebrows this time. Plus Emily Lloyd whom actually looked like she's copying Madonna with the same outfits the same awful acting however without a millimeter of her sexuality ! Not to mention how Jerry Lewis seemed totally wasted I felt bad that there were some potentials in here and some places to make good comic ironies but the whole thing was just the smart hoax and the beginning of a peaceful natural relationship between one father and his daughter yet even this as a drama wasn't that good at all so the love story between Cookie and Mr. eyebrows from hell ! I want to know why they didn't call it  The Return of Cookie's Father Cookie  Father or Cookie  Father Meet A Freak Named Vito ! Actually she wasn't that main character because of some reasons on the top of them is such a script which interested in a lot of things except Cookie herself ! The charming Peter Falk did a great job that made the movie sort of watchable. So as a low budget crime movie from the good old 1980s with the lesser amount of blood and cursing you may deem it fine as long as you forget all about some things like Cookie...The personality and the actress. So watch it and forget about it !.. And I do mean it literally !Inflated P.S  They wrote on the poster so boldly I suppose !  A Delicious New Comedy !!? Sure at the time it was new. But what about Comedy and DELICIOUS ??!!".

Eventually Pia is forgotten about in the movie as it becomes angled toward her family issues. 3. the family issues are SO stupid. her dad comes back from jail after about 15 years and realizes he no longer is big and important to the MAFIA scene any more. how stupid... the father is horribly portrait and is just all around stupid not funny at all. 4. after cookie starts working for father she meet vito an incredibly sexy guy with whom i now love and though cookie keeps messing up vito and her eventually end up together. 5. this is what makes this a fairly good movie... at the end where they fake the father's death cookie wakes up with vito and a song comes in. it is the song should be so lucky by kylie minogue my anthem! and really the soundtrack is fairly good so i do recommend seeing this movie its a solid 7 of 110.".

He is very good looking and has talent a good deal of talent even though in these type of stereotypical comedies it is difficult to see.Adrien Pasdar can presently be seen as the D.A in the CBS drama Judging Amy which is a much better example of his talent and depth. But Adrien Pasdar aside this is a good comedy. The definitive word here is COMEDY. Don't watch this movie looking for a deeply moving world changing experience because you aren't going to find it. Watch instead for a fondness of Peter Falk humor and enjoy the story of his illegitimate daughter Cookie. Emily Loyd is quite possibly the perfect choice for the role of Cookie having never seen her before myself it made it even easier for me to believe she truly was a Brooklyn toughchick who's estranged and imprisoned father was a gangster known on the street as Dapper Dino.At first she's a bit off putting for one it was the 80's and the wardrobe chosen for her is made to fit that era and age of the character. But it is still garish and goofy at times. One example the white dress that she wears to the mafia Christmas partywhat was that all about? I suppose they were trying to show her immaturity and to make her final outfitwhich is a major improvementbe all the more attractive and satisfying. The actress Emily Loyd is not a raving beauty which works out for the best because I couldn't see the character Cookie being model gorgeous but there are several unique elements to her features that give her a strange sort of beauty that is lovely nonetheless. The character Vito Adrien Pasdar notices this about Cookie the first time he sees her. Vito is a character I think you'll enjoy. He is that bad boy with a good heart type that strikes a chord in many American women's hearts. I enjoyed the romance element between Vito and Cookie the most second only to the hilarious events that occur between she and her father throughout the film. There are some things that could have made this film better but few films are perfect so why split hairs? Enjoy the movie for what it is an 80's comedyromance with the handsome and pleasing Adrien Pasdar...shame he's married.".

Actually although this documentary tells about 'military cooking' it manages to put it into a historical. at the same time very human context.The documentary starts with details on cooks and cooking in the German and Russian armies during the Second World War. It visit Hungarian military cooks who happened to witness Soviet occupation in 1956 then continues with two French military cooks with different viewpoints on the Algerian occupation then it visits Czechoslovakia in 1968 again during the Soviet Occupation. The next stop is Yugoslavia but then we have an interesting guest the cook of Josip Bros Tito. Afterwards we witness the disintegration of the same country through two different eyes  cooks. There is an epilogue as well of which I wouldn't give any details.To be honest such a topic can be handled in a wide scope ranging from extremely boring to extremely loose. I think Peter Kerekes was concerned enough about that so that he always yearns for a discourse. The other that he is good at is although the historical venues I mentioned above are mostly eclectic he tried to catch a common pattern by asking 'thick' questions about the similarities in military orders and recipes about war about occupation and collaborators about killing. Nevertheless humour is always there.One last note in the movie you'll watch animals getting killed in various ways for their meat. These are deeply disturbing scenes but I think as a vegetarian any meat eater should be disturbed.".

It's a difficult idea to be grasped for people who live in wealthy societies where nothing much happens and the biggest problems are having more money than you already have and what to do on Saturday night. But Forman manages to show you how you can be powerless and doomed when history moves fasttoo fast. The real protagonist of the story is not the painter but the former Dominican priest whose life is totally changedand ultimately destroyedby the big historical events the French Revolution the French invasion of Spain the English invasion of Spain the Restoration. The same may be said for the other characters in the story. Goya is there as a witness and as the symbolic figure of the artist who manages to create something even out of utter destruction. One could say that Goya's Ghosts are exactly those people and events Goya witnessed and can't get rid of so that he has to turn them into drawings and paintings but the term ghost also refers to what individuals are like in those moments when everything is changing and moving towards God knows what goal. The priest and the young girl and all the other people in the story are just pawns of history who strut and fret on the stage and then disappear. Ghosts because they can be annihilated in any moment. It's a sad truth but it's truth notwithstanding Hollywood's mythologies of superheroes that can win against all odds. Joyce said that history is a nightmare one tries to wake up from Forman showed us the nightmare and the last nightmarish scene of this movie is one of those you can't forget.".

That's a real flaw but if you can get past that there's a great film waiting to be seen. I found I forgot all about it after the first 10 minutes. The critics just don't get this film. A lot of regular people seem to miss it too. They want a film with a typical leading role. They want their morality tales which this certainly IS delivered in easy shades of Black and White... no gray. They don't understand films where the title character is primarily an Observer. Sometimes that CAN be dissatisfying but here the Observer is a genuine genius. Some people want him to be a moral giant but he's not he's simply an observer who has actualized the doctor's oath First do no harm. This is a brilliant story and a morally complex one too. There are some parallels to America in Iraq though that is not the primary goal. This story illuminates the folly of any regime liberal or conservative as each picks its friends and foes taking 180 degree turns from whoever was last in power. Javier Bardem gives an incredibly canny performance! Natalie Portman is totally unsentimental and totally committed to her multiple roles just great! Stellan Skarsgard threw me off at first with the sound of his voice but builds a performance of power and truth in spite of it. Randy Quaid was a small revelation. And of course the film looks and sounds spectacular with it's numerous and detailed textures compositions and sounds. If you want to think if you like having pat assumptions challenged if you love people and history and art see it!".

Goya and uswitness the folly of the Spanish royal court the murderous sadistic perversion of the Catholic Church the cruel inhumane madness of the Napoleonic War along with the sensuality and beauty of life passing. This is the film's main focus to let us experience the time and place as if seen through Francisco de Goya's eyes. As expected of a Milos Forman's film the locales the customs and the overall production replicates the Spain of the late 18th century and early 19th century with the exactitude of a court painting. The cast is also excellent. As an Inquisitor turned a Napoleon's officer Javier Bardem deserves another Oscar nomination. Stellan Skargsdar as usual does a chameleonlike transformation this time into Goya. Natalie Portman elevates herself into a higher realm of acting as the doomed beautiful Ines. And Randy Quaid steals the screen for a few seconds as the King. Milos Forman again has given us an emotionally and intellectuallychallenging portrait of a dark era and the role of art and artist. Although some of the dramatization is slightly contrived the film is compelling and moving and its vision lingers as Goya's art.".

This will probably not remain as one of the best in his career and was surrounded by a level of controversy not the least among critics who received it very differently. Yet it is certainly a film to watch.The story actually does not have Goya Stellan Skarsgrd in the center. It is rather the story of a corrupt morality policeman of the 18th century Javier Bardem imprisoning a young girl Natalie Portman on the unjust suspicion of practicing Judaism in secret. It is the story of a police state built on social injustice relying on pretended moral puritanism in order to save the system. This happens at the price of huge human suffering like the drama in the center of the story and here is the painter as a witness living the dilemma of becoming involved as a human or remaining a witness as an artist. We know what path Goya chose.I was not unhappy neither with the acting nor with the story line although it is a little bit too melodramatic and too much prone to coincidences. Forman is not so much focused on the drama or better say melodrama or even in the historical detail although he seems to be on familiar ground getting back to the period in 'Amadeus'. What he is busy with seems to be more recreating some of Goya's paintings and prints and tracing back the origin of inspiration of these masterpieces. In a way the film can be read as justification of the choice Goya made in life.".

In a short  it's a great film with bad description.What it really is about is that it doesn't matter what principles one believes in if their life is doesn't match these principles. Both inquisitors and French democrats were capable of same brutality  always of course in name of some noble idea  love freedom equality... It's not sentimental or pathetic and it doesn't try to tell you what is the only truth. It simply says that its not principles and ideas that are bad  its people. Characters are very human with many errors  but at the same time each of the characters even villains have moments when you will like them.

While some period movies are overwhelmed by the attention to period detail in this movie the background enhances and makes the movie more believable. The acting was very well performed and all the actors deserve equal mention. I would see this movie again and recommend to all. I have no doubt that this movie will garner many awards in many categories! The costumes the backdrops and scenery were bar none and worthy of many accolades.

While some period movies are overwhelmed by the attention to period detail in this movie the background enhances and makes the movie more believable. The acting was very well performed and all the actors deserve equal mention. I would see this movie again and recommend to all. I have no doubt that this movie will garner many awards in many categories! The costumes the backdrops and scenery were bar none and worthy of many accolades. The historical context is well worth mentioning. A terrific period in Spain's history that left a long and hideous scar on its glorious and eventful history.

	schema:headline " as a portrait of Goya himself it's less than satisfactory but for fans of Bunuel yes Bunuel it's worth seeing";
	schema:reviewBody "I read someone else's comment on IMDb much more adulatory than I would be for Goya's Ghosts who said that it was a masterpiece not only for Milos Forman and cowriter JeanClaude Carriere but for Luis Bunuel too. And that intrigued me even more than I was already in anticipation for the film merely before as a Forman fan. Upon seeing it I can understand the enthusiasm and had a kind of private nearly perverse pleasure in recognizing maybe too obviously on a subjective level little things that popped up when Carriere and Bunuel collaborated on some of the late master's best works. On the other hand for those not too familiar with films like the Phantom of Liberty the Milky Way or That Obscure Object of Desire Goya's Ghosts may seem like strong strange filmmaking that starts to go a little more haywire after the halfway title card 15 Years Later possibly another injoke for Un Chien Andalou fans pops up. But it's not only certain things regarding the line between true drama and surrealism that marks Forman's latest as something interesting.Matter of fact it is a flawed film notably in the casting of Stellan Skarsgaard as Goya himself. Why cast a Swedish actor who usually isn't necessarily bad in the characteractor parts he takes on in the role of one of the most decadent and ribald Spanish artists in the past 250 years of worldwide painting? Skarsgaard doesn't do too much to elevate the part outside of being the guy on the sidelines dramatically trying to not get too much into the situations at first but then soon becoming like a matchmaker in the second half when daughter drama happens between an exBrother and an exprisonerofinquisition. And yet there is perfect casting in having Barden as the Brother Lorenzo who doesn't change in how he tries to push aside any of the problems in his life that he doesn't want to deal with be it questions of real faith taking care of a certain lost woman and his illegitimate child even as he changes from man of the cloth to revolutionary in several years time. Seeing him in the first half in that black robe his eyes dark and leering of Goya and even the Church to an extent it's not wonder that he's one of the most soughtout actors of his time. And even better then that as far as conventions go he gets the truest kind of arc with his character.Then there's Natalie Portman who as probably as something of both an injokereversal of the tactic used in 'Obscure Object' with two actresses playing the same woman and a sort of disintegrationofsoul aspect that Forman might be after ambivalently embodies the crushed innocence of repressive religion. Ines is tossed into a prison following a confession whether true or not is left nicely vague that she's Jewish following a questioning of what she ate and left for more than a decade. Seeing her in this section it's clear she's lucid in her presentation of a simple characterization sweet and naive then later torn into oblivion by insanity and a near absurd desperation to find the child she birthed while in prison. When she plays the daughter it's a little more flat and pat as all we see of her is as a 14 yearold yes 14 yearold harlot. This mixedup matching of actors plus a few bits with Randy Quaid as a wellplayed pudgy king is set to a backdrop of Spain where society is merciless and without much compromise unless the regime changes which is towards one way the ultra strict Catholics or the other the flawed Napoleon revolution people. Meanwhile Goya deaf sketches away in drawings that today seem right out of graphic novels.As mentioned one may get some moments of random surprise as opposed to fully stark costume drama the first appearance of Portman's daughter played by herself is a little doozy the way the cardinal tells his choir boy to keep reading the passage even as the French soldier on horseback rides in with a decree then shoots the boy midway through the emergence of the British army going towards and swarming around a cart of 15 prostitutes left out in a field the very last scene where a cart carrying a dead man is followed by...say no more. So there is a drawback or more than one at any rate to Forman going for telling about the nature of the society around Goya than too much about Goya himself. It is a disappointment too to not get entirely aside from the 'her face haunts me from that painting' logic as to why Goya is so infatuated with Ines and her plight in the first place. There's not much to be seen into the man who drew such scandalous drawings whilst being the king's painter. What we get instead which is intriguing and involving if not totally successful a story of corruption from the 'PowersThatBe' and when it strikes at this Forman and Carriere get some good juicy entertainment. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I had hesitated so much to go to see this movie  because I thought it is a period drama and I won't like the aristocracy and I had assumed that this was a French or Spanish movie. To my surprise it is an English movie.The story is around a painter Francisco Goya played by Stellan Skarsgard during the turbulent times 17901810 when Napoleon invaded Madrid. But do not be mistaken  this is not the story of Goya. The Director Milos Forman uses painter Goya just to provide a canvas for two main characters to emergethe corrupt Brother Lorenzo played brilliantly by Javier Bardem and the innocent Ines played outstandingly by Natalie Portman.Ines after being wrongly detained by Christian church to prison is impregnated by Lorenzo who runs away and later joins hands with Napoleon to come back after 15 years as a high official to find that Ines is the mother of his child  who is now the young street prostitute. With British invading Spain Lorenzo is publicly prosecuted and the last scene shows Ines holding the hand of the dead body of Lorenzo taken out of the town in a horse cart.Hats off to Director Milos Forman remember One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus  who after 7 years of making movies took a sabbatical from his teaching career to make this movie. And what a marvelous movie he has made  worth the wait.The main plot is about the human race and its bigotry. The times are historic yet significantly apply to today's world. Javier Bardem and Natalie Portman have given their award winning performances  especially Natalie Portman plays the role of the young Ines old Ines and young prostitute daughter with such different range of getover and acting that she astonishes us with her versatility and ease.But the movie belongs  all in all to Milos Forman. As is the class of all great directors the musical score is magnificent. The nuances of undertones of each character's thoughts are presented aptly with perfect casting. Milos always entertains us with his subtle comedy  but I would call it as a black humor I published last week that I do not understand black humor of Hot Fuzz. Now after seeing this movie I can say that I now know and understand what is black humor perfectly well. If you like the movie do not miss the ecstatic painting displayed during the unveiling of last titles. They are masterly selected by the master crafts person Milos.If you are movie fan  and are philosophical doubter tribute to my Guru Andreas Hensel  who is one of everything  please go and see this wonderful movie.Stars 8 out of 10".

Yet what it lacked was any punch. No real statement or continuity came forth by the time the credits rolled up.The film's premise of an exploration of Spain before its invasion and subsequent religious reversals and recantions is just lacking completely in continuity. No character is really explored deeply Forman changes focus far too often. Take the sudden jump of 15 years midway through the film. Most characters are done away with completely and all others are beyond recognition except the main protagonist the painter Goya. Even he is not really that interesting. He paints paintings. For different people. Natalie Portman's character serves as obvious pathos at the beginning then her character turns into a demented and ruined savage. Forman never allows any identification or any centre of interest establish itself. One moment the film seems to be dealing with religious fanaticism other times with hypocrisy and social upheaval other times with war.The film is simply too disjointed the characters mostly dull and the plot far too linear for this to be ranked amongst Forman's masterpieces. It spends too much time weaving around aimlessly with any apparent focus or goal. It seems Forman wanted to portray a period different any specific purpose or moral lesson  which is what he has achieved although really the cultural observations are equally diluted. Overall a boring and plain film lacking intent or artistic endeavour it is like Goya himself  nondescript and a little on the plain side.".

	schema:reviewBody "With a title like that you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter Goya. Then after half an hour you decide it is more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more latitude perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period. With lurid characterisation too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact Milos Forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic rambling mishmash that fails on all three accounts.Milos Forman who lost his Jewish father to Nazi concentration camps is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a buffoon and got away with it. Won awards for it in fact. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste of diverse repellent regimes especially Communism. He also made the equally overthetop but rather impressive One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. So at the age of 74 how does he come to offer us this mess? In Goya's Ghosts Goya is one step removed from buffoon. The main character is Brother Lorenzo passionately acted by Javier Bardem. Natalie Portman is equally vibrant as Goya's model Ines and later in the film her own daughter. The tenuous connection with Goya is that he happens to paint both of them.Lorenzo tortures and then rapes Ines who he suspects of being a Jew. Her father tortures Lorenzo. Napoleon dashes in to liberate Spain briefly. Ines gets out of the dungeon the Church has left her in and searches for her child. Goya is still painting but has gone deaf. His main preoccupation seems to be helping Ines. And so on.Historically Goya was also a historian. As Forman had sadly relinquished the idea of a biopic of Goya the painter this one fact could have been used to pull the whole film together  a large slice of history as seen by Goya. But the painter is too tangential to receive any weight. Similarly a document of the terrors of the Inquisition should be done  compared to other despotic orders throughout time the Holy See has been forgiven with barely a confession. Though one might ask if Forman is competent enough to be trusted with a factual account of anything.I thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story he says in the production notes. There were a great many parallels between the Communist society we lived under and the Spanish Inquisition. But the story is too tenuous to hold our attention. Against our expectations and with a background of something major the life of a great painter the horrors of the Inquisition and even the French Revolution we are instead asked to feel involved in a concocted if kind infatuation of Goya's. The result is that we feel cheated.Background detail is appallingly handled. Goya went deaf in 1792 when the film starts not 15 years later. Napoleon is as believable as a cutout from a cereal packet. We see the Church passing out a death sentence when the normal procedure was for the Church to insist that the secular arm did that dirty work. Battles look overlychoreographed and stagey. A peppering of gratuitous naked bosoms hardly makes up for it.On the positive side the production values are mostly good. The colours are vivid the pacing excellent at least until we give up on finding any worthwhile storyline. Bardem is excellent and Portman is a joy until she goes into overdrive as a mad woman. While it doesn't say very much about Goya what it does say is nice even if superficial and pretty irrelevant.I once had a late night drunken conversation where my friends and I asked each other if you could choose a director to depict your life who would it be? On his record Forman would sadly have to be at the bottom of my list.".

The colours are vivid the pacing excellent at least until we give up on finding any worthwhile storyline. Bardem is excellent and Portman is a joy until she goes into overdrive as a mad woman. While it doesn't say very much about Goya what it does say is nice even if superficial and pretty irrelevant.I once had a late night drunken conversation where my friends and I asked each other if you could choose a director to depict your life who would it be? On his record Forman would sadly have to be at the bottom of my list.";

Yet after watching this movie I really had nothing to admire about it.First off the acting was very much below average. The performances were just not powerful enough to really feel shocked by what the inquisition did. Javier Bardem did give a solid performance and was probably the only one who actually had as Spanish accent. It is pretty obvious why this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman who I think is a very good up and coming actress did not really make me feel sorry for her being tortured. Like the movie there was nothing to admire about her performance. Stellan Skarsgaard who I do like gave a very average performance like the other actors giving a boring performance. This movie was essentially about him since he plays Goya. Yet he did not become what he needed to be to make this movie good. What about Randy Quaid? You have just got to be kidding me. Him playing King Carlos IV. Look he is great in comedies but him playing a King that just describes the whole movie for you.The directing was just horrible in this movie. When a movie is a mess there are usually two people to blame for that the director and the writer. I get the feeling that Milos Forman really didn't want his actors to put a Spanish accent on. From the very few battle scenes in here they were all displayed horribly. Also as a director he needs to give you the feeling of shock of what the inquisition did. After this movie I felt like I could careless about the event. To sum it all up he poorly shot the scenes and misguided the actors.The writing which was also done by Milos Forman was just as bad or maybe even worse than the directing. There really was nothing memorable of the movie except for one seen where Bardem does get the same treatment that Portman's character has gotten. Other then that the movie did not give you the feeling of the time period and at least it could have made up for it with a quote or two.After finishing this movie I was just looking at the T.V. thinking OK why should I care about any of this. I do care and are very much interested in history but when movies like this come up it feels like the producers robbed you of something good that could have been taken away from the movie. When movies are this bad we highlight a lot of the technical faults in a movie than if it was good. Like the accents. I'm not sure people would have emphasized the lack of Spanish accents if this movie was good.Thw whole point of this review is to say just don't watch it.".

Javier Bardem proves his worth as much as in his later award winning films The Sea Inside No Country For Old Men etc. and I wonder how such a craggylooking man can be so charismatic. Bardem has something unusual a rare quality of conveying total realism in his acting which becomes him not just a superficial persona he puts on. The supporting cast especially Stellan Skarsgaard as Goya provide a worthy backdrop for the two central very powerful roles played by Bardem and Portman who convey the darkness of the period in excruciatingly detailed performances then reflected in Goya's paintings. The film brings to life Goya's dark realistic portraits of humanity in all its terror grotesqueness cruelty and suffering during a tumultuous period of war and carnage. A brilliant film by Forman and I recommend anyone wanting a challenge in film to see this if they haven't already done so.".

In the final scene some moviegoers may think of Daniel Day Lewis' fate in Nicholas Hynter's adaptation of Arthur Miller's The Crucible. If John Proctor repents he'll stave off execution. In Goya's Ghosts Lorenzo's fate is sealed regardless of his confession. When Lorenzo was a padre Ines' father demonstrated the considerable flaw in The Question.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to recommend putting this one in the skip it pile as well. I was mildly excited by the concept when my fiance rented it and a bit more excited when I saw that Milos Forman directed it. Ah well.....The costumes were nice sure but they were typical. There was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the Period Costume department of any major Hollywood studio. There was no distinction between Spanish British and French  everyone dressed like they were at court in Versailles. The sets somehow didn't evoke the qualities of the settings  the prison didn't feel like a prison the mansions didn't feel like mansions and the outside scenes looked like they were filmed on a back lot for all that they were probably practical locations.The score was dramatically less than it could have been. I have been a fan of film scores since my youth noticing appreciating and collecting them by which I mean more than John Williams.

The score was never anything more than the most obvious choice for scoring a specific tone of scene and didn't integrate itself into the soul of the film think of the music in Babel and you'll have an idea of what I mean. It never attained the grandeur it wanted to but then neither did the film.Javier Bardem as talented as he is was awful. For the first part of the film his mannerisms are so distracting that it takes over his performance. During the second half everything that was his character in the first half is gone replaced by an entirely different set of annoying mannerisms and he looked like the lovechild of Keith Richards and Stuart Townshend's Lestat. I never got the idea that he cared about the role which is to say that the character cared about his life and actions or that the character was ever drawn by the writers as anything more than an opportunist who for whatever reason changes his mind and decides to stick by his principles at the end.Natalie Portman was very good although her performance lacked the shades of increasing insanity between her release from the prison and taking Lorenzo's hand at the end that I would have needed to call it truly an effective performance. The character of Alicia was never defined enough to truly discern and if it weren't for the superb makeup on her eyes and cheeks someone seeing the beginning of the film and the end wouldn't know they weren't the same character. The prosthetic teeth were horrible artificial and distracting but that's no knock on Ms. Portman.Stellan Skarsgrd was fine as Goya. Not Oscarworthy but serviceable and generally believable. I don't know much about the life of Goya or his deafness but it seemed to be tacked on to the movie as a requirement of biographical information rather than anything that was utilized in the film. I am sure it affected Goya's life much more than just requiring the need of an interpreter but you'd never know it from watching this. For the record words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted roughly 30 of the time through lipreading.Don't get me started on Randy Quaid. At least he was a minor character.The script reads like one of the choose your own adventure books I used to read as a kid at several moments through the film several outcomes are possible and none of the actions preceding them lead with any certainty to the way the film actually plays out. Ironically the film is also predictable especially its meager attempts at leavening the mood through small bits of humor. The joke about the hands? Maybe it's because I paint not well as a hobby and know what a PITA hands are to drawpaint but I saw the joke coming a mile away as well as the reprise in the second half.

	schema:reviewBody "Goya's Ghosts 2006I'm not sure why they felt they had to pivot this fictional story around a real painter the great tormented Francisco Goya. Because the main story is completely fictional about a young woman Portman and a priest Bardem and their interactions. And about the torture and imprisonment so common in Spain at the time. The conflict between the secular and the sacred and between clergy and royalty is part of the social and political intrigue the tries to light up the film.But Goya really has nothing to do with all this and even his character is a kind of guide or unifying thread through a lot of disturbing and meandering up and down events. What Goya does provide I think is a kind of realistic gruesomeness behind it all. That's a key part of his work and perhaps it inspired the filmmakers. The time late 1700s to early 1800s was physically rough and life was cheap to be sure. The effects of torture and war are everywhere in Goya's work and thus in this disappointing movie.The plot as such is really a series of conflicts between these spheres of power and it doesn't suck you in for the long haul. What it does do well is create individual moments with both terrific set design and with horrid grotesqueness. This might not be your cup of tea when it has no protagonist to quite get in with. Certainly among the three main characters the young woman arouses purely pity she is used tortured raped and left to rot and the priest arouses curiosity at his changing politics and beliefs his contradictory impulses. These kinds of stereotypes are not awful clichs the movie doesn't sink to parody but themes like this have been woven together better elsewhere. You get a sense the director Milos Forman was aiming for another Amadeus his masterpiece set around the same time with its humanizing of famous figures and with the intrigues of power. But the writing here partly by Forman is daily bread stuff nothing as inventive and ingenious as Peter Shaffer's play used for Mozart's story.It should be said that Portman also plays another part that of the illegitimate daughter of her first character and of course she looks rather like her mom. Which of course makes the priest have a restrained frenzyhow lucky he grows twenty years older and the woman of his dreams is reborn. It's a moviemaking conceit a fun one out of place here though nice of Portman to show off her malleability.The third character? Yes our tour guide Goya himself? The actor Swedish star Stellan Starsgard plays a bit of the everyman not quite as focused and intense as you might suppose the real Goya to be. But who knows? What we do see of him has nothing to do with his actual life or work. Even the paintings he paints are just Goyaesque portraits of the other two characters. Great for some Hollywood memorabilia auction some day! In the end this lands somewhere between thrilling sensationalist and awkward. But beautifully awkward.".

In one of the movies most pivotal scenes Brother Lorenzo visits Ins tells her that he is about to help her asks for her to pray with him and then proceeds to rape her.Later on Lorenzo reports to Ins family and defends The Question torture arguing that if the accused is really innocent God will give them the strength to deny any guilt so a person who confesses must be guilty. But Ins family disagrees arguing that a person will confess to anything under physical torture. To prove this they draw up a statement which says that Brother Lorenzo confesses to being a monkey. In the end Lorenzo is tortured and signs. So much for God's strength.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie a few days ago in Germany and I was very surprised that many critics did not like it. It was the first movie I have ever watched without anybody leaving the room until the very last second. Usually I find myself alone watching the credits. Nathalie Portman has to portrait three completely different kinds of women young Ins old Ins and Alicia. I think that an actress that is able to do so convincingly has to be very talented. As young Ins she is lively and charming likes to laugh and seems to be bright and without any concerns. Years of prison make her an old dirty person who has lost her mind. She desperately wants to have her daughter back to whom she gave birth shortly after being imprisoned and raped ?. She doesn't realize that her daughter must be all grown up and 'adopts' a little baby she finds in a tavern. Alicia her grownup daughter is a prostitute strongwilled and without any feeling of shame. Javier Bardem plays Alicia's father a very dominant man. At first he belongs to the inquisition but when Ins' father proves his believes wrong he needs to flee the country and turns to the French Revolution. He sticks to his new believes even when he faces death. Therefor he's not the plain bad person he seems to be at the beginning but somebody who is in search of the truth power and money. He's a loving husband to his wife later on in the movie. Every character develops throughout the film in a very logic and convincing way. Even Goya who is the linking chain between the other characters turns from a lively and funny person into a serious one. I loved the way everybody was connected to each other and how blindness and a few wrong decisions can destroy lives.I enjoyed every minute of this movie it has great actors and a great story. I will definitely watch it again.".

If you answered yes to any of these questions bewarethe resonance you may feel toward the characters of this film may be so intense the emotional pull of its story so overwhelming that at its end you will find yourself exhausted spent trembling in its cathartic wake. I find it so every time I see it. As an examination of the terrible undercurrents in family relationships of adolescent angst and loneliness of the universal need for love and the awful consequences of its being withheld it is nearly peerless. Movies that toyed with similar themes like The Graduate or Rebel Without a Cause though great films do not come close to packing the emotional wallop this film delivers.To a large part the intensity of the affective response generated by watching East of Eden must be attributed to the strength of the performances. No false notes here. Raymond Massey a truly superb actor who has largely and undeservedly been forgotten gives one of his best performance as the father with a secret a man with the best intentions in the world who has nonetheless unwittingly crippled his son Cal with his sometimes harsh criticisms and his favoritism of his brother Aron. Julie Harris is simply wonderful as Abra a young woman who gradually becomes disenchanted with the perfect brother Aron finding herself becoming more and more interested in the vaguely frightening yet vulnerable Cal. Her speech near the end of the film to Cal's father is heartrending. Everyone else is fine from the always dependable Burl Ives to Albert Decker and Jo van Fleet deserves special mention as the supposedly dead mother. The vehicle which propels the film however is James Dean who not only gives the best performance in his all too short career but one of the best in cinematic history. It is truly amazing to watch him work here. The viewer becomes like putty in his hands bending and rending our emotions at will. It's a performance not to be missed.The movie has received criticism because it does not follow the book and leaves out at least the first two thirds of the novel. East of Eden is one of my favorite books yet I have no trouble accepting this film on its own meritswhich are considerable. A movie CANNOT be a book though there have been several directors who seem blithely unaware of this giving us plodding movies straightjacketed by their literary source. One cannot judge this movie solely by comparing it to the book and with each deviation from the source give it a demerit. I believe this movie is every bit as great as the bookbut it is NOT the book. And John Steinbeck himself loved this movie reportedly saying that the movie was a greater achievement than his book had been. That's a recommendation good enough for me and should be enough for the lovers of the book. You CAN love both. I do.".

No false notes here. Raymond Massey a truly superb actor who has largely and undeservedly been forgotten gives one of his best performance as the father with a secret a man with the best intentions in the world who has nonetheless unwittingly crippled his son Cal with his sometimes harsh criticisms and his favoritism of his brother Aron. Julie Harris is simply wonderful as Abra a young woman who gradually becomes disenchanted with the perfect brother Aron finding herself becoming more and more interested in the vaguely frightening yet vulnerable Cal. Her speech near the end of the film to Cal's father is heartrending. Everyone else is fine from the always dependable Burl Ives to Albert Decker and Jo van Fleet deserves special mention as the supposedly dead mother. The vehicle which propels the film however is James Dean who not only gives the best performance in his all too short career but one of the best in cinematic history. It is truly amazing to watch him work here. The viewer becomes like putty in his hands bending and rending our emotions at will. It's a performance not to be missed.The movie has received criticism because it does not follow the book and leaves out at least the first two thirds of the novel. East of Eden is one of my favorite books yet I have no trouble accepting this film on its own meritswhich are considerable. A movie CANNOT be a book though there have been several directors who seem blithely unaware of this giving us plodding movies straightjacketed by their literary source. One cannot judge this movie solely by comparing it to the book and with each deviation from the source give it a demerit. I believe this movie is every bit as great as the bookbut it is NOT the book. And John Steinbeck himself loved this movie reportedly saying that the movie was a greater achievement than his book had been. That's a recommendation good enough for me and should be enough for the lovers of the book. You CAN love both. I do.";

	schema:headline " Dean's Best PerformanceAn Outstanding Film";
	schema:reviewBody "If you have ever come out on the short end of a sibling rivalry andor felt seriously wronged by a parents you will probably connect nicely with East of Eden 1955. Since the majority of viewers meet these criteria it is easy to see why the film finds a new audience with each generation. And it is easy to understand the tears that are often shed by both firsttime and repeat viewers.Although set at the start of World War I the generational issues portrayed really had came to a head by the mid1950's. Which is why the film was so timely and contemporary when it was released. It was Elia Kazan's troubled relationship with his own father that first attracted him to Steinbeck's novel and caused him to focus the film on the portion of the story that addressed this issue. Originally I ranked it a distant third in the James Dean film pecking order but over the years it has somehow passed Giant and Rebel Without a Cause IMHO and I now find it to be clearly his best and more enduring work. It is a real actorsdirector's film with just six significant characters and with especially good performances from Dean and from Julie Harris. Both were a bit old for their parts but Dean's boyish manner allowed him to sell the character and Harris who had convincingly played a twelve year old just a few years earlier in Member of the Wedding looks the proper age in every scene except one an outdoor scene shot in the bright sun. She struggles sometimes with reining in her sophistication but that could just be the subjective perception of this viewer. Here are some random points to appreciate in this great filmDon't misinterpret Cal's Dean motivation he is not doing things to win his father's love but because he loves his father communicated by the early scene where he watches his father working in the kitchen. The former motivation would be simplistic the latter opens up a host of interesting and ironic interpretations as you realize the seemingly bad son Cal actually understands his father and admires his goodness more than good son Aron Richard Davalos.Aron is not really the innocent figure he appears to be he does not like Cal and throughout the film betrays him.Abra Harris is caught between the two brothers moving steadily from Aron to Cal as the film progresses. Aron represents everything she understands that she should be and Cal represents everything she has been denying herself. The story is largely seen from her point of view and her growth parallels her and the audiences slow realization that Cal is not bad but misunderstood. The two are slowly falling in love but do not kiss until she gets up in the ferris wheel a place where symbolically she is no longer standing on solid practical ground.It is really a coming of age story for both of them with Abra slowly embracing new areas of human experience and Cal moving from adolescence to manhood thanks largely to her timely interventions. Watch for subtle details that Kazan has included like Cal's inability to make extended eye contact with his father brother and mother something that he has no problem doing with Abra. And Cal's unsteady progress as he moves forward momentarily and then retreats by looking away.Note Kazan's use of a raked camera angle for the scenes inside the Trask home unfortunately this device is a little too extreme and calls attention to itself. Also used in The Third Man it was done here to reinforce the offkilter nature of this family's dynamic. It goes away after the scene in which Cal finally confronts his lifelong jealousy of his brother and accuses his father of rejecting him because he is so much like his mother telling Adam Raymond Massey that he cannot forgive himself for having married Kate. This is the point at which Cal moves forward into permanent manhood prior to this he had stepped forward briefly and then retreated back into childhood.Watch for the methodacting device of an actor playing with an object as a means to introduce naturalism into the scene Abra first flirts with Cal with a flower Jo Van Fleet makes a show of taking out and lighting a cigarette Cal repeatedly dips his finger into a wine glass. East of Eden would be nothing but an overwrought melodrama without a host of little things like this that humanize the story.Watch for the awkward tension in all the scenes between Cal and Adam Kazan cultivated the offscreen friction between Dean and Massey reasoning that it would translate into more realistic onscreen sequences between the two actors. Watch for the stunning sequence late in the film when Cal slowly moves out from under the tree branches his menace reinforced nicely by the score.Finally note the contrast between the restrained closing scene which is also the climax and the melodramatic style of the almost everything that has preceded it in the film. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

	schema:headline " Is there any law against writing a review?";
	schema:reviewBody "First I'll throw in my two cents on an issue I wish I didn't have to comment on. Almost everyone knows that East of Eden is based on the novel by John Steinbeck. Although I'm more of a fan of fantastic and surreal literature Steinbeck and Hemingway are probably my two favorite realist authors. East of Eden is an epic masterpiece well worth reading. It's also close to 200000 words long so obviously some details and plot points are going to be left out or changed in a twohour movie and that shouldn't make a difference. The film is a separate artwork in a completely different medium that should be judged on its own merits not compared to the book. For more on this see my novel to film minirant in my user profile. Director Elia Kazan's East of Eden presents itself as a disarmingly simple film. Many might feel that it's slow or uneventful. But the superficial appearance is intentionally misleading a filmic representation of the elegant austerity of Steinbeck's literary style the plot subtexts and filmic artistry are all really quite complex and this is the rare example of a film that grows on you more and more after you've seen it.The plot is a rough modern circa the 1910s retelling of the biblical tale of Cain and Abel set in and between Salinas and Monterey California as an allegory of good versus evil. But both Steinbeck and screenwriter Paul Osborn weave a dense allegorical tapestry with those polar ethical opposites becoming less clearcut as the film progresses.Cain is Cal Trask James Dean here Abel his brother Aron Richard Davalos. Their father Adam Raymond Massey owns a ranch upon which he grows lettuce. He sees the attainment of excessive profit as negative and instead focuses his intelligence and skills on trying to better mankind somehow the practical upshot of which is that Adam is trying to conquer the problem of the preservation of transported especially food via refrigeration or freezing. Adam is sternly frugal and religious and favors Aron. Thus Cal is something of a hoodlum when the film begins. He's irreverent and tends to wander off. We see him being belligerent and somewhat self destructive. Aron in contrast seems decorous and easygoing as does his girlfriend Abra Julie Harris. In other words Cal and Aron are basically presented as Goofus and Gallant at the start of the film.Cal and Aron were told by Adam that their mother was dead. But Cal has suspicions about this and the first part of East of Eden is concerned with Cal's attempt to discover the truth about his mother. He learns the truth and the second half covers a number of parallel somewhat unexpected transformations in the Trask family and their close friends. This is also paralleled with the burgeoning of World War I which has a complex impact on these then small California towns.The first thing that you're likely to notice with the recent Warner Home Video DVD of East of Eden after the novelty of the 3minute Overture which doesn't add much at home but is interesting historically and doesn't negatively affect anything is the beautiful cinematography. This was one of the earlier Cinemascope anamorphic 35mm widescreen with up to a 2.661 aspect ratio films shot also with a new Warner Color process. The results employing gorgeous California landscapes artfully shot by cinematographer Ted D. McCord under Kazan's direction are breathtaking. Everything looks scrumptiousfrom old downtown streets to the rocky ocean shores distant mountains over sprawling fields romantically shot freight trainseven the sugar factory standing in for Adam's barn and the Monterey whorehouse are beautifully photographed. One of the more famous scenes features Cal and Abra in a dense colorful flowerfilled field. The Warner Color manages to look both intense and subdued at the same time which fits the atmosphere of the film perfectly. Kazan employs a lot of subtle camera motions and angles to emphasize the drama including marvelously skewed angles during confrontations between Cal and Adam.The score by Leonard Rosenman is also worth mentioning as the mood of the film hinges on it so much. It's lush and sophisticated with a slight Aaron Copland flavor to my ears. This was Rosenman's first scoring gig. He had been James Dean's piano teacher and had actually studied with famed 12tone serial music proponent Arnold Schoenberg. Ironically he felt himself an odd choice and initially suggested that Kazan ask Copland to score the film instead. That probably led to some of the Coplandish tonalities although to many ears Rosenman tends to sound more like Alban Berg another more famous Schoenberg protg.Of course as a realist drama the performances in the film are crucial. Dean is outstanding as one would expect but so is Harris and the rest of the cast. Part of this must be due to Kazan as Harris for example doesn't come across nearly as well to me in some of her other films such as Robert Wise's The Haunting 1963.If East of Eden has a flaw it's that its relatively short compared to the material available running time makes for some unexplained or shallow turnabouts of character in the complex of goodevil interplay. Aron seems particularly distant to the viewer for example which is appropriate to the final state of his character but which could have been explained better in transformation.But this is a fabulous film with grand biblical and universal subtexts and an unusually developed but extremely charming romance. Unless you're completely averse to realist drama you must see East of Eden at least once.".

	schema:headline " Excellent Story With Characters Who Aren't Always Who They Seem";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow what an impressive screen debut for a 24yearold. That was the famous James Dean here in his first of three starring roles before death took him at a tragically young age. Just as impressive however is the overall performance of the rest of the cast including lesserknown Richard Davalos who also was making his movie debut.The most impressive person connected to this movie however was director Elia Kazan who not only excelled directing this film but  in the same year  directed On The Waterfront. Now that's not a bad year of work! East Of Eden is billed as a modernday story of Cain and Abel between good and bad brothers with one of them feeling rejected by his father. The small Biblical account of the two brothers only mentions an offering they both gave God and then saying the brother whose offering wasn't accepted went out in a fit of jealousy and killed the other. True the offering by Cal Dean and its rejection by his dad Adam Raymond Massey leads to a climactic scene near the end of the film but  this is just an assumption  most people viewed this simply as a story between good and evil pertaining to Dean and Davalos' characters.I didn't see either of those guys as either the good or bad brothers. In fact this film story is unusual in that every main character's personality begins in one direction and as the film progresses ends in almost the opposite. Nobody is as they first seem.Cale Trask is shown early on to be a totally rebellious and immature loser who commits a few stupid acts of vandalism and has a desire to be a loner. As the film goes on we see a softhearted guy who needs and desires love and companionship like everyone else. The fact he only had one parent and that one didn't seem to love him has messed his mind up a great deal.Meanwhile his older brother Aron Davalos is pictured as the kind dependable levelheaded guy who has a nice sweetheart who he plans to marry very soon. Aron has always made his dad proud which makes Cale jealous and bitter hence the CainAbel analogy. In the last third of the film however Aron's personality reveals some dark selfish traits and he isn't so good anymore.Julie Harris plays Abra who begins as a sweet likable and trustworthy person but in the end proves insincere in her ready to marry and I'm in love with Aron remarks as her feelings develop for the younger brother. She does a nice job at the end however helping Cale reconcile with his ailing dad.The fourth major player the father of the two boys is portrayed  at least by Cale  as man who has played favorites with his sons and is more of a businessman than a loving father. However we see later that he is not a bad guy at all. He is happy to praise his younger son when merited is quick to forgive but like a lot of fathers in the old days I believe had a hard time outwardly expressing love for his children despite in his heart wanting the best for them.The fifth major character in the film Kate has the least amount of lines but is the most powerful figure in the movie. She's the mother who abandoned her kids when they were babies and left her husband because she didn't want to be tied down to a ranch. Wow Thank God our mothers didn't have that selfish attitude! She's pictured as a very hard bitter woman who has made a success of herself and to hell with everyone else. However once again as the story unfolds we see an opposite side. Cale checking rumors she was in the area sought her out and discovered she indeed was his mom. Nobody in the Trask family knew she lived nearby with the dad telling the kids she was dead rather than risk hurting their feelings.. Anyway later she surprises us by softening up and loaning Cal 5000 for a business venture to help him and help bail out his dad. That amount of money is equal to at least 100000 today so it's a generous kind person who would say okay to that monetary request. The more she speaks the softer she sounds even if she wouldn't want to admit it.The only character I wish had a bigger role was Anne played by Lois Smith who was beautiful and had an intriguing role that I thought would amount to more. I'm glad to see that she is still acting on a regular basis today.Overall it's a solid drama with complex characters who make you reflect about them long after you view this. I don't know why it took so long for me to finally see this movie but I was impressed. May I recommend the twodisc specialedition DVD?. This movie is wonderfully directed acted and photographed. I've only seen it once last night and I am not in love with the film yet but I am surprised it only garnered one Academy Award. I think it deserved more.".

Nobody is as they first seem.Cale Trask is shown early on to be a totally rebellious and immature loser who commits a few stupid acts of vandalism and has a desire to be a loner. As the film goes on we see a softhearted guy who needs and desires love and companionship like everyone else. The fact he only had one parent and that one didn't seem to love him has messed his mind up a great deal.Meanwhile his older brother Aron Davalos is pictured as the kind dependable levelheaded guy who has a nice sweetheart who he plans to marry very soon. Aron has always made his dad proud which makes Cale jealous and bitter hence the CainAbel analogy. In the last third of the film however Aron's personality reveals some dark selfish traits and he isn't so good anymore.Julie Harris plays Abra who begins as a sweet likable and trustworthy person but in the end proves insincere in her ready to marry and I'm in love with Aron remarks as her feelings develop for the younger brother. She does a nice job at the end however helping Cale reconcile with his ailing dad.The fourth major player the father of the two boys is portrayed  at least by Cale  as man who has played favorites with his sons and is more of a businessman than a loving father. However we see later that he is not a bad guy at all. He is happy to praise his younger son when merited is quick to forgive but like a lot of fathers in the old days I believe had a hard time outwardly expressing love for his children despite in his heart wanting the best for them.The fifth major character in the film Kate has the least amount of lines but is the most powerful figure in the movie. She's the mother who abandoned her kids when they were babies and left her husband because she didn't want to be tied down to a ranch. Wow Thank God our mothers didn't have that selfish attitude! She's pictured as a very hard bitter woman who has made a success of herself and to hell with everyone else. However once again as the story unfolds we see an opposite side. Cale checking rumors she was in the area sought her out and discovered she indeed was his mom. Nobody in the Trask family knew she lived nearby with the dad telling the kids she was dead rather than risk hurting their feelings.. Anyway later she surprises us by softening up and loaning Cal 5000 for a business venture to help him and help bail out his dad. That amount of money is equal to at least 100000 today so it's a generous kind person who would say okay to that monetary request. The more she speaks the softer she sounds even if she wouldn't want to admit it.The only character I wish had a bigger role was Anne played by Lois Smith who was beautiful and had an intriguing role that I thought would amount to more. I'm glad to see that she is still acting on a regular basis today.Overall it's a solid drama with complex characters who make you reflect about them long after you view this. I don't know why it took so long for me to finally see this movie but I was impressed. May I recommend the twodisc specialedition DVD?. This movie is wonderfully directed acted and photographed. I've only seen it once last night and I am not in love with the film yet but I am surprised it only garnered one Academy Award. I think it deserved more.";

East of Eden must be seen in the widescreen format to truly appreciate its visual style.  It is arresting sometimes beautiful and always powerful.Then there are the performances.

After seeing the film a few times I really appreciate the performance of Julie Harris too.  I once thought her a little too mature for the role  but now I see how her reactions to the events really enhance the emotional impact of those events.  Kazan allows her to be in frame during some of the most crucial encounters between Cal and his father  and her face tells a million stories.  This is a true supporting performance  her performance helping Dean realize Cal.  Brava Julie!I'm a lot older now than when I first saw this film  but I still relate so strongly to the communication breakdown and the need for love between father and son.  The improvement of my own relationship with my father makes me see the film differently but with no less emotion.  Like all masterpieces this film does not date we just see it differently as we age.  This is undoubtedly one of my top five films.  How about a theatrical revival?  I have never seen it in a cinema.  Remember see it in widescreen  not pan and scan.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't read John Steinbeck's novel East of Eden but I'm familiar with enough of the author's work to know that he wasn't a glass half full kind of man. Steinbeck's characters appear to persist despite their misery devoid of hope and comfort and persevering out of sheer bloodymindedness. This potentially poses a problem because Hollywood has traditionally taken the stance that it is optimism not pessimism that sells tickets. This clash of sensibilities is seen readily enough in 'The Grapes of Wrath 1940' in which John Ford's assurance in the hardiness of American families sits at odds with Steinbeck's stark brand of realism. Nevertheless Elia Kazan was an ideal candidate to adapt the 1952 novel East of Eden having already dealt with unflinching dramatic themes of family and societal conflict in the films 'A Streetcar Named Desire 1951' and 'On the Waterfront 1954.' The pair had collaborated previously with Steinbeck writing the screenplay for Kazan's Mexican Revolution biopic 'Viva Zapata! 1952.'Whereas 'A Streetcar Named Desire' had been a completely stagebound film owing to origins on Broadway 'East of Eden 1955' allowed Kazan to spread his cinematic wings so to speak. Steinbeck had intended his novel in part as a tribute to the Salinas Valley in Northern California and so location is everything. Cinematographer Ted McCord captures the setting in lush WarnerColor the fertile green fields consciously opposed to the bleak inner conflict raging inside the heart of the film's protagonist. Despite being visually impressive it is  as in all Kazan pictures  the director's genius for working with actors that really shines through. James Dean in his major picture debut and the first of only three lead roles delivers one of the most heartbreakingly tragic performances I've ever seen. His Cal the Biblical Cain to Richard Davalos' Abel has endured a life without love every misguided bid for his father's Raymond Massey approval met with indifference or remonstration as though only to cement his selfbelief that he is inherently bad. In adapting East of Eden another director might have aimed for sheer scope winding up with something not unlike 'Gone with the Wind 1939' or 'Duel in the Sun 1946.' Instead Kazan plays his strengths and it's a telling sign that the film's most powerful moments unfold not in the outside environments that McCord captures so well but between four walls  inside homes sheds and brothels. Dean's character skulks mousily in the corners fearful about making eye contact as his articulate proper brother Aron makes unconsciouslycondescending remarks perpetuating stereotypes that have been drummed into both since childhood. Only Aron's sweetheart Abra Julie Harris understands Cal's torment at the hands of his cold naive family members but by then it may already be too late to save him. At under two hours 'East of Eden' perhaps doesn't explore its characters and their motivations as fully as it might have  for example Aron's metaphorical slaying at his brother's hand isn't give enough exposition  but nonetheless stands as a beautiful and astonishingly powerful piece of storytelling.".

	schema:headline " Top performances for film of Steinbeck's favorite book";
	schema:reviewBody "Although some of his other books receive more acclaim and readership The Grapes of Wrath Of Mice and Men The Winter of Our Discontent John Steinbeck said that East of Eden was the novel that he lived to write. Indeed the moralism of his writing reached broader and deeper in Eden than in any of his other works. The story here is set mainly in Steinbeck's beloved Salinas Valley and Monterey County.Warner Brothers did a commendable job in bringing the story to life on the silver screen. It condensed a 600page novel into a twohour film yet kept all of the main elements of the drama. The title for the story comes from the Bible. Genesis 416 reads Cain then left the Lord's presence and settled in the land of Nod east of Eden. The plot of the story is a modern Cain and Abel tale and it is repeated within succeeding generations. In the Bible Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil to offer the Lord. Abel brought the best of the firstlings or some of the firstlings and their fat portions. The latter were more pleasing to God. So Cain did soso average but Abel went out of his way to give the best to the Lord. God didn't love Cain any less  he was just most pleased with Abel's offering. Yet Cain succumbed to pride greed envy anger and lust. Most know the story of East of Eden or will find other reviews that discuss the plot. So my remarks here are brief and cover some things not mentioned. Seeing this film again after many years on a DVD I had the advantage of extras that included some deleted scenes. I think one inclusion would have made the film perfect  the scene of Cal and Aron in their room after they had argued outside and Cal said that Aron was the one he wanted referring to his father's favoritism as he saw it. Without that sequence we see Cal suddenly perking up pitching in and being Mr. goodguy helping his father. But there's no real explanation or background to let us know why he would change. I don't know why they deleted that scene  it made the perfect fit and segue with Aron and Cal talking and Aron explaining in a way that Cal could understand. I don't think that would have made the movie too long in itself. James Dean had the largest role as Cal and was the male lead. And yes he was a new young and hot star of the time. All of the acting is excellent including Dean's. But I think the very best performances in this movie were by Julie Harris as Abra Jo Van Fleet as Kate and Raymond Massey as Adam. Richard Davalos as Aron wasn't far behind and Van Fleet's performance was most deserving of the Oscar she won. James Dean made one more film after this  Giant which came out in October 1956. He wasn't alive to see it because he was killed in a highway accident on Sept. 30 1955. He had just finished filming for Giant. That was just five months after East of Eden hit theaters. It's interesting to note that the site of Dean's accident was a few miles east of Paso Robles California. That's at the southern end of the Salinas Valley of Steinbeck's East of Eden.Those interested in Steinbeck should enjoy a visit to the National Steinbeck Center. It's a marvelous museum in downtown Salinas CA.".

I don't think that would have made the movie too long in itself. James Dean had the largest role as Cal and was the male lead. And yes he was a new young and hot star of the time. All of the acting is excellent including Dean's. But I think the very best performances in this movie were by Julie Harris as Abra Jo Van Fleet as Kate and Raymond Massey as Adam. Richard Davalos as Aron wasn't far behind and Van Fleet's performance was most deserving of the Oscar she won. James Dean made one more film after this  Giant which came out in October 1956. He wasn't alive to see it because he was killed in a highway accident on Sept. 30 1955. He had just finished filming for Giant. That was just five months after East of Eden hit theaters. It's interesting to note that the site of Dean's accident was a few miles east of Paso Robles California. That's at the southern end of the Salinas Valley of Steinbeck's East of Eden.Those interested in Steinbeck should enjoy a visit to the National Steinbeck Center. It's a marvelous museum in downtown Salinas CA.";

As the film does not give the background of KateCathy and her deviate ways. All the important facts and sentiment are totally amiss in this movie. As I do not mind James Dean as Cal as some do he had nothing to do with the poorly written script. Cal would never ask KateCathy for a loan for 5000 Cal in the book received the loan from Lee. I am so glad I finished the book before seeing this movie. This movie is not a 14 of the book and a bad adaptation of it. This movie is a disappointment. If you are really interested in the story take the time to read the Book East of Eden.

	schema:reviewBody "When the majority of people think back on the career of James Dean they tend to think of Rebel Without A Cause as Dean's masterpiece and for good reason. Dean's debut East of Eden on the other hand is an extremely poor adaptation of a novel of the same name that was written by John Steinbeck. This is the film that put James Dean on the map and was the starting point of his rise as a cultural icon. While some may call this film a milestone it comes off as a huge misstep for director Elia Kazan.The film opens up at around  of the way through the actual book and still manages to be a jumbled and uneven mess. Major characters from the book are cut out and in the process create giant plot holes. New characters are added such as Abra who changes the relationship between a lot of characters and adds different tones and themes to the film that Steinbeck originally never intended. Another problem the film suffers from is it's extremely uneven pacing there is too much time wasted on things that never play into the actual arch of the film. Kazan seems like he tries to distract his audience rather than engage them.Elia Kazan who has shown through his previous films that he is clearly a capable director and this is the fact that makes this film so disappointing. Kazan never seems truly grasp the underlying tones of Steinbeck's book and this translates to the screen. Instead of treating his material with care and insight he instead seems to constantly exploit Dean's to cool for school attitude to manipulate the audience into empathizing with a character because of his looks and not his motives. Kazan never exposes the core essence of his characters he lets characters tell you what their characters are thinking instead of letting them show what they are feeling a major weakness from any director. The films biggest weakness is that it never devotes enough time to character development. Characters constantly make decision's that seem out of place and unnatural. For instance when Aron becomes insane and leaves for war his fianc Abra is totally indifferent to the entire situation. Yet her heart breaks for Cal when he is faced with the fact that he may have to live his life without the forgiveness of his father even though he is the cause of Aron's leaving. It seems the more and more Cal destroys the lives of the people around him the more they take him in with open arms.Aside from poor character development the film fails to give an adequate amount of back story for certain characters. The dynamics of the relationship between Adam and his two sons is never really explored beyond face value. It is never explained how exactly Cal finds out that his mother is alive nor does the film explain the motives of the relationship between Cal and the person he starts his bean business with who appears on screen a total of 3 times and than forgotten. The film while generally disappointing and uninspired does have its moments from time to time. Jo Van Fleet who gives the best performance in the film won the award for best supporting actress at the 1956 Academy Awards. Van Fleet's film debut proved that she could hold her own even among larger that life actors such as James Dean. Another strong point of the film can be attributed to the film's art department who do a stellar job at recreating the Salinas Valley circa the early 1900's. Cinematographer Ted McCord is the real heart of this film. McCord takes chances and they pay off. His use of lighting is more moody than most studio films of the 50's and he maintains a sense of movement even when the actor's blocking remains mostly static. McCord is responsible for developing characters that many of the unimpressive actor's in this film could not accomplish through acting. During one scene between Cal and his father McCord highlights their distorted relationship by using innovative camera tilts that gives the scene a real sense of drama that the acting lacked. The biggest tragedy resulting from this film is that Ted McCord didn't even get nominated for an Academy Award.After all these years East of Eden seems aged and uninspired. James Dean proved that he was easy to watch on camera but didn't prove that he was an accomplished actor. Unfairly critically acclaimed and winner of one deserved Academy Award East of Eden really only ever accomplishes two things. It proves that people love happy endings even if they aren't really happy and that too many people are suckers for a pretty face. It is insane to think that Steinbeck loved this film upon seeing it.".

Each time I see this movie I see it from a new perspective. I learned from the DVD and from reading Elia Kazan's comments that the character Cal played by Dean is really Steinbeck in many ways in his youth and Kazan also identified with him. I learned that there was real friction between Dean and the man who played his father Raymond Massey and that Dean deliberately provoked Massey to get angry with him to bring out the moment in the film of the father's feelings towards his son. I also marvel each time i see this movie at the outstanding performance of Jo Van Fleet. She deserved her best supporting actress academy award. This movie resonates on many levels as do most of Kazan's films. It is modern retelling of the garden of eden story and it is the story of the troubled youth of the fifties fighting against the conservatism of the Eisenhower years. It is a story of the confusion and conflicts in a family with a war approaching and it's a story about a woman Van Fleet's character who doesn't like being bottled up in a controlled religious setting. Many things to enjoy here and one wonders where the artists of Kazans stature are in this day and age. I only wish that all of Kazan's films were on DVD such as Baby Doll and Wild River. I wonder if anyone but me notices that on the extra DVD where there is an interview with John Steinbeck that he shifts and contorts his mouth in a manner very like Dean in the movie. It was said that neither Steinbeck nor Kazan originally liked Dean but both agreed that he was perfect for the part and both identified with him very much.".

The boy is in constant conflict with their own religious father who prefers the another son.I'm thrilled with the picture. Nature is the real beauty in this film. The problematic people in this atmosphere seem more credible. This is a powerful drama with different moods and clear psychoanalysis. It is fascinating that the director establishes a better relationship with the landscape and a weaker relationship with the protagonists.Nobody's perfect. A trite but true phrase. The only question is who will find meaning in their own imperfections. The film can recognize good and evil. This attitude affects the clarity of emotions. Fortunately Biblical allusion is not excessive. The brothers in a way symbolize duality in man himself to grotesque proportions. The struggle for acceptance in the family and society which has tragic end !? This is not only preposterous but is dotted with a kind of illusion.James Dean as Caleb Trask is unrepeatable but the performance is overstated. Emotional character does not show a clear emotion. He is a hero and a villain in this film. The son who fought for an ounce of his father's love. The son who is trying to buy his father's love. The protagonist who has a frank and somewhat noble purpose in life. James Dean is a strange combination between Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift. Julie Harris as Abra Bacon is a young and inexperienced lady who is forced to choose between the perfect son the good guy and imperfect son the bad guy. Of course she is not good enough for the perfect son but she matures in time to save imperfect. Very good performance I have to admit.Raymond Massey as Adam Trask in the role of the perfect and the strictly religious father. I can understand his seriousness sense of justice and even fanatical devotion but persistent refusing attitude against his son I will never understand. I tried to find a reason at some redemption but again I have not found a deeper meaning. Richard Davalos as Aron Trask was the perfect son. I felt resentment and envy in his character. Of course after the knowledge of the life of his mother. That's awesome. The protagonist who believes in the eternal triumph of good over evil. Characterization is very bad in this case. Jo Van Fleet as Cathy Ames is the mother described as a monster without a shred of love. The evil that is necessary for the story.This movie is only a part of the novel and I made conclusions based on that.".

I've started this movie several times but never have been able to get to the end although it was obvious where it was going to end up. It disgusts me at almost every level.I've also never understood the attraction of James Dean. He only seems to play this character  the scion of an overly wealthy family who seeing poverty all around him  finds no reaction except whining and bleating about his lofty position in society. Well more to the point he whines constantly about how his mommy or daddy or both don't love him enough.In this loser flick there is a scene where Dean finds his soul mate  or so I suppose it'll turn out. She is giggling about having thrown away a 3000 ring her dad a widower gave to his new bride. Then she says she forgave him for remarrying. Dean and she find this episode hilarious. Note that this is set during WWI where that 3000 is enough to support three farm worker families for a year. Such is the movie that it only looks at life from these ignorant bitchy teens' point of view that this violent wasting is overlooked or used as a plot device to weld these characters to each other.Throughout the entire movie Dean speaks in a weasely nasal whine and slinks around half folded up which I suppose is spoiled 50's American body language for being beaten down by immense wealth. The movie is constantly sympathetic toward this miserable brat excusing him running roughshod over anybody and anything to feed his own narrow needs.For example when he decides to make a device to harvest more efficiently he steals a vital part from some hard working poor people. This either puts them temporarily out of business or out of business until they can replace it  at enormous cost to them. He could have bought it with his pin money but instead he steals it from poor people. When caught all the sympathy of the movie is on his side. Personally I would have loved to see the poor victims of his theft beat him senseless.In fact thinking about this entire movie the thing which is missing is that Dean isn't beaten and expelled from the town. Everybody would have been better off and the movie would have been enormously more satisfying.".

	schema:reviewBody "East of Eden from 1955 is based on the John Steinbeck novel of the same name beautifully realized on the screen by Elia Kazan with James Dean as the perfect Cal.It is the modern story of Cain and Abel with the brothers Cal and Aron in California around the time of World War I. The film covers the last third of the book and it ends a little differently.The story in both book and film centers around choice in the book the subject comes up with a discussion of the correct translation of the Hebrew word timshel which means may. God blesses Cain with free will leaving the choice to him Thou mayest rule over himThis is not only a heartwrenching story and script but the acting is across the board superb.Kazan was struck by how much Dean was like Cal and actually observed his uneasy relationship with his father so he gave him free rein with the role.He is magnificent as a young man jealous of his brother Richard Davalos and wanting his father's Raymond Massey love desperately seeking to be understood. The only one who does is his brother's girlfriend Abra Julie Harris. Harris one of the great Broadway actresses of her time is lovely as the empathic young woman who finds herself torn as she realizes she is in love with Cal and not Aaron. Richard Davalos the handsome good boy Aron does a marvelous job and he has great chemistry with Dean. Their interactions are intense.Elia Kazan was always sorry he hired Raymond Massey feeling he did not have the range the director wanted but as the stern principled religious father he is excellent. He absolutely hated James Dean who deliberately provoked him  Dean was big into the Method  and complained that one had to stand around and wait for him to act. Kazan used the dislike to the character's advantage too.This was Jo Van Fleet's film debut though she had done television and had won a Tony award for A Trip to Bountiful. For her role as a bordello madam in East of Eden she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Kazan used her again in Wild River another brilliant performance. And the cast is great right down to the smaller roles played by Lois Smith Burl Ives and Albert Dekker. Of the cast only Smith and Davalos are still alive as of this writing. Someone reviewing it on this board said your feelings about the film change with age as one loses one's parents etc. I have to agree. It grows richer.East of Eden the book was a seminal for me and I feel as deeply about the film. A true masterpiece.".

	onyx:emotionText "East of Eden from 1955 is based on the John Steinbeck novel of the same name beautifully realized on the screen by Elia Kazan with James Dean as the perfect Cal.It is the modern story of Cain and Abel with the brothers Cal and Aron in California around the time of World War I. The film covers the last third of the book and it ends a little differently.The story in both book and film centers around choice in the book the subject comes up with a discussion of the correct translation of the Hebrew word timshel which means may. God blesses Cain with free will leaving the choice to him Thou mayest rule over himThis is not only a heartwrenching story and script but the acting is across the board superb.Kazan was struck by how much Dean was like Cal and actually observed his uneasy relationship with his father so he gave him free rein with the role.He is magnificent as a young man jealous of his brother Richard Davalos and wanting his father's Raymond Massey love desperately seeking to be understood. The only one who does is his brother's girlfriend Abra Julie Harris. Harris one of the great Broadway actresses of her time is lovely as the empathic young woman who finds herself torn as she realizes she is in love with Cal and not Aaron. Richard Davalos the handsome good boy Aron does a marvelous job and he has great chemistry with Dean. Their interactions are intense.Elia Kazan was always sorry he hired Raymond Massey feeling he did not have the range the director wanted but as the stern principled religious father he is excellent. He absolutely hated James Dean who deliberately provoked him  Dean was big into the Method  and complained that one had to stand around and wait for him to act. Kazan used the dislike to the character's advantage too.This was Jo Van Fleet's film debut though she had done television and had won a Tony award for A Trip to Bountiful. For her role as a bordello madam in East of Eden she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Kazan used her again in Wild River another brilliant performance. And the cast is great right down to the smaller roles played by Lois Smith Burl Ives and Albert Dekker. Of the cast only Smith and Davalos are still alive as of this writing. Someone reviewing it on this board said your feelings about the film change with age as one loses one's parents etc. I have to agree. It grows richer.East of Eden the book was a seminal for me and I feel as deeply about the film. A true masterpiece.";

	schema:reviewBody "O.k. I know I know....books and films are two different art forms and little can be gained by comparing the telling of the same story in one vs. the other. I'm a firm advocate of that myself. However let me just say that you cannot watch this film as a substitute of the Steinbeck novel though a film should never be used as a stand in for literature in my opinion. Kazan et al. very liberally adapt Steinbeck's story to the big screen and make a very impressive film however it's not the same story Steinbeck himself was telling.That aside East of Eden is a good not quite great but close film from a very inconsistent period of American film making i.e. the mid50's. Cinemascope and other widescreen processes were new and many directors were content just to train their cameras on a pretty landscape and think that was enough to make their compositions interesting. However Elia Kazan completely at home in the stark bw worlds of On the Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire obviously knew what to do with his widescreen compositions and as a result East of Eden is far more dynamic than many films from the same time period. For example in an early scene Cal James Dean walks along a stand of trees beside his brother and his brother's soontobe fianc. While they're talking Cal walks deeper into the frame and follows the other two while hidden from us and them by the trees. This of course serves the purpose of communicating Cal's isolation but it also seems like a perfectly natural thing for Cal's character to do and so doesn't feel obvious or heavy handed and it's visually interesting and so breaks up the frame. Kazan adds touches like that throughout the entire film. Even if they don't always work the skewed angles toward the end are somewhat corny they're appreciated for their attempts to create a unique visual style.James Dean just wasn't a very good actor but he was an interesting screen presence. He was always sulking around and looking uncomfortable in his own skin which is probably why teenagers at the time related to him so much and why he seems so right for the role of Cal. The women in this film deliver the best performances. Julie Harris does much with a somewhat thankless role through her naturalistic acting and Jo Van Fleet is simply terrific in a role that amounts to one significant scene. I'm not sure she deserved an Oscar for her maybe ten minutes of screen time but she does manage to make Kate into a memorable character in the blink of an eye. Indeed the film's greatest disservice to the novel is in reducing Kate's character to nothing more than a plot device. Anyone who's read the book remembers what a vivid character Steinbeck creates of her and it's a shame the film couldn't take more advantage of that.What the movie comes down to thematically is an investigation into the good vs. bad impulses that exist in everyone and whether or not we are forced into one of these two polar opposites by fate or have the ability to decide for ourselves which one we'll choose. It's an absorbing film and one of the must sees from one of the most interesting decades for the art form.Grade A".

Julie Harris...Brilliant! Raymond Massey...Brilliant! Jo Van Fleet... Very underrated. I even liked Albert Dekker!But James Dean...... I really don't get it. To me he was 'incredibly' overrated. A 'method' actor Dean seems to have had different 'methods' than Brando Karl Malden Dustin Hoffman and many others. Whenever he's on the screen I feel like he's shouting 'Look Ma... I'm 'Acting'!' This guy was so over the top in everything he did! I know all the old guys at the studios at the time were trying to be 'hip' and 'with it' showing they knew what 'teen angst' was all about. They were waaaay off the mark. You want to see 'real' teen angst from that period?.... watch Sal Mineo in anything he did. In 'Rebel Without A Cause' all Sal had to do was play about 8 angstlevels down from Dean and he was a 'real kid'. I watched about 15 minutes of 'East of Eden' with a group of twentysomethings and their reaction to the movie was Who's this cornball 'Dean'??? Dean's acting was dated in '1955'.... in 2011 he's a cartoon. He would have been pretty good in silent movies.The only other Kazan movie I can't watch is his 'other' movie of the same genre 'Splendor in The Grass' 'another' film that everyone else thinks is brilliant but to me is off the graph.Everything else Kazan did I can't get enough of!".

What we have here is one of the holy trinity for Dean worshipers the others being Rebel without a Cause and Giant.  Well I remember 45 years ago when James Dean was killed outside of Paso Robles.  I know that stretch of road well having spent a lot of time going between Bakersfield and San Luis Obispo but I also remember seeing this film the year before.  I was less interested in Dean's being in it because he was relatively unknown at the time having only one line in a horrible Martin and Lewis comedy That man's a professionalugh.  What really drew me into the theater was the coming to the screen of Steinbeck's long California novel East of Eden. Steinbeck had written the book several years before based on the struggle between two brothers in their quest for approval from a distant father.  I was greatly disappointed in the movie because of the radical departures from the original book but taken with the chemistry between Dean and Julie Harris.  A most underrated actress she brings the element of Eve to the dyad of the two brothers.  The favored brother Aron Steinbeck was hardly subtle with the names Caleb and Aron sons of Adam is played by Richard Davalos who? whom most of us only recognize from bit parts in Kelly's Heroes and a few others.  Veteran character and stage actor Raymond Massey does his usual excellent protrayal as does folk singer and fine actor Burl Ives.  But Jo Van Fleet dang near steals the show.  In effect I was taken by the film even though I'd read the book and was expecting a great deal more of Steinbeck and less of Kazan. Yeah I know.  Shoulda known better So impressed was I that I went to see the film again and have seen it at least a dozen times since.  The story is an old one and based on the book of Genesis but it's really even older than that.  Sibling rivalry is an ancient source of myth and is reflected by various archetypes.  That is not what makes this film great.  It is Dean Van Fleet and Julie Harris and the darkness that Kazan imbues into this story.  It is the quest for truth and the agony of discovery that makes this film work.  There's no justice here. Only the perpetual drama of human emotions.  Dean had a magic moment.  His next film Rebel became a classic and vaulted him into the league of legend. His premature death elevated him even loftier into the world of myth.  We can only wonder what would have happened if he'd have lived.  Would he have become a silly reminder of his iconic past ala Brando?  We'll never know. All we have are these three films...".

One can actually see the heat rising from the street and the cinematography makes one feel lost in the hot temperature.

James Dean gives one of the screen's finest performances and his scenes with Raymond Massey detonate with the power of emotions unchecked and real.  Julie Harris is equally remarkable as is Richard Davalos as Dean's brother who helps to lead the story directly into a parallel with the CainAbel conflict.  Jo Van Fleet deserves her Oscar and every other honor and Lois Smith breaks your heart in her small role as a trapped young girl in VanFleet's 'house'. Rosenman's scoring is likewise stunning and always 'right'.

	schema:reviewBody "East of Eden based on the novel by John Steinbeck concerns an upright father Raymond Massey and his two sons one whom he considers good Richard Davalos and another whom he considers bad James Dean. The story is influenced by the biblical story of Cain  Abel while much of the film focuses on Dean's character striving to earn the love of his father.The cast is a pretty good one. James Dean received a posthumous Oscar nomination for what was his first major film role. I think that his performance here is every bit as memorable as his work in Rebel Without a Cause. Jo Van Fleet ended up winning an Oscar for her performance while Julie Harris also delivered a fine performance. Unfortunately I found the performances of Richard Davalos  Raymond Massey too bland to stand out especially in comparison to the other cast members.Elia Kazan's direction was good enough to land a Best Director Oscar nomination but I don't think that the film looks quite as good as other films of his. The score by Leonard Rosenman is stirring and is showcased in an overture at the beginning of the film.I would certainly recommend this film to anyone wanting to know what all the fuss is about James Dean. Even if you're not interested in him particularly you'll likely find the story an enthralling one.".

The story is influenced by the biblical story of Cain  Abel while much of the film focuses on Dean's character striving to earn the love of his father.The cast is a pretty good one. James Dean received a posthumous Oscar nomination for what was his first major film role. I think that his performance here is every bit as memorable as his work in Rebel Without a Cause. Jo Van Fleet ended up winning an Oscar for her performance while Julie Harris also delivered a fine performance. Unfortunately I found the performances of Richard Davalos  Raymond Massey too bland to stand out especially in comparison to the other cast members.Elia Kazan's direction was good enough to land a Best Director Oscar nomination but I don't think that the film looks quite as good as other films of his. The score by Leonard Rosenman is stirring and is showcased in an overture at the beginning of the film.I would certainly recommend this film to anyone wanting to know what all the fuss is about James Dean. Even if you're not interested in him particularly you'll likely find the story an enthralling one.";

I don't think so.You can tell that this was not one of MGM's A List productions. No Liz Taylor Edmund Gwenn or Donald Crisp. Plus the story has been transferred to the pioneer days of the American west. The biggest recognizable star in the film besides Lassie herself actually himself since Lassie was played by Pal a male dog is Paul Kelly as an old prospector and Shep's Lassie's owner and Mr. Kelly is practically unrecognizable. He's only 52 at this point but he's donned up in whiskers and makeup that make him look like a thin version of Santa Claus. His hands clearly show he is not as old as the role he is playing.This Lassie story is a bit different besides just the move from Scotland. Lassie usually plays the passive lovable dog waiting for the goodhearted yet hardheaded Scots that are to decide her fate to come to their senses. Here Lassie has a more Clint Eastwoodlike aggressive posture towards the man who killed her master for his gold and attempted to poison her and goes full fang on the guy at every opportunity producing a very ironic and just ending. By the way who names a female dog Shep anyways??? Paul Kelly is good as the prospector and master of ShepLassie except it is clear that he doesn't trust his partner begging the question why did he make this obviously nefarious fellow a partner in the first place? Bruce Cowling is absolutely awful as the villainous partner. He has a demeanor that would be better suited to a B scifi film of the 50's rather than this action adventure film. He is always looking up and around with a horrified expression on his face as though he expects an alien spacecraft to land at any moment. Gary Gray gives a good but not great juvenile performance as the murdered prospector's grandson  I didn't find him whiny at all. Native Americans are hammily and stereotypically portrayed but at least they show them as seeming to be the only people for 100 miles around who know anything about veterinary medicine even if one good stereotype doesn't wipe out the negative ones. If you like or love the other Lassie films I'd say give this one a try. It's not boring and most of the film is focused on Lassie.".

I'm clearly too lazy to do any research here and The Painted Hills is one of those. It is irresistible to make a this movie has gone to the dogs! pun so I won't even though I technically just did. But in a way it has. Lassie playing Shep man's best friend gets top billing. THE DOG GETS TOP BILLING. Now I'm not familiar with how actors or their agents negotiate contracts but here's how it plays out in my mind MOVIE MOGUL Okay Lassie in the credits it's gonna be and with Lassie as Shep! LASSIE Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr. MOVIE MOGUL Ha ha kid calm down calm down! LASSIE Rrroo rrrrooo roooo. MOVIE MOGUL Okay I think I see. Colead billing? LASSIE Rawrf! Rawrrrrff rawrf! MOVIE MOGUL Oh God! Let go of my arm! Top billing! Top billing for you now let go of my arm!!! So the dog gets top billing and with the rest of this shellshocked cast I suppose it's understandable. We get lovable old grumpus Jonathan the prospector his young whiny and apparently orphaned friend Tommy sketchy loser Lin Taylor and lovable old religious grumpus Pilot Pete. The meat of the plot here could be summed up in a few sentences so I'll save you the actual pain of watching the movie. Jonathan is a prospector with a dog named Shep and his partner dies while he is at his claim. He gets a new partner named Lin who becomes obsessed with the gold and Jonathan for some reason gives Shep to whiny little crybaby Tommy. Lin kills Jonathan Shep sees it and Lin tries to kill Shep. Then Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy whines it gets cold and Shep carries out an elaborate plan to get revenge on Lin which he or she? does. The end.Unless you have a deep unsettling need to see a Lassie movie even then there's got to be a better Lassie movie than this just avoid The Painted Hills. When it's not dragging on marveling at Lassie's limited ability to 'act' similar in style perhaps to Keanu Reeves  always the same facial expression only the body moves setting up the obvious using several minutes of film or insulting Native Americans everywhere with its whiteactorinfacepaint Ugh! How! Me Running Bear! stereotypes The Painted Hills is fit only for Lassie fetishists or people who have some kind of connection to prospecting through their days as a grizzled old prospector lookin' fer that consarned vein of glittery gold!".

Now I'm not familiar with how actors or their agents negotiate contracts but here's how it plays out in my mind MOVIE MOGUL Okay Lassie in the credits it's gonna be and with Lassie as Shep! LASSIE Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr. MOVIE MOGUL Ha ha kid calm down calm down! LASSIE Rrroo rrrrooo roooo. MOVIE MOGUL Okay I think I see. Colead billing? LASSIE Rawrf! Rawrrrrff rawrf! MOVIE MOGUL Oh God! Let go of my arm! Top billing! Top billing for you now let go of my arm!!! So the dog gets top billing and with the rest of this shellshocked cast I suppose it's understandable. We get lovable old grumpus Jonathan the prospector his young whiny and apparently orphaned friend Tommy sketchy loser Lin Taylor and lovable old religious grumpus Pilot Pete. The meat of the plot here could be summed up in a few sentences so I'll save you the actual pain of watching the movie. Jonathan is a prospector with a dog named Shep and his partner dies while he is at his claim. He gets a new partner named Lin who becomes obsessed with the gold and Jonathan for some reason gives Shep to whiny little crybaby Tommy. Lin kills Jonathan Shep sees it and Lin tries to kill Shep. Then Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy whines it gets cold and Shep carries out an elaborate plan to get revenge on Lin which he or she? does. The end.Unless you have a deep unsettling need to see a Lassie movie even then there's got to be a better Lassie movie than this just avoid The Painted Hills. When it's not dragging on marveling at Lassie's limited ability to 'act' similar in style perhaps to Keanu Reeves  always the same facial expression only the body moves setting up the obvious using several minutes of film or insulting Native Americans everywhere with its whiteactorinfacepaint Ugh! How! Me Running Bear! stereotypes The Painted Hills is fit only for Lassie fetishists or people who have some kind of connection to prospecting through their days as a grizzled old prospector lookin' fer that consarned vein of glittery gold!";

	schema:reviewBody "Movies that were made by MGM in the 1950s and before were known for their high quality in terms of filmmaking. They were also responsible for distributing a good majority of movies featuring the famous dog Lassie. Unfortunately like any other studio they have a few bad films under their belt and one of them happened to feature Lassie. Say hi to 1951's The Painted Hills which is often considered to be the worst of the Lassie movies and for good reason.The movie goes like this Jonathan a gold prospector that hit pay dirt but unfortunately his partner has recently died leaving his only son Tommy without a father. Jonathan who is the owner of a dog named Shep played by Lassie decides to give Tommy the dog so that he won't be alone. In the meantime Jonathan gets a new partner named Lin our villain who is interested in keeping the gold all to himself and would even kill to get it all which is what he does. LassI mean Shep finds out what happened and then tries to warn Tommy. So in short it's a revenge story about a backstabbing partner whose plan is ultimately foiled and is killed by one of the most recognizable dogs in movies and television.This movie is the equivalent to that of a really bad Lassie episode in that the acting is pretty horrible as if every actor is reading off a cue card held by the director. The story as you can clearly see from the synopsis I've just given is rather basic and cookiecut that you can easily predict what will happen next making it not even worth sitting through despite its short running time of approximately one hour. That is unless you watch the film via Mystery Science Theater 3000 which is what most people have done. That's right. The movie was bad enough to warrant an MST3K episode and seeing that the movie is in the public domain it's basically open season for anyone willing to riff the hell out of it.If you find this movie in a bargain bin don't even bother picking it up. Even if you're wanting to give it to your kids for them to watch don't even bother. They'll probably want to watch something else most likely a Disney film or probably any movie other than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this 'Lassie' movie on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and suffice to say it was unlike any other Lassie movie I had seen as a child. It is by far the darkest Lassie film I had seen and Lassie does not save the day simply by barking and people figuring out that Timmy has fallen into the well. However it is not that good of a film a bit of a slow starter with a pointless plot twist or two before the epic confrontation between Lassie or Shep as it were and her owner's killer! Granted Lassie herself is a boy dog named Pal meaning the film is Shep played by Lassie played by Pal.The story has a prospector who is close to striking gold unfortunately his old partner has died leaving the son crushed. Well the prospector has a dog that he tries to give to the boy but the dog does not care too much for the new arrangements and instead goes back to her old owner. Well a man who teams up with the prospector to find the ultimate vein of gold unfortunately the man is of course greedy beyond belief and it is not too long before the prospector knows of the man's ill intent. Well not soon enough to save himself. Soon it is up to Shep the dog to avenge her owner as she must be poisoned shot and chased into the frozen mountains to finally get revenge for her owner!This made for a pretty good episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. It did start off a bit weak mind you as I was thinking that the short that preceded this film about hygiene was going to be the highlight but the film picks up greatly once Lassie's owner is killed and Lassie begins her quest for revenge. Once that begins the laughter and riffs are in high gear especially during the chase sequence as for reasons unknown the killer is more affected by the cold than is a dog that is soaking wet.So this 'Lassie' film gets points for being different I guess but it is hardly a Lassie film when the dog in the film is called Shep and the dog that is supposedly Lassie is named Pal. These days you do not get many dog stars but back in the day it was more normal. No stars would probably be caught dead having to have second billing to a dog these days including porno stars! The film had some dark elements to it so probably a bit rougher than what many parents were expecting from a Lassie film but nothing that is all that extreme by today's standards. However not a very good film either so they'd probably be better skipping this one all together.".

It's Taylor who's paranoia reached homicidal proportions who went completely postal and murdered Jonathan by pushing him off a cliff.

It's Taylor who at first was a nice guy who took over the partnership of the gold mine that Jonathan had with Tommy's dad Frank who had since passed away from Pneumonia. It was greed that took hold of Taylor who soon became so crazy that he even accused and was about to shoot that's until Jonathan stopped him the kind friendly and bible thumping Pilot Pete Art Smith over trying to steal the gold he had hidden in his cabin.

It's was local Indian Medicine Man Bald Eagle Chief Yowlachie who saved Shep's life with his home made remedy of herbs and spices which not only brought Shap back to life but finally convinced her that it was Taylor who did in her friend Jonathan and tried to do her in as well!SPOILERS With Taylor now trying to knock off Tommy who like Shep knew he murdered Jonathan Shep springs to his rescue. With a determined Shep chasing him up the snow covered painted hills Taylor's luck runs out when he finds out in trying to shoot Shepthat he's all out of ammunition. Shep not really interested in bringing Taylor back to civilization to face justice charges him causing Taylor to fall off a cliff like he pushed Jonathan to his death and die covered in the snow below.A bit hard to take in Lassie or Shep completely out of character acting more like a vicious Pitbull or Rottweiler attack dog then the sweet and loving Collie that we all grew to love over the years.

It isn't until he hits rock bottom that he agrees to join up with ruthless and cutthroat manager Bert Gordon. Gordon agrees to take him on the road to learn the ropes.

	schema:reviewBody "The Hustler is steeped in the seedy atmosphere of smokefilled pool halls in the ugly urban hinterland of America. The Ames Billiard Hall is funereal in feel.  When 'Fast Eddie' Felson walks in with Charlie his manager Charlie remarks These tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.  The film is about the talented men who perform but equally about the talentless predators who exploit them.  The habitues of the pool hall cling to the shadows.  They wince when a blind is opened and sunlight gets in.  A new hustler enters and these vultures gather silently on the margins.Eddie is the youngster hungry for glory.  He and Charlie pose as salesmen and Eddie feigns drunkenness hooking the punters by repeating an almostimpossible shot.  For all the slickness of the con Eddie is impatient for bigger things.  He wants to challenge Minnesota Fats the best hustler in the land.Newman gets his name above the title but this is a film with four exquisite pieces of acting.  Jackie Gleason as Minnesota Piper Laurie as Sarah and George C Scott playing Bert Gordon turn in wonderful performances.Eddie matures as the story progresses.  He starts as a cheap chiseller hustling ten bucks but ambition carries him to Louisville and the world of the high rollers.  Sarah's love opens emotional dimensions in him which he previously lacked.  Bert Gordon confronts him with his own spiritual inadequacies forcing him to understand himself.  Eddie is jejune in the first game against the Fat Man but by the second meeting he is emotionally strong and completely his own man.  He has made the spiritual journey from the whining everybody wants a piece of me to the inner knowledge that Sarah bequeathed him  that only those who give can truly live.Bert Gordon with his dark glasses and hawkish features is a creature of the night.  Loving the 'action' of a clash of talents but lacking any talent of his own Gordon is the predator on the sidelines.  Hearing of the new hustler's presence Gordon arrives soundlessly and sits watching intently for hours.  His dark genius sees the weakness in every soul.  In the bar when he and Eddie talk business Gordon is foreshortened to look tiny alongside the talented youngster.  For all his money and sharp wits Gordon will never be more than a parasite living off the ability of others. Finally Eddie and Fats walk into the sunlight heroes who have proved themselves.  Gordon remains perched on his gloomy barstool a prisoner in his own dark kingdom.If Sarah is the vulnerable physicallydisabled woman who relies on drink too heavily the victim of the men she encounters she is also the heart of the movie.  She destroys Gordon's certainty and she shows Eddie the meaning of love.  Her tragedy is Eddie's salvation.  She and Eddie find each other in a deserted bus station in the dead hours.  They are both lost souls Citizens of Hell.  She is the deformed girl with the empty life and he is the emotional cripple with no resources of education or character to sustain him.  They cling to each other  as if shipwrecked.  When the seduction comes Sarah hesitates.  She knows this will lead to suffering. Why me? she asks then surrenders to her fate.The time when Eddie's hands are in plaster is Sarah's brief season of happiness.  She stops drinking and even makes progress with her writing. Somebody needs her belongs completely to her.  It cannot last.I made you up Eddie Sarah tells him and in a sense she did.  She imagined him to be loyal and stable.  On the night when the truth dawns Sarah goes from feeling pretty in her new dress to being a rainsodden wreck.  She is supplanted in Eddie's attention by the sinister Gordon who asserts the new powerbalance in the railroad diningcar.  The hotel suites are adjoining and though Sarah closes all the doors she can't keep Gordon out.  By Findlay's party she has hit the bottle again.  The patterned dress which Eddie bought her a symbol of her incarceration has the shadow of the ballustrade projected onto it seemingly magnifying her sense of ensnarement.Though Jackie Gleason does very little in this film he dominates it. On screen for a fraction of the film's totality and having neither great speeches nor grand gestures he impresses by his sheer presence.  Stillness selfcontainment and an ironic amusement make Minnesota Fats the perfect foil for the angry ambitious Eddie.  In the final showdown Fats' quiet poise outshines the grandstanding of the others.  Gleason conveys beautifully the fear at the core of this big dandy.  When Eddie has him in trouble the Fat Man begins to lose his sartorial integrity as his confidence unravels.This contrast of stillness and motion is effective in the first meeting of the hustlers.  Fats and Gordon who know what they are about remain motionless and tranquil.  Eddie the incontinent wannabe gradually loses control of both mouth and limbs.  The film is rich in symbolic language. The cheap rooms which Eddie rents are mere boxes for hire like the bus station locker which he lives out of.  When he and Sarah meet for the second time the inevitability of their coupling is conveyed in a scene without words or gestures.  Eddie's plastercasts are manacles  without his hands he is nothing.  A sumptuous restaurant and a happy couple are transformed when the brutal truth emerges.  The camera angle is reversed and Eddie and Sarah are now separated by gaunt shelves of crockery.  The illusion has been shattered.  When Eddie sneaks out on the sleeping Sarah with the stake money in his hand it is the betrayal of Charlie reenacted.A marvellous film is enhanced by a superbly sleazy jazz score Kenyon Hopkins and the violence is all the more gutwrenching for being suggested rather than shown.Verdict  probably a masterpiece.".

You know the pool tables are green and the balls are multicolored but somehow the black and white perfectly matches the colorless existence of the protagonist and his supporting players.  You can smell the cigarettes taste the booze.Newman Gleason Scott and Laurie all turn in great performances.  But this movie made after the heyday of the studio players' contract still bears the hallmark of great movies from that era strong supporting performances all the way down the line.  Vincent Gardenia for pete's sake as the unlucky bartender in the first scene!  Michael Constantine as Big John. Myron McCormick as Charlie Eddie's sponsor most of the way through the movie.  And Murray Hamilton as the millionaire Southern mark.  This movie was made when supporting roles were an end in themselves by actors who believed every second they were on screen should be of high quality.The day I wrote this review  January 18 2004  The Hustler was no. 143 on the Top 250 list.  No way are there 142 better movies.".

	schema:headline " A Talented Loser";
	schema:reviewBody "It's an intriguing idea. If a person is talented that person should be a winner. And we would expect a loser to be someone who is not talented. But the idea that someone could be a talented loser is a paradox a contradiction that doesn't fit into the conventional mindset of American culture and is the basis for The Hustler a character study of an ace pool player who can't seem to win respect from his peers.The pool player is Fast Eddie Felson Paul Newman. The plot moves along by means of four secondary characters with whom Fast Eddie interacts 1 his manager Charlie 2 the veteran pool player Minnesota Fats 3 Eddie's girlfriend Sarah and 4 the money man Bert Gordon.The Hustler is very much a product of the late 50's and early 60's when progressive filmmakers were trying to buck the staid post WWII era with its reactionary Cold War mentality that resulted in strict conformity to established American values. In this film Bert Gordon and Minnesota Fats represent the establishment. Eddie Felson is the loner up against the establishment he's the renegade kid out to beat the system. Yet at every turn the establishment beats Eddie one way or another. His idealism is useless. He must conform to the establishment's rules expressed in the film as character or give up his dreams.The film is therefore very cynical and incredibly cold. From start to finish there's not an ounce of humor. It depresses the spirit. But the film is a very good metaphor for a terrible era wherein societal repression was the norm.While the story's main character may be a loser the film itself is a talented winner. The excellent BW lighting together with a jazzy score create an effectively somber and downbeat tone consistent with the oppressive political atmosphere of that era. The dialogue is sparse and incisive. And the acting is persuasive. Paul Newman is convincing as are the secondary characters. I especially liked the performance of Jackie Gleason who comes across as suave serious and in total control a great contrast to his comedic side in The Honeymooners.The Hustler is depressing and grim. But the film is very well made. It entertains in ways that are obvious and educates in ways that are subtle.".

On technical merit alone this film is a pool player's classic. Beyond that however the way Fast Eddie takes to his skills and relationships pushes this film out as a classic for the general audience. In one scene he is describing what it is like to be really good at something. It is one of the best speeches about excellence I have ever heard. This is one of my top three films.

Scott as the Hustler hustling the hustler. His performance gave the movie a gritty underworld feel to it. Piper Laury delivers a powerhouse performance as the illfated drunk girlfriend of the lead player Paul Newman. He probably delivers one of his best roles to date. Just like Robert De Niro in Raging Bull he plays a character who is incapable of handling the pressures of fame and fortune who is as George C. Scott's says A born loser. If you look in Newman's eyes during the picture you can see the troubles he is going through. He loves the girl but is unable to express this because he is afraid she will know the real him. He has to keep playing this Hustlercharacter all through his life to keep himself going. He knows nothing other than playing pool and hustling people out of their money.The cinematography was absolutely brilliant alongside the setdressing. The dirty lowlife feeling that must have hung around these dives called poolhalls was conveyed perfectly to the screen through brilliant lighting and art direction. The scenes in which Newman plays the different people at the pool table were shot and edited to near perfection which has been redone again to near perfection in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese.The music gave a real emotional feel to this moving picture. Kenyon Hopkins deserves all the credit for this.Absolutely a mustsee for everybody who like to watch movies that are worth watching.1010".

Anyone of the three main characters could fill the titular role whether it be Paul Newman's upandcomer Jackie Gleason's mantobeat or George C. Scott's behindthescenes angleshooter.These three stars allOscar nominated carry the picture both individually and collectively. The thirtyish Newman is simply a revelation to anyone me who hasn't seen him act much in his prime. He perfectly captures the smooth in control but on the edge persona of Fast Eddie who has the physical tools but not necessarily the mental skills to be a champion. Gleason likewise perfectly fills the body and clothes of Minnesota Fats with a graceful elegance uncommon to a man of his size. Scott who declined his Oscar nomination could easily have been overshadowed in his role but his subtle and shifty eyes and movements create a character that occasionally outshines his two huge costars.The Hustler reaches its zeniths when at least two of these men are on the screen. The dialogue exchanges of Newman and Scott as they feel each other out crackle with intensity. Gleason and Scott ooze wary respect for each other and Newman and Gleason combine admiration and competitiveness into one neat package from which the entire film derives its energy.A film about pool sharks seems to demand brilliant representation of its colorful world. But French cinematographer Eugene Shuftan instead opts for blackandwhite which surprisingly works wonderfully. His Oscarwinning imagery particularly excels in displaying light and shadows such as the sun streaming into smokefilled billiards halls. Shuftan accomplishes an exceptional feat using a monotone style to effectively paint vivid pictures.Despite high achievement in so many areas The Hustler suffers from Doughnut Syndrome there's a hole in the middle. The pool scenes that bracket the story are very good and one middle scene between Newman and Scott is the best of the film but the romantic portion of the story flounders. The drifter Newman falls for a fellow drifter Piper Laurie for no apparent reason other than alcohol and the fact that they're both alone. To their credit they do acknowledge that their relationship is flimsy and depraved but the movie squanders too much times on this waferthin story arc rather than stick with what works.Those parts succeed wildly about as enjoyable as any scenes ever shot but without adequate buttressing material the film as a whole falls short of the high watermark left by its parts.Bottom Line Phenomenal at times but subpar at others the male performances carry the film. Seven of ten but definitely worth viewing if you haven't seen it yet.".

Why is Eddie so selfdestructive? He has Minnesota Fats ostensibly the country's greatest player beaten in the first marathon match only to drink himself into insensibility and let Fats off the hook. Throughout the movie Eddie is surrounded by other people who are selfdestructive or only interested in making a buck off of him. Even Charlie his original manager Myron McCormick in a terrific roleneeds him for a meal ticket. Bert his second manager is a slithering calculating parasite who uses everyone around him. Sara Eddie's pathetic girlfriend is going through life in an aimless alcoholic haze. The movie really lets you into the lives of these people who live on the margins of society. The cinematography is outstanding the settings and mood of the movie draw you in totally. The acting is uniformly outstanding from top to bottom. Great movies get great performances from the minor characters too. Vincent Gardenia Michael Constantine Murray Hamilton and McCormick are perfect in the smaller roles while Paul Newman Jackie Gleason Piper Laurie all getting welldeserved Oscar nominations and George C. Scott are indelible in the major roles. Even boxer Jake LaMotta has a cameo as a bartender. Can Eddie finally overcome being a born loser? Can love redeem any of these lost people? What makes a person a champion? Is it talent alone or does a champion need some inner demon that can only be defeated by pursuing victory at all costs?".

What makes a person a champion? Is it talent alone or does a champion need some inner demon that can only be defeated by pursuing victory at all costs?";

It is more about the life around it Fast Eddie Felson's life in particular. Paul Newman plays this man in a terrific way. Eddie is a great pool player he could be the best if only he had more character. This is what Bert Gordon George C. Scott tells him. It is true. Eddie is a selfdestructive man. He drinks too much and he does not know when to stop. At one point early in the movie he is playing the man who is considered the best of the country Minnesota Fats Jackie Gleason and he has won 18.000 dollars but he gets too drunk and loses everything.Minor spoilers. Then he meets a girl Sarah Laurie Piper who like him drinks too much. They start living together and it seems that Eddie is changing but we suspects he is always thinking about playing Minnesota Fats again. Eddie gets in some trouble his thumbs are broken and after this he decides that he needs Bert Gordon to get back on track again. Gordon made him an offer before his thumbs were broken which seemed pretty unfair but now Eddie thinks he has no choice. He has the woman he loves on one side who could get him out of trouble and the game of pool and his desire to be the best on the other. What will happen is for you to see.The interesting story about this selfdestructive man is also about the selfdestructive woman and the events around her are almost inevitable. The hero is a hero in most ways but it is a hero who must face his weaknesses instead of discovering his strong points. This kind of hero is rare these days. Paul Newman shows us why he became such a great star with this memorable role.Other things are very good too here. Although the game is never explained it is fun to watch every shot some of them almost impossible. The black and white cinematography looks great. Fast Eddie Felson would return in Martin Scorsese's 'The Color of Money' a lesser film in some points but very good as well.".

Watching this for the first time i was expecting a movie full of games of pool with trick shots galore with Newman the hero getting the girl and beating Fats the champ role credits...a nice little feel good story. wow was i ever mistaken and very pleasantly surprised to be. The Hustler is filled with great performances Newman Gleason Scott and Laurie all give great GREAT performances that makes a fairly simplistic plot with little real action absolutely riveting to watch. Newman is great as Eddie the born loser with talent coming out of his ears but not enough brains to know how to utilise it best. Gleason is great and says a lot with simple body language more than the few lines he has. Scott is phenomenal as always as a soulless gambler only looking out for himself and dragging all those around him down as well. Laurie is perfectly suited to her character a desperate lonely alcoholic who seems to know her relationship with Eddie is bad for both of them yet is unwilling or unable to break free.The Hustler is amazingly written with quotable lines and dialogue that just cuts deep into the cores of these characters as they interact with each other and are forced to show their true colours we see the true people underneath as the facade is stripped away. These are damaged broken confused troubled souls who seem to gravitate towards one another as if they can sense a kindred spirit. I have to say that the reason these characters resonated so strongly with me is because as unpleasant as it is to do so i can see elements of myself in each character.This kind of movie is one that would be nigh on impossible to get made in contemporary Hollywood. A downbeat story from start to finish with unlikeable characters it is one of the greatest films i have ever seen. an absolute classic in the purest sense.".

Newman is still in his raw justbecomingastar period of his career having completed The Long Hot Summer and then Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and having finally figured out his tumultuous love life leaving his wife and kids for Joanne Woodward with whom he would forge a lasting relationship of fifty years. Newman cements his position as one of Hollywood's finest leading men with Hustler although the script leaves him a little bit short of material. But Hustler is considered a classic with nary a mediocre performance in the bunch. The cinematography is a bit short on the pool hustling scenes with the later remake albeit in color better succeeding in dramatizing the action and flow of the pool games.For buffs who are watching this slightly darker movie after the Tom Cruise version The Color of Money where Newman trades places with George C. Scott to play Cruise's handler it bears noting that this black and white classic is a bit slower paced taking the necessary time to build up the characters and their associated pathologies although younger viewers may find this offputting having been fed altogether too much action in the first five minutes of everything cinematic while just ignoring character depth.Consider that The Hustler is a must see just like Breakfast at Tiffanys or Raging Bull in that it marks the beginning of a screen acting legend and suggests his future prowess while providing a gripping storyline along side some really talented actors and suggesting its rightful place in cinematic black  white classics.".

Fast Eddie Paul Newman is a handsome honest looking guy who hangs out in seedy pool halls bars and motels so he can hustle people at pool. He pretends to be drunk or impaired so the denizens of these places will look at him and see easy money. Once they are hooked Eddie employs his great skill and beats them easily. Eddie is so good at this that in some cases the mark doesn't even realize he's been hustled.Merely beating common people out of their money is not enough for Fast Eddie however. After what seems to have been years of hustling people he decides to go after Minnesota Fats Jackie Gleason the man who is supposed to be the best pool player in the country.After his match with Fats Fast Eddie ceases to travel. Before long he meets Sarah Parker Piper Laurie a depressed alcoholic and moves in with her. Eventually he prepares to return to the world of pool upsetting his fragile lover. The conflict between the two sides of Eddie's personality emotionless hustler and passionate lover leads to the climax of the film.Every character in The Hustler is a hustler of some sort. Fast Eddie makes a living hustling and his relationship with Sarah begins as a hustle. Sarah's own hustle involves her invention of a character that she pretends to be all the time instead of being herself. Everything she tells Fast Eddie in early scenes is later revealed as a lie ironically including the part about her past career as an actress. Eddie's manager Bert Gordon George C. Scott hustles Eddie by mocking him at certain times to keep him in control. Even Minnesota Fats hustles Eddie in subtle ways by acting as if he is in control during their contests.Essentially The Hustler is a character driven film about Fast Eddie's struggle to find meaning in his own life. He has to choose between success in pool or his relationship with Sarah. This conundrum and his desire to prove himself torments Eddie but the decision is ultimately taken away from him and Eddie learns the bitter lesson that an individual doesn't always have time to make his own decisions.For those looking for a grimy cynical character study seasoned with a pinch of melodrama The Hustler is a great choice. Those looking for a glossy feel good film should look elsewhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Positives The cinematography deserved all of its Oscar and George C. Scott and Jackie Gleason are majestic. When they're on screen or the story picks up it's a gripping movie. There's not a duff turn among the supporting cast either.Negatives Was Newman trying to be Brando? Because for me his performance bombs  he looks like a nerdy college kid trying to act tough the cockiness is totally forced and overplayed. And what are the redeeming features of Piper Laurie's character that Eddie puts up with her? She goes around being a mouse and bringing everybody down the wrong sort of drunk for the story. These tough guys would have found a goodtime gal or at least told her to cheer up once in a while. If Eddie's trying to help her because he feels the need to help himself it doesn't come over in the script. Her aspirations to becoming a writer consist of four lines typed up one drunken afternoon and the three tendollar words on the mirror. That's pantomime. There's no hint that she knows she's deceiving herself or drinking secretly or that she has any inner pain at all  she's just grumpy ALL the time. She had polio and her father died  that's it? Maybe it's the hairdo. Sarah's misery is all taken as read same as Eddie's genius he never practices and the characters come across as halfbaked. Sarah's story also steals the focus from Eddie she does make a far bigger sacrifice after all. But because the character is so thinly written there's no chemistry between her and anybody. In fact the only dramatic tension is in the pool contests which may make you feel 'The Hustler' is better than it is. Presumably this movie was part of the early 60's gritty realism trend in drama but these preppy actors attempting a methody thing with the progressively more overripe script just come across as pretentious. 'The Cincinnatti Kid' is a far better sports drama of the time. 'The Hustler' tries to do too much.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hustler is seen as a well respected getting Oscar nominations and making Paul Newman's name as an actor. Here is a film noir style film with gritty flawed characters looking at working class culture. It made during a great period of cinema.The film tells the story of a small time pool hustler Fast Eddie Felson Paul Newman who had been traveling around America making a lot of money and wanting to challenge Minnesota Fats Jackie Gleason the best pool player in America. After initial success Fats beats Eddie with him being battered and beaten. He ends up forming a relationship with an alcoholic woman Sarah Piper Laurie a woman who is beaten down by life. They both help each other and seem in love but Eddie does the only thing he can do hustle getting himself in dangerous. In a bar Eddie meets Bert Gordon George C. Scott a gambler who offers to back Eddie up and give him his chance to beat Fats.The film is considered by some a sports movie but the film isn't. It is a character drama it is about the broken American dream like the writer John Steinbeck focused on. Many of the characters are flawed in some way. Eddie is a very arrogant character who doesn't know where to stop and is almost on the path to selfdestruction. Sarah is an alcoholic who has given up on her dreams. Bert Gordon is a user a man who only thinks of his own selfinterest an good villain. The Hustler strongest element is the acting with top performance from all the actors. They made you believe in their characters. The director Robert Rossen does a good job using fading shots strong fixed shots adding to the atmosphere and does well filming the pool scenes.They are some problems with the film. It is a little too long and seems unfocused. Just cutting a few minutes properly would have made this a better film.I personally the grim and gritty reality that this film sets out. This is a worthy film from the film noir school.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hustler had the misfortune to be up against films like West Side Story and Judgment at Nuremberg in 1961. Another year it might have carried away more Academy gold than just for black and white cinematography and for black and white artset direction.A lot of people think The Hustler is about pool what it really is about is obsession at being the best and how it can cost you in other things that really matter.Paul Newman as Eddie Felson is one such obsessed creature. He wants to be the best pool player ever. To do that in the words of that eminent 20th century philosopher Ric Flair to be the man you got to beat the man.The man is Jackie Gleason playing the legendary Minnesota Fats champion pool player of all. They have a marathon match in which Newman seems to have the upper hand but Gleason pulls it out in the end. Nevertheless Newman comes to the attention of George C. Scott a gambler who wants to use him for his own ends.Jackie Gleason and George C. Scott both got nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category but lost to George Chakiris in West Side Story. Scott is a dangerous and malevolent figure he was probably at his most evil on the screen in this role. Piper Laurie got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and this turned out to be her career role. She's an alcoholic floozy with some dreams that keep her ego afloat but she loves and respects Newman. They complement each other's needs and Newman finds that out way too late. Laurie unfortunately lost to Sophia Loren in Two Women.But what I liked best about The Hustler is the contrast between Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason. Gleason is on screen at the beginning and at the end. Note how he sits apart from everyone in the pool room. No social life no people in his orbit it's lonely at the top. And to stay there Gleason dedicates himself to pool to the exclusion of everything else.Yet this is who the ambitious but very vulnerable Newman wants to be. In creating his character Newman gave it equal doses of ambition and vulnerability both working at the same time. Not an easy thing to do but Newman is at the top of his game as Eddie Felson. Sadly Newman lost the Oscar that year to Maximilian Schell in Judgment at Nuremberg.But eventually some 25 years later Paul Newman got the Oscar for playing a more mature Eddie Felson in The Color of Money. A kind of justice certainly few players ever get that kind of opportunity again.The Hustler was also up for Best Picture and Best Director for Robert Rossen. It lost to West Side Story in both categories. Both films hold up well after almost half a century that was a tough call for Academy voters.The Hustler is about pool the way Moby Dick is about a whale. And there both classics.".

Newman's performance is one of the greatest but he's young still coming into his own and has a few awkward heavyhanded momentsfor example the I'm the best you've ever seen speech is done awkwardly in a Brooklynesque accent that's just weird. Having BEEN a hustler Gleason's performance is massively confident flawless. Iconic performances Ralph Kramden Minnesota Fats and Sheriff Beauford T. Justice Bandit I onlythis guy was a GREAT actor with the right material. At one point in the late 50s I think he was considering playing an oldtime ward pol in a John O'Hara script.

	schema:reviewBody "The Hustler is one of those rare films that has been so well crafted that it is lauded by both critics and savvy audiences alike as a benchmark film the quintessential movie about pool its players and hustlers and the obsession and drive involved with wanting to be the greatest. What makes a movie great is when all the elements come together so beautifully from the casting acting directing cinematography editing etc. that it works virtually flawlessly both as a whole and as individual elements. The Hustler is one of those films. You could argue how you could have made it differently but you would be extremely hard pressed or delusional to claim you could have made it better. As anyone who has seriously acted or otherwise participated in a film or play will tell you once enough of the right elements have come into play the film or play will take on a life of its own and all the strengths will make each other stronger and better the rare phenomenon of a group of individuals working on the highest common denominator as opposed to the too frequent degenerating into the lowest common denominator. The casting is great with not a single weak performance anywhere from a young Paul Newman when he was at the peak of his craft down to Jake LaMotta the real Raging Bull who plays a bit part as a bartender. The acting is so often brilliantly understated you might think you are watching a documentary especially since the film is shot in stark black and white. The unflinchingly honest realism is one of the underlying elements that gives this film such great life. None of the characters or situations are glamorized including the love between Eddie Newman and Sarah Piper Laurie. They are two lost souls who are drawn together by their shared angst and alcoholism yet develop a true powerful love that is heartfelt and realistic. They don't magically make each other perfect but they do bring each other some happiness and relief from their loneliness. Jackie Gleason is perfectly cast as Minnesota Fats partly because he was The Great One Jackie Gleason but also because he really knew the game of pool. Probably Holloywood's greatest all time pool player in real life he hustled full grown men when he was an eight year old kid. Incidentally both Newman and Gleason did their own pool shooting in the movie adding to the movie's realism. George C. Scott plays Bert Gordon the powerful dangerous hoodlum who controls the money and action for both Eddie and Fats. Scott gives such a fine performance you could easily imagine he would have been a real life Bert Gordon if he hadn't been an actor. If you want light shallow fare then The Hustler is not for you. But if you are looking for a great honest movie that will haunt you as you remember many of the moments in dark poolrooms where everyone smoked and drank too much back when they were socially encouraged and viewed as relatively harmless a film that neither preaches nor glamorizes it just shows what is powerfully and unapologetically so you are forced to draw your own conclusions as you see that everything has its price and that even for the supposed winners there are no magical happily ever after scenarios where everyone and everything is beautiful and perfect but rather flawed and struggling to find an elusive state they will probably never achieve then you will truly enjoy The Hustler a great film.".

There simply is no comparison. Rent or buy both and see for yourself. No question the first movie had the better acting in it George C.

Scott. He seems to have survived in Color but it is unfortunate he did not allude to anyone who was in the first movie particularly Sarah. I first saw The Hustler when it came out in 1961 and now that I own the DVD I plan to enjoy it many times. It depicted a very small world but it was a world made up of people like you and I. The ending was classic. In spite of Eddie's defeat of Fats life seems to go on. Fats goes home Bert goes back to his chair the spectators of the game shuffle off into the nothingness from which they came and Eddie moves out into his new life but with hope.

In no other movie has there been such a universal theme so well portrayed. The theme here is what makes a winner what defines a loser.  The answer is character. How do we obtain that elusive ring? Through the crucible of disaster? Of a love lost? By selling out?The pool game in this movie is merely a convenient prop. This movie is NOT about pool.  We have seen this shoot out before.  The fast young guy challenges the king. King of the Hill is a nice term for boys growing up. Some gain the maturity to move on to quit using people for selfish gain. Tevis  Rossen state it takes character to overcome those early base animal instincts and to find inside ourselves there is more than raw physical talent that makes us winners. How many times have you read about a sports team They have no character.'It could be anything other than a pool game business brick laying' a jockey.'  The most telling statement was delivered by the character Bert Gordon George C. Scott to  Fast Eddie Paul Newman after Eddie's ego got him humbled and his thumbs broken hustling suckers.   This read  life isn't football you don't get paid for yardage.' Just count the cash. And isn't that life in 1999? Just count the cash.  There are so many dialogue lines that that just hammer the senses.  Like  You know what beat you Eddie? Character.But there is another side to this. Because as Fast Eddie Felsen states Paraphrasing....If I take that then she never lived she never died.... Eddie doesn't sellout to cash he already sold out a greater value too late does he realize it and finds some pride gained through newly found inner strength. Character maybe?Yeah Eddie there is more than cash and technical talent to life.The acting absolutely brilliant. Newman's best. He had the game face and demeanor of a dominant aggressor.  Everything in this movie is what life is  Power. It is at times subtle linear abstract existential They wear masks Eddie. Piper Laurie delivers fragility and vulnerability better than Leigh in Streetcar.'  Scott is the loser and is stunning in role.  Gleason is the mountain of a man Newman had to climb' over to get to the top.  It is all here in one superlative package of cinematic art.The best ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hustler 1961  out of 4 'Fast' Eddie Felson Paul Newman shows up to play the legendary Minnesota Fats Jackie Gleason in a game of pool and soon the hotshot realizes that there's more to winning than just talent. After some time off the hustler winds up with a woman Piper Laurie who suffers from alcohol abuse but even worse is when he teams up with a gambler George C. Scott.Robert Rossen's THE HUSTLER is without question one of the greatest films of its type. Most people are connected to it because of its story of a hustler and the gambling aspect but there are some of the greatest performances you're ever going to see on display here as well as a pretty depressing look at losers. Throughout the movie Felson is constantly called a loser which is a term that fits the majority of the characters in this rather grim dark and depressing film.For me the greatest thing here are the performances with Newman easily leading the way. It's easy to see why this is the film that turned Newman into a superstar. Up until this point he had played a fair share of troubled rebels but everything in him just came together for this role. He's certainly very believable as this young guy who can't seem to stay out of his own way when it comes to trouble. This is a very troubled character and the actor perfectly nails every aspect of it. Gleason will always be known as a comedic actor but he could nail drama when he needed and this is the perfect example. It certainly doesn't hurt that the two actors were also great pool players and this brings a real nature to the film.Laurie is rather heartbreaking in her role as the drunk and then you've got Scott playing one of the biggest snakes in film history. There's no question that his Burt character is one of the great villains in film history. Myron McCormick is excellent in his small role and then you've got a young Murray Hamilton. THE HUSTLER also benefits from some wonderful cinematography that perfectly captures this pool world. I mean has there ever been a better example of why BW is so great? Add in the terrific score and you've really got something special.THE HUSTLER is a classic film that constantly gets better each time you view it.".

The Beast From Hollow Mountain is one of those minor league yet highly enjoyable attempts to combine the two favorite elements of 12 to 15 year old boys when we went to the movies back in the midfifties cowboys and dinosaurs. We knew Guy Madison well from his long run Wild Bill Hickock TV series which had precious little to do with the real life of that historic character but was plenty of fun all the same. Here he's a range rider who discovers that his cattle are disappearing. Could it be outlaws? No the title creature who attacks Madison a cute little Mexican kid the gorgeous Patricia Medina and a whole host of vaqueros. There is as was the case back then precious little dinosaur footage for the way they kept costs down back then was to 'tease' you with distant growls but avoid showing you the real thing for as long as possible. After about an hour of this you got maybe fifteen minutes of actual footage with the creature who has the weirdest wildest tongue of any dinosaur in movie history chasing after Guy and friends with the swiftness of a professional track star. And it's a good thing they keep him offscreen because he's at best semiconvincing when you do see him. That doesn't make this brightly colored film and less fun to watch.

I finally caught it again on DVR on TCM Thur 27 Jun 2013. For what is billed as the first Cinemascope and Color dinosaur movie Beast has rough goodness.And it is better than I remember. Surprised me. The dinosaur effects are some what better than Dinosaurus! 1960 apparently the reviewers panning the FX have not seen Dinosaurus! but it is not as good as what Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen did together in Irwin Allen's Animal World 1956. I think the Beast... FX were billed as RegiScope animation in depth.I have read that Willis O'Brien's cowboys and dinosaurs idea had been kicking around since before his Mighty Joe Young another movie where O'Brien and Harryhausen worked together. And after O'Brien's death Harryhausen decided to make his mentor's unmade pet project as The Valley of Gwangi.The dinosaur in Beast... appears late and the conflict between the gringo rancher Ryan from Texas and the Mexican rancher Enrique and the growing romance between Ryan and Sarita Enrique's betrothed occupies the first two thirds or three fourths of the movie. Mysterious deaths of cattle are attributed to rustlers and the ranchers' rivalry. But after the steerchomping Beast makes his appearance he has lotsa screen time in the last part of the film. OK I concede the tongue gets to be a bit much in some scenes. Looks to me like the tongue was rotoscoped onto the sequences shot with replacement animation.What has stayed with me from seeing this film over fifty years ago is the scene where Sarita and the kid Panchito are besieged in a cabin by the Beast. That was scary then and is still is a moment or that may be my nostalgia acting up again.".

	schema:headline " Mexican oater with tackedon dinosaur action";
	schema:reviewBody "One of two 'cowboys vs. dinosaurs' movies penned by Willis O'Brien the other being the far more successful VALLEY OF GWANGI made in 1968. THE BEAST OF HOLLOW MOUNTAIN is something of an obscure film despite its mainstream status as an average '50s Bmovie monster flick. For the most part the film is flawed in numerous ways and fails to deliver on the entertainment stakes until the last twenty minutes. The film was made in Mexico on the cheap and it shows with an entirely Hispanic cast aside from imported lead Guy Madison AVENGER OF THE SEVEN SEAS. Perhaps these are the reasons for its lack of popularity. Another reason is that this film is far more of a routine oater than a monster movie due to the budget or lack thereof we don't actually get to see the monster until the final twenty minutes of the movie.Up to then THE BEAST OF HOLLOW MOUNTAIN follows all the usual clichs of the western genre filling the screen with a bunch of predictable characters the noble kindly newcomer the damsel in distress the jealous Mexican bad guy the drunk the annoying little kid who screams and cries a lot. There's a hell of a lot of smalltalk going on and far too much filler especially during a neverending street party in the latter half of the movie. At least its short and you can just about get by watching it without dozing off. There are one or two notable action sequences to enliven things including a nicelychoreographed fist fight on the street and a cattle stampede from hell. There are a fair amount of real stunts involving horses which appear to be pretty dangerous and likewise a scene where villagers let off fireworks IN THEIR HANDS shows that in Mexico there are no health and safety measures to worry about.Castwise there are few surprises to be had. Everybody fulfils their own role without really standing out from the crowd. Ten minutes after the film ended I couldn't really remember a face or character which may tell you something. Guy Madison does his best with the material and goes through his familiar motions carrying off some great athletic work there too the bit where he runs and jumps on a horse is very impressive. This was just before Madison set sail for Italy and pursued his career as a villain in an assortment of swashbucklers and peplum epics for the next ten years.As for the Beast itself it turns out to be a mouldy old dinosaur inexplicably living in the mountain for thousands of years without dying of old age. The stop motion effects used to animate the beast are usually poor O'Brien should have been allowed to handle the effects himself instead of some amateur doing the job. At least the stop motion is better than the terrible rubber dinosaur feet used in the closeup shots. The last twenty minutes of the film is one longrunning action scene with the dinosaur figuring heavily in the action stakes although it may not look the best it is pretty well animated especially when we see it running after a horse. The trap our hero sets for the Beast is the cleverest thing in the movie.As a kid I was fortunate enough to catch this one on television and I loved it totally. Seeing it as an adult I am well aware of the flaws and faults but I still view it with a sentimental eye. Although the monster looks cheap at least it gets to eat a few cows and kill a couple guys and the ending will impress all but the most spoilt kids. Hardly a classic movie but a winner on the nostalgia front. They don't make 'em like this anymore that's for sure.".

Patricia Medina is more than lovely...she is a dream in color. The plot is surprisingly well thought out and the script is pure 1950's fun from start to finish. Once the action gets going it is worth the wait...a tough fist fight a couple of fast draws and some horsemanship that is very impressive. Some people complained about how the monster meets its end but I thought that it was quite a change from the usual manner in which the hero brings it down...actually something that might work if such a monster was to show up for real. In short this is NOT Valley of Gwangi or Jurassic Park but it is just good clean fun for everyone in the family! Sit down with a big bowl of popcorn a mug of Pepsi a pack of smokes turn out the lights and enjoy an hour  a half of pure fun. Don't criticize it just enjoy it.".

I remember seeing this at the theater when I was about nine years old and it frightened me terribly. That steer head! The suspense was terrificwhere is the monster? Instead of paying attention to the screen I kept looking behind me wondering if the monster was going to pounce on me from behind! However when the Beast finally appeared he was well worth waiting forgreat stopmotion special effects. I especially liked the Beast's tongue which rippled out now and then in a threatening manner. However the film has an annoying brat who must be suffered though he has one of the best scenes in the film when he turns around and seesguess what? It also has unintentional humor as the lovely lady Sarita and the boy are fleeing from the Beast and take shelter in a brokendown adobe ranch house. Even then I thought That's not much of a shelter! I'd love to see this film again. It's a natural for a rainy Saturday afternoon matine and quite good for its type.".

An intriguing premise but ultimately this movie is too long for its own good even though it lasts only 81 minutes since the dinosaur doesn't appear until the last 15 minutes. Features some half decent charming stop motion animation though the creature's lizard like tongue is just damn peculiar which naturally never reaches the level of a Ray Harryhausen movie.

	schema:reviewBody "This cowboy and dinosaur movie is better than it's reputation.  Though moving slowly in places it is capably acted and has enough action and plot development to keep both me and my 7 year old son interested. It did lose the 4 year old periodically  My only addition to other's previous comments are that I do feel the film holds up fairly well considering it's age.  The female lead is surprisingly liberated being noone's useless sex object.  She manages to make independent decisions shows that she is quite capable of taking care of herself and does not panic in the face of danger.  When the beast of the title appears she does not scream and panic or fall helplessly to the ground as so many 50's heroines would do instead her reaction is one of realistic shock and brief fear followed by quick and decisive action.  She even manages to evade the monster for an extended period without tripping or twisting her ankle.  during this whole movie she does not do anything stupid or anything contrived to serve as a plot device.  The hero is also fairly realistic.  He is neither a chauvinist nor a stereotype.  We see that while he is determined to fight for his own rights he will concede and consider a course of action that will benefit those people he cares for.  He is strong and confident without being overly macho and he is intelligent and thoughtful.  I found the other characters were treated with respect also.  There is no odious comedy relief.  Even the drunken father is handled with care and not a caricature.  The little boy is likeable not annoying as is often the case in this sort of vehicle.  I found the wedding festival which annoyed one reviewer to be colorful and entertaining.  A welcome surprise in a movie of this type.  Finally although we are forced to wait a long time for the appearance of our monster and the first appearance is much too abrupt once it appears it is almost never off the screen and is certainly entertaining.  Nit pickers will of course have a field day with the effects.  They are after all none too realistic.  However the effects do have a unique sort of charm.  The true nature of all of these effect sequences is clouded in rumour and innuendo.  It is my understanding from various interviews and articles that when the producers bought the story outline from Willis O'Brien that they also purchased some test sequences which he had created.  The rest of the scenes were then produced by the method described in other reviews whereas static sculptures in various positions were substituted frame by frame.  If you watch closely it does seem that there may be more than one dinosaur which do not quite match each other and a few scenes stand out in their fluidity.  The running sequences mentioned by another reviewer are obviously much smoother of motion than most of the jerkier scenes.  Of course the big rubberboot feet are obvious.  As for the tongue. Both of my kids loved it! Kids know fun when they see it!".

This is one of the few nonHarryhausen stopmotion films produced during the 1950s.  The original concept was bought from Willis O'Brien by Edward and William Nassour but they reneged on their promise to hire O'Brien to do the animation.   The Nassours did it themselves.  The animation is extremely rough but the model of the tyrannosaurus is pretty good except for its excessively long tongue  it looks like a long red tentacle!Be prepared for a long wait before the dinosaur shows up the first two thirds of the film is pure Western soap opera and endless filler scenes of a Mexican fiesta.  The dinosaur doesn't actually make an appearance until the last twenty minutes of the film.  The climax however is action packed  a running battle on the open range between a hungry dinosaur and the cowboy hero Guy Madison star of TV's Wild Bill Hickok' from 1954 to 1957. Patricia Medina is the lovely heroine.Watch for a scene in which the tyrannosaurus runs after a galloping horse the animation was done with a series of plaster models each one posed at a different point in the running reptiles stride.  Special effects processing was handled by Jack Rabin and Louis DeWitt Kronos' and Atomic Submarine'.TRIVIA NOTE FOR TRUE SCIFI FANS The TRex in this movie is just one of many scifi monsters that were defeated by actors who achieved fame in cowboy roles.  In Tarantula' the spider is destroyed by a bomb dropped by pilot Clint Eastwood.  The Martians in War of the Worlds' are pitted against Gene Barry star of TV's Bat Materson'.

	schema:headline " Great Story by Willis O'Brien but what happened to the StopMotion Animation Work?";
	schema:reviewBody "I got this movie a long time ago on VHS from Incredibly Strange Filmworks who deals with rare SciFi Horror Classics  more. I got it for Christmas one year I believe. I saw it it was pretty good I was disappointed by the StopMotion Animation I was used to seeing good smooth animation from Willis O'Brien  Pete Peterson also Ray Harryhausen  David Allen. Jim Danforth is also one of the best won 2 Oscars. I didn't know of him at the time though. Anyway it is a SciFi  Western  Thriller about a Dinosaur hiding out in Hollow Mountain  the swamps  only coming out during times of drought to feed on the local Cattle. Good script by O'Brien. Edward Nassour who Directed also did The StopMotion Work which is too jerky not very good animation. Willis O'Brien  Pete Peterson should of did the animation I heard that the budget was too low so O'Brien turned it down. I guess that makes sense to do good smooth animation u need a lot of time. Nassour didn't have that time  Budget. The next year's The Black Scorpion 1957 was done by O'Brien  Peterson excellent Animation up their with the best StopMotion Work. Obviously with Scorpion they had the time  the budget to make good effective animation. When it comes to StopMotion to make it good u need time  a lot of money in those days. Nassour obviously didn't have it. The Allosaurus looks really nice  detailed I am sure nice armature  the rest was great  very detailed. Just Nassour didn't know what he was doing with the StopMotion Work. It is an Allosaurus too not a TRex I am sick of reading these other comments saying it's a TRex if u know dinosaurs like me count the fingers a Rex has 2 Fingers an Allosaurus has 3 fingers. In the film it has three so it's an Allosaurus. Same with The Valley Of Gwangi 1969 which was 100 times better of a SciFi  Western  Thriller with more dinosaurs  brilliant StopMotion Work from the master Ray Harryhausen. Gwangi was also an Allosaurus. Anyway Hollow Mountain is alright it isn't the greatest animation but it is decent I guess. With the budget  time that's all that could be done so. Any O'Brien  Peterson Harryhausen Allen or Danforth Film is far better cause they are among the StopMotion Masters. Nassour was a Director  isn't known for animation he just did it cause he couldn't get anyone else Harryhausen would of probably turned it down as well. Anyway Earth vs. The Flying Saucers 1956 came out  he was already probably working on 20 Million Miles To Earth which came out the previous year 1957. It is still a good combination  story it isn't the worst Dinosaur Movie I have seen worse. It just isn't as good as u would expect especially for Dino  StopMotion Fans. I have this film on DVDR Pan  Scan Version from Flix Movie Channel it is on their often so if u wanna check it on it's on their a lot. I also have a VHS Transfer on DVDR of The 2.351 LetterBox Version. Anyway 5 out of 10 for this. Thought I would mention I just recently got on a website like eBay called ioffer a far surperior Laserdisc Transfer of the film on DVDR in LBOX 2.351 also includes a nice menu with chapter stops  Trailer. It was only 10 bucks too in all with shipping beat that! Plus I got 2 other SciFi Films with it for free The Cosmic Monsters 1958  Fire Maidens From Outer Space 1956 Cosmic I really like but Fire Maidens was alright they also have the trailers along with nice menus.".

Jim Danforth is also one of the best won 2 Oscars. I didn't know of him at the time though. Anyway it is a SciFi  Western  Thriller about a Dinosaur hiding out in Hollow Mountain  the swamps  only coming out during times of drought to feed on the local Cattle. Good script by O'Brien. Edward Nassour who Directed also did The StopMotion Work which is too jerky not very good animation. Willis O'Brien  Pete Peterson should of did the animation I heard that the budget was too low so O'Brien turned it down. I guess that makes sense to do good smooth animation u need a lot of time. Nassour didn't have that time  Budget. The next year's The Black Scorpion 1957 was done by O'Brien  Peterson excellent Animation up their with the best StopMotion Work. Obviously with Scorpion they had the time  the budget to make good effective animation. When it comes to StopMotion to make it good u need time  a lot of money in those days. Nassour obviously didn't have it. The Allosaurus looks really nice  detailed I am sure nice armature  the rest was great  very detailed. Just Nassour didn't know what he was doing with the StopMotion Work. It is an Allosaurus too not a TRex I am sick of reading these other comments saying it's a TRex if u know dinosaurs like me count the fingers a Rex has 2 Fingers an Allosaurus has 3 fingers. In the film it has three so it's an Allosaurus. Same with The Valley Of Gwangi 1969 which was 100 times better of a SciFi  Western  Thriller with more dinosaurs  brilliant StopMotion Work from the master Ray Harryhausen. Gwangi was also an Allosaurus. Anyway Hollow Mountain is alright it isn't the greatest animation but it is decent I guess. With the budget  time that's all that could be done so. Any O'Brien  Peterson Harryhausen Allen or Danforth Film is far better cause they are among the StopMotion Masters. Nassour was a Director  isn't known for animation he just did it cause he couldn't get anyone else Harryhausen would of probably turned it down as well. Anyway Earth vs. The Flying Saucers 1956 came out  he was already probably working on 20 Million Miles To Earth which came out the previous year 1957. It is still a good combination  story it isn't the worst Dinosaur Movie I have seen worse. It just isn't as good as u would expect especially for Dino  StopMotion Fans. I have this film on DVDR Pan  Scan Version from Flix Movie Channel it is on their often so if u wanna check it on it's on their a lot. I also have a VHS Transfer on DVDR of The 2.351 LetterBox Version. Anyway 5 out of 10 for this. Thought I would mention I just recently got on a website like eBay called ioffer a far surperior Laserdisc Transfer of the film on DVDR in LBOX 2.351 also includes a nice menu with chapter stops  Trailer. It was only 10 bucks too in all with shipping beat that! Plus I got 2 other SciFi Films with it for free The Cosmic Monsters 1958  Fire Maidens From Outer Space 1956 Cosmic I really like but Fire Maidens was alright they also have the trailers along with nice menus.";

	schema:reviewBody "The 50's is one of my favorite eras for horror and scifi as most of my fond memories as a kid come from watching Harryhausen flicks and Universal Horror movies of that time frame thanks to my father introducing me to them of course Im not that old. Along the way there was some really good ones and then there were others like the film here Im reviewing TBFHM.The story has a basic premise a Mexican village has a legend that when the waters lower a creature comes out of an unexplored mountain and looks for food anywhere it can get it. Like a lot of the 50's monster films this would be enough to satisfy and entertain. Top that off with stop motion effects and your thinking pure 50's fun rightwrong. The movie also has another story of an angry cattle herder feuding with another herder to gain a monopoly on the cattle business in the area. This part of the story is focused on for nearly the first 60 minutes only briefly bringing up the monster that the title describes.As a western which the movie predominately is it really isn't that good. As a monster movie it is not good either. The monster which finally shows up in the last 20 minutes is more or less to be a TRex. It is a very unconvincing stop motion sub par on every level and the way the monster is finally defeated is so stupid you have to see it to believe it. The funny thing about the TRex is he has a tongue that Gene Simmons would be envious of and at times they us a guy in rubber monster legs and feet to show it walking another effect that added a level of badness to the movie.In the end there is not much here to see. several of the cast would go on to star in the better stop motion monster gone amok film The Black Scorpion. This seemed like a warm up to that film. If you want to see the best cowboy monster movie out there see The Valley of Gwangi which is light years ahead of this dreck. A lot of talking with very little action and the action when there being of the very lame variety I have no choice but to give TBFHM 310 Bad one of the worst 50's stop motion monster films. despite a respectable cast the story and pacing were dreadful along with the special effects.".

I think it was simply a time of adjustment for him and I cannot recommend this even though I saved it for decades.

Irne Jacob also the star of Red handles a double role as two women cut from the same metaphysical cloth  the Polish Veronika and the French Vronique. Her presence as both women is at once whimsically childlike and sensually melancholic relentlessly alluring it is easy to see why she became Kieslowski's muse. Jacob is perfectly fluid in the shift between characters an embodiment of ideal femininity as dreamlike as the tone of the entire film.Actor and director are symbiotic relying on hazy autumnal ambiance and mood for narrative utilizing a subtle minimalist approach to dialogue. This is fine art unlike heavyhanded Hollywood productions. The tone is consistently ambiguous  emotionally resonant to be sure but beyond a vaguely somber wistful undercurrent the movie allows the viewer to fill the empty space with his or her own thoughts and feelings. It's a true testament to Kieslowski's mastery and few films are ever so transcendentally sublime.The lack of this masterpiece's availability on DVD is a sad affair. There are rumors of a release in 2005 but for fans of movies like Amlie hungry for something with a little more depth The Double Life of Vronique comes most highly recommended  even if you have to search high and low for a copy on VHS.".

Had Juliette Binoche also been cast in the role of Vronique as I understand that Krzysztof originally had intended the similarities had been even greater. She was however occupied with shooting Les Amants du PontNeuf at the time I believe and so Krzysztof opted for the less experienced Irne. I don't think the film is any worse for it she is brilliant and not just a pretty face as some people put it but a very intelligent and aware actress as anyone who has seen her interview for the Red DVD release should discover if they haven't already.In short a wonderful film wonderful music great acting.

Veronique in turn for some reason realizes that she has to give up her own singing career and seemingly without a single moment of regret instead dedicates herself to teaching the music of Van den Budenmaier to untalented bratty schoolchildren. There is little doubt after watching the movie that the Polish Veronika did indeed somehow die so that the French Veronique might live.The opening sequence of the movie also contains the outline of Christ's life. Veronika is shown the star that will start Chrismas Eve oh the horrifically nonsensical astronomy we teach our children... but I digress.   and immediately afterwords we are taken to France where the child Veronique is being told about the leaves of spring.

I think the film is more accessible for european viewers the same way Dawn by law might be for american viewers I cant bear that pretentious american underground movies at all with cool men swearing all the time trying to be funny... I cant identify with most of nineties american characters. There are many american art house films buffs as well so I cant say this is a general fact its just my view anyway.Regarding the development of the characters Tsylia probably couldnt understand at the beginning of the film how both women are described so poeticly. Weronicka is watching at the stars while Veronique is watching the leaves fall. I see this is not evident but it  says a lot about the two. Weronicka is more spiritual magical and Veronique is more practical more down to earth. If you cannot see the metaphores throughout the film you will not grasp anything about the development of the characters thats for sure. Furthermore Irene Jacob performance is sublime you can see on her face so many difficult to express sensations shes not just a beautiful face as it has been stated below I can name hundreds of pretty american girls on stupid films I was shocked to read Irene Jacob is just pretty couldnt these people see shes a valuable actress as well. In any case shes pretty in the sense Catherine Deneuve is I mean shes not the common beatiful woman you can see by his gestures that she feels alone in the world that she feels the fullness of life ... She sometimes seems like an angel in this film Weronicka.Im an atheist but I admit the religious or spiritual feeling of the film engages anyone. The film evokes the idea that gifted people such this soprano singer have a spare part somewhere in the world the same way the puppetier has a spare marionette for the one he uses most.God is not mentioned but the scenes are revealing Veronique caresses the bark of a thick tree in the very last scene which could signify her real father as well or just the idea of fatherhood.The music is ten out of ten if you feel nothing while listening to Preisners masterpiece youd better not say youre sensitive anymore. This is his best for me alongside with the music for Short story of a killing and Damage soundtrack which sounds cruel and mysterious to me.I cant think of any other film more precious and lyrical than this one.".

The Double life of Vronique is not a film that allows easy description it doesn't seem to fit in to any genre or category it is a film that must be experienced under it's own terms as a serious hypnotic work of art. Director Kieslowski sets up the odd dreamlike atmosphere right from the start using mirror reflections and odd camera distortions to show us the bizarre way that VeroniqueVeronika sees the world around her. The use of sepia printing also gives the film an odd distilled look taking us right out of any real reality giving each of the frames something special. The problem this creates is that it takes away any real connection we have with the characters we never really feel anything for them or are even that concerned for their outcomes Kieslowski moves his actors around his stage in the same way the marionettes are manipulated in the film but the film works on such a subtly hypnotic level I don't think that Kieslowski ever wanted us to feel part of this world. Kieslowski follows VeroniqueVeronika through Paris and Poland intimately probing her with close handheld camera the cinemaverite effect of this making the viewer feel almost like a voyeur following the women's every movements and encounters. The Double Life of Veronique is a film that definitely deserves to be seen and requires multiple viewings if we are to get everything out of it's complex predestined narrative. A film full of beautiful images and haunting moods that you'll remember long after if only there had been a little more focus on the characters I would certainly give it a 10. Maybe my next viewing will lift its marks. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Much of this is an adoration of French actress Irne Jacob by Director Krzysztof Kieslowski in a sense it is a homage to her one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and one of the most talented. If you've never seen her this is an excellent place to begin. She has an earnest open quality about her that is innocent and sophisticated at the same time so that everything a man might want in a young woman is realized in her. Part of her power comes from Kieslowski himself who has taught her how she should act to captivate. He has made her like a little girl fully grown yet uncorrupted natural generous kind without pretension unaffected. She is a dream and she plays the dream so well.The movie itself is very pretty but somewhat unaffecting with only the slightest touch of blue when the puppeteer appears by the curtain the curtain is blue and we know he is the one since she is always red. The music by Zbignew Preisner is beautiful and lifts our spirits highlighted by the soprano voice of Elzbieta Towarnicka. But the main point is Irne Jacob whom the camera seldom leaves. We see her from every angle in various stages of dress and undress and she is beautiful from head to toe. And we see her as she is filled with the joy of herself and her talent with the wonder of discovery and the wonder of life with desire and with love.Obviously this is not a movie for the actionadventure crowd. Everything is subtle and refined with only a gross touch or two and no gore thank you to remind us of the world out there. Vronique accepts the little crudities of life with a generous spirit the flasher the two a.m. call her prospective lover blowing his nose in front of her... She loves her father and old people. She is a teacher of children. She climaxes easily and fully. To some no doubt she is a little too good to be true. And she is and that is Kieslowski's point she is a dream. And such a beautiful dream.An actress playing the character twice in a slightly different way has occurred in at least two other films in the nineties there was Patricia Arquette in David Lynch's Lost Highway 1997 and Gwyneth Paltrow in Sliding Doors 1998. It's an appealing venture for an actress of course and when the actress is as talented as these three are for the audience as well.Note that as WeronikaVronique is in two worlds Poland and France so too has always been Kieslowski himself in his real life. It is interesting how he fuses himself with his star. This film is his way of making love to her.Kieslowski died in 1996 not long after finishing his celebrated trilogy Trois Couleurs Bleu 1993 Rouge 1994 and Bialy White 1994. We could use another like him.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:headline " Slow and sometimes selfconscious but still remarkable gorgeous  moving";
	schema:reviewBody "The Double Life of Veronique 1991Director Krzysztof Kieslowski is one of the undisputed poets of Cold War and postCold War cinema. The movies in his PolishFrench trilogy Blue White and Red are finely tuned sensitive imaginative dramas that use mystery music psychology and visual fluidity to immerse you in another world that is beguiling and fascinating.That's exactly what goes on here. It's a stunning moviemaking achievement in how it pulls off this unique blend of amorphous elements leading you into the ambiguity of the director's invented world. And into the world or worlds of the lead characters both played by Irene Jacob a classic kind of restrained French FrenchSwiss actress with a limited range but within that range she has penetrating beauty and a moving melancholic aura for the camera which lingers on her face through much of the movie. Her roles as the two women who are classic doppelgangersthey look alike have similar talents singing and both have heart problems. And they overlap in reality for just a few seconds with only one seeing the other until later when the other finds she took a picture of the first.This is an unashamedly lofty film. It has high art written all over it but not in the experimental or cutting edge way of independent filmmakers of this time. Rather it pushes European mainstream film to its most refined limits not giving up a narrative logic not giving up musical scoring and photographic pyrotechnics and not giving up a cast of beautiful people doing beautiful things. In fact the star first shown as a child is looking at the stars in pure wonder and the beauty of the world is sustaining and truly marvelous for herand this I think is the life view of the director. That the world is amazing filled with odd and beautiful coincidences and is mostly there to be lived and enjoyed regardless.To some extent he is both characters both Veroniques. The allegories of 1980s Europe splintering under Communism's last few years have been written about a lot the Polish Weronika gives herself to her music and dies for it trapped somehow the French Veronique is free to reject her talent travel and yet ultimately end up a puppet to her personal weakness. But the fact is Kieslowski was both the successful Polish director who died young though he didn't expect that I'm sure for his art and the successful expatriate living a life filled with art and pleasure. He embodied the modern Europe filled with the heady optimism that led to the love of a new Europe without borders infinite in its possibilities.It's worth noting that Communism has just fallen when this movie was made. There is a brief scene the bus scene with the soldiers that inserts this with as usual elegance. Note here that he again makes the individual's inner needs more important than the greater politics. The French Veronique is free to be hedonistic the Polish version cannot quite do that though you feel her struggle with what to do with her life as a singer.All of this is obviously impressive. For its intentions and its inner coherence the movie is terrific. But it's also starting to feel selfimportant a little overblown in both its allegories and even in the basic doppelganger hook that holds it together. It's also a slow movie. If you don't completely drown happily in the aesthetics of the film which would be easy to do you might find there are little moments made too important too detailed too unaware that the audience is getting ahead of the movie and is restless. For me this was in some of the musical segments in the marionette scenes and even in the very last moments which should have blown me out of the water.Final word. I think it would help to see this film before the Three Colors trilogy because they are better movies especially Blue and Red. I have seen Red several times and it also stars Jacob and I love it completely still. This predecessor is thinner in comparison but only in comparison to this remarkable director's startling successes immediately after.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Double Life of Veronique 1991Director Krzysztof Kieslowski is one of the undisputed poets of Cold War and postCold War cinema. The movies in his PolishFrench trilogy Blue White and Red are finely tuned sensitive imaginative dramas that use mystery music psychology and visual fluidity to immerse you in another world that is beguiling and fascinating.That's exactly what goes on here. It's a stunning moviemaking achievement in how it pulls off this unique blend of amorphous elements leading you into the ambiguity of the director's invented world. And into the world or worlds of the lead characters both played by Irene Jacob a classic kind of restrained French FrenchSwiss actress with a limited range but within that range she has penetrating beauty and a moving melancholic aura for the camera which lingers on her face through much of the movie. Her roles as the two women who are classic doppelgangersthey look alike have similar talents singing and both have heart problems. And they overlap in reality for just a few seconds with only one seeing the other until later when the other finds she took a picture of the first.This is an unashamedly lofty film. It has high art written all over it but not in the experimental or cutting edge way of independent filmmakers of this time. Rather it pushes European mainstream film to its most refined limits not giving up a narrative logic not giving up musical scoring and photographic pyrotechnics and not giving up a cast of beautiful people doing beautiful things. In fact the star first shown as a child is looking at the stars in pure wonder and the beauty of the world is sustaining and truly marvelous for herand this I think is the life view of the director. That the world is amazing filled with odd and beautiful coincidences and is mostly there to be lived and enjoyed regardless.To some extent he is both characters both Veroniques. The allegories of 1980s Europe splintering under Communism's last few years have been written about a lot the Polish Weronika gives herself to her music and dies for it trapped somehow the French Veronique is free to reject her talent travel and yet ultimately end up a puppet to her personal weakness.

Such themes could be messed around  but in the hands of such talented people these socalled irrationalities are brought to life with beauty subtlety and intelligence.The music is amazing the cinematography is stunning and Irene Jacob is wonderful. This is one of greatest films to explore the idea of the soul  and one of the best films in general. If you haven't seen it prepare to be moved by the metaphysical the mysterious and the humanity of the piece.

	schema:headline " overspecialization material and spiritual";
	schema:reviewBody "Much of this may be considered spoiler and is intended for people who have already watched the movie.Weronika W of Poland and Veronique V of France seem to begin life with identical natures but develop into extreme opposites W becomes spiritual in her personality and view of life attending to the inner and the private and V becomes material attending to the outer and the social. At first I saw the same connections I thought the girls see but later I interpreted events differently from how I think they do. I'll use a few scenes as examples.At her father's place W wakes in a fright with a vague sense that she's not alone in the world as if some spirit visits her. Later when she sights V in the square she seems to have an otherworldly experience as if this other girl is connected to that spirit. I assumed the same connection but on watching the movie again I realized that I had barely noticed something obvious in that scene W is in imminent physical danger of being run over by vehicles and being knocked on the head or arrested by riot police while V is physically safe and sound on her bus. To have an inner experience on seeing one's double is fine but at the same time the sight of her double being safe and sound should encourage W to want to protect her own body and to get out of the square. Instead W reacts in her usual private way standing in almost a trance as behind her the riot police prepare to move. Run W run!! As for that other spirit it is W's way of experiencing and reacting to her chest pains for which she never seeks medical treatment. But she carefully defends her inner life as she prepares for her concert and tries to avoid her boyfriend Antek. He seems to be of good character but any love affair can stress the spirit.Beginning with her first scene as a young woman V vaguely senses some sort of loss in her life. Later the parallel to the scene in the square happens in the hotel room. V vaguely tells the puppeteer Fabbri F that she's always sensed there was someone else and she's always known what to do. When F asks V to tell everything about herself she promptly empties the contents of her purse onto the bed then smiles sweetly as he goes through them. When V sees the photo of W that has been in her purse for a long time V seems quickly to connect the photo with that someone else who has always helped her know what to do and to connect her sense of loss with the assumed death of that person. I assumed the same connections myself. But after watching again later I paid more attention to some aspects of this scene we can take the contents of her purse as her private inner self what little she has of one which she so willingly dumps onto the bed and which F goes through in a mocking manner for example making her crystal ball disappear  much as in an earlier scene he drives off with the angelspirit on the side of his van. V's private life is under stress as it always is with a lover even one of good character which F lacks. To grieve at the assumed death of someone is fine but the sight of the photo of her double from inside her own purse should encourage V to look within and to take care of her private self. Instead she reacts in her usual material way imagining a dead body somewhere and allowing F to enter her with the sort of mechanical sex one sees in bad pornography. Dig in V dig in!! As for the loss V senses it is her was of experiencing and reacting to the withering of her own private life as she glides superficially and mechanically through the motions of her social life. As for her always knowing what to do it is due to her own keen attention to the outer world and its social conventions  attention that W clearly lacks though she tries to be kind to people.BTW some have supposed that F has mysterious insight into some connection between W and V but he could base his novel on nothing more than what V does and tells him in the hotel room.W flourishes spiritually while paying the obvious price for never getting medical help for her heart condition. V flourishes materially and socially but in the end she seems purely mechanical in going through all the right motions she moves the puppet of herself while F controls her she drives her car to dad's place she operates its power window to reach to the tree then she runs like a puppet to dad who has been working wood with his new sophisticated tool. Each girl succeeds in her own way but also pays a heavy price for being overspecialized.The many parallels between W and V serve as artistic device to compare and contrast them. But connections between W and V other than each sighting the other briefly are not required in this interpretation. For each of the girls that sighting is an awful tease since she cannot realize how easily the other girl can deal with the current situation in which she is so unaware and helpless herself. Here is a pair of stories the first is a slight revision that lets each girl survive and the second brings them together.".

It is not my favourite Kieslowski I would reserve that place for Blue and then No End and the Dekalog series but it has a lovely quality to it. I have never liked the ending really but enjoy the way it comes about. The general concept it strong and it is this that gives the film a slightly haunted quality which it pulls off.

Weronika is a young Polish concert musician with a heart condition and cool aunt. Just as she collapses from a fatal heart attack in the middle of a performance the action shifts to France where we meet Veronique  played by the same actress Irene Jacob. She was born on the same day as Weronika and is her double. In fact she felt a pain at the moment that Weronika died.The Double Life is a beautiful looking film not just because of Irene Jacob's perfect breasts. The music is a central element and strength of the film. It is a very romantic film and the minimalist approach to dialog adds to the beauty. The railway sequence is quite unforgettable. In watching the film its important to let go of reason and rely instead on emotions.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Double Life of Veronique  1010 This is an incredibly haunting and poetic work that raises a plethora of questions regarding life death and the unexplainable connection that some people share. I was stuck in a sort of trance while watching this as beautifully photographed scenes seemed to follow one after the other for the film's entirety.There wasn't a moment that I had lost interest and the questions posed throughout are some that I found myself thinking about on many different occasions as a child. Do we perhaps even simultaneously share the same thoughts feel the same feelings and take part in the same actions as another person we have never met? Is it more than instinctual for us to avoid certain things or act in certain ways? This film spoke to these questions but of course never answered them. It turns out I believe that there are no answers to begin with.This is the fourth Kieslowski film I've seen and most certainly the best. Visually it shares a few things in common with the Colors Trilogy and Irne Jacob Veronique and Veronika was actually the main character in Red. Her acting is extremely good in both films and the mood she creates in this one is understated but incredibly graceful. I should mention the music in the film as well which in addition to being beautifully presented plays an important role in the connection between the two women. This is one of the best films ever made presented by a man of great vision who left us far too soon.".

	schema:headline " What I might have felt had I watched this exquisite film for the first time back in 1991 but I guess I'll never know";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching this exquisite film for the first time 15 years after it was released would be a very different experience from watching it back in 1991 had I got the opportunity. That this first time viewing actually comprises two viewings which are though not backtoback only 3 days apart means yet a different experience. Finally having gleaned a considerable amount of material before going into the cinema has perhaps changed significantly my perception from what it would have been had I first watched in back in 1991. Had I watched it back in 1991 without any foreknowledge of what the film is about I would probably have made an immediate association to Hitchcock's classic Vertigo  an abrupt death of the heroin leading to the mysterious resurrection of same. I would be looking for clues to explain the mystery and a satisfying twist at the end. And I could not have been more wrong.Armed with all the literature I've read written from back in 1991 to quite recent times by both professional critics and nonprofessional but almost equally erudite IMDb posters I know what I would be looking for. There's only a thin line between the film being mysterious and poetic and the words poetic and poetry appear in just about everything I read on this film. Poetic could mean technical thing like rhyme and rhythm but here of course it's senses and perceptions as well as a frame of mind.The critics back in 1991 mind you talked about the frustration of trying to make some senses out of this film. But there are always two sides to a coin  there is the joy and liberation of being able to see in the film anything you want. I do not see anything particular in Veronique's long red scarf dragged along the floor during her brisk walk along the corridor. But I am chilled right down my spine by the look and smile the alto gives to Weronika at the beginning of their duet. For some reason I see death but probably because of my foreknowledge. The images of the two old women seen moving slowly by Weronika and Veronique no one would fail to connect but everyone would see different meanings from it. Each frame in this film contains details that are meticulously constructed by master Kieslowski to provoke the audience's senses and intuitions not to challenge their intellect. The entire film is shot in a sort of perpetual late afternoon glow which is close to sepia tone but a tad brighter. Images and motifs are so rich that it's hard to find another film that is comparable. One review has given a full discourse on the use of music. I would only mention the deepest impression I had of a scene almost towards the end when Veronique wakes up from what looks like a short nap and moves through corridors and stairs to her lover the puppeteer's workroom. The loud pulsating music invokes such a powerful sense of mystery that is almost oppressive. But when she finally gets into the workroom looks at a puppet and asks with a most ordinary smile Is it me? the music suddenly disappears as if it was never there before. Cinematic magic! Enough praises have been heaped on Irene Jacob by everyone or maybe never enough. She does particularly well in bringing out the subtle difference between the two women she portrays  Weronika cheerful even playful focused and Veronique more sensuous melancholy slightly bemused. This film is so rich that you can never say enough about it and I have not even mentioned the puppet scene. I will certainly want to watch Double life again on the big screen maybe not so soon again as during the current screening but in some hopefully nottoodistant future rescreening.".

I found the characters believable especially given the target audience of the movie the dialog was fairly cleverly humorous but serious when it needed to be the characters were adequately conceived including the intentionally unlikeable 4th party woman who wasn't family. Most of all I enjoyed the pacing of the movie. Some slow underwater scenes were accompanied by peaceful music belying the increasingly perilous situations the characters found themselves in. Halfway through the movie the tension never fully dissipates as each event flows into the next as the stakes rise. The badguys are dealt with intelligently and there are enough twists to convincingly carry the instability and danger of the situation.I went into this movie wanting to enjoy it and I wasn't disappointed. Though its premise wasn't the most intellectual of premises I don't feel as if it were dumbed down as much as many action movies do and instead carried out is plot with due respect given its expectations. I'd recommend this movie as a good postsummer adventure flick!".

	schema:reviewBody "You almost feel like Rodney Dangerfield from Back to School after watching this movie. The film has some neat underwater photography some good stunts and even a twist or two. But ultimately it's just as excuse to show off some young flesh. Is that entirely a bad thing? The Hound thinks not. A good dosage of Jessica Alba flesh can warm you up on the coldest winter day.Into the Blue is directed by John Stockwell. Yes the guy who played Cougar in Top Gun. One may dislike the content of the films he's made thus far in his early directing career Blue Crush CrazyBeautiful but one cannot deny the fact that the man knows how to shoot young women's bodies. Since there are only two female main characters that means there are also plenty of young men for the women to feast their eyes on. Paul Walker kind of has the Justin Timberlake thing going on. Seeing him and Tyson Beckford really makes me feel out of shape now that the holidays are over.Oh the plot! I almost forgot. It's basically a rehash of The Deep. We have young treasure hunters in the Caribbean who find not only a sunken ship carrying gold but a recently crashed plane full of cocaine on the ocean floor. Naturally the drug dealer of record in the area wants the coke for himself and doesn't want anyone getting in the way by searching for treasure near by. The resulting action has numerous gun battles shark attacks kidnappings and acts of machismo. The film is a little long but the conclusion is worth sticking around for.This film is not to be confused with anything up for an Academy Award this year. It was filmed nearly a year and a half before it was released for reasons I would not dare to speculate on. It did make 18 million bucks in the theaters but any longlasting success this film has will depend on if any of these stars goes on to have a long career. There is an extraordinary amount of violence and gore for a PG13 film. An Fbomb or two here and there would have certainly given it an R. The acting is pretty sparse. The scenes above water look rushed and possibly printed on the first or second take. The scenes below water are very impressive however.The verdict 5 of 10 stars. This is a popcorn flick with some decent production values and a hot young cast. Not much else. Too many bad guys and a plot that doesn't know when to resolve itself. Here's a little game if you get bored with the movie... see if you can hold your breath as long as these people do in some of these scenes. Some of the time it seems like they go several minutes without breathing.The Hound.".

The real star is the ocean here and the good guy bad guy looked like my step brother and fit the bill.

Personally I am quite into diving so for me the appeal was there. It was quite odd for me as after an hour I had found myself totally immensed in the story and unaware of anything else happening in the cinema around me! After the first hour things really start hotting up and the action begins. Without giving too much away the climax is just about right in terms of time although Jared's summary of who is crossing or doublecrossing who was rather too brief and quick for me. Never mind we all knew who was the bad guy anyway. And so after the climax is the finale and it's predictable stuff sure but I'm all for a happy ending hey who isn't?!.I summary I would recommend this to anyone 25 or under really. The story is solid enough to keep you interested and the diving scenes are pretty spectacular as is Jessica Alba!. As long as you aren't expecting an Oscar winner you'll do fine!".

After the first hour things really start hotting up and the action begins. Without giving too much away the climax is just about right in terms of time although Jared's summary of who is crossing or doublecrossing who was rather too brief and quick for me. Never mind we all knew who was the bad guy anyway. And so after the climax is the finale and it's predictable stuff sure but I'm all for a happy ending hey who isn't?!.I summary I would recommend this to anyone 25 or under really. The story is solid enough to keep you interested and the diving scenes are pretty spectacular as is Jessica Alba!. As long as you aren't expecting an Oscar winner you'll do fine!";

There are really only about 5 movies that made the big screen and involve diving to any degree. I have over 300 dives and I have never seen a more beautiful capture of the love of water. From the Jet Ski scene to the Yachts to the fantastic display of coral fish and rays galore I felt like I was right there. It seems the movie is being ripped up because of the drug involvement and treasure find similar to the Deep. Are you for real? Take any murder mystery and of which there are thousands and guess what there's a stiff a cop and someone with a weapon who seems like a nice guy but isn't. And that's OK cause as long as there's blood a babe and a bad cop the tickets will keep selling. As long as you see this movie for what it is you will enjoy it very much. This is about a guy with high morals a little lacking today who is living in trash to do what he wants more then anything in the world a treasure finder. Trouble finds him because he is good at what he does. The movie is fast paced and exciting from the very beginning I can't believe the poor reviews that have been listed by other viewers. This is worth every bit of 7 to see.".

The film consists of scenes and NOT of cheap fast cuts and hectic camera work below and above surface. The filmmakers obviously liked and knew what they were doing. What I couldn't believe is that the same filmmakers also liked detailed scenes of unnecessary cruelty though not too explicit and only near the end. I learned from this and some harsh critics here that when you set a new standard of underwateradventure you don't reach that part of the audience who only want the thrill of fears and killing and the clash of good vs. evil because these people totally miss the beauty and all the work that obviously went into achieving it and feel bored. So why spoil a film with that in the first place? There are enough cruel thrillers out there. So go for alladventure anticynic. A step in the right direction and an honorable follow up to THE DEEP.

The underwater scenes here are vivid colourful visually exciting and beautifully filmed. It was like being there.I identify strongly with the character of Jared Paul Walker. Here is a guy who knows how to handle himself and doesn't put up with any sht. If there actually were people like Jared in this world leading the life he leads in this movie I would be green with envy. This movie makes me want to quit my job abandon my responsibilities book a flight to the Bahamas and look for someone like Jared to hang out with.The irony is that once Jared has made his fortune he will look back on his simple island life complete with dockside trailer and old boat as the best days of his life.I would have enjoyed a movie just showing Jared and Sam Jessica Alba a hot couple living their perfect lives in this Caribbean paradise. However the drugs story was entertaining enough. And I think it reflects the reality that the drugs trade wreaks havoc on many Caribbean islands.The character of Bryce Scott Caan was perhaps the only annoying thing about the film. No redeeming qualities there at all. It's inexplicable that Jared would hang out with someone like this and that the filmmakers didn't kill him off in the end. Die Bryce die!I thought Josh Brolin played his role particularly well. He's an underrated actor.If you love diving snorkeling and the Caribbean or if you just want to look at eye candy male and female for 90 minutes you'll enjoy this film.

In fact the storyline was much more dominant than the skin and fast boats. Although billed as the lead of the movie and clearly the largest star Jessica Alba and her character played a backseat role to Paul Walker whose ethical and moral dilemmas were the heart of the movie. Maybe it's the same theme in many movies? Young bright people with everything going for them are introduced to bad influences and they are tempted by these outside forces. They make a few bad decisions learn from them and then make the right decision. Or do they? Into the Blue follows the same premise but at least this premise dominates the movie not selling out for the teenage box office. At least not overtly. This movie isn't going to win an Oscar but it was definitely worth 10.".

I shall sing its praises until I find myself staring at the ceiling of some hospital ward malingering on my deathbed. All scholarly criticism aside this picture is a no less than 10000 leagues ahead of all other underwater drugsmuggling CameltoeFestaculars that have ever gone before it and I daresay of all that will succeed it. I cannot begin to convey via this most primitive form of expression  wordprocessing  how supremely how allencompassing how serotonininducing director John Stockwell has improved the basic quality of my life. In a single motion picture spanning just two hours he has brought to mankind what can only be described as an unbridled cacophony of excellence. Listen not to the critics of your local newspaper. Listen not to Jonathan Ross on Film 2005 just before you brush you teeth and go to bed. Listen to the little man or woman inside your head who sees in Jessica Alba something that is lacking from your otherwise mundane life. Listen to the self you buried years ago along with your childhood dreams. Listen to me. Go see this film. Pure cinema rarely sees the light of day in the nocturnal world of Hollywood cinema. By nocturnal I mean dark. And by dark I don't mean smouldering films with edge and deeper meaning. I mean films that don't deserve to see the light of day. The kind of Hollywood films that saturate our daily lives. Be they advertised on the sides of doubledecker buses or on our packs of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes offering some cheap plastic tiein. With Into The Blue it seems Hollywood has awoken from a slumber rivalled only by a fictional character Sleeping Beauty.Sleeping Beauty? How about beauty that's awake and real? And tanned? And not wearing very much aka bikinis? And called Jessica Alba costarring Paul Walker Ashley Scott and Scott Caan. These players aren't just the Baywatch cardboard cutouts you might expect. If Into The Blue was a chess match between Gary Kasparov and Deep Blue the actors would be the knights bishops rooks and royalty combined. There's no cornercutting castwise or productionwise. This is a Tour De Force like no other. I can scarcely remember a time in my life when I've felt more alive than those glorious moments I spent in The Skydome Cinema Coventry on that Saturday afternoon. Life could not be better.

In this enjoyable as well as eerie flick  Almodvar established again his uniquely poetic and visually striking style  though imitating to classy Eyes Without A Face 1960  the masterpiece directed by George Franju .

Moody terror movie about a mad doctor  assisted by a maid Marisa Paredes  removes the structure of a gorgeous women and attempts to graft her skin onto her body . His guinea pig results to be a brave and rebel girl Elena Anaya  but this patient is very closely linked to dramatic deeds from past he would like to forget  then things go wrong . Austerily wonderful mysterious film that contains intense drama  thrills  chills  and haunting poetic fantasy . In this enjoyable as well as eerie flick  Almodvar established again his uniquely poetic and visually striking style  though imitating to classy Eyes Without A Face 1960  the masterpiece directed by George Franju .

	schema:headline " The impossible film to pitch. Horror at it's best.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Skin I Live In is like most films by the Spanish director a film that cannot be pitched or explained in a few sentences. I am reminded of his superb work in Talk to her and All about my mother. Talk to her was a love story between a woman in a coma and her rapist while Mother was a film about a nun with AIDS a transvestite with a hearth of gold and a woman searching for her son's heart. In one sentence Almodovar's films all sound twisted at best. But in the hands of a master they are beautiful works of art. Same goes for The Skin I Live In. In a sentence like many who haven't watched the film are quick to point out the film sounds creepy at best and deals with a plot that makes most uncomfortable.A plastic surgeon Banderas belongs to family straight out of Pasolini's Salo. He keeps a beautiful woman Anaya as a guinea pig and he tries to create a new kind of skin. But Anaya's character in what seems the major metaphor of the film preserves her inner persona intact regardless of what happens to her body. As in most of Almodovar's films the layers become more complex as the movie evolves and towards the end of the film there's a plot twist only Freud could have come up with.Without spoilers I would like to point out that the director seems to use horror as a channel to explore the violation of every moral code embodied by the characters. With a magnificent score by Alberto Iglesias Almodovar tries for a difficult genre and it pays off. The set design and cinematography as always with Pedro's films is superb. At Canes the reception of the film was mixed an I can understand why. It simply isn't an easy movie to watch. For those who don't seem to have a problem with American horror movies where teens are stalked raped and cut into little pieces by a chainsaw but are horrified by The Skin I live In I have a suggestion Let's remember that fiction is indeed the only place when one can deal with horror and gore as metaphors for our human flaws a place where we don't have to hide from our demons but we get to talk to them a place where sickness gets no one hurt... Like Hitchcock used to say It is only a movie dear.".

Although not gory this is a disturbing work both on a literal story level and also for the questions it raises about identity love sadomasochism and passion run amok.These themes are all Almodovar touchstones but delivered here with a visually stunning icy touch and with much more complete logic than in his early works which often felt less fully thought through and had more frustrating plot holes and character leaps. Not a 'scary' film but a creepy moody and highly effective one. A dark fairy tale as told by say Stanley Kubrick. It's good to see Antonio Banderas reunited with Almodovar and he delivers a wonderfully complex and quirky modern day Dr. Frankenstein.

	schema:reviewBody "As a longtime fan of Pedro Almodovar's films I will admit the trailer for his latest film The Skin I Live In left me somewhat baffled. Having now seen the film however I see the method in his madness. The trailer tells you little or nothing about the film but bombards the viewer with crazy images which are in retrospect probably designed to confuse. The trailer serves the purpose of telling the viewer very little of what the film is about while titillating with striking visuals. A bold move but an effective one because the less you know about this film going in the better.With that in mind I'll keep this review short and will try not to give anything away. Antonio Banderas plays a rather unhinged scientist who is keeping a beautiful young woman prisoner in his home while using her as a human guinea pig for a new type of synthetic human skin. That's about as much information as you need. As the story unfolds petal by petal in that flowerlike way we've become accustomed to seeing from Almodovar each scene adds wonder and flavour to an already robust setup. Moving at a breakneck pace not a frame is without beauty and not a second is wasted without pushing the story along. This screenplay is extremely polished and beautifully nuanced.As usual cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaine delivers beautifully vibrant visuals but unlike other Almodovar films this palette is decidedly less colourful sticking mainly to Cronenbergian metallic colours fused with fleshy tones but with the odd gash of vibrant colour. It is as beautiful to behold as any other Almodovar film but perhaps less garish.In a film that relies on ambiguity in so many ways the cast here must be commended. Delicate balances are achieved by all concerned and it's wonderful to see Antonio Banderas settling into the rather unsettling role of Dr. Robert Ledgard. He exudes the same charisma and sexual bravura that made him famous but without the least whiff of sex symbol status coming through in the performance. He is creepy strangely alluring and underplays the mad scientist bit admirably. Elena Anayas also impresses in a very challenging performance both physically and emotionally both of which are perfectly effective as her story unfolds. A brilliant character who may not have been so impressive in the hands of a less capable actress. The camera intimately caresses her face and body throughout and she steadfastly rises to the challenge of being as beautiful a muse as a director could ask for.It is unlikely that Almodovar will win over any new fans with The Skin I Live In but he will surely satisfy his already massive fanbase. A dark thoughtful frightening piece but never shying away from the heights of melodrama that Almodovar is known for this sits beautifully on the line between Cronenberg at his best and a crazy soap opera.Unique Gothic and delightfully melodramatic! I love it!httpcharlenefilmblog.blogspot.com201108skinilivein.html".

His films openly explore subjects many acclaimed directors fear to tread and absorb in their whole entire careers but what is always guaranteed with Almodovar is a sense of wonderment and the unexpected and 'The Skin I Live In' 'La piel que habito' is no different. Based briefly on Thierry Jonquet's 2003 novel 'Mygale' Almodovar's latest film is a delightful and refreshing combination of multiple genres including drama thriller and body horror. It's shockingly sincere beautifully horrifying and has an appeal that will keep the audiences eyes locked towards the events onscreen until the final credits roll.Dr Robert Lesgard Antonio Banderas is a renowned surgeon who is attempting to achieve a breakthrough in biomedical sciences by creating a synthetic skin through transgenisis. Classified as a horrific mutation by some and acknowledged by Robert as an innovation his experiments come at a price. His human test subject is a beautiful woman named Vera Elena Anaya who is contained within his home and cared for by his head servant Marilia Marisa Paredes. Vera is not like other women she wears a skincoloured suit made out of fabric instead of clothes she is constantly watched by Robert and Marilia and she never leaves her room which only Robert himself holds the key too. What follows is a startling journey of discovery as the narrative unravels a story of disturbing past present and future events transforming the lives of all those involved.Beginning in Toldeo in 2012 Almodovar utilizes a constantly underused and underappreciated device in the nonlinear narrative. He provides the audience with one perception of each character before returning in flashback during the second act to six years previously where further events are explained and through this the audience's initial observations of the characters become undermined and drastically altered. He then digresses between past and present at will building a comprehensive picture of each character involved as the story develops revealing some startling and disturbing discoveries. This decision to structure the film in this way also adequately supplements Almodovar's need to explore his key themes including sexual identity and the nature of the moral of ethics of the human soul after it has been literally stripped bare.Coupled with the beautiful cinematography from Almodovar's longtime collaborator Jose Luis Alcaine and an original and complimentary score by Alberto Iglesias 'The Skin I Live In' also becomes an example of technically proficient filmmaking which works alongside the performances of the likes of Banderas and Anaya as well as the slickly written script which keeps the audience on their toes until the final curtain has been dropped. Pedro Almodovar is undoubtedly one of the most successful auteurs of the last few decades and with 'The Skin I Live In' he shows that he can almost touch upon a new genre in the form of body horror genrehybrid whilst also retaining all the previous elements themes and techniques which have made his films the deepseated critically successful films that they are.".

His latest effort as usual in Spanish with English subtitles is no exception even tho he gives most of the screen time to his most accomplished discovery and frequent star Antonio Banderas seemingly one of the few Hispanic actors whom Americans will tolerate in a lead role playing the brilliant and innovative plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard. This is a deadly serious role in marked contrast to Banderas's other current star turn as the voice of Puss in Boots.The female lead Elena Anaya plays Vera Cruz yes Ledgard's stunningly gorgeous patient experimental subject apparent captive and  well here Almodvar who cowrote the screenplay with brother Agustn gets a bit coy. Is she a manikin an Eliza Doolittle to Ledgard's Henry Higgins a Sabina Spielrein to his Carl Jung possibly a creature to his Frankenstein? Or maybe none of the above? We know only that she seems devoted to him tho he is unresponsive to her charms.Vera is confined to the big bedroom elegantly furnished where she does her yoga exercises dressed in a fleshcolored body stocking. Ledgard has the only key to the room and he always keeps her locked in. He himself stays in the smaller bedroom next door where he watches her intently on a wallsized video screen. All her food and other needs are delivered from the kitchen via a dumbwaiter and she communicates with only 2 people Robert in person and the housekeeper via intercom.Ledgard is a widower and we see in flashback that his wife Gal suffered a terrible car accident and fire leaving her horribly disfigured even after Robert's virtuoso surgical work and devoted care. But even after all his efforts Gal is unable to stand her pain weakness and ugliness and she commits suicide. Unfortunately it's right in front of their tweenage dotter Norma Blanca Surez who is driven into hysterics and a nervous breakdown by the sight.Ledgard as one of the world's leading reconstructive surgeons does not lack for cash so he devotes the next several years to his twin obsessions coaxing his dotter back from the precipice of madness and developing a graftable artificial skin which he somewhat ghoulishly dubs Gal a combination of human and pig genes that's highly resistant to burns cuts and punctures. Such an epidermis would have saved his beloved wife he reasons and this alone justifies his transgressing the ethical boundaries against transgenics. This is the only sciencefictional element in the film and it's not much of a stretch from what modern medicine is actually capable of doing which is why I categorize it as essentially a psychodrama.There are 3 other characters of note Ledgard's housekeeper Marilia Marisa Paredes an older woman with secrets of her own her wastrel son Zeca Roberto lamo who pays an unwelcome visit and studly young Vicente Jan Cornet son of and apprentice to the local dressmaker who takes a shine to nowteenage Norma as she shyly tries to work her way back into normal society.We learn most of the above during the first half hour which leaves us wondering just what on Earth is going on here. The remainder of the film slowly pulls aside one curtain after another to fill us in. And that is all I will say on the subject. You'll have to see the rest for yourself.And you should.".

All her food and other needs are delivered from the kitchen via a dumbwaiter and she communicates with only 2 people Robert in person and the housekeeper via intercom.Ledgard is a widower and we see in flashback that his wife Gal suffered a terrible car accident and fire leaving her horribly disfigured even after Robert's virtuoso surgical work and devoted care. But even after all his efforts Gal is unable to stand her pain weakness and ugliness and she commits suicide. Unfortunately it's right in front of their tweenage dotter Norma Blanca Surez who is driven into hysterics and a nervous breakdown by the sight.Ledgard as one of the world's leading reconstructive surgeons does not lack for cash so he devotes the next several years to his twin obsessions coaxing his dotter back from the precipice of madness and developing a graftable artificial skin which he somewhat ghoulishly dubs Gal a combination of human and pig genes that's highly resistant to burns cuts and punctures. Such an epidermis would have saved his beloved wife he reasons and this alone justifies his transgressing the ethical boundaries against transgenics. This is the only sciencefictional element in the film and it's not much of a stretch from what modern medicine is actually capable of doing which is why I categorize it as essentially a psychodrama.There are 3 other characters of note Ledgard's housekeeper Marilia Marisa Paredes an older woman with secrets of her own her wastrel son Zeca Roberto lamo who pays an unwelcome visit and studly young Vicente Jan Cornet son of and apprentice to the local dressmaker who takes a shine to nowteenage Norma as she shyly tries to work her way back into normal society.We learn most of the above during the first half hour which leaves us wondering just what on Earth is going on here. The remainder of the film slowly pulls aside one curtain after another to fill us in. And that is all I will say on the subject. You'll have to see the rest for yourself.And you should.";

	schema:headline " Took me by surprise!";
	schema:reviewBody "I've never seen a Pedro Almodovar film before. I had been wanting to see this ever since I saw its premise. Very interesting but it still surpassed my expectations.The film is unpredictable in it's pace. You never know what to expect next. It is hugely intriguing because of this. You can sense deeper and darker secrets are at the core of it all but you don't know what. It becomes even more mysterious once it jumps back six years in time. There was a shot that convinced me what was really going on. It was a shot that mirrored two characters... well that's all I am going to say. But when I saw that shot I was convinced of what was going on underneath and I was right. That doesn't mean it was predictable... not at all. Despite being sure of what was the twist the film was still able to surprise me again and again. I want to take note that this really wouldn't be an easy film to pull off. In fact on the surface it's quite soapy and on the hands of someone else could have easily turned into a fullblown melodrama. It didn't and I am very glad of that. The icy cinematography and direction brilliantly keep us enthralled in a world in which anything is possible. It feels like sciencefiction and horror blended with real grounded drama. I also want to take note of the performances. Being Mexican and having been raised of fullMexican parents I knew who Banderas was but I never knew he could act this well. He never makes his character easy to figure out and there's always a sense of empathy that we have with him but should we? Who is the victim here? Elena Anaya is the star though. She has incredibly expressive and emotional eyes and from the start we sense something underneath her. This is an incredible performance one of the best supporting performances of the year. The ending was sort of abrupt though.All in all I loved this film. Completely intriguing hugely entertaining very mysterious and gleefully thrilling without becoming a melodrama and feels very mature. Oh and did I mention that the music score is fantastic!".

	schema:headline " A fullon masterpiece.";
	schema:reviewBody "Pedro Almodovar has created a daring and entirely unique masterpiece a word that I do not use lightly or often. The Skin I Live In has a lot that of aspects that feel very Almodovar but there's also a lot of Cronenberg here as well and with the latter being my favorite director it's no surprise that I fell in love with it quickly. The film is a startling wild study into a world of obsession revenge and the complexities of the human flesh. Almodovar has really outdone himself here crafting a tale of wicked intensity and rarely met eccentricity.The structure here is one of it's more interesting aspects and yet another film this year that isn't told in a strictly linear fashion. We first meet Doctor Robert Ledgard Antonio Banderas in the present day as he works tirelessly on perfecting a new skin for his subject the young and beautiful Vera Elena Anaya. Almodovar establishes us in this present day world complete with a very Almodovar subplot a man in a tiger suit comes to the house and brings some trouble and a lot of baggage for Ledgard. We get to know these people become intrigued by what brought them to their current state and that we jump back six years to explore this character further.It's a surprising jump and I must admit that it got me off guard at first but as we spend more and more time in the past building up to the present I slowly came to terms with what Almodovar was doing. He gave us a stake in the present day world so that when he took us into the past it becomes about more than just laying out the facts. We already have a perception on Ledgard and a curiosity into understanding the events that bring him to where we met him so the film becomes as much of a fascinating game of putting these puzzle pieces together as it is a character study and allaround masterwork of high drama.Slowly the pieces start to come together and I found myself constantly trying to figure out what happened in this world how these events in the past connect to the present day we were introduced to. When we finally get our answer...stunned...amazed...jawunhinged...none of these words can even begin to describe what happened to my mind. This is a twist that doesn't exist for shock value by any means but absolutely sent me to the floor one of the most shocking and unexpected moves in cinema history as far as I'm concerned. It threw me for a major loop and everything I had come to perceive about these characters and their world was altered in an instant. Everything became a thousand times more fascinating and complex with the use of one simple word.As I said before this is a piece of the most miraculous and bold highdrama a world where anything is possible but nothing feels out of place. That is perhaps the most shocking aspect of the film itself that Almodovar gives us a story filled to the brim with melodrama but none of it feels contrived or too weird or too much. Everything feels totally natural and believable in the world that Almodovar establishes for us. His ability to make this happen is nothing short of extraordinary. Of course he doesn't do it alone and there are a lot of other aspects to the film that contribute to making it work on every conceivable level to bring us into this incredible world.Of course there are the performances which are just a dream on their own. I've never been a fan of Antonio Banderas and I've honestly been hesitant to watch films just based on his involvement but he delivers something here that I never knew he was capable of. Ledgard is an incredibly difficult character to pull off because our perception of him changes drastically throughout the film but Banderas masters it without a single hitch. There was never a false move never a moment where I didn't believe this character was capable of doing what he was doing. He is charming intelligent deranged and intimidating unfolding layer after layer as we go on. It's a remarkable achievement in both character and performance. The other performances work very well to support Banderas and Almodovar's work here particularly from the absolutely gorgeous Elena Anaya. She is all things sympathetic manic intriguing and sensual and when we come back to the present day after understanding what brought her to this place she takes on a whole new life of internal chaos and complexity. For all of her outward expression it becomes a very internal performance and she is sensational here.The technical aspects are all on key all of them impressing without taking the spotlight away from the story but the one thing that really left a mark was the phenomenal score. If it wasn't for Hanna this score would be a runaway victory for my personal win right now. Rarely have I seen music so wellutilized for the atmosphere a director strives to establish. The highwire drama meets it's ally with this music a soaring operatic work that brings us into this world so completely. It swept me away and completely engulfed me in this world that Almodovar established. The score is a perfect fit for the film because it captures exactly what the overall product is a brilliant and original opera of miraculous proportions. This is one of those films that I wasn't expecting a lot from and it just blew me away at every level.".

His usual reflections on the nature of relationships and the consequence of one's actions take on a well defined shape and advance forward with selfassurance.The order in which the events of the story are told is a cunning device that allows the director to make us reflect on how superficially  indeed skindeep  we perceive reality and how quick we are to judge first impressions and jump to conclusions. What we first perceive one way those initial scenes that slightly baffle us but which we nevertheless do not hesitate to judge in a specific way take on a completely new meaning when the story pauses to take us back into the past in order to tell us about an important series of events that happened at the time which bear a direct relation to present events. The new light that is shed on the present changes completely our perception of the story as we had first witnessed it which is a humbling experience. We are then taken back again to the present and continue watching the rest of the film but with this completely new understanding of the real underlying motivations for the characters' actions. It is at this point that through a slight thrillerstyle twist in the plot the story takes on a Shakespearean dimension as it delivers its powerful humanist lesson that vengeance begets vengeance.Food for thought in fact enough food to last you days and feed other people as you are left on the one hand wondering at the concept of skin what we actually desire when we desire someone whether all desire is skindeep whether the skin does not allow us to see the person behind. And on the other hand you are left with the reflection on how the road of vengeance leads only to selfdestruction. When a film leaves you pondering so deeply I can only conclude it is a great film.".

I have read the novella Tarantula that this is supposedly loosely based on however I found that it followed the novel extremely closely I thought a lot of the twists and stuff that were in the book would be taken out if the film but thankfully most are present and accounted for.Antonio Banderas is so terrific as the leading man he hasn't looked this great in screen in a long time I think he seems more at home in his native language and Elena Anaya is absolutely radiant on the big screen her face just lights up the screen and she is absolutely exceptional in a very strange role. The story is really a bizarre one it's seems like a less perverted De Sade and a more understandable David Lynch it always takes you by surprise and it is highly original and also somewhat daring I think and thank god a director like Almodovar decided to film it and not some silly director.The cinematography and music is beautiful the colours and textures in the film are picked up beautifully by the camera and the music is a great companion to each scene it's so close to perfection in the production design department that i would go so far to say as I haven't seen a better looking film this year. This movie is in my opinion the least accessible of all of Almodovar's films but I hope it doesn't put people off as his touch and style is clear and present here.

	schema:reviewBody "Pedro Almodovar's much lauded The Skin I Live In was for me yet another disappointment from the Spanish Master.Almodovar has served up the usual glossy pot pourri of themes e.g. gender issues twisted sex dysfunctional families. Playing the art house game to perfection he has remembered to include critic friendly references and quotations from other film makers. This time the soap opera has a horror twist but Almodovar brings nothing new to the genre.Unfortunately for me the sum of the parts in Almodovar's films never adds up to a consistent or organic whole. Is the film about Antonio Banderas seeking to recreate his dead wife? Well that narrative thread quickly dissipates once Almodovar has used that idea to deliver a shock cut of his burnt wife. Is it about his obsession with the skin itself? The fetishised series of images  wet clothes transparent gloves genetically modified textures etc  would seem to suggest so. Yet this thread leads to nothing more than a series of self consciously arty images that whilst superficially attractive head into a cul de sac and simply vanish. Instead Antonio Banderas character then shifts to an obsession with avenging the apparent rape of his daughter by punishing the rapist. Is the convoluted way in which this is resolved an attempt at taboo breaking and gender distortion or is it just another tired attempt by Almodovar to shock a jaded audience. The character played by Banderas whether he is supposed to be driven by science the need to recreate his wife the need to create a universal family or the need for vengeance comes across as being somewhat tepid and a bit dull.The dysfunctional family theme  featuring a preposterous gallery of the unfaithful dead wife suicidal rape victim daughter secret mother rapist brother who also had an affair with the wife  develops by layering one absurd piece of nonsense on top of another. Almodovar having self indulgent fun as the provocateur trying to push buttons but creating nothing of value and telling us nothing of any significance about real relationships. The character of the brother in particular is served up just to add a bit of shockhorror and to provide Almodovar with another excuse to disrobe and mistreat the poor Ms Anaya. The character of the brother is the worst sort of kitsch confection that adds no layers of understanding to Banderas's character's psychology. As for the shock twist ending regarding the identity of Banderas's creation that was obvious and telegraphed at least 20 minutes before it was supposed to have been revealed.I dislike Almodovar's treatment of women. I have no idea why he is spoken of as someone who creates excellent and challenging roles for women because more often than not the lead female character in his films are clichd and a cipher for his distorted view of the relationship between a man and a woman not a subject that Almodovar has much real life experience of. The women in Almodovar films seem to have to conform to the Latin Catholic stereotype and are usually either whores or mothers. In addition many of the women are victims and quite frequently the victims of rape. Yet this is an experience that in Almodovar's films they miraculously dispense with as if they are recovering from a heavy cold or an inconvenient headache. Almodovar's treatment of women is the bitter and twisted aftertaste that always sours his intentions for me. The brash popart visuals can't completely hide a deep seated darkness in Almodovars' psyche.As ego boosting references for the broadsheet critics we get visual homages to films such as Tristana Les Yeux Sans Visage and Clockwork Orange which by comparison only serve to remind us just how unfocused Almodovar's work is and in the case of directors like Bunuel show just how tepid the supposed taboo busting of Almodovar really is.On the positive side I thought the soundtrack by Alberto Iglesias was excellent and Elena Anaya was a wonderfully ethereal presence in a confused role that asked her to do little more than look wide eyed and expose her TA.This film like Almodovar's work in general is overrated. The positive reputation that his work enjoys remains a source of considerable confusion to me. I believe that there is a standard reflex critical response to Almodovar's films that is based on a misrepresentation of his work. Until Almodovar demonstrates an ability to actually produce intelligent and cogent films with ideas and themes that are rigorously developed and not simply thrown against the wall to create a rainbow concoction of colours and ideas that some people misinterpret as art then his films will always remain ultimately exploitative and rather pointless cartoons.".

	schema:reviewBody "Almodovar for me is a talented director who makes hits and misses. 'Talk to Her' I believe is his best film to date there are a couple of contenders for his worst. But 'The Skin I Live In' definitely isn't one of them.It is an arthouse horror thriller adapted from Thierry Jonquet's novel 'Tarantula' unread by me. The obvious source of inspiration is the French film 'Les Yeux Sans Visage' another horror film involving a mad doctor and synthetic skin. But 'The Skin I Live In' is far more than that. I won't give any details of the plot anyway but perhaps think about that title more carefully.When I say it is an arthouse horror film  it is definitely Almodovar's own brand of 'art'. He fills his screen with deep rich gaudy colours  reds blues yellows browns oranges  and the disquieting rosy shade of cream that belongs to the synthetic skin of the title. It is a visual feast.The plot is ridiculous and somewhat trashy but it hangs tightly together and Almodovar has cast aside horror conventions and clichs and made something quite original. Antonio Banderas impresses in the lead as the vengeful surgeon and the film becoming evermore twisted as Banderas' true motives for the experiment and its full extents become clearer is very entertaining. People left the cinema as the end credits began to roll laughing  not in derision but in shock.I wonder if this will have an American remake. I can see it happening but I hope it doesn't. Almodovar has put his own unique stamp on this incorporating at successive turns tongue in cheek humour disturbing brutality psychological torture and bizarre moments of poignancy. I suppose the best compliment that can be given to the film with this in mind is that it works.It is no masterpiece. It is very well acted very well made with an interesting and pleasing aesthetic with sharp prickles of fear and a genuinely surprising twist. It is an entertaining guilty pleasure from Almodovar. I await his next film with interest.".

Bright colours carefully designed sets beautiful people in weird overthetop situations unconventional relationships and a sense for detail worthy of a true perfectionist. It's all there in this film and better than ever. The story is intriguing enough to keep you on the edge of your seat with some crazy twists that only Almodovar can come up with. The cinematography is excellent with some scenes that are pure visual poetry. Make sure to enjoy the scene where Vera tears her dresses apart and removes the pieces with a vacuum cleaner or the way Almodovar films the murder scene with the camera looking down from the ceiling or the closeup of Vera's feet wriggling in the black skintight socks. There's so much to admire and enjoy. The film stars Antonio Banderas who renews his cooperation with Almodovar the last time the two worked together was in Atame from 1990. Banderas is a rich surgeon who has developed a new sort of artificial skin and turns out to be a creep who thinks he has the right to literally mold people to his taste and preferences. Banderas plays this man in a properly emotionless way. The very demanding role of Vera is played by Elena Anaya of 'Lucia y el sexo'fame who also played a part in Almodovar's 'Hable con ella'.In some reviews this film is called a horrormovie. That's a very misleading description. There are hardly any horror elements there even is very little blood. The only way to describe it is as a typical Almodovarmovie.

What remains is a 2 hour long headscratcher that only succeeds in insulting the intelligence of the average moviegoer who is left adrift to find some redemption over the time and money invested in this flick while aside from some brief nudity there is none on offer. The screenplay for the film would probably been in better hands if the Coen brothers had written it.

And there are scenes that seem to be in just because they appealed to Almodvar and he did not know what to do with them like two nightclub numbers performed by Concha Buika. Several topics are handled with almost clinical detachment like cloning growing skin and surgery. This is not to say that the presentation is without fascination. The more I got to know Ledgard the less I cared for him or about him. I could connect with poor Vincent the unwilling victim of a sex change operation but the contemplation of that makes for some uncomfortable reflections.This is the first I had seen Antonio Banderas and I thought he was well cast. He reminded me of some stars of previous generations like Clark Gable. Elena Anaya did not get to be where she is on her beauty alone she has an expressive face and a lithe body. When she was running around the house she had the grace and quick reflexes of a feral cat.Particularly impressive is the score which artfully enhanced the experience.

Not a single character makes sense scenes appear to be crowbarred into place so an extra piece of 10 minute narrative can be made and most of the film would have been just as affective if it was told by a stranger around a campfire.. 'It was on a night like this' indeed... Banderas whilst doing a great job just doesn't make sense at all and has half a dozen changes of direction  Is he lonely? Is he evil? Is he a dirty old man? Hmmmm.. Juries out on that one. Still at least the leading lady yet again catches her death in the name of narrative! And while Elena Anaya is painfully lovely and just about the only consistent role the story is told with such pantomime it truly is difficult to feel the slightest bit sorry for her. This won a BAFTA? Really?! Is the viewing public that starved of entertainment that this was the best thing on offer? 'Martyrs' is horror. You want psychological thrillers take your pick. Stop giving this man money! it only encourages him!".

The director mixed things up trying to shock but somehow he lost it in the mix.Almoldovar presented us a potato that wasn't really a potato.. but an orange oh no.. was it a tomato ?A boy that was born by the housekeeper adopted at birth by her employers. He will grow up never knowing that he was adopted although his real mother will serve into his house even by the time when he will became a renowned surgeon which wasn't really a surgeon but more like some obsessed scientist later to became a revenging father of a suicidal rape mental disordered daughter.The surgeon's wife getting laid with housekeeper's second son her brother in law to die carbonized in a car accident later to find out she didn't actually died there and on top of all... a sick passion developed by the not so surgeon for a woman patient that wasn't so woman after all but his daughter rapist kidnapped and transformed into a woman.. looking exactly like the dead wife as a revenge for what he did to his daughter.While this rapist got a facelift and a Vaginoplasty the brother in law enter into the scene by posting his face on the intercom wearing a tiger suit asking his mother to let him in. From there to the point where the mother was tied to a chair while he was riding again on what he believed to be the old wife.. was a blink of an eye.Now let's see.. can you think to anything more sick and depraved than above mentioned to bring into this masterpiece ? Could you fall in love with your daughter rapist anyway regardless how it may look knowing who is he? I wonder what Freud would have said about this..If you are a normal person sensitive with unaltered and healthy point of view about lifesociety and family this movie will point your finger on the onoff button on your remote... after playing it for 10 minutes.Judging by how overrated is this movie and the large amount of positive feedback.. made it obvious to me one more timethat we are living in a godless sick world and it's getting worst day by day.

The storyline and trailer seemed weird raw colourful elements you come to expect from the director. However the lack of story to bind the story to the picture to make us identify in some ways with the characters to make us discover existential meanings in the storycharacters all these things were missing. And it is difficult to rely purely on beautiful pictures and weird scenarios that for one have been also used in other films by the same director. Thus without a strong story I didn't feel convinced by the movie. Watching this film I felt indifferent about the story and whatever twist was there in it. Almodovar usually is detail oriented and also allows actors to bring their interpretation and personalities in the movie. I also felt that the actors had such rigid roles that they didn't have much room to act and to really absorb into the movie. Antonio Banderas gave nothing to the performance as compared to his older performances in Almodovar films. Similarly was Marisa Paredes also not challenged or allowed to shine and Elena Anaya although she was good had no room to act. All in all trying too hard to create mystery suspense while there is no story to add meaning to the somewhat weird events.".

	schema:reviewBody "As Vivekananda has said The intensest love that humanity has ever known has come from religion and the most diabolical hatred that humanity has known has come from religion. Both of these elements are present in Xavier Beauvois Of Gods and Men the story of seven Roman Catholic French Trappist monks kidnapped by radical Islamists from their monastery in the village of Tibhirine in Algeria during the 1990s Algerian Civil War. The film depicts the sacrifices people of good will in both religions are willing to make for each other and that the separation between religions is not an unbridgeable gap.Winner of the Grand Prix at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival Of Gods and Men stars Lambert Wilson as Christian Prior of the monks and 79yearold Michael Lonsdale as a world weary medic who treats up to 150 Moslem villagers each day. The film derives its title from the Book of Psalms Psalm 8267 quoted at the beginning of the film I have said Ye are gods and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes. Filmed in Morocco the film shows the daily life of the Trappist monks before the terrorist threat becomes real.Though a large part of their day consists of contemplation and devotion living in close contact with the Muslim population allows them to interact with them in a positive way healing the sick selling honey in the nearby markets and caring for the aged. In addition daily chores such as cooking gardening loading wood for the fireplace and cleaning take up a large part of the day. Soon word gets around about the murder of European workers on a construction site by the terrorists and the monks recoil in horror when they learn about the stabbing of a woman riding on a bus by Islamic fundamentalists simply because she was not wearing a veil.The Algerian government asks the monks to leave for their own safety but Christian tells them that their calling is to serve the people of the community and he insists on remaining though he is willing to let the other monks decide. The issue becomes suddenly more immediate when a group of fundamentalists show up at the monastery on Christmas Eve demanding medicine for their wounded colleagues. Though the request is refused Christian quotes the Koran to their spokesman Ali Fayattia Farid Larbi and they end up shaking hands though the Prior senses rightly that they will be back.When all agree that they will not abandon the monastery even at the risk of death the dramatic high point of the film is reached when the monks recreate the Last Supper by sitting around a small table drinking wine and listening to a recording of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet. As the camera pans from face to face we can observe a beatific smile on some faces and tears on others demonstrating an inner poetry and reverence for life. The monks are not Christian moralists but spiritualists confronting the extremes of the human condition characters who point the way to overcoming despair.The monks like the Cur de Torcy in Bernanos' Diary of a Country Priest love poverty with a deep reasoned lucid love as equal loves equal expressing the eternal struggle of the spirit to know Christ and to come to terms with his anguish. The heroes of the film are not saints. They are flesh and blood human beings full of ambiguity and fear but never far from compassion and humility willing to offer us the possibility of a world transformed by grace.".

They are flesh and blood human beings full of ambiguity and fear but never far from compassion and humility willing to offer us the possibility of a world transformed by grace.";

I liked the fact that they treated the subject of faith and the possibility of coexistence of Christianity and Islam as well as the differences in a very simple everydaylifeway. What was new to me was the visualization of fraternity. This aspect was a big thing throughout the whole movie. It is one of the things i least understood about priests and monks until now. It was amazing to see this feeling i have never personally experienced come alive on the screen and sort of being able to feel it myself. I also liked that they used 'real' people and not pretty Hollywood types but i suppose that is normal in a production like this. I liked that a lot was left unspoken unexplained and open for various interpretations.The scenes i liked best was the one where the abbot was at a lake to find inspiration for his tough decision. the 'last supper' with the closeups of the monks' faces and the ballet music the terrorist and the abbot talk about the birth of Jesus the ending usually i don't like abrupt and vague endings like these but in this film it was bearable and befitting because in real life it is also still unknown what exactly has happened.".

Also it being 78 men living together it was interesting to see the different personalities in a group environment you have the natural leader the introverted the brave the scared etc.etc.I imagine like most people who've seen this film the performance by Wilson Lambert was very touching. He was totally believable as the cloister's leader.Unfortunately the church is undergoing a very hard time in regards mostly to child abuse it's nice to have a reminder of the positive aspects. I myself went to a catholic school with some Brothers and a monastery on campus.

Boring you may say nothing happens you may say and in one sense you'd be right. But..... The point about this film is not the plot. What this film acknowledges is that the real drama of human existence is internal the real action in our lives takes place inside of us and the real journeys that we make are in our minds and our souls. This is a film about relationships between different communities between individual members of the same community between individuals and God and between individuals and themselves. This is a film about identity and place  two things we all have in common like it or not. Personally I found the religious aspect of the film intriguing. We live in a world in which religion is again being used to justify momentous acts. An analysis of how that works and what it means has to be relevant. But even if you are not interested by this or are as I know many people are turned off by the mention of the words religion or God what the film does is to allow it's audience to begin to look behind these literal concepts at how the spiritual whatever that might mean to you functions in our daily lives. So 910. 1010 is very tempting but the film is not perfect. It would probably be boring if it was and a very definite recommendation. Oh and by the way it has some beautiful scenery some stunning and innovative cinematography and some crackingly good looking men.".

Only later does the film reveals itself but not before one has confronted several assumptions about the rightness or wrongness of there being a monastic order at the centre of a largely Muslim community.During the film the seven monks are obliged to consider their practical role their higher purpose and their own strengths as men individually and collectively. We are told next to nothing of their back story and must work from their characters as revealed in the situations in which they find themselves  tending the sick and facing the political and physical threat of the internecine attrition of local Muslim factions.The performances operated along an axis that has the sage worldly but ageing Michael Lonsdale Luc at one end and Lambert Wilson at the other giving a careerwatershed performance as Christian the youthful scholarly faithsecure leader of the group. The film's ascetic design affords ample opportunity for beautifully composed shots that recall late 17th century Italian church allegories or the martyrdompiety of Carl Dreyer's Joan of Arc. This is particularly the case in a memorable exquisitely filmed Antonionilike extended denouement sequence which scrutinises the group as they eat supper after making the key decision of the film.In addition to the performances of Lonsdale creating a character on a continued trajectory from the worldlycompassionate servitude shown in Frankenheimer's Ronin and the excellent Wilson I admired director Xavier Beauvois' restraint in not laying on the piety too heavy and in pitching the pragmatism of the selfsufficient monks just right. The film doesn't preach. If anything in its austerity it can seem a little remote for a Western audience. Still the cold and hardship like much else in the film rings true. 710".

They are clearly different in a cultural sense from the surrounding community. However their simple life and acts of charity are welcomed and accepted by the Muslims in the adjacent village.The plot revolves around the threat of death from militants in the region. The Algerian revolution has succeeded in forcing out the French colonial forces. The Algerian government and army officials want the monks to leave and return to France for reasons of safety. The monastery is seen as a remnant of colonialism and is therefore the target of nationalistic and religious violence. The problem revolves around the questions Will the monks stay? and What will happen if they do?Lambert Wilson plays Christian the elected leader of the monks. He does an outstanding job of portraying a man who could have succeeded as a leader in almost any undertaking. However he has chosen monastic life and now his leadership has become a matter of life and death.Veteran French actor Michael Lonsdale plays Luc an elderly physician who can barely walk but can still heal. The acting is uniformly excellent. In fact the acting was so good that my wife and I had to remind ourselves that this is a movie and these men are actorsnot monks.The music mostly chants sung daily by the monks was superb.This is a very powerful film. We saw it at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester NY. If you can't see it in a theater the movie should work almost as well on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "I seem to fall between the two camps of critical reaction. The majority who feel this is a classic great film or a sizable minority who call the film boring historically inaccurate and all surface. I find myself agreeing with some points made by the critics e.g. being bothered that the film never really examines how hated the French were for their earlier colonialism. That larger context is part of what makes these Brothers targets. One passing mention is hardly enough to deal with a huge element of the underpinnings of the story. You could use it to make the Brothers seem even more brave and to more deeply understand that they took a risk to reach out and just be there even before things get 'bad' andor to make the hatred they faced from the terrorists and the Army not just seem random. To be clear that hatred is unforgivable. But understanding how something happened or why your enemy hates you doesn't equal forgiving terrorism. But is part of the path to peace. And it is something these wise well read monks would have known about and must have been part of their thoughts and discussions though its largely avoided here.I also agree that the film is slow in parts sometimes needed to establish the rhythm of the monks' lives but other times getting repetitive with no seeming advantage. In addition besides the two main characters the other monks are largely onenote sketches and the sudden turn around of those who wanted to leave  maybe the most fascinating action in the film  is largely under explored Some of the time spent used on repeated rituals or retread conversations could have been used to deepen the understanding of those men and their heartrending confusion. It also bothered me that those who wanted to leave are never given the strong or convincing arguments they easily could have. They're almost made to seem cowardly or 'wrong'. The film could have gone further in it's compassion towards these men and understanding that this was a complex decision even on a theological level. When does God want us to martyr ourselves and when would God rather we not sacrifice the gift of life to find a way to live to fight another day? I can think of a number of third choices between surrender and simply running away. These men must have examined those options but there is little sign of it here. I have no problem with the film's conclusion but I wish it had felt both sides presented with equal weight and seriousness as I assume must have happened among the real monks. But my biggest problem is that the film's style while inviting thought is somewhat emotionally distancing so while my brain was deeply engaged my heart was less than I wish it was. I wanted to weep for these men and for the world but I found myself more caught in mind than in emotions. I believe the story was strong enough to carry both. Now all that said I still think unlike many of the professional critics that raised these points that this is a very very good film made with intelligence and passion. It is visually simple but stunning to look at. Its slow pace adds to the meditative unHollywood feel that eschews inflating drama for its own sake and allows us a taste of the peace these men experience by living in their simple giving way even in the midst of war. And there are scenes of sheer brilliance where whole stories are told on peoples' faces with little or no dialogue. Scenes where a combination of photography and acting capture a huge range of complex emotions. We watch fear joy transcendence defeat and loss run through the hearts of these men within seconds of each other without a word needing to be said That is filmmaking of a high order. Ultimately this is a film that deserves and needs to be seen. A plea for peace and courage in the face of hatred. But that doesn't mean it isn't a flawed work or that acknowledging those flaws dismisses those very good things the film does accomplish.".

	schema:headline " Trappist monks bravely face their own private 911";
	schema:reviewBody "With the Catholic Church getting so much bad press these days as a result of allegations of sexual abuse it's refreshing to watch a story about Christians who are the good guys. Based on a true story 'Of Gods and Men' chronicles the tragic tale of a group of Trappist monks in Algeria who were murdered by terrorists during the mid 90s. The story begins with a group of seven monks led by their leader aptly named Christian. They live in a monastery which has been part of an FrenchArabicspeaking community for years. The monks minister to the local townspeople providing counseling and medical assistance. One of the monks Luc apparently was a physician before entering the order and feels overwhelmed seeing approximately 150 villagers per day. The monk's peaceful life is interrupted when a group of Croatian workers are murdered by terrorists near the monastery. The scene is very realistic as the armed terrorists suddenly drive up to a work site in vans and begin slaughtering each man one by man slitting their throats. They allow a local worker to leave but all foreigners are marked for execution. The local authorities offer to post soldiers at the monastery to protect them but the monks refuse. Soon Ali Fayattia a local terrorist commander pays a visit with his gun toting thugs at his side. They need medical assistance for wounded comrades but Christian refuses to let any of the monks leave with them. Christian displays great courage when he tells Fayattia he won't talk to them on the monastery grounds while his men are holding weapons. Fayattia appears to respect Christian and agrees to speak to him right outside the monastery grounds. Christian quoting the Koran convinces Fayattia to leave convincing him that they do not have the medical supplies to treat the wounded men. The near slaughter propels a crisis of conscience amongst the monks. These simple spiritual men are now faced with the reality of evil impinging on their ordered existence. They debate amongst themselves whether they should stay or leave. During the first vote a couple of the monks vote to leave as they fear for their life another is undecided another two are in favor of staying and Christian joins an older monk in waiting for a sign from God.The film tautly depicts a world surrounding a peaceful enclave ready to explode. Local townspeople inform the monks of a young woman who is murdered by teenagers because she refused to wear a veil. Soon a local military commander accuse Christian of collaborating with the terrorists after hearing rumors that he permitted treatment of one of Fayattia's wounded men the rumor turns out to be true. Later Christian is called upon by the Army to identify the body of man who has been identified as Fayattia. Christian says it's him but it appears that the local military commander doesn't believe him.The situation becomes more dire as local news reports bring more bad news of terrorist attacks. When the monks travel by car they pass burned out cars on the side of road with soldiers milling aboutthe aftermath of terrorist attacks on innocent victims. There's more intimidation from the Army as they harass villagers at the monastery's clinic and send a helicopter to pass over the monastery while the monks embrace one another while chanting a hymn. The monks finally hold a second vote and after a great amount of soulsearching all decide to stay at the monastery. While music from Swan Lake plays they hold a Last Supper of sorts with the camera focusing on the beatific visage of each monk. As Christian remarks in substance their work of Christian charity is simply a reflection of the work of their maker. They cannot leave Algeria since they have promised God that they will always help the people they have promised to serve.The ending is masterfully understated. Instead of focusing on the slaughter of the innocents we merely see the terrorists march the captive monks up a mountain while it snows the scene eventually fading to white followed by the credits chronicling the fate of the principals. Of Gods and Men works on two levels. First it depicts the courage of the monks as they face death.Can any of us say we would have been as courageous as the monks were here? Secondly it's a cautionary tale about the danger of evil in the world today. No one is safe from these fanatics who seek to destroy the innocent with impunity.Despite my admiration for the monks' courage in the face of an encroaching horror I still am troubled by the fact that they remained at the monastery. What good is martyrdom when they could have packed up and helped other people in an area where their own lives wouldn't have been placed in jeopardy.Of Gods and Men is sometimes slowmoving particularly when the monks are either chanting or performing rituals of religious devotion. Despite this there are many reasons to admire this true tale brought to the screen with great sensitivity and insight.   ".

	schema:reviewBody "I feel awful about giving this film a low score but I felt I had to on the merits of my levels of interest in what was happening or what was about to happen. It very much played out like the daily life of a monk  nothing was hurried everything was calm and done in a pure and careful manner. In this way it perfectly matched the mood and the setting of the subjects of the film. But it meant that as a viewer we sat and watched while the characters would have endless prayer meetings or silent contemplations or long walks or read books to themselves  we don't even know what they were reading or eat food or have more prayers or go for another walk. All done without a word spoken. This went on. And on. And on .... and on. The acting was very good from all parts and it certainly felt realistic from all parts. But if like me you are not a Christian you begin to question the depth of the story. Of course it is a terribly sad true story. But then again in war there are millions of sad true stories. It almost felt like it was an attempt to glorify the religion rather than to tell the story since  as the film says at the end  the ultimate events were never known. In summary it's a story which doesn't stand out from any other sad story of conflict but we watch nearly two hours of nothing really happening followed by film makers' guesses as to what may have happened at the end. I wouldn't advise watching this unless you strongly desire to feel closer to the world of a monk and to feel closer to a film maker's guess at an individual story of war.".

It very much played out like the daily life of a monk  nothing was hurried everything was calm and done in a pure and careful manner. In this way it perfectly matched the mood and the setting of the subjects of the film. But it meant that as a viewer we sat and watched while the characters would have endless prayer meetings or silent contemplations or long walks or read books to themselves  we don't even know what they were reading or eat food or have more prayers or go for another walk. All done without a word spoken. This went on. And on. And on .... and on. The acting was very good from all parts and it certainly felt realistic from all parts. But if like me you are not a Christian you begin to question the depth of the story. Of course it is a terribly sad true story. But then again in war there are millions of sad true stories. It almost felt like it was an attempt to glorify the religion rather than to tell the story since  as the film says at the end  the ultimate events were never known. In summary it's a story which doesn't stand out from any other sad story of conflict but we watch nearly two hours of nothing really happening followed by film makers' guesses as to what may have happened at the end. I wouldn't advise watching this unless you strongly desire to feel closer to the world of a monk and to feel closer to a film maker's guess at an individual story of war.";

It has also won in that same category by the National Board of Review and was France's official submission to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film although it didn't make the short list. Making its debut at the Cannes Film Festival it went on to win the Grand Prix Award there. This is set in 1996 and is based on the events of a true story that took place during the struggle for power by different Islamic guerrilla groups and the government in Algeria. Caught in the middle are a group of French Roman Catholic Trappist Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance operating the selfsufficient monastery of Tibhiirine in the Algeian highlands and helping the people its nearby village. The monks have been largely left alone by the area guerrilla fighters but when their leader is killed he is replaced by an even more brutal leader and the threat to their existence is imminent. They must decide to stay or go. From writerdirector Xavier Beauvois this is a dark film that moves slow in it's two hours. Great cinematography from veteran photographer Caroline Champetier with a beautiful production design by Barthlmy in converting an abandoned monastery in Morroco that hadn't been used in 40 years for the setting. Lambert Wilson leads the ensemble cast as the Christian the leader of the monks with veteran actor Michael Lonsdale as the monastery and village doctor. This film is about 30 minutes to long and too artistically clichd for my liking. Lots of audiences and critics love it but I would only give it a 7.0 out 10".

The movie tries so hard to show the monks' presence was essential for the people of the region that they couldn't live without them but the question that comes to mind is that how could the villagers survived the history if it was so... possibly the light version of the missionary propaganda. I was misled by the positive reviews and am not sure how come most of the reviews are so uniformly positive.

	schema:reviewBody "One can react to a film in many ways including intellectually viscerally emotionally cognitively spiritually and aesthetically. One's reaction to a particular film is the result of complex interactions of all of the above and the characteristics of the film itself. Certain films are more likely to bring out particular types of reactions. This film works on many levels and will draw out complex and individual responses from each viewer. My responses were heavily influenced by my being a member of Catholic men's religious order that has a long and ongoing history or missionary work that at times puts our men in danger. This was true in the centuries since our founding and remains true for a number of my friends who are working undercover in several countries. I first watched Of Gods and Men with another member of the order who had already seen it but wanted to share the video and the experience with me. We watched on a small not very good TV with wretched sound. But within moments of the opening all of that faded away. When it was over I sat in the dark room stunned. I know several Trappist monks. I admire their lives and occasionally retreat at one of the their monasteries. While their vocation to contemplative monastic life is not my vocation the bond of being in religious vows allows us to share something fundamental and vital. I was stunned when I read about the killings in Algeria and followed the story closely in the papers. Before watching the film I read the very wellwritten The Monks of Tibhirine that supplied some back story and biographical information that was not included in the film a great deal about the history of Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria and much history of the French in Algeria. The scenes during which the men were discerning God's will both as a community and individually ring true. The lack of consensus the bickering the fear the acceptance and the gradual movement of the Spirit are the same for all orders when they engage in corporate discernment emerging from each member's individual discernment. Though forewarned by my buddy the scene of Swan Lake playing in the refectory was emotionally wrenching. The looks on the men's faces as the music swirled and the sense of community returned could never be described in words. I've been as deeply moved and emotionally drained each time I've watched the movie since about four times since the initial viewing a year ago. Quibbles about the lack of action are absurd. That is not the kind of life we lead as religious. Prayer Mass and contemplation even in an active order are the backbone of our lives together and as individuals. The combination of the honesty of the portrayals of the men's and the community's spiritual crises along with the sublime cinematography combine to make this an extraordinary film on all levels.".

This is the majority of the film in a nutshell and as such it is perhaps not a film that could stand a mass audience.I don't say this in a condescending way but just that the film is probably too slow for the casual viewer  not that others won't get it or any such nonsense as that. I liked the film but even for me there were times where it lingered too long or spent too long showing us certain aspects of life in the monastery. It did feel longer than 2 hours and I think this is mostly down to the fact that the whole film has a very slow pace and very gentle delivery. The upside of this is that it does have more emotional impact as a result  because the characters are clearer we understand their minds and I enjoyed that I was able to see their struggle and also understand the reasons for their decisions because I had seen the role they played.The film matches the slow pace with some beautiful shots visually it is a very still film and it does feel at times that it is like a great painting with the use of light and atmosphere. The performances are where the film delivers best though. Everyone is strong and seems to have understood their characters very well because they are convincing and engaging. The ballet music meal towards the end of the film is the best example but there are plenty of equally strong and expressive moments throughout.It is a slow film and even though I liked it I did still struggle with the glacial pace at times. It rewards and satisfies at the same time but a few times you do need to stick with it while it unfolds slowly.".

Throughout the movie there is a heavy emphasis on religious texts and I miss more screen time for the monks' own thoughts and conversations not just one psalm after another.The scene that gripped me the most by far was a scene where the monks ate together and drank wine while they listened to classical music. In this scene they actually live in the moment instead of contemplating religious past or future and they come alive in a much more profound sense than earlier in the movie except maybe for some of the scenes with Michael Lonsdale who does a very good job in the movie.All in all an OK movie that shows how dangerous it can be not to question beliefs this regarding both the Cistercians and the islamists.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie on TV and it left me in a state of confusion. I simply could not understand why the people making this movie made so many misstakes. And what was up with those opening scenes? I got Rambo flashbacks during that. I consider myself to be within the target audience boys who like action movies with guns babes car chases fights and so on. The problem with this movie IMO is that it underestimates its audience. Just because we like action movies does not mean we like movies with just action scenes. Nor does it mean that you do not have to make any sense.10 years ago i would have thought that this movie was tha bombe. I would have thought that it was cool. However this is not 1999 it's 2009 yes i know the movie is from 2006. After all the things that have happened in the last couple of years you simply can not show such unbelievable stuff as getting shot at a 120 times from 310 meters away during a car chase and not get hit once outside the Matrix of course.This movie made me doubt myself. Have i learned so much about combat tactics guns and ammo warfare law enforcement crime and human frailty from watching Discovery Channel and National Geographic that i am simply incapable of enjoying a simple action movie? After thinking a lot about that i concluded that the answer is yes. Yes i know to much to enjoy a simple action movie. And The Marine is about as simple as it gets. A bit more work on the script to make it more logical and coherent and this movie would have scored at least 1 more point probably 2. I know the marines are tough guys but i also know marines are not dumb. Stubborn yes but not dumb. The marine in The Marine is tough and dumb.The Marine is fun to watch but only when you have nothing else to do. If you need to kill some time then The Marine will kill it. And you will watch it all the way to the end because of Kelly Carlson. If you are a man you want her to be your lover or hostage. If you are a strait woman or gay man Kelly Carlson's hair will make you go oh wow look at that that is hot. But remember if you want to enjoy it for more than Kelly Carlson dumb yourself down a bit.I gave this movie 5 stars. 1 for Kelly Carlson and her hair 1 for Robert Patrick and his lines 1 for the guns fights and explosions 1 for the catfight and 1 for giving me hope that one day someone will give me a multimillion dollar budget to make my own action movie.".

The world was given some of the greatest action entertainments ever Terminator's 1 and 2 Die Hard Predator Robocop etc. And all of that was shamefully thrown away for the cheap ripoff's just so Hollywood can make a profit. And here we get WWE starting to finance and distribute films in hopes of expanding their fanbase and their publicity. And they start by throwing their superstar John Cena in his horrendous overthetop debut.The Marine follows John Triton Cena who has been recently discharged for disobeying direct orders and he now has a lousy security job but at the end the problem of having a job he hates isn't even resolved but what do we care?. Later on a group of diamond thieves who are trying to evade the authorities after their latest heist kidnap Triton's wife. Triton decides to do the usual in a dumb action flick he decides to go after them and take the law into his own hands. But the plot itself is too weak for us to care about what's going on. I mean the problem basically occurred by chance and coincidence when Triton and his wife just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time at the gas station. And all the plot elements don't mesh together very well.And of course its action because the WWE wrestlers just want to prove their masculinity. And overall the action sucks. There's explosions and gunfire lots and lots of explosions and gunfire. But the special effects team must've been on crack because the blasts look like splashes of Sunny Delight and the gunfire looks like it was made from a home computer with just that stupid orange X and the annoying sparkles that we see.And the acting performance by Cena is atrocious and more wooden than a redwood forest. Robert Patrick as Rome is subpar since he wasn't as threatening as he used to be in Terminator 2 and even in Die Hard 2 which he appeared in only 2 scenes. He's pretty much just spewing out dumb oneliners and acting goofy. All that rather than the intimidating silence he's known for.And the rest is just a bunch of badly timed jokes dialogue and scenarios. Especially the part when Morgan is telling about his experiences with his camp counselor and Rome ordering him to find the generator. That part was WAY outta place badly acted and awkward and it felt like it was never gonna end. And towards the end when Triton surely kills Rome in the blast then after reviving his wife Rome suddenly rises again with severe burns and then Triton kills him for good VERY VERY B movie if you ask me. And the The Marine is chock full of moments like those.I didn't give this the lowest score because some of the fist fights here were alright and I liked some of the popculture references such as the ones to Terminator and Scarface here.But don't waste your time this is for John Cena diehards only......".

I'll tell you why The Marine is not worth seeing.First off the movie has a weak plot. Not exactly original. Kidnapped wife not the best. We got a few talented people here. Kelly Carlson and Robert Patrick. However they are supports. Okay can they save this? No. I have to say without any antiCena and all honesty that John Cena is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He is more wooden than a log cabin. His tough guy facials are hilarious. How did he get this role? And how is it that an experienced actor Robert Patrick have to play second fiddle? To Cena no less? Ouch. Cena's acting made the Marine hard to watch.Also When a movie sucks the only resort to try and win over people is to....yep explosions. Forget the plot forget the story forget the bad acting as long as we have explosions the movie is saved! Right? Right???? The Last Word Utter garbage. How Cena nabbed the starring role here is going to be one of the biggest mysteries of the world. His acting is awful. The movie's script is lame too many explosions and did I mention Cena? I hate to say this but Cena don't quit your day job. Acting isn't your style.".

Also being a Marine I was at first blown away by how pathetic the Marine background footage was that they gave Cena. But about 13 of the way through this poor excuse for an action film I was very happy that they had him wear a camouflage Army cover hat for you nonmilitary types instead of a cornered Marine issue cover when he saluted that officer because neither he nor his character deserved to wear a Marine uniform. By the way a high ranking officer would never salute a Sgt. first. It's always the other way around! Apparently there were no real Marine advisers on this movie set. Even if they had all the Marine details in order the action was extremely stupid and I was left severely disappointed. Neither Cena nor Cena's character in this movie deserve to be called The Marine. One last thing. I've seen some people say the action is so realistic in this film. That is the furthest thing from the truth. I saw at least 300 bullets I'm not exaggerating either unloaded into the car Cena was driving during a chase and not a single flat tire as a result. Need I say more!?!".

While I don't look for a heavy complicated plot in an action film it is always helpful to have something to hold it together. The story line is very linear and predictable. In the theater I was in the audience actually started laughing out loud at the predictability and clich lines.

The comic remarks vary from silly things like the I hate rock candy to references to other movies when you see the movie you'll understand.

I grew up during the 80's watching and loving such action flicks as Commando Cobra Tango  Cash Action Jackson and The Marine is no worse than any of those cheesy 80's films we all know and love. I believe that is the appeal of this film to me! John Cena plays a marine by the name of John Triton. After disobeying a direct command during active duty in the Middle East he is discharged and returns home to his wife in South Carolina. Bored with his new found freedom from the service little does he know that some unwanted action is waiting for him.Like I mentioned before this is a fun action flick in the vein of the old 80's action movies. A very predictable plot but a lot of fun! Who says that every film has to be like The Lord Of The Rings or The Godfather to be enjoyed by people on a boring Sunday afternoon. The Marine does what it was meant to it entertains the audience with unrealistic action and explosions.John Cena can not act outside of the squared circle. In my humble opinion he is not even a great wrestler so I expected his wooden acting skills. Still in this type of movie who cares? Van Damme can't act either but his early films were fun like this.Overall I give this film a 510. Great for a boring rainy afternoon and a definite must for all 80's action fans.".

Cena is fantastic in his role and has 'the next Rock' written all over him he just has fantastic screen presence and perfect 'hollywood' timing. Robert'T1000'Patrick is awesome and is perfect in his villain role. Like all action films the story is a bit over the top but actually makes sense and is easy to follow. Don't expect Shakespeare or anything but there are a couple of great lines in the movie. Despite all it's action movie clich's it came off to me as fresh fun and definitely worth the admission fee don't be put off because it's a wwe production. Big Thumbs UP!".

While at a gas station Kate is kidnapped by a jewel thief named Rome and his associates. John goes on a 1man rampage in order to get her back.

	schema:reviewBody "The Marine 2006 Directed By John Bonito Starring John Cena Kelly Carlson Robert Patrick Abigail Bianca Anthony Ray Parker  Manu Bennett MPAA Rating Unrated for intense sequences of violent action sensuality and language PLEASE NOTE This Is A Review Of The Unrated Version Of The Movie Just recently I gave See No Evil a passing grade despite labeling it as one of the most clichd and stereotypical slasher flicks ever devised. I mention See No Evil in a review for this because they are both movies produced by WWE Films and both suffer from the same exact problem yet both have gained my recommendation for the exact same thing. The Marine is one of the most clichd and stereotypical action flicks ever devised Does that sound familiar?. It stars John Cena another wrestler trying to prove that he can act and exists solely to have him survive as many explosive situations and kill as many bad guys as possible. Unsurprisingly The Marine has very few new or innovative ideas to offer which is why most people could simply skip this movie altogether and never even realize that they had missed it. However it doesn't necessarily make for a boring watch and is certain to entertain casual moviegoers to some extentthough said extent is probably not very far at all.John Triton Cena is a recentlydismissed marine who was sent home after failing to follow orders. Kate Triton Carlson is his beautiful and beloved wife who supports him no matter and desires only to make him happy. Rome Patrick is a cruel and ruthless diamond thief who will betray anyone in order to line his own pockets. Angela Bianca is a coldhearted killer who exists to serve Rome her lover. When John and Kate are on their way to the mountains for a relaxing vacation they happen to stop at the same gas station as Rome and Angela and their other henchmen who have just pulled off a huge diamond heist. After a Rome's triggerhappy assistant Morgan Parker shoots and kills a cop Rome and his entourage destroy the gas station leave John for dead and kidnap Kate. But John is not deadand he will do anything to save his wife. Suddenly all hell breaks loose as John goes on a wild and explosive adventure to find his wife and bring her back home. But what he doesn't know is that someone he thought he could trustis working for his greatest enemy.The performances in The Marine are average at best but they didn't really need to be any better. I didn't go into this movie thinking that it was going to have any Academy Award worthy performances. John Cena is best known okay so only known for his longtime role in WWE Monday Night RAW. Now professional wrestlers are not typically good actors by any means. They are typically flat emotionless cardboard cutouts with muscles. Glen Kane Jacobs proved that he had what it took to portray a bloodthirsty serial killer with conviction in See No Evil so I was slightly optimistic for Cena's breakout role. Well I got an average but believable performance. He did a decent job. Kelly Carlson who is incredibly gorgeous in my opinion and quite talented also does a nice job. She first caught my attention with her provocative role in NipTuck and she shows here that she can transition between television and film. Robert Patrick plays yet another villainous roleI mean really this is getting very predictable. I guess he does what he is good at because he too does fine. But the guy really needs to start taking more diverse roles.The biggest problem with The Marine aside from its glaring lack of originality and creativity is the overall ridiculousness of the action. When things explode in this film they explode and destroy everything for miles aroundexcept for our hero who is thrown several feet by the explosion into safety. Our hero is tossed around thrown out of a car that is burning and flying off of a cliff practically blown up shot at by assault rifles and more and yet he remains almost completely unscathed. What is he a robot for crying out loud? On top of that the music used in the movie is almost excruciatingseriously. This is the first time in a long time where I actually thought that the music almost ruined the movie. It was dreadfuland the random bits of humor and quirky moments were even worse. The recurring jokes about rock candy had me rolling my eyes and there are other jokes that get old just as fast. The dialog itself is horrendous and deeply false. However The Marine didn't need good dialog to be a decent action movie because let's face it a typical action movie replaces any substance it should have had with senseless violence and action. This is not necessarily a good movie but it is entertaining enough to warrant a watch. But just like with so many movies released lately do not expect anything new.Final Thought Ridiculously overthetop and silly The Marine manages to get my recommendation because it is more fun than it should be.Overall Rating 510 B".

This movie is a draw back to the old 80's action flicks like the Ateam Rambo Camando and Delta Force. I look forward to more movies like this one. I recommend this movie to all those nonanalytical types who are just looking for great action and entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've just stumbled on this movie and I thought why not? Perhaps it's so bad it's funny and I must admit it showed potential on that part. First thing you'll see is the opening sequence John Cena in a Marine official suit saluting the audience with the American flag as background. Enormous potential for a funny trash movie.If you read some of the best reviews here you'll find a lot of hilarious comments like John Cena is an excellent actor. Pure '80 fun and This movie is what's so great about America. Those people are clearly girls or boys in their teens who've been fed with MTV bull PS2 games and cheap CGI . Let's dimanstle them in a quick way1 John Cena is an excellent actor. If this guy was serious and the way he wrote it would imply so then we're in dire need of some obligatory school lessons about funny action movies 2 Pure '80 fun. No no it's not. The '80 gave us the finest cheesy action with Commando Rambo 2 Die Hard and so on. Those were funny movies. This movie is abysmal.3 Let me tell you that if this movie's what's so great about America then America must really stink as nation. Because The Marine an action movie starring John Cena Robert Partick Kelly Carlson and some other useless wannabe actors doesn't even try to be ironic or make fun of itself as it should in fact it tries to be a serious action movie. But let's make a quick summary to help you understand the atrocity of The Marine plot clichd as hell. Those who say but man this is a rad action movie who cares about the plot?? are forgetting that ALL the good action movies have some decent plot Predator Lethal Weapon Die Hard Face Off Hard Boiled god forbid me. This has none villains kidnap Cena's wife Cena smashes everything including passing through a couple of houses while hanging on a truck Cena rescues his loved one. All this crap would actually resemble Commando but you have a lot of humor and gags there absolutely necessary for an over the top movie. There's zero here.John Cena he's probably the worst actor you'll ever see. His face remains exactly the same plain thing during the whole movie when he kisses his wife when he's angry when he's sad when he's happy when he's a douche. Go watch the first tree you find down the road and that's Cena's performance in a nutshelldialogues ... movie's in dire need of some irony but like I already pointed out it tries to be serious. A series of one liners trying to be funny but they're just lame as hell. It's not even unintentionally funny. It's just boring.in short don't even consider renting this crap for some laughs with your friends you'll bore them to tears. Get Taxxi The transporter or Snatch if you want tome dumb but ultimately funny action. It's a dangerous mixture of zero plot and acting frenzied editing bad CGIed explosions. It's just awful. But I don't want you to miss the movie intro with Cena's salute. Come on it's ten seconds worth of your money".

This movie on the other hand was quite enjoyable.First off was the acting. Robert Patrick and Kelly Carlson were phenomenal. I found myself pleasantly surprised by John Cena's performance as John Triton. Cena much like Stallone or Schwarzanegger isn't going to win any awards or dramatic leads but as far as action films go his acting was solid. Overall the movie was quite well cast and there are only a few spots of bad  or over  acting.The writing wasn't too terrible. There were a few spots of dialogue that were silly or unnecessary but overall it was a standard action film. The plot while very common did have some unique twists. Most fans who have seen a ton of movies will be able to pick up on and guess the twists before they happen but still enjoyable. The special effects were actually really good. I can't say enough how much I prefer to see things get blown up instead of CGId. CGI looks fake most of the time but real explosions just look so much better.Overall I really enjoyed the movie. If you are an action fan especially of films like Rambo and Predator I'd recommend you see this film. If you're a wrestling fan it's as good as it gets. If you like the Rock you'll like Cena!".

It is a trivial plot element that can be overlooked  and in the film's defence they did try and justify it by making romance a bit magical though probably didn't need to go that far.The film was sweet colourful and fun to watch. The music was great and the acting was decent. Having said that I think there were some fundamental flaws in the films and tricks they missed1. Why should the girl love Suri when he offers her none of the love and fun that Raj does? I don't understand why she is supposed to settle for the 'real' Suri when he is so boring. If Taani is supposed to compromise for her husband should he not also become a bit more like Raj and meet her half way? It would have been great if he had started dressing a bit more fashionably for her even in his 'Suri' self. 2. We are told that Taani is a loyal and decent wife. Yet it is completely out of character for her to think about running away with another man. I was a bit disappointed that she didn't even tell Raj she was married and spent so much time with him outside home.3. A perfect twist to the film would be for Taani to have known all along  it would have been a nice way of showing that Taani did recognise his heart from the start but she also wanted to see how far Suri could go. But without this twist the story was very predictable.These things make the film very frustrating for me. But at the same time I don't want to fault it too much as I think it is still on the right path  I'm fed up of the showoffy 'Don's of Bollywood today. Romance is still where it's at.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie was already the most hotly anticipated film of the year when it was announced in March because it is finally the third directorial outing of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Mohabbatein director Aditya Chopra. Aditya's films always turn out to be good and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is his next movie 8 years after Mohabbatein. The story is about an 'odd' couple played by Shahrukh Khan and Anushka Sharma who find true love in the backdrop of a dance competition called Dancing Jodi. Surinder Sahni Shahrukh Khan a man working for Punjab Power who falls in love with Taani Anushka Sharma the flamboyant funloving vivacious girl for whom the whole world is her canvas and she paints her own life with the colours of rainbow all until unforeseen circumstances changes it all and brings them together. They get married and lead a notso happy life due to huge age difference between Surinder and Taani. Taani meanwhile wants to participate in a reality dance show called Dancing Jodi which is the main backdrop of the movie. The dance contest showcases couples of all races colours backgrounds and sexual preferences. Taani wants to take part for the show but she is not able to due to her husband's lack of fashion statement. Later on when Surinder finds out about his wife's wish to participate in the reality dance show he undergoes a major change. Taani keeps falling in love with her changed husband.Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is such a beautiful film that touches your heart that makes you cry and laugh in some points like Shahrukh against a sumo wrestler. Some of my friends thought that it looked rubbish because in the promos Shahrukh Khan had a moustache and comb over and was wearing bad cloths but is truly the best the best Bollywood movie of the year after a long list of turkeys. It is also the first Shahrukh film of the year and before this he made special appearances in Krazzy 4 and Bhootnath. The music is brilliant although they can't match with the classic soundtracks of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Mohabbatein but there were about 5 songs and every single song was good and I don't know what the best songs are. It is a must see unless you do not like Shahrukh or have a heart of stone because there is no way you are going to like it.".

I loved him as both characters they both made me smile and also drove me to tears! Anuksha did a brilliant job as her debut character and I couldn't believe this was only her first film. She was marvelous and fresh as Taani. The songs are just beautiful and they will either make you get up and dance or lay down and just cry tears of happiness. The climax was mesmerizing and surprising the comedy was wonderful and the message was very important that we need to love our jodi for who they are and not who we wish they are.

Each genre and each storyline will have a different yardstick depending on what the film is setting out to achieve. Don't go looking for logic and 'intelligence' in a film when its primary motive is to make people laugh and have a good time.And I will host a grand party the day rediff ditches Mr.raja sen.That aside Rab ne is a film which will make you feel good and happy and Shahrukh absolutely deserves credit for this. His performance as Mr.Surinder is an absolute delight to watch and the mannerisms will leave you in splits of laughter. And then the performance as Raj is the icing on the cake.I wont say anything more about this as it will spoil the experience for you.Shahrukh Khan take a bow.This is amongst your best performances to date.The new face of the film Anushka deserves special mention for the way she acted and carried off the role of Taani. There is innocencecharma certain vulnerability and tenderness in the character but at the same time she can be quite a force to reckon with if provoked. And Anushka lived in the role. For a debutant its amazing.Vinay pathak as usual was his excellent self as the best friend of Shahrukh and their moments on screen are truly rib tickling.'Haule Haule' song is very good and so is the background score. It adds weight to the film and to the comedy. All the other songs are pretty decent.The way the city of Amritsar was shown is also very nice and the rich production values of yashraj films is clearly visible in each and every frame.And finally for the director. Welcome back Mr. Aditya. We missed you and we hope that you make movies a little more often than you do.Maybe the ending could have been handled slightly better but then its not a major gripe. Some parts of the story may defy conventional logic like the way Shahrukh manages to juggle his different 'careers'. But as I said earlierthese kinds of films are not about logic or intelligence.They are about making you laugh and have a good time and in that Rab ne is eminently successful.All in all Rab ne is a very feel good film that you can go out and watch with your whole family. 100 Paisa Vasool film".

This film is not about a dance competition but it is about a human being who can be so natural that do not need any artificial pomp and show to be an honest lover. Shah Rukh Khan has done his job brilliantly. He is such a solid actor and no one in Indian cinema can match his character playing and emotions portraying. He can even make a dumb movie like Om Shanti Om look good and be hit. Must watch this movie in theater and you will definitely want to see it again.".

From the first 10 minutes to the last everything happened as a coincidence and the actors keep saying it God's reason that they were together given straight form the title RAB NE BANA DI JODI. Shah Rukh has given one of his worst performances ever. He over acted as Suri the geek who worked for Punjab Power and even worse while playing Raj a cool hip guys that comes out of no where. Although the heroine in this movie Anushka Sharma did put a lot of effort into her debut role but sad to say her character was not well built. I mean seriously you wont recognize you husband if he took of his glasses and shaved his mustache? Where did she think she was going to end up with being friends with Raj? From the first time Raj and Taani met he was flirting with her and kept talking about love and just kept overacting to be the coolest person in the planet. Everything happens coincidentally from Day 1 of where Suri and Taani met at her wedding there just happened to be a bus accident where the whole family of the groom  and the groom himself dies. Hearing this news her father has a heart attack and then they are married shortly after all this tragedy. How realistic does this sound to you? Even a kid in Preschool can figure out that there's something not right with this picture. I don't understand how some one can say this is a good movie in any way the music including the background score was mediocre the photography was below par the art direction was bad everything in the movie from the streets to the garage looked like a set the only realistic looking location was the Golden Temple the actor has give out a performance with the same crap he has been giving out for his past 100s of movie and most importantly the dialogs and the story were absolutely ridiculous. With the movie rating to be below par in all these categories how can one say this was a great movie. We are in 2009 and Bollywood has been making the same kind of crap since the dawn of Indian cinema. One can argue with me by saying if this movie was crap why did it do so well in the Box Office. Well I have 3 letters for you SRK. People will spend money to see SRK's appearance on screen not matter how crappy the story or the director is. Well getting back to the movie I gave this a 1 out of 10 because of its impracticality and the redundant storyline over the years of Bollywood cinema.".

Eventually she quit just 1520 minutes before the climax if thats what you can call it. We moved out of the theatre to do better things on a lazy Sunday evening but lost so much time already waiting for some chamatkarmiracle from RabGod or Rab Ne.... My friends condition was similar to that of AnoushkaTanni in a scene when she is watching some movie and runs out of the theatre away from SRK. I wonder if that was an ironic hint for the audience as well.The performance of ShahrukhSurinder Sahni is so predictable and irritating that it would make a brain tumor look merciful. AnoushkaTanni forgot to join acting classes before entering this venture and Aditya Chopra needs to revisit direction classes. Even the songs seemed too forced in certain situations and the chemistry between the lead pair is flat as it was supposed to be touching. In a love story there is supposed to be love and not compromise  good luck which it appears to be in this case.Also I heard a lot of praise about Vinay Pathak'sSahnis friend performance. Firstly he doesn't fit the role of a guy who can produce a makeover by just shaving someones moustache. And then he seems to be competing with Shahrukh Khan in the overacting business looking more like the audiences worst enemy than Surinder's best friend.Thanks Yash Raj for proving once more that you'll are up for producing only rehashed bull which we the audience are supposed to digest at any cost.Everyone please take a prescription from your doctor for severe headache and nausea if you plan on visiting this movie.".

SwadesChak De and now Rab Ne.His performance in Rab Ne is right up there and no other actor could portray the character of Surinder with such lan as SRK did. Well I've heard SRK say in some interview prior to Rab ne release of how his previous 6 Yashraj Films had contributed in making him 90 superstar. Wellnow you could make it 7 in a row and YRF has made him 100 superstar. The YahrajSRK saga continues and it is now in the form of its life. Aditya Chopra after a historic DDLJa mediocre Mohabbatein is back with Rab Ne.It doesn't get bigger and better than Rab Ne.Well after watching this film you would curse yourself on how Adi betrayed all the Indiam movie lovers by directing just 3 films in the last 14 years.How rich could Indian cinema have been had he directed a few more gems ala Rab Ne.C'mon Adi..We would want to see you in the director's chair rather than producing those horrific movies Roadside Romeo.DarrDDLJDTPHMohabbateinVeer ZaaraChak De and now Rab Ne.SRK is back with YRF.What is it that makes this combo churn out the most memorable movies we would ever watch on the silver screen year after year.Rab Ne inspite of being a good 2 12 hour long movie rivets you in every single frame.It is a movie which would take you into a different worlda world of Surinder Sahni.As promised by the makers one would identify themselves with the protagonistfeel for himlive with him and when u start living with the character and forget everything around u know pretty well that the film is working big time.A simple love story where every scene is so convincingly shot that one wonders on how the shooting was completed in just 47 days and the script written in 12 days. It would be immature of me to even comment about SRK's performance.Anushka Sharma Well she couldn't have asked for more.And she performed with such confidence that would have made even the likes of the Kajols and Madhuris proud Vinay Pathak enters the big league as well and we will now start seeing him taking center stage in the more prominent movies.Little moments from this film leave such a lasting impression.Be it the scene on the dining table with the roseThe back ground tune and the score of Haule Haule being played intermittently at regular intervals for little triumphs of Suri Taania greeting Suri's friends on the Reception nightthe Holi scenethe Yellow Tiffin Boxthe Biryani thingThe sorry episode to name a few.You would yearn for Taania to unite with Suri and not elope with Raj.Inspite of loving the character Raj all these days in DDLJKKHH and so many other movies we start disliking him and rather feel for the Surinder and would want him to succeed in his love.That is where the movie succeeds big time. Admitted it gets a bit dull in the middle with the dance episodes and all but u would when the entire 2 12 hours revolves around just 2 characters.But still the movie remains afloat thanks to all those wonderful little moments that are spread throughout.Agreed it is no DDLJno KKHH but still you would not want to miss it.Go watch it!!!!".

A stork in the woods as it rains. A cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. You don't need vast elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. Reading viewers' comments on the movie it seems that most found the second half  which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed  as the most satisfying. A few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn't really get going until the second half. For me it was the first half that got under my skin the most for its cinematic originality poetry and symbolic power. War is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers this may seem like an obvious statement but it's only after watching Come and See that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman defenseless child and frail senior citizen. Also never before had I seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. In cinema rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. It isn't always quite clear why women get so upset over it. In Come and See rape is shown as nothing but pure unadulterated hatefuelled violence with only a superficial external resemblance to sex. Unlike other raped women on film you cannot imagine those in Come and See ever healing from their scars. On another subject whoever thinks this movie contains propaganda is obviously prejudiced against the movie simply because it's a Soviet production and should think things over a little more carefully. It's astonishing how you can still find little traces of the Cold War mentality surviving to this day even in younger viewers... The fact that as detractors of Come and See claim Stalin was no better than Hitler has nothing to do with anything at all in this movie's context  Klimov's picture is NOT about nationalistic oneupmanship on who had the worst tyrant  it's about the basic suffering of ordinary humanity in war  ANY war though this one happened to be going on in Bielorussia. There was in fact ten times more propaganda in ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan than the whole of Come and See. This is painful sublime cinema. I've always believed there's something special about Russians when it comes to producing art especially literature  this movie goes some way towards reinforcing that impression in me.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the greatest of all war films Klimov's stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia's triumph over the German invaders in WW2 based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war the propagandist use to which it was later put  when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism  does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov's shorter Larissa 1980 is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See.

'Come and See' is an invitation for its youthful protagonist to arm up and investigate the war but also one for the audience to tread a similarly terrible path witnessing with vivid immediacy the Belorussion holocaust at close hand. Here the intensity of what is on offer justifies amplification by the use of a travelling camera pointofview shots and some startlingly surreal effects pointing up unnatural events the small animal clinging nervously to the German commander's arm for instance soundtrack distortions or the mock Hitler sculpted out of clay and skull.Main character Floyra is the director's witness to events a horrified visitor forced like us to 'see'  even if full comprehension understandably follows more slowly. For instance during their return to the village there is some doubt as to if Floyra is yet or will be ever able to fully acknowledge the nature of surrounding events. In one of the most disturbing scenes out of a film full of them Glasha's reaction to offscreen smells and sights is profoundly blithe and unsettling. So much so we wonder for a brief while if the youngsters really know what is going on. Its a watershed of innocence one look back as the two leave and the reality of the situation would surely overwhelm Floyra  just as later more explicit horrors do the viewer.Come And See was not an easy shoot. It lasted over nine months and during the course of the action the young cast were called upon to perform some unpleasant tasks including at one point wading up to their necks through a freezing swamp. Kravchenko's face is unforgettable during this and other experiences and there are claims that he was hypnotised in order to simulate the proper degree of shell shock during one of the major early sequences. The sonic distortion created on the soundtrack at this point later appeared to a lesser extent in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan as did elements of a muchcommented scene where a cow is caught in murderous crossfire. Klimov's camera ranges through and around the atrocities although one doubts that a steady cam was available. By the end Florya is isolated from humanity technically as well as mentally by a striking shot that excludes the middle foreground. Disturbingly expressionistic though these scenes are others such as the scene where Florya and the partisan girl Rose visit the forest after the bombing achieve an eerie lyricism that are however entirely missing from the Hollywood production. And whereas Spielberg's work concludes with a dramatic irony that's perhaps a little too neat contrived for different audience tastes Klimov's less accommodating epic finishes on a unique cathartic moment  no doubt partly chosen to avoid any bathos after events just witnessed but one which sends real blame back generations.Hallucinatory heartrending traumatic and uncompromising such a movie will not to be all tastes. It certainly does not make for relaxing viewing although those who see it often say it remains with them for years after. This was Klimov's last film for as he said afterwards I lost interest in making films. Everything that was possible I felt had already been done no doubt referring to the emotional intensity of his masterpiece which would be hard to top. By the end of their own viewing any audience ought to be shocked enough to pick up a rifle themselves and vengefully join the home army setting out to fight the Great Patriotic War  a necessarily stalwart response without limit of participation symbolised by the director who tracks a camera through the dense forest before finally rejoining a column of soldiers heading to the front. If you feel like I do that any real war film should succeed in conveying the power and pity of it all then Come And See is an absolute go and watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "One of the greatest of all war films Klimov's stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia's triumph over the German invaders in WW2 based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war the propagandist use to which it was later put  when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism  does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov's shorter Larissa 1980 is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See. Through his images the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason if on this occasion not just one but thousands.At the heart of the narrative is Floyra both viewer and victim of the appalling events making up the film's narrative his history a horrendous comingofage story.

	schema:reviewBody "In all fairness this Belorussianmade World War II picture detailing Nazi atrocities holds a special distinction in world cinema it is by far the most brutal and emotionally draining of all  in fact a viewer whose senses have not been properly trained would most likely find it unwatchable. Those brave souls willing to be put through an ordeal of almost 2 12 hours will find themselves deeply immersed in an absolutely horrifying experience that will not easily subside whether they want it to or not.The title Come and See taken from the frequently repeating lines of the book of Revelation clearly dares the audience to assume the role of St. John witnessing the Apocalypse or rather one of the darkest periods in the history of humankind. What we are assaulted with plays somewhat like a demented version of Modern Times transpiring across the panel of Brueghel's Trimuph of Death if such a combination is possible. The camera is consistently filtered through a murky slightly unfocused gaze and the sound is often heard through shellshocked ears. This tends to eirly distance the events yet make them even more frightening and unsettling. Much of the dialogue lacks specific meaning or even concrete sentences  it is replaced by subhuman growling wailing and other spinechilling gluttural sounds of the war. What the director prepares is something Spielberg would never even dream of  no sign of compromise with the audience. A crowd of civilian villagers locked up in a barn by Nazi soldiers is not spared at the last minute like Schindler List's Jews they are burned alive and we get to watch all of it.Unlike most of the films in this genre Come and see relies mainly on images and sounds instead of a coherent plot which is not necesserily a weakness since the sheer terror distorts time and space into a kind of hallucinatory blur clearly intentional and understandable. But this incredible level of bleak intensity in the long run has a negative effect on the film the viewers have to desensitize themselves just so they can keep watching so the most harrowing scenes are sat through in numbness.Another questionable move on the director's part is his occasional use of surrealism. While some visuals are painfully believable while others are simply baffling crazed villages consructing an effigy of Hitler a pensive German commander with a pet slender loris a rare African primate on his shoulder a female Nazi eating raw red lobster not even mentioning a bizzare final montage wich is both inexplicable and obvious ending with a reallife photograph that is perhaps the most terrifying of all in its implications. Yes at times the movie overachieves its goals and seems almost like the footage in The Clockwork Orange that they made Alex watch to cure him of ultraviolent behaviour yet other times it delivers the kind of jolts those accustomed to mainstream cinema could only wish they had. The face of a youth who had lost all sanity and aged many decades over several days will be etched for an indefinite amount of time into the memory of anyone who has seen this film.".

	schema:headline " Possibly the definitive Russian front film";
	schema:reviewBody "Come and See is bizarre disturbing and haunting.  It is more moving and enlightening than all of the other mostly disappointing films I have seen depicting the Russian front in World War II.  Strangely enough the Red Army is entirely absent from the movie.As a Russian film it begins less conventionally than most films produced in the west.  It starts off very surreal and it is difficult at some points to understand what is going on or what certain characters are doing.  This gives the theme a foreign and realistic feel.  We follow the life of a peasant boy in Byleorussia in 1943 as he joins the partisans.  Certain events involving his family and his introduction to the partisans especially one involving a young girl make his fight more personal. Strange interactions between characters and Director Elem Klimov's follow tracking shots dominate the film and give it a unique method of storytelling.  Then the nightmare begins.The destruction of a Russian village is the horrific centerpiece of the story.  It is brutally realistic with more tracking shots that hold for long periods of time without cutting.  We see the German Wehrmacht burn a barn loaded with civilians to the ground as these soldiers clap smile and embrace each other.  The chaotic action involves many scenes that are sporadic flames burning out of control a German soldier accidently shoved into the barn house with the victims and possibly improvised which lend a great authenticity to the material.  The images are unforgettable and will stay with you long after you've seen the film.  Klimov has succeeded in putting the viewer in the village.  Surprisingly despite coming out of the Soviet Union in 1985 Come and See never felt to me like propaganda. There was no communist rhetoric and the heroes were all partisans many of which were flawed.  The Germans aren't caricatures at the same time they commit acts of evil and view their actions in a banal way.  When one of them defends the atrocities of his platoon he states inferior races spread the microbes of communism.  The character delivers this line not with fierce anger but with nonchalance as if it were common knowledge not something that he needs to explain to anyone. Some reviews have criticized the afterthought a rewind of the Nazi rise to power and invasion of Europe as unnecessary.  It may be but it is still powerful.  Other flaws people find with the movie are all characteristics of the director's style therefore I don't find them flaws.  Come and See is a great very different and very moving film.  Grade A".

As a result I am often slightly disappointed with much of what I see as all the hype that I've read about a film kind of blows my expectations out of all proportion. I had a feeling this would be the case with Elem Klimov's 'Come and See' a film I'd read a lot about particularly here on the IMDb. Imagine my excitement when having tried to see the film for nearly a year I discovered it was to be released on DVD a week or two ago from today!

I'm rambling now but I'll simply end by saying that 'Come and See' is with its outstanding technical and artistic credentials aside a film whose very title alone demands that it be seen.

	schema:reviewBody "There's not much one can say about this movie besides Be warned it's going to hurt you  a lot. The story is simple Byelorussia in 1943 and it's Hell on the Earth. The Nazis are fighting a noquartergivenorasked war against huge Soviet partisan units and the population is caught in between historically the German security forces destroyed hundred of Byelorussian villages murdering most of the population in the effort to clear the rear of Third Panzer Army. Those who haven't been deported or killed by the Nazis are trying to join the partisans. One of them is Florya a young boy  and in his quest to join the fight he get much more he had bargained for. It's a movie about an apocalyptic world the title is taken from the Book of Revelation a most of the movie looks like it has been filmed on another planet but unfortunately it was allreal. The emotional centre of the movie is a lengthy sequence involving the destruction of a village with all the sickening but not exploitative details shown with cold determination. There's no catharsis this is not Schindler's List! no hope no redemption  even the eventual revenge against the village's destroyers become just a sad and murderous business. Come And See is a difficult violent and surprisingly poetic movie compared to which even classics like Saving Private Ryan Spielberg payed a homage to this movie on SPR's beginning or The Thin Red Line seems just artificial. This is the real thing!".

	schema:reviewBody "Come and See 1985 I first saw this movie a couple of years ago. I didn't really know what to think of it at first. The soundtrack on the DVD is a little messy and the acting was a bit strange. I knew it had affected me though in a way that not many other movies had. As time went by I began to realize just how much of an impact the movie had on me. It really really stuck with me. One night while writing a review of Errol Morris's latest documentary Fog of War I found myself thinking more and more about Come and See and decided that I had to watch it again immediately. I ran out after midnight and rented it and watched it 3 times or so over the next week. I started to see why the film had been haunting me and sticking around my thoughts. The reason was that this movie is simply a masterpiece.Elem Klimov directs the film starring Aleksei Kravchenko as Florya a young boy who desires to fight with the Partisan's army against the invading Nazi army. He digs until he finds a rifle then the next day he is off to a camp in the middle of the woods. The scene is chaotic it seems and unorganized. The fighters try to take a photo that takes about 5 minutes to accomplish because everyone keeps messing up their positions. Florya spots Glasha Olga Mironova a young girl who has the younger fighters swooning over her and who also seems to have some sort of relationship with the leader of the camp. What that relationship is exactly we never find out. Florya gets left behind on the attack because he is perhaps too young and besides another older fighter needs some new boots and swaps with the new kid. .The anxious Florya is upset by this decision and he takes to the woods for some solitude he cries and then discovers that near by Glasha is also crying at being left at the camp more so for being left alone than behind. The two begin to bond and end up in an open field when German planes attack and begin to bomb the encampment. The scenes that follow next teeter on the brink of madness on film. Come and See is likely one of the most maddening films ever made for that matter. The key is the soundtrack. Florya is struck deaf for a few moments by the bombs. Sounds are muffled but not like anything you've ever seen in a Hollywood film. The soundtrack is a mix of strange ringing and sounds and music adding to the atmosphere of chaos that the two youngsters have now been thrown into. Much of the film has this style of soundtrack which makes the Florya's descent into madness much more poignant.The film movies forward from here back to Florya's village which has now been deserted. The two head to an island on the other side of a bog where Florya believes the town is hiding along with his mother and sisters. The scene where they climb through the mud is another example of Florya losing his mind. The soundtrack again becomes ambient and menacing in its strange blends of sounds. They eventually find some villagers and Florya now even more loses his sanity along with some of his hair which is given to recreate a statue of Hitler. This will be the last time we see Glasha in the movie as Florya goes with a party to collect food for the starving people.The most famous scene and the one that will likely never leave you is of a village being ransacked by Nazi soldiers. The scene is chaotic and culminates in a barn stuffed with the townspeople being burned and shot apart. Another one of the most famous shots from the movie is of Florya shooting a photo of Hitler each bullet making time reverse. The photo goes back in time until it is a picture of Hitler as a baby on his mothers lap. He is an innocent infant and Florya cannot bring himself to fire another shot. These shots are incredibly powerful and they stick in your mind.Obviously Come and See was filmed with influences of Soviet Propaganda in it but it hardly matters because it is so well made and so maddening you can't help but be totally absorbed by the experience. The movie has a hypnotic quality about it and without being horrifying because it's a jump out of your seat surprise bloodbath it is horrifying in its representation of the cruelty people are capable of in war.I can't remember ever seeing another film that expressed the descent into madness any better and being so involving as Come and See. By the end of the film you feel like you've just experienced what it must be like to lose your mind. The film never goes into the desensitizing of violence in war. Instead it focuses on the violence which causes those who witness to become desensitized from the madness of its cruelty.Elem Klimov created this film out of his actors and their emotions and essentially used the viewer as another character. This movie draws you in and makes you experience exactly what the characters must. There are few other films that do that to you especially to the extent that this one does it. And for that Come and See is not only a masterpiece it's really one of the best films you'll ever see. Find it but don't just watch it. Allow it to take you in even if that means you have to see it a couple times. Let it take you in and you're in for an experience rarely found in cinema anymore".

People like me who were born 1015 years after the war ended knew it all along first hand from the stories told by parents and grandparents actually living through those times and events. My own mother at the age of seven was thrown by German soldiers into a barn that got lit her front teeth were knocked out by the butt of a German soldier's rifle and she along with tenth of other village kids was saved by my grandmother and other villagers only because some partisans had chosen to attack and deliberate the village that day. What most of Western viewers find horrifying shocking and disturbing is nothing but the truth being accurately depicted by some later movie makers. This movie is pretty much like a documentary that could actually be shot with the help of some sort of a time machine in case there was one in 1985 when the movie got filmed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Come and See  well if you hate violence and brutality then you certainly wont want to see this. This Picture set in 1943 occupied Byelorussia is most probably the most true to life war movie ever only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can come close. What is amazing in this picture  is how the director uses a child's perspective and view in circumstances that you can only describe as evil. The director pulls no punches in how bad times actually were for peasents and partisans alike as German and collaborators show the viewer how low and depraved a fascist military machine actually is.I dont want to go into the plot  as this film is a MUST for anyone who considers themselves a film buff. Disturbing and terrifying scenes do not in anyway spoil the flow of the film  but when viewing this film  please desist from seeing this movie in the early evening  as you wont sleep.The acting accolades of course goes to the main characters  but I wish to give a special mention for the Russian Partisan Commander  who was just simply  superb. Everything about him was what you'd expect a Red Army Officer to be. The looks  the attitude and the steely determination is simply a credit to the actor. The best scene involving the Red Army Commander was when they had captured an Einsatgruppen Unit  and the SS soldier  who knew they were facing death was allowed to speak  after there own Commanding Officer was pleading pitifully for his own life. The SS soldier tells his captors that they are subhuman and that there peasent belief in Marxism was grounds enough that they should be eradicated. The Red Army Commander then in just a few words tells his men  that they are not just fighting for Socialism  but also the right to exist.What happens after...well you'll have to see.Come and See is nothing short of disturbing awesome powerful and brutal. This is the best film I have ever seen regarding films portraying the Eastern Front 19411945 war. This film should be engraved in gold as the standard for any budding war film director. Only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can be put in the same League table.".

The racial policy of the Nazis was to eliminate all inferior races such as Jews and Slavs from Eastern Europe and to make land available for German settlement in the east Lebensraum. Because of the importance of Eastern Europe to Nazi policy the bulk of the German Army was sent to the eastern rather than the western front. Estimated that 20 million or more Russians by Russians I mean the people of many nationalities that included Russians Ukrainians Byelorussians Jews and many others who used to live on the Soviet territories occupied by Germans during 19411943 died fighting Hitler recent estimates place figure 2530 million. Units of the SS Schutzstaffel and SD Sicherheitsdienst were used to carry out the genocide. The SD was separated from the main body of the German Army Wehrmacht and made up of fanatical Nazis and fascist East European often from the Baltic collaborators.Elem Klimov's and Ales Adamovich's Film is perhaps one of the most powerful and horrifying films about the war I would add Tarkovsky's The Childhood of Ivan aka Ivanovo Detstvo and Mikhail Romm's documentary Obyknovenny Fascism aka Ordinary Fascism aka Triumph Over Violence. Not for a moment would the film let the viewer relax. With each scene the feeling of horror increases. We are transformed into the main character 16 year old boy Florya. We are forced to see with his eyes to hear with his ears. In the beginning of the film Florya is a child. At the end after having witnessed the unspeakable terrors of the fascists he becomes an adult and not just an adult  an old man. His face is the face of War  and it is to us the viewers authors say  come and look in this face if you dare. War unmistakably selects as its victims the weakest the youngest and the tenderest  the authors could not go against this truth. In the military camp Florya meets the young girl Glasha. Together they try to make their way to the village where his family lived. But no one is there it is empty  it is burnt out. And again some force pushes Florya Glasha and us to go further. But where? To the shed where the women and the children are burning alive? Into the hands of the rapists fascists? Or to be photographed with the revolver put at your temple surrounded by the laughing SSmen? Is there any way out of the Inferno of War? The mystery of the final episode Florya can not force himself to shoot the child at the photograph sitting at his mother's lap. Even if the child's name is Adolph Hitler. Florya puts his rifle down. The clear blue sky is above him. Sounds Mozart's Requiem. What is this? Victory? Or defeat? Did Florya survive or did he perish like millions and millions during the endless days months and years of the worst war the humankind had known? Even if survived physically he is a changed forever man the man who looked triumphant death and horror in the eye for too long to ever forget them.".

The realism makes you wonder how many people were harmed making the film while the score represents the mindnumbing experiences of Florya a tourdeforce performance by Aleksei Kravchenko 16 at the time.  All along somehow Klimov knows very well how to prevent the audience from becoming numb.ILM's specialFX are smoother but the FX here in 'Come and see' are so realistic it's almost unreal reminiscent of the first 30 min of Saving private Ryan Thin red line watch the animals Apocalypse Now and the painstaking 'Band of brothers'.  Indeed forget about the rest of 'SPR' Platoon and even Full Metal Jacket.  However I would like to recommend Deer Hunter Cimino 1978 and Hotaru no haka 1988.

All along somehow Klimov knows very well how to prevent the audience from becoming numb.ILM's specialFX are smoother but the FX here in 'Come and see' are so realistic it's almost unreal reminiscent of the first 30 min of Saving private Ryan Thin red line watch the animals Apocalypse Now and the painstaking 'Band of brothers'.  Indeed forget about the rest of 'SPR' Platoon and even Full Metal Jacket.  However I would like to recommend Deer Hunter Cimino 1978 and Hotaru no haka 1988.  But I never suspected there was something massive like this.  1010";

	schema:reviewBody "Come and SeeGrowing up watching war movies from Apocalypse Now to Black Hawk Down I thought I knew what war movies are. Apparently I was wrong. Come and See is not like those films. It does have soldiers explosions and people dying. However Come and See doesn't have John Williams making you feel like storming the beaches of Normandy is somehow best expressed by French horn. What makes Come and See so interesting are 3 basic elements 1. We experience war through the eyes of a teenager 2. It doesn't follow a formulaic approach and 3. It's brutally real.First of all war movies are typically seen in America through the eyes of some brave almost always white man heading off to the glory of the war. Ben Affleck in Pearl Harbor Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan Tom Sizemore in every major American war movie or TV Show since 1989 including the two aforementioned. In Come and See our protagonist Florya is a teenager who eagerly jumps at the chance to fight with the Russians against the Nazi invasion. His youth and innocence at the beginning is just like the audiences. He believes he knows what war looks like but when confronted with the reality of it he along with the audiences slowly loses his mind and his prefabricated ideals. He and we become lost in this seemingly alien world of war that had previously been a clear vision to us. Our joint progression is a testament to Klimov's smart design. What I cannot stand about American war movies is the obviousness of plot. That doesn't mean all American war films are bad but I do believe they follow a very specific pattern. Here it is Someone goes off to war they battle lose a friend gain some friends recover from loss learn some important lesson and come home. Saving Private Ryan's title character Matt Damon Pearl Harbor's Danny Walker Josh Hartnett Jarhead's Anthony Swofford Jake Gyllenhaal all follow this line. In Come and See Florya does go off to war with some ideals he makes and loses some friends but he never comes home. Also he's not doing it in any cookiecutterMichael Bay way. He is literally destroyed of all his innocence family self worth and judgment. He never recovers from his losses he simply pushes them deeper within or ignores them which could be argued is the same thing he never learns lessons from his experiences he becomes angry and disavowed with own thoughts and ethics and he never comes home because he doesn't have a home anymore and he wants to keep fighting I also understand that war and The Army could be his home but I disagree with that. I feel his home is truly destroyed when his innocence is destroyed. Lastly Come and See's realistic approach to filming is remarkable and startling. There are no sweeping shots of the horizon and the soldiers walking through vast fields epic crane moves around the statuesque protags a la every Michael Baytype war film or funky color separation or manipulation. It is really is 2 hours of handheld camera live ammunition and explosions real color and original WWII uniforms. Come and See is an intelligent exploitation of your senses and emotions that are clearly visible in the young actors own minds. When Florya stands next to the nearly leaded cow you see his real fear just like the guy watching the film next to you. Some documentaries are a cleaner look at war than Klimov's film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Come and See is one of the rare films that I can remember being emotionally drained upon its conclusion. The expression on my face as I sat there watching the credits scroll by seemed as worn and broken as that of the protagonist Florya.The film follows Florya as he joins i.e. obtains a gun a partisan group resisting the German advancements in the forests of his native Byelorussia during World War II. What he witnesses at the ripe age of 12 changes a once openeyed smiling face into a weathered traumatized one that has experienced the unimaginable.And of course the unimaginable were the Nazi atrocities committed during the war. Come and See does not focus on what the German Army did to the Jewish population but rather what they did to the native Soviet population. The Nazis were not only concerned with the utter destruction of the Jews but of the Bolshevik Party as well. And to Hitler that meant any man woman or child living under communist rule. And this cleansing fell into the hands of the SS who as depicted in the movie literally destroyed every sign of life.Florya is able to escape death unlike the rest of his family but serves as a witness to the destruction and in this sense dies as his innocence and youth is lost. Klimov does a masterful job and depicting this slow death by concentrating on the facial expressions of Florya versus that of the Germans and both of their transformations over time. Klimov's Hitler montage at the end is especially moving and puts an interesting spin on the whole what if question.This is the most historically accurate war movie I have ever seen and would highly recommend it to any warhistory enthusiast. But I would also recommend it to any film watcher that realizes the goal of the medium which is to evoke emotion in the audience and Come and See does just that.".

I didn't want to break it for any real reason or for any real length of time other than to change the disc more on that later.I had the time so I watched the movie.I could argue that with two small flaws this is one of the greatest antiwar films ever made.This is the SUBJECTIVE story of a boy who joins the partisans during the German invasion of Russian and his decent into hell.This is a tough movie. its in your face and everyone else's literally as we see everyone and everything that our hero does even to the point that if he's talking to someone the camera will hold on them as they speak with no cut aways. We learn everything about people by their faces since we have the time to study them. This is simply one of the few times where even if the film had had a different aspect ratio other than 1.33 tv shape I would rally to have it full screen rather than letterbox simply because for this movie you MUST lose yourself in what you see and hear. Having someone facing you looking at you is more powerful when all you can see is their face. Faces are a landscape in this film.This is especially true of Floyra our hero who's stunned expression at all that happens around him is a constant source of wonderment.As we as shocked and rattled by what we see we know that he is even more rattled because he is there and he is expressing it on his face. Its said he was hypnotized to be able to get the right expressions and seeing the pain on his face I believe it since you could only express what he is by living through it... Wide eyed numbness his mouth sometimes agape we watch as he tries to just get on...The film as I said is subjective and we see and hear literally what Floyra does. When his hearing is thrown askew by shelling what we hear becomes less distinct. Sound will drift in and out and we get a sense of being there. The camera also holds on some scenes at times Not cutting away for better angles simply because Floyra doesn't have them.This film will rock your world and then some.I want to tell you everything about the film but at the same time fear that doing so will set up expectations as to what happens. Reading the material on the film and seeing the trailer set up some expectations in my mind some of which was right and some was wrong. I would like to have you see the film knowing as little about what actually happens as possible so you experience the film straight. I lost my expectations the minute the film began and I was wondering what was going on... I was hooked as the long strange trip took over. I'm certain that once the film stats you will be free of expectations too but at the same time I think if I told you too much it would ruin the what happens next.This is GREAT film making.That said there are two small flaws.First as some reviews have said the Germans when they finally show up on screen are just a tad cartoony. menacing but slightly cartoonish...I could be wrong... but regardless through it all Floyra's pained expression cuts the cartoon away and reminds us this is bad stuff going down.The second flaw is a montage of actual footage used near the very end. I know why it was done or can guess but its too long. It breaks the spell in some ways... I think it would have been more apt had the film had the original desired title of Kill Hitler.The last point I want to make is the fact the film is on two DVDs. Released two years ago there is no logical reason for the film to be broken into two parts the tape is a single cassette release except that like many films from the Russian Film Council its loaded with subtitles 13 languages and three audio options. There is also other extras like an introduction by the film maker that runs 20 minutes documentary footage and an interview with the lead actor. But I digress....I'm certain that the film doesn't really need to be in two parts for any reason other than a technical one... except that in a strange way the break sort of works for the film if you watch it straight through taking only a break to switch discs. Call me crazy but the break is perfectly placed at the mid point to the story. Not only that the film changes from first half to second half. The tone  even though continuous in action is different as the second disc begins. Its almost as if we are back at the beginning of the film at a peak that slowly slides downward. Time wise the two halves are different with the action taking place over a couple of jumbled days while the second is one continuous series of events over two days.In the end all that matters is the film.And here the film is absolutely great.See it and be moved. random thoughts In its way its comparable to grave of fireflies The film that many people compare it to Destiny of a Man is a relation but not direct ancestor of it simply because the films are very different Destiny taking place over years in Flashback Come and See is happening here and now over weeks.

	schema:reviewBody "This is just about as powerful as a war film can get.The year is 1943. A teenage Belorussian boy by the name of Florya finds a rifle and then joins the resistance to fight the Germans. On the way he sees all the horrors of war and thats what this film is really about.This is one of the most powerful war films I've seen and I have seen a lot. The events aren't dramatized too much and the film manages to keep a good sense of realism. At the same time however it achieves an excellent surrealistic atmosphere by contrasting this young boy to the horrors of war that surround him. The soundtrack helps a lot in this area by not really providing music in the traditional sense but rather these very tense and powerful slightly ambient noises. Reminded me a lot of the sound that an orchestra makes when they're getting ready right before the start of a concert. Now the film was made during Soviet times so it does show the Germans in a bad light and as very cruel but to a large extent thats how things were. Aleksei Kravchenko the actor portraying Florya pulls the job off well despite his young age. He doesn't have much dialog to say and this really is more of a visual film.To add to the artistic qualities of this film there is also an excellent technical side. In addition to the soundtrack which I mentioned before this film has some of the best cinematography I've seen in a long time. Director Elem Klimov makes excellent use of the steadycam with which he follows his characters as they go from one place to another and without cutting away. There are two excellent examples of this First is when Florya comes back to his village and the camera follows him as he comes down a hill goes into his yard and then into his house. The second is the last shot in the film which follows a collumn of soldiers then takes a brief detour which is more of a shortcut actually into a forest and then rejoins that group of soldiers some time later. Simply awesome. The battle scenes are very intense especially one of a group of German soldiers taking out a village. What I really liked was that everything seemed genuine. During one scene where a bomber bombed a forest you could really see the dirt being kicked up and trees falling down.An absolute must see film.".

The second is the last shot in the film which follows a collumn of soldiers then takes a brief detour which is more of a shortcut actually into a forest and then rejoins that group of soldiers some time later. Simply awesome. The battle scenes are very intense especially one of a group of German soldiers taking out a village. What I really liked was that everything seemed genuine. During one scene where a bomber bombed a forest you could really see the dirt being kicked up and trees falling down.An absolute must see film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Elem Klimov directs Come and See. While the film predominantly follows the ritesofpassage journey of a young boy it is remarkable how often and effortlessly Klimov shifts visual perspective offering us the objective and subjective states of a wide range of characters and objects. For example in one of the films most surreal scenes several characters are shown guiding a cow across what seems to be open and unguarded terrain. Suddenly a series of intense firefights break out. Several characters are killed but it is the fate of the cow with which the film is most preoccupied.The images of the cow standing untouched by the raging skirmish then struck by a barrage of bullets and finally of its eyes rapidly shifting and dilating before death are indicative of Come and See's ability to produce indelible images from what are often quite standard war film situations. Like Malick Klimov is as much interested in the landscape and the objects and people that inhabit it as he is in representing the minutiae and widening horror of his protagonist's journey from home to the multiple sites of slaughter and genocide that mar his countryside.The journey of a wideeyed innocent across apocalyptic terrain is common territory for the war film Ichikawa's The Burmese Harp Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood The Human Condition etc but Klimov is going for a much more macabre tone bludgeoning us with the sheer intensity and sick morbidity of his images.Unlike say Schindler's List Come and See is also remarkable for its use of abstract colour and sound. This is not a realist film its shocks and effects are more dreamlike from the mutedness of its burnished cinematography to the extraordinary closeups of several of its characters' impossibly aged faces to the hyper expressive performances of many of its actors to the impressionistic and at times almost expressionistic use of sound. In this context the title of the film is not just a call for audiences to bear witness to see that which is not imaginable that which has little visual record and to get a sense of the physical conditions the come of the title experienced by those during the war but a description or pointer towards the more spectatorial expectations of the film. Of course the order come and see also functions as an exploitative challenge Come and see if you dare! Indeed many Chinese warpornpropaganda films feature eerily similar titles.The film is essentially an epic journey and many of its images possess an almost Dantesque quality. It can also be seen as a coming of age film a remarkable coming or progression or is it regression? that is etched upon the utterly transformed face of its central character. Unsurprisingly Spielberg screened Come and See several times for cast and crew prior to shooting his Holocaust film. See would prove a huge influence on Spielberg's Empire of the Sun Schindler's List Wr Horse and Private Ryan in its mixture of childlike innocence lots of dollying in to the shocked children's faces and brutality. This is the worst aspect of Klimov's legacy his film opening the doorway for an onslaught of other shockporn movies  all the way to Gibson's The Passion of the Christ  all of which pretend to be history lessons and important humane testimonies when in reality they simply use progressions in technology to escalate violence levels push tolerance levels and are built around a primary need to jolt apathetic desensitised audiences. Hilariously as warporn gets more hardcore in real life the numbers of genocides wars and atrocities demonstrably increase whilst media coverage decreases and public apathy increases. This is the mistake of all war films people don't repeat because they forget the implication being that we must therefore shock ourselves into awareness we forget because we repeat see The Shining. The human animal needs denial more than food.So while Come and See and its Spielberg imitators lack any real historical depth complexity nuance understanding of human beings and trade in simple exploitation they also possess a kind of psychological naivety perhaps best exemplified by Klimov's final scene in which a kid essentially refuses to shoot a young Hitler. WW2's engine had little to do with Hitler but here he's reduced to the genesis of evil the seed from which WW2 blossoms.Though commissioned by the Soviet Union as a propaganda piece Come and See was made shortly prior to the fall of the Iron Curtain a period in which artists had a certain amount of freedom. Klimov's films is thus at times self consciously a meditation on Stalinist war films. In this regard the film literally begins upon the beach where Tarkovsky's Ivan ends from where it attempts to create a new war narrative shunting aside Stalinist glorification for a kind of psychological shell shock. The result though is basically a Soviet version of Men Behind the Sun the infamous Chinese propaganda film in which we're called to bear witness to the activities of sadistic Japanese soldiers. In Klimov's case  the film focuses on the Nazi atrocities in Byelorussia  we leer at sadistic vile rapacious murderous and cowardly Nazis while Communist partisans are portrayed as playful comradely and righteous people. If a countries leadership willingly sided with the Germans from 193941 invaded countries Poland Lithuania Latvia Finland etc carried out numerous atrocities against other nations and their own people and supported the Gulag system then the viewer needs to be extremely careful when they view material that has been officially sanctioned by that leadership.810  Worth one viewing.".

	schema:headline " Harrowingly realistic the true horrors of war";
	schema:reviewBody "Russian director Elem Klimov's final film 'Idi i smotri Come and See' is a masterpiece of the genre a war film so disturbingly intense that it strays into the realms of psychological horror. Set in 1943 during the Nazi occupation of Belarus the film follows the fate of a young boy Florya Gaishun Aleksei Kravchenko who joins the Soviet partisan army. As the horrors of war unfold before him Florya loses his idealistic preconceptions of combat becoming confused and psychologically unstable. The entire film is witnessed through his young eyes as his civilised world is thrown into turmoil and those that he loves perish at the hands of a merciless enemy.Much like Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' the film is almost surrealistic in its exploration of the horrors of war constructing a hallucinatory nightmare of escalating confusion fear death and madness. And yet despite this the film manages to come across as being frighteningly realistic. Perhaps this surrealistic approach is also paradoxically the most realistic depiction of war. Young Florya is cast into a hellish world he simply can't comprehend placed in the same position I imagine the experience would strike us as being one long distressing and horrible dream. Florya seemingly even treats it all as such. With the ghastly events happening all about him he can do nothing but stare with petrified shock and awe as one who expects to wake up at any moment.'Come and See' boasts a string of remarkable sequences which will resonate with viewers for a long time after they see it. A series of bomb strikes tear apart a Russian forest silently obliterating the mature trees as a shellshocked Florya hears only the maddening ringing in his ears Florya attempts to clamber through a thick murky bog feeling with each step as though he is getting nowhere he awakens in the midst of a thick mist his head resting on the carcass of a dead cow. Perhaps the most lasting scene is one in which an entire population of villagers is herded into a barn and then consequently set alight. Words fail to describe the horror of watching the flaming barn doors still flapping wildly as the inhabitants fight with their last breaths to save themselves and their families. Meanwhile Florya just stares his blank disbelieving expression infinitely more effective than any other actions would have been.Inexperienced teenager Aleksei Kravchenko is excellent in the lead role which the director subsequently described as a very difficult role with extreme emotional states. So arduous were the emotional burdens of the film that Klimov later expressed surprise and relief that young Kravchenko did not suffer any adverse psychological trauma during and after filming which notably employed the use of live ammunition to maximise authenticity. His character is placed in situations that are to us simply impossible to fathom and Florya reacts to these changes in his life with a sort of awed silence sometimes anger. Young actress Olga Mironova apparently in her only film role plays a pivotal role as Glasha whom Florya befriends in the early part of the film.The film ends with a simple but very disturbing montage of archive footage. As Florya attempts to symbolically destroy Adolf Hitler by firing bullets at his portrait the blackandwhite World War II footage rapidly rewinds we see corpses at a concentration camp a 1930s Nazi party rally Hitler's services during World War I. As Florya fires more and more bullets the images continue to reverse themselves as though eradicating the history from existence. Finally we arrive at a photograph of Adolf Hitler sitting on his mother's lap as a young baby. Unlike the Nazi savages who felt no remorse in torching entire villages to the ground Florya cannot bring himself to symbolically murder this innocent child even with the knowledge of the horrors he would later orchestrate. Is this morality the reason why wars are an inevitable consequence of human existence?Though the final reel does undoubtedly stray towards propaganda the Russian citizens are clearly shown to possess superior morals to those of the evil fiendish Germans the entire film is executed so disturbingly perfectly that you are too engrossed in the spectacle to really notice at all. There is no clear resolution to the story. Of course the valiant Soviets successfully triumph over the company of Nazis but they then strike off for another confrontation. The War will go on forever and Florya will never be given a reprieve from all the horrors he has witnessed. The original working title of the film had been Kill Hitler not specifically referring to the infamous dictator but with a more general meaning. As Klimov explains in the DVD preface to his film he meant the title to suggest that we should kill the Hitler within ourselves because we all have our demons in this or that measure. However after the title was deemed inappropriate another was chosen from chapter 6 the Book of Revelations ...and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder Come and see!'Come and See' was the final film that Klimov ever directed. Having experienced World War II with his own eyes as a child he felt that it was a film that he needed to make and after doing so he was no longer compelled to continue directing. The director comments once again on the DVD preface I don't regret that I made that film. It had a difficult prehistory and history. But one has to make it a difference once in a while to commit something worthy. Herein lies the sense of creative work when you can offer to people something real serious real meaningful Simply put this is the masterpiece that he was born to make and a single viewing will ultimately change the way that you view war.".

But what is shown is enough and the movie is beautifully done. The director did not make any more movies because he said everything he wanted to say.This is war movie like no other. If you want to understand what happened this is a must see. There are so many movies about Holocaust but the level of suffering on the Eastern front is unfortunately for political reasons severely underplayed in the West. 20 million Russian and Soviet civilians died from the Nazi hand. The decency with which this movie tells the truth about the war is really worthy of greatest respect. There is not a second that is fake in this movie it is pure distilled soul of the Soviet people and their struggle against Hitler. If you want substance look no further. There has been no other movie like this.".

I do know some of what was going on during WWII as I'm not a completely illiterate moron... but I won't even begin to try to come off as erudite as some reviewers who obviously know FAR more about worldhistory than I do. Instead  I will approach this review strictly from the viewpoint of a filmfan. That said  COME AND SEE is definitely one of the most harrowing films that I've ever come across. Being mainly an underground horror fan  I've made it my life's work to seek out the most sickening disturbing twisted nihilistic films that could possibly be laid to film  and honestly  the few films that have actually touched a nerve with me typically are not by definition horror films at all  but then again  if these types of films can't be considered in the realm of horror  then what truly can??? COME AND SEE revolves around Flor  a young boy living in Beylorussia during WWII. We learn early on that Flor is eager to fight the good fight of his countrymen against the pending onslaught of German invading soldiers but unfortunately for Flor  he is unexpectedly thrust into situations that he could not have possibly been ready for  as I'm sure is the case in reality for anyone who experiences war firsthand. To avoid spoiling any of the truly memorable scenes  I will just say that the rest of the film is spent following Flor as he singlehandedly escapes his own death numerous times until the conclusion where he meets back up with his comrades...I don't even know where to begin with all the good points about COME AND SEE. The acting is INCREDIBLE by everyone involved  moreso than I would have ever thought possible from such young actors particularly portraying such complicated and devastating roles and situations. The cinematography is incredibly bleak and perfectly captures the hopeless and helpless environs of wartorn Russia at least I guess they do  as I wasn't there...  there is not one second in the film where you question the authenticity of the surroundings. There is really no gore to speak of  but the more horrifying scenes are captured so perfectly that no amount of bloodnguts could have really made the film better and this coming from a certifiable goresleazehead. If I had to pick ANY negative issues with the film  I would say that there are scenes in the beginning that are SO haunting that towards the middle the film loses a bit of momentum causing even some of the stronger endscenes to not have as much power. I also feel that the very last sequence shooting the Hitler picture mixed with actual Holocaust footage was a bit of propagandaoverkill that was unnecessary as I felt that I had already CLEARLY gotten the message. Those two aspects alone drop COME AND SEE a half point in my book. But regardless  this is an ABSOLUTELY incredible film that I can't recommend enough  just understand that you will most likely come away from it emotionally drained  which to me is one of the highest achievements that cinema can provide...9.510".

This movie is not an exception in overall point of view. It has quite a same morale.But few things make it still unique and are the reason to rate it a bit higher than just average.At first reality. Not historically but people in the movie are much more real than in Hollywood movie. It seems that only Russian actors can let the public see the soul of Russian people and soldiers. I'm not Russian myself but I've met a lot of them and this is just the unique thing they call Russkaja dusha Russian soul. Russians have very hot temper they can blaze up in a second and start the fight but they never let it damage their friendship.Second dose of realism people in war. I mean especially Dygalo was a very realistic character. When I was serving my time in Estonian army I met an officer who was also veteran of Afganistan war. And believe me he was quite a copy of Dygalo. It is hard to understand how real war experience could leave such a trace in human mind but now when I saw Praporshik Dygalo in that movie I noticed a huge similarity between Dygalo and that officer and I instantly understood that this is the real thing this is exactly how war affected those soldiers. And the fact this film has managed to take it to public so real gives it a great bonus.And last but not least Russian language in a movie that also really sounds as Russian language. I'm always laughing about the episodes in Hollywood movies that should include Russian army or characters and I have to say that Russian language in Hollywood movies is more than ridiculous therefore I'm quite happy that this film was made in Russian. By the way Russian is considered to have the most developed vocabulary in swearing and as this is war movie and those guys are pretty rough as well it sounds much better and more real in Russian. Translation usually manages to lost at least half of the meaning.In conclusion yes I would recommend this movie to everybody. Although it shares the same morale than other war movies it's still somehow unique and especially Americans could take a look and compare it to Hollywood stuff.".

An epic in every sense of the word 9th Company boasts a rousing soundtrack broad camera shots unbelievably beautiful landscapes empathetic characters and vividly brutal action sequences.Based on actual events that culminated on 7th January 1988 on the Djardan 3234 Heights of Afghanistan 9th Company follows the illfated fortunes of a small group of young Soviet soldiers from the trials of boot camp to their arrival in the heart of the war zone and the climactic bloody battle that made them heroes.The 9th Company is first and foremost a war film. Not a antiwar film and certainly not militarist  but a genuine war film. It is not about the glories of Russian weapons rather the glories of those who fight with them down to the last round of ammunition. Apart from the odd radio murmur from Mikhail Gorbachev the film has cast all politics aside.Visually great care was taken to immerse the viewer into the world of the 9th Company. The Afghan scenes are painted in a sepia redbrown hue while the training camp portions of the film appear colder with more pronounced hints of green and blue. Fyodor Bondarchuk has a fondness for using slow motion for emphasis and in this instance it is particularly effective. The props military equipment costumes specially constructed Afghan village the characters their speech the sound and finally the dust  all appear authentic. Bondarchuk makes good use of a 9m budget lavish by Russian standards and the film features some impressive hardware including 30 T64B tanks 10 Mi24 Hind attack helicopters 10 Mi8 multirole transport helicopters 22 AN and MIG fighters 1500 Ukrainian army troops and 42 threeton loads of stone and rubble for pyrotechnic effects to name a few.The 9th Company showcases some explosive action sequences. Violence and vodka are served up in equal measures and it makes for a highly intoxicating cinematic cocktail that's guaranteed to push your excitement levels over the limit by the time the climactic final firefight arrives. Drawing obvious parallels to numerous conflicts occurring around the globe today 9th Company is a tense powerful and tragically topical war film that demands to be seen. It's a timely reminder that war is hell wherever you are from and whatever language you speak.For those interested in purchasing a DVD copy of the film I suggest visiting either httpwww.alldvd.ca or httpwww.dvdigitall.com. I've had the pleasure of dealing with both sellers and have found them to be the most trusted dealer of imported European films on the Net. They have great customer support and are extremely knowledgeable when it comes to hard to find DVD's. Even more important is the fact that they only deal in legitimate nonbootleg releases. Both sellers and film come highly recommended.".

The previous movies about Soviet war in Afghanistan never managed to be so successful and therefore they didn't reached the masses. Bandarchuk's movie helps the youth as well as other people in the post Soviet republics to understand what the veterans of the Afghanistan war have gone through. It is actually pity that I living in Latvia now more about what Americans have gone through in Vietnam then my neighbor in the upstairs apartment in Afghanistan. I believe that such thoughts could share with me many who live in the post Soviet area.The actors were well picked and they plaid well. The sound effects were cool and the music was fine. But still the movie was not perfect. There were some little things that didn't fit together. For example the plain that got shot  with four engines on smoke and flaying at such a low altitude it would never be able to get back to the runway besides if it even had it would never crash in to gasoline cans since on a battle airfield there are no open air storage for fuel. If they had then those Afghans would simply shoot at those cans instead of the plane. The last fight episode was not clear either. If Dzhakonda was sitting on the edge of a mountain then how those Afghans could get to him without waking up anyone else? So the overall impression is that the movie was very good but not perfect.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. I won't laugh at ridiculously low grade it has got because there are more important things to be said or underlined. First of all it is stupid to compare such film with Platoon which is a common pattern of the comments on this site. Even though Platoon is a good war movie it is still an obvious Hollywood product which is not the case with 9th Company. Platoon brought some important issues for the time it was made except very good filming but it still serves American perception of the world  divided to good and bad guys one group of the soldiers are following bad lieutenant played by Tom Beringer the others are followers of deceased model of human killer played by William Dafoe. There are no such illusions in this film. Like no other Hollywood film this one shows that good in the war is something we who live in piece can't comprehend. 9ya Rota shows that every person has good and bad in themselves which is much closer to true but the form of good in the war is not what we would expect. What is so well done are thorough and catchy analysis of social and psychological features of the soldiers from the time they entered the barracks as civilians to the time of their final battles as soldiers. We can easily follow their transformation through these times and the way they change. That is done childishly simply and beautifully as in no film before that. 9ya Rota keeps you nailed to the screen for whole 139 minutes. And it stays for good. Brilliant acting of fantastic crew and no amateurs even among the minor roles brings you very close to the drama. And drama is stunning and emotional. And whatta directing!!!? Regarding the site criteria this film deserves at least 10 out of 10 if you ask me.".

It has a lot of Holliwoodish scenes which make me feel embarrassed because it also have a lot of beautiful deep and touching scenes scenes that reflect something Russian something deep thought. But then the good scenes turn again into Spielberg type Saving private Ryan patriotism blabbering and I get embarrassed again. But overall this movie has good directing good visual effects. It is clearly a bigbudget movie with beautiful shots music professional special effects. I see how Bondarchuk tried to show honestly the real army days with the hierarchy of soldiers the drill sergeants beating rookies the brutality of the system. I really felt touched by the play of some actors. I felt sorry for Vorobei a young intelligent boy who has to die and he dies fast and painful like in real life and you can't help feeling deep sorry about it. But then I get embarrassed again seeing the Rambo style scenes with guy shouting No and charging forwards into attack with the machine gun in hands. I can't help feeling embarrassed seeing the mujaheddin attacking Russians walking in line full height totally defying all common sense and the way the soldiers would dash in the real war. I understand what Bondarchuk tried to deliver I feel impressed by the beautiful shots of Afghanistan helicopters it has quality in it. The fight in a village was quite well shot but then again we see the holliwoodish style last battle which doesn't make any sense. The same with the actors play. Some actors make you believe in them feel their pain and joy while others play just bad. So overall comparing to Hollywood it is better. Americans would never make a movie like that. But it is still very commercial and you can see that it's made to be sold. You can see that the director adopts Hollywood's methods of spectator manipulation. And I can't help feeling that it could've been much better that he could've done much more and different way as there is such a rich history of Soviet and Russian cinema with its own unique style.So my verdict is yeah good attempt but just an attempt.".

In fact the whole movie has nothing to do with the VDV or Airborne Assault Troops Paratroopers. Sure Praporschik Dygala says they are in the VDV but there is nothing special about them. Also the VDV does not have any T80 tanks since tanks are too heavy to drop off from an airplane. VDV uses BMD'snot BMP's like in the movie light armored vehicles capable of being dropped anywhere by parachute.They never train on an airplane they never even see a helicopter before Afghanistan. They are treated like a Penal Battalion.The whole trip to Afghanistan made these soldiers look like cattle sleeping on the floor. There are supposed to be seats on this kind of flight.Finally the airplane crash was not possible. A Stinger would not hit the side of the plane it would hit an engine because it tracks heat jets. An engine is the hottest object on an airplane. Even with one engine destroyed the plane should have landed safely.Before I forget to add if you stand next to a barrage of 122mm rockets you can lose your head very easily. One would never stand so close to that kind of artillery strike.The music and special effects were good.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was looking forward to seeing 9TH COMPANY  a film that broke all records at the Russian box office and that caused veterans of the red army to leave the cinema in tears . With hindsight this sounds like the same reactions from 20 years earlier when veterans from the Vietnam war left American cinemas after watching PLATOON  FULL METAL JACKET and HAMBURGER HILL . The problem with his Russian equivalent is that it's perhaps too equivalent to the aforementoned films Students of narratology and structuralism will instantly recognise the connections . We see the recruits turning up at basic training camp getting their heads shaved  we see a scene where the trained but green troops are given the low down on as to what motivates the enemy and the new troops see death as soon as they arrive at the airport . Couldn't screenwriter Yuriy Korotkov and director Fyodor Bondarchuk disguised these influences a little bit more ?This is a failing . I was expecting a much darker film with an identity of its own . I remember seeing an HBO production called CITIZEN X which dealt with a serial killer during the Soviet communist era . CITIZEN X didn't really concern itself with being a serial killer murder mystery but had a subtext of how a dictatorship fails its people . I'm sorry to say this but if you took the characters from this red army unit changed their names and transplanted them to the jungles of South East Asia in the 1960s you'd be watching a very straight forward and generic war film that you've seen before I can't claim to have seen battle but there's a couple of times when the mis en scene didn't ring true . Considering the Soviets had been in Afghanistan for 9 years and are led by battle hardened NCOs the company make fundamental operational mistakes like walking along a valley bunched up together . Also the climatic battle scenes seem to suffer badly from editing . The mujahedeen swarm over the lines Soviet line then it cuts to a dwindling band of survivors with all the Afghans no longer there . What happened to them ? In effect 9TH COMPANY is by no means a bad film . It does have good production values and some bloody violence but it's not a film that will have you learning much about the success and failures of the ill fated Soviet military expedition to Afghanistan in the 1980s and I'm afraid I wa expecting more . One can't help thinking that in a few years we will see a breath taking movie set against soldiers battling Islamic fanatics in Afghanistan but will be an American film featuring NATO troops".

The plane takes off and is then hit by an Afghan rebel SAM missile therefore forcing the plane to land again. Just as you think the plane has landed safely a tyre bursts and it skids and crashes into a fuel dump thus incinerating everyone inside it.All this happens in front of the newly arrived recruits and sets the tone for the remaining action scenes in the film. I would not say this it is antiwar film but more like a film that show the horrors of war which is not a bad thing.".

They are sent to a boot camp in Fergana Uzbekistan where they are submitted to the brutality and abuses of the disturbed Sergeant Dygalo Mikhail Porechenkov during the training period increasing their camaraderie. Then they are airborne to Bagram Base in Afghanistan join the 9th Company and move to the Khowst Province 3234 m height to defend the mountain and protect the convoys with supplies. When the soviets retreat from Afghanistan they are forgotten and slaughtered in the mountains.The screenplay of 9 Rota follows the structure of Full Metal Jacket focusing a group of rookie recruits trained by a sadistic sergeant in a training camp in the first half and their battles in Afghanistan in the second half along 1988 and 1989 when the war ended with the withdraw of the Soviet forces from the Afghanistan. The plot alternates between tense and violent scenes but also relieves with sequences of comradeship sex with Snow White and jokes during the training period. Further than that it is a great antiwar feature based on a true event and the plot shows how pointless and senseless the war is supported by magnificent cinematography and battle scenes. The lead characters are very well developed creating a great empathy between the viewer and them. My vote is eight.Title Brazil 9o Peloto 9th Platoon".

His mentor still believes in him and urges him to go to Italy to take an exorcism course hoping that he it would strengthen his faith in Christianity. In Italy he attends a session from Father Xavier who soon becomes aware of his skepticism. As a result he sends him to an eminent Jesuit exorcist Father Lucas whose ways though questionable are quite effective.

Honestly the only reason i watched it was because of Anthony Hopkins and i am glad i did. This movie has everything that fans want in an exorcism movie. Some people may find it a bit slow paced but the movie does not steer off course every minute is relevant to the storyline. Even in his 70's Mr Hopkins did just what was expected from him. He gave a powerful performance which scared the living hell out of me and played his most convincing role since Hannibal Lector but surprisingly so did someone else someone who i had never heard of. Yes i am talking about Colin O'Donoghue who managed to stay in the light and make a great connection with his costars. Every character in the movie was fully utilized specially that of Alice Braga.I find that many people fail to see the spark in this film and the only reason i can think of is that people these days are too fond of gore which this movie lacks. Surely The Rite is not for the Doubters but for the people who believe and have interest in this subject.After decades of miserable exorcism movies finally we got us a winner. Can i dare say that this movie is better than The Exorcist? No i cant but this is definitely the Second Best .. Now i can confidently say that you were wrong big sister.With solid performances amazing cinematography and mind blowing sound effects i give it a 910.".

I don't think anyone is as good as him in this matter.the way that he is so relaxed while playing Father Lucas is fantastic  you actually get the idea that he is a priest !! The Directing not as good as acting. Felt a bit slow in the middle. and some stuff just didn't make sense to me.But the sound editing and the visual effect was really good for a lowbudget film. Beside the character of Anthony Hopkins Father Lucas the rest of them don't seem to have a depth and meaning to it. The reporter's character is just so plain that you sort of forget about her in the middle !! I had very low expectations when i was going to see it but after it changed my mind. And the fact that it is based of True events makes it more interesting and realistic. So don't expect and entertaining and FullAction film you should expect a film that gets you thinking because thats what it did to me. OverAll 7.510".

	schema:headline " Survival of Exorcism subgenre with the phenomenon acting by a giant actor";
	schema:reviewBody "The Rite looked like it would be a mixed bag right from the start. The film seemed to suffer the same fate many other films before it fell victim to and that's giving away too much of the storyline in the trailers. On top of that it was a film that revolved around exorcism which is a subject that usually leads to disappointing results. Expectations would lead one to believe that The Rite would have enough momentum to reel you in only to drop the ball during its finale similar to last year's The Last Exorcism except hopefully without the appearance of a neon red glow in the dark fetus. Luckily the film has a few surprises up its sleeve.The cinematography in the film is probably the first thing you'll notice visually. The opening of the film makes things like dripping embalming fluid a swing set on a playground and an overturned shopping cart seem more interesting than they really are. Rain is an element used fairly often in the film to usually signify when something has gone wrong or is about to. Whether the camera is placed up high to make it seem like you're looking down on the cast from the heavens or down low as if you're looking up at them from the depths of the earth the rain sequences in the film are definitely some of the most memorable due to the camera work.This is probably a pretty obvious statement but the film is worth seeing for Anthony Hopkins alone. It's not that Colin O'Donoghue does poorly since he certainly has a strong screen presence and does a fantastic job carrying the film but Hopkins just manages to trump that while stealing every scene he's in and rightfully so. Father Lucas Trevant is the strongest and creepiest role Hopkins has played since Hannibal Lecter and his best role overall in years. It's just amazing seeing a man in his seventies give a performance that's this physical and this absorbing. Speaking of distinguished actors it was nice seeing Rutger Hauer as well even if it was just for a small role.The dream sequences and hallucinations in the film may have been my hands down favorite. I've always been a fan of the surreal the imaginative the creative and the things that don't seem to make sense at first but gain meaning as the film or story progresses. I never thought I'd find myself intrigued with the actions of a mule or that frogs could have an even deeper meaning than what you're probably expecting but The Rite accomplishes this very well.Thankfully The Rite delivers an exorcism film that is actually worth seeing. It'll probably be forgotten about in a year filled with so many blockbuster film releases but considering that January and February are usually filled with such monstrous duds at the box office The Rite manages to surpass expectations. While the film does seem rather reminiscent of The Last Exorcism and borrows the atmosphere from the Heath Ledger film The Order The Rite is actually a better experience overall. With an engrossing performance by Anthony Hopkins along with a fairly strong cast all around its fantastic cinematography surreal dream sequences and a satisfying conclusion that doesn't hint at a sequel The Rite is actually a surprisingly decent film all around.

Speaking of distinguished actors it was nice seeing Rutger Hauer as well even if it was just for a small role.The dream sequences and hallucinations in the film may have been my hands down favorite. I've always been a fan of the surreal the imaginative the creative and the things that don't seem to make sense at first but gain meaning as the film or story progresses. I never thought I'd find myself intrigued with the actions of a mule or that frogs could have an even deeper meaning than what you're probably expecting but The Rite accomplishes this very well.Thankfully The Rite delivers an exorcism film that is actually worth seeing. It'll probably be forgotten about in a year filled with so many blockbuster film releases but considering that January and February are usually filled with such monstrous duds at the box office The Rite manages to surpass expectations. While the film does seem rather reminiscent of The Last Exorcism and borrows the atmosphere from the Heath Ledger film The Order The Rite is actually a better experience overall. With an engrossing performance by Anthony Hopkins along with a fairly strong cast all around its fantastic cinematography surreal dream sequences and a satisfying conclusion that doesn't hint at a sequel The Rite is actually a surprisingly decent film all around.

	schema:reviewBody "Review of The Rite DVD Rated PG13 114 minutes By Leticia Velasquez Catholic Media ReviewMichael Kovak Colin O'Donoghue has always been a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. Isaiah 533 The only son of a Chicago funeral director Itsvan Kovak Rutger Haer Michael lived literally down the hall from death his entire life. Unlike most young men who never experience death close hand Michael is steeped in it preparing bodies for burial with his father. As a young boy Michael is coaxed by his father into helping prepare the corpse of his mother by gently blowing on the red fingernail polish his father applies as he lovingly prepared her body while whispering endearments into her ear. The image is forever seared into his memory tainting his adulthood with a lack of faith and a sense of detachment. When time came to make a decision about his profession in life Michael knew well that his options were limited as he told a friend in my family you either become an undertaker or a priest. Michael chose the priesthood not out of sense of mission but as a way out of his bleak existence and a means to pay for college. After he is ordained as a deacon Michael's guilt over deceiving his superior about his intentions impels him to write Fr Matthew Toby Jones about his decision to leave the seminary. He admits he has no faith and feels he has no vocation to the priesthood. But fate intervenes before Fr Matthew can act. The two men are involved in a car accident where a young woman is fatally wounded and Fr Matthew looks on stunned silence as Michael blesses the victim reluctantly yet tenderly as she dies. He is impressed by this and convinces Michael to delay leaving the seminary until after he has taken a two month course in Rome. A course in exorcism you're an undertaker so you're not squeamish he adds with a gleam in his eye.Not at all squeamish Michael plays the role of devil's advocate in his exorcism class in Rome challenging his instructor over whether the possessed are suffering from psychosis and is nonplussed over a sudden power outage when the demon Baal is mentioned. In order to help Michael overcome his doubts about the existence of Satan his professor Fr Xavier Ciaran Hinds sends him to observe veteran exorcist Fr Lucas Trevant Anthony Hopkins. Michael is joined in his doubts by Italian journalist Angeline Alice Braga who wants him to share his experiences at Fr Lucas side for the purposes of an article. These two young cynics are about to engage in a life and death struggle which will evoke deep seated fears and upend their world viewAn eccentric Welshman Fr Lucas lives a lonely existence in an obscure corner of Rome occupying an ancient villa whose courtyard is overrun by cats. Fr Lucas takes Michael's cynicism in stride and advises Michael not to engage in conversation with the demon who possesses the pregnant teen who has come with her sister for her regular exorcism session. Michael is so captivated by her predicament that he finds himself drawn into a life and death struggle with the devil whose very existence he denies.Although the movie trailer plays like a hightech adaptation of The Exorcist to which exorcism films will inevitably be compared there is more spiritual and emotional depth to director Mikael Hafstrom's work than Blatty's. The Rite more closely resembles the cinematic subtlety and theological accuracy of The Exorcism of Emily Rose according to Fr. Gary Thomas the priest from the book on which the film is based. Michael is a sympathetic character and the film's dramatic exposition of the tragic origins of his faith crisis help the audience sympathize with him as he confronts demons both within and without his tortured soul. Even eccentric Father Lucas played compellingly by Hopkins is more vivid than the ghostly older priest in The Exorcist yet the pairing of priests to defeat Satan is a familiar theme. Fr Lucas even makes a sarcastic reference to The Exorcist telling Michael You'll see no spinning heads and pea soup here! What will enliven Catholic viewers is the authenticity of the phenomena of the exorcisms and the splendor of the priesthood when contrasted against the darkness of pure evil. Special effects enhance but do not overpower this compelling thriller and magnificent architecture of Rome augments the timelessness of the story. For the many fans of the book by AP journalist Matt Baglio on which the film is loosely based screenwriter Michael Petroni has respected the basic story while raising the emotional stakes to great dramatic effect when combined with excellent cinematography and the masterful presence of Anthony Hopkins. Priests who watched the film in the theater with me had a positive reaction but pointed the following theological errors as a deacon Michael could not give absolution as he appears to do in the case of the dying woman and that an inexperienced priest with emotional wounds and of questionable faith would never be chosen to become an exorcist. Too many weaknesses for Satan to exploit they explained. The manifestations of possession vomiting nails and frogs unearthly voices superhuman strength and knowledge of inner weaknesses are absolutely accurate according to Fr Gary Thomas the real priest from Baglio's book who had a less dramatic change of heart about the existence of Satan. When I asked him in an interview whether he believed that the devil was a being he responded I believed when I met him. For older teens and up for frightening and macabre scenes appropriate but vivid sexual innuendo verbal references to incest and rape and foul language. This film is best seen with parental supervision.".

Even nowadays when everything else has failed and the science can't provide a solution people in some parts of the world still believe in that and seek help to practices of mysticism like exorcisms.In this movie exorcism is presented in conjunction with lost faith. It is inevitable that the nonbeliever has to see with his own eyes for his faith to be restored.The atmosphere of the movie is eerie from the start. Even before the demons...present themselves! The reluctant hero and the universe that conspires so he can find his way to God is presented in a solid way.The cast is good. Anthony Hopkins is as excellent as ever. The music helps to establish the theme of the movie and Rome and the Vatican look majestic as ever maybe the best set to place such a movie.There are some grisly images but you want be scared because of them.

There were seven orders or steps in becoming a priest. In that order from minor to major porter lector exorcist acolyte subdeacon deacon and priest. This set of orders supposedly was instituted a millennium ago or more. In more recent times the exorcist order is virtually ceremonial. The actual current exorcists are specially appointed priests. But it makes you wonder back in the Early Ages the next step after reading the Bible at church services being a lector was to cast out demons being an exorcist. Was there a special need way back then? Such that the faithful could not wait for an ordained priest to intervene? We've also seen Protestant exorcism recently in The Last Exorcism. I have no reason to believe that casting out demons is limited in any way to Roman Catholics. I think the next film begging to be made is a Jewish exorcism. Perhaps there is a Muslim equivalent as well.I am not saying that you have to go out and see The Rite rite now in the cinema. I don't regret seeing it there.

However his intention of scaring us prevailed over any other thing and he unfortunately could not find the previously mentioned balance as a consequence. So The Rite is full of the typical clichs from the exorcism subgenus like the evil boy the woman who screams curses and contorts her body the priest with a faith crisis who sees signals everywhere the possessed ones who know even the most intimate secrets from the exorcists...and a long etcetera. And besides The Rite takes so seriously to itself that there are some occasions of involuntary humor something which makes its true events to be even less credible the satanic mule is absolutely priceless.The main attraction for many people to go to watch The Rite is undoubtedly the presence from Hopkins in one of the leading roles and he brings an enthusiastic and expressive work. And even though he seems to loose the control near the ending I would not blame him for that but to the poor screenplay which betrays his character with a predictable twist. Colin O' Donoghue has the worst written character from the film but he still managed to bring a decent and credible performance. And finally the great Rutger Hauer is horribly wasted in his character.In conclusion The Rite is a tedious rehash of the tiring clichs from the exorcism subgenus so I really do not recommend it.".

The turn of events at Rome make him question his self beliefs and embark him on a journey of self fruition and worldly truth.Cast wise No complain. Anthony Hopkins seems very natural for his role of Father Lucas an unorthodox Exorcist who questions his faith after a failed exorcism. His performancespecially the devil possessed climax performance brings in mind the chilling menace he showcased in Silence Of The Lambs or Fracture etc. Newcomer Colin O'Donoghue plays his role of an upcoming reluctant Priest cum Exorcist with diligence and audacity. His appearancesomething of a mixture of dark and white makes him an ideal candidate for Batman's Bruce Wayne role. His performance was not overthetop nor was it beginner's mess. Rest chips in well in their roles.The Rite strength and weakness both lies in its Storyline. Fact is the storyline deals with the sensitive issues of demonic possession faith contradictions exorcism good versus bad issues in a very delicate ways. Neither the Director injects heroic acts to make it entertaining nor incorporate gore and violence to make an impact. Everything is dealt in a very instinctual manner rendering the movie being liked by a section of viewers for its authenticity and veracious dealing with its subject material on the other hand being distasteful to the other section of viewers for being non entertaining and devoid of gore and violence.Overall The Rite has something missing and something present. Even though the subject material might be difficult to digest for most viewers The Rite succeeds in capturing the viewer's attention and appreciation.My Verdict 710".

Three days later the Vatican denied the story. Father Gary Thomas was working as a parish priest in California when church leaders asked him to travel to Rome for training in the rite of exorcism. In Rome as an apprentice to a veteran Italian exorcist his eyes were opened to a darker side of the Catholic faith he had never known and he came to see the battle between good and evil as never before. Journalist Matt Baglio had full access to Father Gary over the course of his training and the astonishing story he found reveals that the phenomena of possession demons the Devil and exorcism are not merely a remnant of the archaic past but remain a fearsome power in many people's lives even today. The inspiration for the movie The Rite starring Anthony Hopkins this book provides a uniquely intimate glimpse into the chilling world of a reallife Roman Catholic exorcist.' And so with a few name changes to protect the innocent Michael Petroni adapted this book for the screen and in doing so developed a very understandable survey of the 'rite' of exorcism. In the film the student is Michael Kovak Colin Donaghue a new young Irish actor whose indecisions about things clerical harken back to his childhood when while living in a house used as a mortuary he is trained by his father Istvan Rutger Hauer and is forced to examine his mother's corpse being prepared for burial. Knowing that Michael only choices for career were mortician or priest he opts unconvincingly for the latter. After completely seminary but before taking his vows as a priest Michael resigns form the seminary only to be encouraged to proceed on a different course by his mentor Father Matthew Toby Jones who sends him off to Rome to learn exorcism because of a new demand for priests trained in that rite. Michael goes to Rome and in classes given by Father Xavier Ciarn Hinds is found to be an outspoken and sent to study with a brilliant exorcist Father Lucas Trevant Anthony Hopkins. Michael learns during several exorcisms on a young pregnant girl Marta Gastini that in order to perform exorcism the priest must believe in not only God but also the devil. Michael meets journalist Angeline Alice Braga in his classroom who asks to accompany Michael on exorcisms this is probably meant to be author Baglio's role and in her presence we witness the transformation of Michael into a believer  with a few surprises arising! Director Mikael Hfstrm paces this film well and while there are no truly new insights into the field of exorcism he does manage to make the acts appear fairly credible. Hopkins gives his usual bravura performance and the rest of the cast thankfully underplays their roles. Some of the scenes are fairly gruesome so it is not a film for the weak of heart. And if the viewer is expecting a docudrama of Baglio's book there will be some disappointment. It is a movie and as a movie it is entertaining. Grady Harp".

The younger Kovac makes his way to a monestary headed by a Priest played by Toby Jones who by a moviecoincidental turn of events suggests Kovac head to Rome to study the art of Exorcism.Kovac arrives and meets the character of Father Xavier Ciaran Hinds who quickly realizes that his new pupil is losing his faith. Seeing a bright mind that stands to be lost Xavier suggests the hermitseeming Father Lucas Anthony Hopkins finally. Lucas quickly performs an exorcism then another. And another. And pretty soon we can't help but ask ourselves if Rome has more exorcisms than Panera bread.The Rite is a good movie that doesn't seem to know what to do with itself. Anthony Hopkins doesn't show up til a fourth of the way into the movie and still he is not at all the main character. O'Donaghue who has to shoulder the burden of being the film as well as trying to hold a candle to Hopkins does quite well. He is believable and no matter how clichd his story is we want to see the best for him in the end.Alice Braga is your typical horror movie heroine. She plays Angelina no last name and is a ballsy reporter doing a story on exorcisms. The plot plays around with a romance for a bit before Kovac decides to become a priest. Rutger Hauer does a fine job in his bit part as the older Kovac. Likewise Toby Jones and Ciaran Hinds.Cinematography is also excellent. The shots of Rome and the interiors of the Vatican Father Lucas' home and the exorcisms themselves are filmed very well. The script is my main problem. In the middle of one of these exorcisms Hopkins answers his phone and expects O'Donaghue to continue on. Badly used comic effect that not even Hopkins can save.This is a mediocre film that doesn't take itself too too seriously and made an enjoyable two hours or so. It's very much like so many movies coming out nowadays however in that it's just to forgettable.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have no belief in the supernatural but when it comes to movies there is nothing I like better than a good horror. If the movie is sufficiently wellmade then there is no problem suspending disbelief for cursed video tapes cannibal zombies giant monsters vengeful ghosts or pretty much anything else. 'The Possession of Emily Rose' was a fairly good movie about demonic possession but I can't think of another one. The problem with possessionbased horror movies is that one either has to be a religious person who is already wellversed in such notions and scared by them or else the movie itself has to be very good at conveying a persuasive atmosphere of the dread and otherworldly malevolence that earthly manifestations of such beliefs should inspire. As with 'The Exorcist' 'The Rite' relies almost entirely on Christian and specifically Catholic beliefs for its horror value and also as with 'The Exorcist' too bad if you're a nonbeliever because there's not much left over for you. In fact the more seriously and obsessively both movies take their religious doctrines the sillier they look. 'Tell me your name!' shouts wouldbe exorcist Michael Kovak repeatedly at the demon inhabiting Anthony Hopkins' character. 'Dave! Jeff! Sid Vicious! Punkinpuss!' one shouts back at the movie. Then there's the director's apparent belief that slapping a 'dungeon echo' soundtrack sound effect on everything from doors closing to people opening their eyes equals 'scary'. Question How is a roomful of small frogs 'demonic'? Answer I don't know I was laughing too much at Muffin the Satanic Mule yes there's actually a satanic mule to think straight. And the ultimate question as to why a demon might want to make its possessee swear argue crack their knuckles and contort their limbs and how this activity might further the cause of Satan is never addressed much less how Biblical 'free will' might work with unwilling demonic possession. Kovak the conflicted 'atheist priest' is surprise surprise a weak and insipid character whilst the hardcore religious stuff is corny and embarrassing enough to have both believers and skeptics facepalming in unison. Throw in a couple of those cheap popup 'scares' like a cat at a window. Argh! A cat at a window! Be still my beating heart! and you have a lazy stupid movie which wouldn't give a tenyearold the heebiejeebies. Actingwise Anthony Hopkins isn't too bad when he's not pointlessly covered in 'scar' makeup and ranting hammily but then any acting is wasted in a movie where the goingson are so ridiculous. Neither scary nor profound 'The Rite' is patronising and insulting to its audience whether you're a firm believer or not. If you must rent it then treat it like a comedy and that way you won't feel like your money was spirited away.".

Anthony Hopkins is absolutely histrionic overacting in many moments. The unknown Italian Marta Gastini and the Brazilian Alice Braga have good performances and save the film in minor roles.

Those movies also introduce some interesting new characters and this time isn't the exception While the villain was a bit generic Tapion A new ally who also plays the role of a brother figure for Trunks manages to add a certain degree of melancholy to the plot in a way not usually seen in Dragon Ball making the plot to feel a bit closer to more serious anime shows like Saint Seiya despite of the obvious differences between those two series.Even when the plot resolution is a total Deus ex machina that comes out of nowhere without any single foreshadowing I still consider this movie to be a more than enjoyable ride from beginning to end. Definitely a mustsee for every Dragon Ball fan.810".

And the fight scenes I would want to just rewind everyone of those to watch the glory of fighting. My favorite part of the movie is the connection between Trunks and Tapion they act like they are brothers. My favorite fight scene in the movie is when Gohan fights the half monster I say half because Gohan only fights it's legs strange I know. It most likely won't be out in English until about midlate 2005 but at being one of the longest of them and possibly the best of them it is absolutely worth the wait. For an anime or action movie its great. For a DBZ movie it is perfect.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoy the DBZ movies but they usually all have the same flaw...they all could have used about 10 to fifteen minutes of plot development and about five more minutes of battle time. This one is no exception to the rule. Overall I enjoyed but I thought it could use just a bit more. Here it is nice to see they take a differing approach with the evil foe as this monster is rather large and is not the usually just smaller or just bigger than Goku villain. This monster is about Godzilla size. They also introduce a new hero character as well and he is the main focus for the story part of the movie the time before the ultimate ending battle. The plot has him and Trunks sort of becoming friends. Of course this also has the part of the story where our plot is established and it is rather interesting just needed a bit more to it. Then the last bit of the movie is a rather cool battle featuring many of the DBZ warriors including Goku Vegeta Gohan Goten and Trunks. The battle is rather nifty as the DBZ warriors get knocked around a bit by the behemoth foe. So on the whole it is a good movie just needed about 20 more minutes of play time to it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The last of the Dragon ball Z films sadly but at least they went out with a bang!! I got this film along with Fusion Reborn in the latest Funimation convient double feature set at a not too high price. Between the two this is my favorite primarily for its emotional side with Trunks and the new character Tapion. I also loved its somewhat spooky tone which was greatly enhanced by the final Z villain Hirduegarn. Let me just say I love the monster in both forms and the final allout epic battle is one to remember!! Vegeta of course makes his usual sudden appearance accompanied with my favorite line in the flick I was enjoying my first day off in over a month until some flatfooted mutated bemmoth stepped on my house! You're going to regret this you freak! Classic Vegeta once again as a super saiyan two. Of course plenty of other characters get their turn against Hirduegarn including Ultimate Gohan Goten Trunks and even super saiyan three Gotenks!! Sick!! The only one who doesn't appear what so ever is Piccolo in which I'm rather disappointed the only reason it isn't a ten star DBZ film. Naturally SS3 Goku saves the day with a badass new technique from which the title is named after and it's definitely not one to miss. One more thing though is that I didn't really like the fablestyle music in the English track. I personally preferred the English dialogue with 5.1 Japanese music options which is available thankfully on this doublefeature. Buy it and experience two of the greatest Z films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well lets start with the basics. The real title of this movie is The Explosive Dragon Fist. It's about Hildegarn who by the way isn't a dragon...I'm getting all this info from the Japanese movie with English subtitles Anyway the move gives no real hints as to its chronology within the dragon ball z story line other than the fact that Gohan is already doing the whole Great Saiyaman thing so its probably after movie 12. duh I'm too lazy to explain the entire story from beginning to end but heres the readers digest version On a far away planet called Konats in a far away galaxy thats really far away some idiots practicing black magic wished for their big ugly evil idol to be brought to life aka a mix between Pinocchio and Godzilla. Anyway the beast they brought to life was called Hildegarn. Hes unstoppable about a day when two kids use their magic flutes to weaken him wow they pick up weaknesses fast on that planet. Then they use magic swords to cut him in half wow some fast blacksmiths on this planet too. Somehow the flutes trap the two halves head to waistwaist down inside their bodies. Then finally the enders get involved and decide that the two brothers who saved the planet should be locked in music boxes and sent to the two ends of the universe. gee interesting way of showing gratitude. Moving on the two brothers Tapion and Minoshiyal are sent to the far ends of the galaxy. About 1000 years later one of the dudes that brought the beast to life who had been traveling from planet to planet looking for the brothers found the younger brother and killed him. minoshiyal cuz who wants to base a story around a person with a name that hard to pronounce Thus the lower half of Hildegarn was released. legs and tail Later the evil guy finds Tapions music box and goes to earth where he tricks Gohan into using the dragon balls to free Tapion who has a hard time keeping the upper half under control. If he falls asleep it escapes and tries to kill him But freeing Tapion meant the super special music box which kept Tapion locked away was destroyed. So to help him Bulma tries to construct a new one but it doesn't work. Tapion thinking it's OK to sleep falls asleep and the upper half of Hildegard unites with the lower half and the full Hildegard wreaks havoc on the town. The Zsquad tried and fails to beat it then Goten and Trunks fuse and goof around then after being yelled at by Picollo they attack Hildegarn and it seems like they've won. But dun dun dun Hildegard sheds his ugly skin like a beetle and becomes even uglier than before if thats possible. The only difference is that now he has wings. Yay. So anyway he kills more stuff and at the last minute when all hope seems lost Goku goes Super Saiyan 3 and says some cheesy line before doing this awesome punch evidently a dragon fist where he flies up in the air and the dragon that comes out when someone summons the uses the dragon balls the ones on earth appears in gleaming gold like Goku's hair and flies right through Hildegarn's torso leaving a giant hole the size of the Roman Colosseum which obviously kills him. So yea yay Goku won as if you had any doubts. I know it was a bit long but it's a complicated story. There are a lot of other details i left out so you wouldn't be reading an article the size of a harry potter book but when the movie comes out it'll just be more interested to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beware of Spoilers!This is a review for the recently released Funimation version. Although the Japanese version is very good. I had to say wow when I finished watching it. It has such a great story and is much more deep than the other movie stories. I was amazed that it was packed into 55 minutes. There are so many great qualities about this final Dbz movie. Great story Great animation some character development. The story is thus Two warriors Tapion and his young brother Minosha destroyed a beast named HildegarnHirudegarn in English version1000 years ago with magic whistles and contained the whistles along with their bodies inside Music boxes so he could never be released again and freed their planet from destruction. Hoy the strange alien who used his powers to bring Hirudegarn to life comes to earth to find a warrior who can open his music boxwhich contains Tapion so he can release Hirudegarn again to do his bidding. He acts as if he is innocent and the zwarriors use the dragonballs to open the box. Later on Hoy finally manages to release HirudegarnI won't tell how and the Zwarriors come to the scene. Also the movie tells the story of how Trunk's got his sword which I think is very cool. Overall the story is very complex I had to watch it twice to fully understand it. The final battle sequence is fast thrilling and action packed and very satisfying. We get to see most of the Zwarriors fight but Piccolo does not return for this final Dbz film which sucks. We get to see some Fusion and SS3. One thing that sucks is Funimation changed some major names like Dragon Fist which is changed to Dragon Fire which is stupid and pointless. Also there is crappy Gt music in it which does not make it anymore exiting in the battle sequences. Funimation doesn't use bands for the music anymore but they could have used the music similar to what they used in Fusion Reborn. Which was fast paced metal which was pretty awesome. I wouldn't say this is the best Dbz movie though which a lot of people say I think The History of Trunks is the best Dbz movie. To conclude This Dbz film is great in Dub and Japanese and is a great conclusion to the Dbz movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing The Scent of Green Papaya I was not expecting much just a vehicle for Catherine Deneuve.  And while it most definitely is that it is also so much more.The stunning cinematography the elegant score and the epic love story set against the turbulent colonial times.  I was quite taken with the myriad plot twists.  Too bad our high schooler has a 3minute attention span.This is a very real depiction of colonialism.  One reviewer noted the maternalism of Deneuve's character while pointing out the brutality of the slave sellers.  People expecting a total condemnation of colonialism or a total condemnation of communism just don't see the gray between the black and white.  Unfortunately only Europeans could have made this movie.  There is no didactic viewpoint which is why some Americans don't react well to it.    While the ending is a bit flat it still doesn't detract from the fact that this was a great movie.One of the little pleasures of this movie is listening to the Vietnamese housemaid's pidgin French and reading the subtitled translation.   While movies like The Scent of Green Papaya are wonderful and deserve all the accolades they are accorded this movie is very underrated.  Green Papaya is a nice cultural experience but it can't come close to Indochine for grit and history.  3 12 stars out of 4.".

Society was essentially segregated in Saigon  Indochina. One member of my family told me a story about how they left the French compound in Saigon one day with their mother and  for the first time  saw the real Vietnamese people in tattered clothes... Cue why are they in rags mummy? because that's the way most people live. So as I see it at least I wouldn't criticise this film for the sense you get of the French being oblivious to the reality of their existence in Indochina. That's the way it was. That's the way most colonies were in fact think Shanghai.

	schema:reviewBody "There is some difference of opinion about whether this is a good film or not. Some have called it a soap opera beautifully filmed. Both Leonard Maltin in his Movie and Video Guide and the good people at Video Hound used that designation. But I don't think that is correct at all. Beautifully filmed yes stunning at times like something from David Lean and in fact this film has more in common with the Hollywood panoramic epic than it does with the tradition of the French cinema. But it is certainly not a soap opera. In a soap opera the important element is a narrow focus on things material social and sexual played out in a banal clichridden and bourgeois manner. In Indochine the focus is on political change and why it came about.The story begins in Vietnam in 1930 and concludes on the eve of the communist revolution in 1954presaging the tragic American involvement a decade later. Catherine Deneuve plays Eliane Devries the strongwilled owner of a rubber plantation in Vietnam then part of the French colonial empire. Having no children of her own or a husband she raises the Vietnamese girl Camille Linh Dan Pham as her own. She conducts secret affairs and even visits opium dens while maintaining the appearance of respectability. We are shown the decadence of the French living in Vietnam and the exploitive evils of colonialism hardy the stuff of soap opera. We are made aware of the social unrest stirring amongst the population and even shown what amounts to a slave auction conducted by the colonial powers with the aid of the French military in particular the French navy.Enter JeanBaptiste Vincent Perez a handsome French naval officer who despite the difference in their ages initiates an affair with Eliane. She is at first put off then reluctant and then madly in love. Perhaps this familiar progression is what some think of as soap opera material and perhaps it is although their affair is only a small part of the film and at any rate such behavior is entirely consistent with Eliane's character and that of JeanBaptiste and is necessary for the plot developments to come.Deneuve was nominated for Best Actress by the Academy but didn't win Emma Thompson won for Howard's End but the film itself won as Best Foreign Film. In truth Deneuve's performance is a little uneven. Regardless this is one of the most important roles in the career of an actress who was as beautiful in 1991 when this film was made as she had been in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg 1964 at the beginning of her career. Indeed I would say even more beautiful. My favorite Deneuve film by the way is Mississippi Mermaid 1969 with JeanPaul Belmondo directed by Francois Truffaut.Also uneven is the direction by Regis Wargnier. The scenes set in Saigon involving the French and the Mandarins at their pleasures amid their wealth as they maintain their privilege are done with strikingly beautiful interiors splashed with the kind of color seen in for example the films of Chinese director Zhang Yimou. The scenes amount to indictments of the French and demonstrate why the communists eventually came to power. Note that the privileged are always decked out in the most amazing displays of color while the workers and the peasants are brown and dirty.The panoramic cinematography of the Vietnamese country is also strikingly beautiful. We are shown the sheer cliffs falling into tranquil waters dotted with junks the rock outcrops nestled in verdant growth the angry skies and the deluge of the monsoon. But the trek of Camille across the land to find her beloved is not realistically done. Her quick incorporation in a peasant family is also not convincing. And the following scene in which she and JeanBaptiste escape from the slave market defies probability. However what becomes of her and him is brutally realistic and consistent with what we know about those times although I would like to have seen them being fed when they are rescued and some indication of how they spent their time in that Shangrilalike hidden valley.Despite the flaws and inconsistencies this is a fine cinematic experience enthralling disturbing and visually beautiful. See this as a prelude to all other films about Vietnam and the Vietnam War. What will become clear is how foolish was our involvement and how doomed to failure it had to be.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

It was not a happy story for the Vietnamese they had to fight for 2 more years to be reunited and struggle for 15 more to start to come out of the whole process. That said this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made period.The intricate ballet of personal dealings and politics is carried out so well that one can easily get lost in the levels just as one can get lost in the intricate dance that is life in Asia. What you see is what you see it may be more or less depending.I do not believe that the movie defends France not does it condemn her. That part of the story is wisely left alone what remains is a human drama of the folly of resisting the inevitability of change. As the film unfolds the sheer weight of history comes down on all involved.It is that weight that brings the tears. From the time that JeanBaptiste is brought to Saigon to the closing credits there is no escape for anyone. The old order is out the new is awaiting its time of entry upon the stage. It is a time for tears a time to mourn and ultimately a time to heal.Americans in particular have a funny sense of history. We forget that others have been down the same roads before us. France's relationship with vietnam was most likely more of a force in the history of its people than ours with all of our napalm will ever be because the French left a legacy of life that could be seen even in the senslessness of the American presence.This movie captures that relationship and transcends it.

I was actually quite surprised at one of the comments which roughly said that the Vietnamese girl falls in love with French officer for no reason at all. Does not everybody know that love always happens for no reason at all? That is why many famous love stories are tragic people tend to fall in love with completely wrong people from different perspectives.I did not seem wrong to me that Elaine was mothering her Vietnamese workers. Remember Gone with the wind? How Scarlett's mother was treating her slaves tending to them when they were sick? I believe that many people felt that way towards their slavesservantsworkers. Elaine grew up in Vietnam she thought about it as her home and Vietnamese as her people though in a bit simplistic way. What I am trying to say is that her relationship with Vietnamese in the movie does not look untrue. Perhaps to some people it just looks politically incorrect these days when most people think that colonization was all that bad. It is too complicated an issue and the movie was not about it. On the contrary the movie wins while portraying both caring and cruel French people in Indochina not painting only with black and white colors rather raising questions than giving simplistic answers. It is rare in movies these days. This movie is done with impeccable European charm and gets 1010 from me.I am ready to defend my viewpoint at the Message Boards any time.".

I know how important this war was for the Americans as well as for the Vietnamese but this is an old country with an ancient culture that has a lot more to offer than the battles bombs and booby traps in the jungle the rice fields or the cities. Indochine is a movie that tries to show us another part of the country's history. It deals with the latest years of French colonial times in Vietnam or Indochine as they called it back then.The story starts in the 1930's at one of the largest rubbertree plantations in Indochine Vietnam. This plantation is owned by the French colonist Eliane a proud woman who lives with her father and her native adoptive daughter Camille. She doesn't have a husband or a man in her life apart from her father but gets to know the young officer JeanBaptiste when both want to buy the same painting at an auction. They have a short affair but than she refuses to see him again. In the meantime it's Camille who has fallen in love with JeanBaptiste and Eliane knows it. She makes sure he's send to one of the most desolate outposts on some remote island making sure that the two will never see each other again. Camille has no choice but to marry the man she was promised to but in the meantime she starts a search to find the man she really loves.This could have been a romantic movie in a different setting than we are used to but nevertheless one like we have seen many more before. And in a way it is but the movie has a lot more to offer as well. It shows the atrocities committed by the French the great poverty of the indigenous people the rise of Communism and the futile attempts to stop them before the French got involved in the war that would later be continued by the Americans. This movie is a lesson in history and geography wrapped in a paper of romance and marvelous landscapes. It was beautiful and dramatic at the same time. I was touched and amazed by it and really liked it a lot. That's why I give this movie at least an 810.".

It has a really decent plot that allows one to enjoy the movie while giving a history lesson and some of the reasons for the war between the French and Vietnamese people. A good see for those who want to see a different kind of movie and a MUST see for anyone interested in the history of the French involvement in Vietnam and the reasons for the intense dislike of the French by the common man in Vietnam. The scenery is outstanding. You will need to be ready to pay attention because the movie is in French and has English Subtitles. I think that this adds to the allure of the movie and did not take away from my enjoyment.".

The film was a fantastic lesson in history to which Vietnam and the rest of us are owed. To satisfy length requirements for my comments I will add that this crew did not shy away from showing characters who experience anger insult jealousy pain and all the rest with true precision. It is nice to see fine acting and depth with appropriate casting. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see color and who can read subtitles. I would also recommend that this film be viewed in two or three sittings. I did this because of disruptions but actually this respite added to the inherent suspense of each characters' fate and made the film easier to digest on a whole.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Regis Wargnier's Indochine is superb. The premise is simple enough Eliane a wealthy French landowner has an adopted Vietnamese daughter during French Indochina. Her life revolves her adored daughter and her extensive rubber plantation. Ultimately they separate.But what's complex is the relationship between Eliane and the people she controls her workers her child which underlines the fraught relationship an empire has with her colonies. Eliane symbolizes the French empire while Camille symbolizes Indochina which ultimately broke free from France. Eliane is both paternalistic and maternal both cruel and kind at the same time a privilege the empires have on their colonies. She protects a little boy she whips a male worker for an offense  all this regarded by her as something maternal a parent's love towards her child. She adores her plantation and runs it effectively and proudly.At the same time she passionately loves Camille who is very close to her too passionately perhaps to the point of being controlling like she is with everything in her life. She tells Camille that there is no difference between races that she Eliane is in fact Asian as she was born in Indochina and has lived all her life there. But this is far from the truth. There is in fact an unequal relationship of which Eliane enjoys the better end of the stick. The passionate tango which the mother and daughter performs at their Christmas party shows this. At first glance the dance is innocent. However we see that Eliane whispers to Camille that she wants to be alone with her in a mountain chalet like in the fairy tales. This parodies a heterosexual courting relationship and illustrates Eliane's masculinity equated with the need to dominate  not surprising as Eliane is thrust into the role of command usually linked to men and therefore enjoy the privileges accorded to men. This also illustrates the fact that despite their bond there's no doubt that Eliane is linked to European privilege and that Camille is pampered adored and doesn't stray far  France's exotic little pet.But ultimately Indochina decides she no longer wants to be a pet. The turning point of the motherdaughter relationship starts when young and handsome JeanBaptiste a naval officer enters the picture. Eliane's and Camille's tranquil life together is rocked. Eliane's usual cold and distant and not to mention secretive approach to relationships is shattered when she actually falls for hims the situation is made impossible when her daughter Camille also falls for JeanBaptiste after being saved by him at a shooting. Jealous and hurt Eliane orders him to be posted to the remote Con Dao islands. However she underestimates Camille's will. Lovestruck Camille sets out cross country to go to JeanBaptiste. Eliane and Camille's relationship as they knew it is never the same again.Indochine is a superb picture illustrating a mother's love and control towards her child and how the dependent child must ultimately separate a metaphor of the fact that all empires end.Make no mistake that this is France's story of the empire she lost in fact from the very start of the movie we hear Eliane narrating the story. Even when Camille was running away through the countryside it is through Eliane's lens that we see the voyage. We don't see her Communist training. The details are unknown to Eliane. Eliane is simply imposing her emotions and narration on what happened just like an empire imposes and creates the stories of her colonies.The story is told with a charismatic soundtrack and cinematography. The shots of the Vietnamese countryside and the famous Ha Long Bay simply take your breath away alongside with the shots of the rubber plantation misty in the morning. Eliane's wardrobe is also a feast for the eyes.Excellent performances from Catherine Deneuve and Linh Dam Pham whose portrayal of their characters' outward restraint and control also successfully show us their turmoil and pain. Deneuve was truly deserving of her Oscar nomination and Cesar win alongside with the Golden Globe. Indochine has become one of her celebrated latterday works and rightly so.However one point off for the movie taking too long to unfurl there is a subplot involving Yvette the wife of Eliane's French coolie that I did not care to know about. But overall a superb film greatly nostalgic which at the end may leave you with a heavy melancholic feeling.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS Regis Wargnier's Indochine is superb. The premise is simple enough Eliane a wealthy French landowner has an adopted Vietnamese daughter during French Indochina. Her life revolves her adored daughter and her extensive rubber plantation. Ultimately they separate.But what's complex is the relationship between Eliane and the people she controls her workers her child which underlines the fraught relationship an empire has with her colonies. Eliane symbolizes the French empire while Camille symbolizes Indochina which ultimately broke free from France. Eliane is both paternalistic and maternal both cruel and kind at the same time a privilege the empires have on their colonies. She protects a little boy she whips a male worker for an offense  all this regarded by her as something maternal a parent's love towards her child. She adores her plantation and runs it effectively and proudly.At the same time she passionately loves Camille who is very close to her too passionately perhaps to the point of being controlling like she is with everything in her life. She tells Camille that there is no difference between races that she Eliane is in fact Asian as she was born in Indochina and has lived all her life there. But this is far from the truth. There is in fact an unequal relationship of which Eliane enjoys the better end of the stick. The passionate tango which the mother and daughter performs at their Christmas party shows this. At first glance the dance is innocent. However we see that Eliane whispers to Camille that she wants to be alone with her in a mountain chalet like in the fairy tales.

The story line is told with painstaking detail in Vietnam against the back drop of war and that's what makes this movie so poignant you understand the characters through the little details so well that you cannot help but feel that what you perceive is what these characters are feeling. I literally cried throughout 15 of the films' 90 minute runtime not just a tear in the eye oh that's too bad but sobbing OH MY GOD WHY WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN?! Catherine's character and the Vietnam girl play it to perfection.I remember a comment kept running through my head this is not fair it's not fair it had to happen to them it's not their fault dammit it's not their fault. This film is a representation of how good dramatic anime can be if used correctly. There are no kung fu fights or mysterious dragons only reality. Such horrible wonderful reality that one will find that they cannot think about war in the same way as they did before. I know that this was the greatest war movie I have ever seen. It also might just be the greatest film ever. See it don't walk run you must see this".

I am not an authority on the art of cinema preferring to experience films and then see what I thinkfeel about them. INDOCHINE is a profoundly beautiful and moving film. I watch it now and then to recalibrate my moral compass.Background I believe that colonialism's fate was sealed with the invention of movable type. Granted it seemed unstoppable for a few centuries but all forms of Manifest Destiny et. al like all dogs eventually have their day. So will those that are currently wallowing in puerile selfcongratulatory nationalism to borrow a phrase from Carl Sagan. Philosophically speaking colonialism like slavery is indefensible. What's to like unless you're the one doing it? True there are films that celebrate the triumph of colonial powers over lesser beings. Here are three THE FOUR FEATHERS THE SAND PEBBLES sort of and GUNGA DIN also sort of. GUNGA DIN however imputes more intelligence to the erudite Thugee leader GURU than the three loutish British noncoms who fight him to preserve the RAJ. The noble watercarrying Gunga Din a sort of human reincarnation of RinTinTin saves the day and gives his life for his beloved leaders. More than often such films serve patriotic purposes. Whatever works eh?INDOCHINE is a fine example of cinematic art with a strong message about social justice and the rights under Natural Law of all peoples. It is strikingly beautiful. But under all this beauty lay injustice cruel exploitation and addiction to drugs and sexual appetites. One sees the rot and decay of the French and Mandarin ruling classes. Compared to them the Communists didn't look half bad. For more on that subject look up THE NEW CLASS by Milovan Djilas in Wikopedia if you don't want to read it.Just as France held fast to her colonies in Indochina like a parasite colonistrubber plantation owner Emile fastened on to his daughter Elaine. In turn she clung to her beautiful adopted daughter Camille. The most striking metaphor was the Tango scene in which mother and daughter danced a grotesque parody of romance. The young naval officer Jean Baptiste saw this very clearly. Confronting Elaine with this awful truth got him banished his naval career in tatters actually it's not quite that simple. It also put in motion a tragic set of events that convulsed the lives of all concerned. The love between Camille and Jean Baptiste survived living on through their infant son Etienne who was adopted and raised by Elaine. Every time I watch this remarkable film I feel emotionally drained. Time to watch something light and funny eh?".

The film's cinematography production design and costumes are stunning  never forced or pretty for their own sake but appropriate and executed with consummate craftsmanship. Indochine tells of the demise of French colonialism in what became Vietnam in an evenhanded manner never placing all virtue on any one side but narrating its story through characters who are dimensional flawed and recognizably human in only one case is there a character who is completely unsympathetic and that is a bit part. It is never easy to create characters who exhibit reprehensible qualities but still keep the audience interested in and sympathetic to them Indochine accomplishes this adroitly. The issues of France's colonial interest in Indochina come across in a natural nuanced way through the actions of the large and varied cast without it ever seeming like we're getting a history lesson. Catherine Deneuve's reputation as a somewhat chilly actress is used to good effect here which is not to suggest that her performance is at all onenote. Of interest is the depiction of the relationship between the French and the natives who are essentially subjugated and exploited however there is real affection at times between members of the two groups until the forces of history take over. The story of Indochine has many parallels throughout history  the story of a European or American interest moving in on the resources of an undeveloped country and appropriating them for its own profit and to the detriment of the inhabitants of the region. Somehow it took me fifteen years to get around to seeing this film and I was more than pleasantly surprised. The film exceeded my expectations and I recommend it to anyone interested in intelligent yet still entertaining filmmaking.".

Eliane Devries Catherine Deneuve has both a daughter and a son yet has never given birth which is maybe a metaphor for France 'adopting' Indochina. Like Heart Of Darkness the film employs a framenarrator in the shape of Deneuve who begins by telling her story to Camille Linh Dan Pham whose parents have just been killed and because they were Eliane's best friends she has adopted Camille  who comes with a dowry of her parent's land which swell the size of Eliane's rubber plantation  and both raises and loves her as her own. Devries is a chic Frenchwoman who for reasons never satisfactorily explained has forsaken the chic culture and civilisation of France for a superficially beautiful yet ultimately harsh land that's not unlike the antebellum South without the Mississippi. When a young naval officer JeanBaptiste Vincent Perez appears on the scene the inevitable happens and May and December have their mayfly moment. JeanBaptiste was of course the name of the mime artist in Les Enfants du Paradis and is well chosen given that Perez who has all the charisma of the Black Hole of Calcutta on a bad day might just as well be miming for all the animation he brings to his lines. Equally inevitably Camille falls in love with him and when Deneuve has him transferred to a remote outpost Camille follows him and contrives to kill one of his colleagues putting them both on the run. All this is played out against the political unrest that is always a byproduct of colonialism. In turn Camille has a child by JeanBaptiste he is killed she becomes something of a Vietnamese La Passionara and Deneuve winds up holding the baby and it is he now a grown man to whom Deneuve is narrating the story in 1954 as Indochina became Vietnam. Weighing in at two and a half hours it requires stamina but in addition to Deneuve both Jean Yanne and Dominique Blanc are on hand and against all the odds it does keep you watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven a homage to the 1950s melodramas of Douglas Sirk is an exquisitely crafted film of beauty and grace. The world that Haynes creates is so meticulously detailed that one almost forgets that the movie isn't fifty years old.Julianne Moore deserves an Academy Award for her portrayal of Cathy Whitaker a homemaker whose idyllic life begins to disintegrate when she learns that her husband is gay. Moore's Cathy is a delicate woman who would like to be courageous but can't be because of the world that she is trapped in. As her innocence begins to die she realizes how empty and superficial her life is. When she begins a cautious romance with her black gardener Dennis Haysbert she begins to see the racism and hypocrisy that forms the underbelly of a seemingly perfect world. At the end of the film Cathy has no illusions and realizes that the life that she thought was perfect is actually a neverending hell.Dennis Quaid is equally stunning as Cathy's tortured husband Frank. After Cathy discovers his homosexuality the two are forced to grapple with a truth that neither of them can comprehend. Frank goes to a doctor for treatment and his confession is heartbreaking. He says that he can't let this thing this sickness destroy my life. I'm going to beat this thing. We look at Frank and pity him because we realize that such a feat is impossible and unnecessary but Frank does not possess that knowledge. Frank begins to drink more and when he finally breaks down and tells Cathy that he has fallen in love with another man all of the anger shame and joy comes pouring out of him all at once. It is a supremely moving moment and the best performance of Quaid has ever given.As the marriage between Cathy and Frank begins to unravel the two also begin to fight. All of Cathy and Frank's arguments and confessions take place at night bathed in shadows. The truth has no place in this bright artificial world and it must stay hidden at all costs. One night when Frank tries to make love to Cathy and can't Cathy tries to placate him saying that he is all man to her. At that remark Frank hits her and for a moment the audience does not breathe. Cathy then asks quietly for her husband to get her some ice. Cathy is all restraints and it is only with her kind gardener that she has a chance to break free. The scenes between Moore and Haysbert crackle with erotic energy because everything remains unsaid. When Cathy finally asks him to dance with her it is a moment when we realize what human beings are capable of being together.The fourth example of stellar acting comes from Patricia Clarkson as Cathy's best friend Eleanor. Eleanor is a bitter gossipy coldhearted woman and when she tells Cathy I am your best friend you want to scream to Cathy not to believe her. Clarkson makes the most of her rather limited screen time and turns in a fascinatingly layered performance.Far From Heaven may very well be the best picture of the year. In creating an artificial world Todd Haynes has managed to lay bare the human soul in a way that has never been done before. It is a moving and important motion picture populated with some of the most nuanced acting I have ever seen. Cathy and Frank Whitiker may be far from heaven but the film comes about as close to heaven as is possible.".

However Frank's secret desire for men wrecks Cathy's image of their marriage but they manage to keep it a secret and seek help.  When Cathy confides in her black gardener the rumours begin that again threaten Cathy's allAmerican society queen existence.It helps when writing a review of a film like this that you can throw round all the right references and draw comparison's wit the two Sirk films from which Haynes drew inspiration from.  Sadly I can't do that as I haven't seen either of the works although have seen some Sirk films so I'll do the best I can!  From the outset this film builds a plastic perfect 50's world before revealing that everything isn't as the outside world and even those on the inside may perceive.  This works well but the film is strong because it works on several other levels past this one.Past the fake nature of lives  we are all human after all  are several other broader themes that are not as clear but still important.  The place of women is society is one  where Frank's indiscretion appears to still let him work etc Cathy much smaller crime sees her condemned from all around. Her relationship with Raymond shows how women held social status only as trophies in some circles and when this role was threatened or made redundant they had little more standing that blacks etc.The two fallings of Frank and Cathy are parallel and it is interesting to see the two.  Frank stigma that he must hide is one of sexuality while Cathy is less lucky in that her stigma is as clear to observers as the skin on Raymond's face.  This is not to say that the film works as well on each of these levels but it does work well enough on all of them.  It is slow and patient and it may frustrate some audiences who will claim nothing really happens'  if a review says this then ignore it  they have clearly missed the point.The 50's feel is bang on and very well done.  I'm not sure if Haynes has lifted the touches that make it feel 50's' from Sirk directly i.e. copied but it really works.  The colours are lush and every set and costume feel like it must be straight from the 50's.  It is to Haynes credit that he has done this without being camp or wistful in the way that many films set in the period can be.  He plays it straight down the line.The cast are roundly good.  Moore deversedly got her nomination for this work and she is excellent.  She never goes over the top but is visibly simmering throughout.  Quaid is good but has a less complex character to carry we don't get to understand what he is going through or felling  is it deep guilt lust love etc?  Haysbert in 24 is OK but plays a stiff morally righteous man who is so good' as to be difficult to swallow!  Here it is not quite as bad but Raymond is still a  good wholesome' man. Haysbert does him well but again I wanted more to the character.  The support cast are good and all play the plastic socialites and professionals of 1950's well.Overall this film is very lush  nothing but praise can be given to director costumes and set designers etc.  The cast are all good even if they must act with decorum and patience throughout and the emotion and drama of the story although stilted and controlled is still very involving.  A very good film  if it had been made in the 50's it would be held as a classic today.".

	schema:headline " a great film in both form and content";
	schema:reviewBody "Far From Heaven' is a total artistic triumph for writerdirector Todd Haynes who has among other things provided the most brilliant examination of the codes and values of the 1950's that I have ever seen in a film. His work here turns out to be a uniquely exciting and satisfying blend of form and content.   The '50's were of course a time when normality' was the condition most honored and prized in American society.  To be just like everyone else was not merely the greatest goal to which one could aspire but it came to define the very value one had as a human being.  And woe to anyone who didn't quite fit into those proscribed limits of acceptability'  for if one didn't one had to at least keep up the appearance of respectability and conformity for the benefit of society even if what went on behind closed doors was something quite different from what people on the outside imagined.The Whitakers are the model of a perfect '50's family.  Frank is a handsome highly successful businessman with a beautiful wellrespected wife who divides her time between raising their two children maintaining their lovely suburban home and spearheading the requisite number of charities for a woman in her position.  In fact she is such an archetype of the ideal housewife that a local society paper has chosen to feature her as one of their profiles.  Cathy's perfect life however is quickly shattered when she makes the shocking discovery that the husband she loves so dearly is a closeted homosexual who obviously married her as a means of hiding the truth from both the world and himself.  In true '50's fashion Frank when Cathy catches him in the act with another man decides to seek treatment' from a therapist in the vain hope that he will be cured' of his problem.' These scenes are a jolting and stark reminder of just how far we've come from the days when this unenlightened viewpoint held sway in society. The film also deals with the issue of racism when Cathy becomes a confidante and friend of a young black man who works as her gardener.  When this relationship is noticed by the townspeople the ugly realities of bigotry and prejudice come to the fore proving that even in a place like Connecticut where no actual laws segregated blacks from whites the attitudes of the common citizenry were no more enlightened than those that permeated the Deep South.In a stroke of genius Haynes has patterned his film after actual 1950's melodramas particularly those by director Douglas Sirk whose movies like Imitation of Life' and Magnificent Obsession' provided daring for the times studies of social issues like racism and MayDecember romances within the context of what were essentially glossy visually palatable soap operas.  Sirk's films are often honored for their ability to inject subtly subversive sentiments into popular mainstream entertainments.  Far From Heaven' looks exactly like those films from the colorsplashed autumnal setting to the pictureperfect interiors of an uppermiddle class home in suburban New England where familial and personal problems appear as out of place as Leave it to Beaver' would seem if it were on network TV today. The astounding achievement here is that Haynes is both paying homage to and utterly destroying the period at the same time.  He succeeds in immersing the audience for nearly two hours in this amazingly recreated world.  We come to feel as trapped in the stifling setting as the characters themselves do.   Haynes captures with emotional force the sense of helplessness these characters feel at not being able to measure up' to the demands of their world and the utter sadness and loneliness caused by the fact that they don't even have anyone they can truly open up to and discuss their problems with for they become instant candidates for rumormongering and societal rejection the moment they do.  Keeping up appearances' becomes the sole consideration in such circumstances leading many people to lead lives of quiet desperation hidden behind blandly conformist upbeat exteriors. In our day and age when people have gone to the other extreme  pouring out their every twisted idiosyncrasy on daytime TV talk shows for the benefit of a sensationcraving audience  it's important to be reminded of how much worse the alternative can be.  If nothing else Far From Heaven' is a study of the kind of emotional and psychological damage that can be inflicted on an individual when a society encourages repression and conformity at all costs.As Cathy Julianne Moore gives a performance that can be called nothing less than overwhelming.  She is utterly heartbreaking as a goodnatured woman totally baffled by the curves life is throwing at her trying to maintain a faade of normalcy and happiness even though inside her psyche has been inexplicably and irrevocably torn to pieces.  She wants desperately to figure out where her husband is coming from but the distance he keeps putting between himself and her precludes any such understanding.  Yet Cathy is also a paradoxical figure in that even though she is struggling to keep her life and marriage appearing normal' to the outside world she is subtly undercutting that goal by challenging the status quo in her relationship with Raymond the gardener.  Her genuine revulsion at the racist attitudes she sees around her compels her to act in a way true to her own convictions. Moore does a perfect job conveying every facet of this richly detailed and complex character.  It is certainly awardworthy work from one of our very finest actresses.  As Frank Dennis Quaid in a controlled restrained and heartwrenching performance captures the sadness of a man who wants desperately to live the life he's chosen but who just can no longer fight against the truth of his own nature.   In a way Cathy and Frank's situations are mirror images of one another.  Both discover a love' on the outside of societal norms yet because of the personal pain that that love is inflicting on the other partner in the marriage his for another man and hers for another man as well the two hurting people seem unable to perceive that connection they share.  These two fine performers turn what might have been just a cold exercise in style into a deeply moving and profoundly meaningful workTechnically the film is a masterpiece on every level from its art direction to its costume design to its cinematography.  The veteran composer Elmer Bernstein has provided a richly evocative symphonic score modeled on actual '50's style soundtracks that brings out the melodramatic richness of the film's many set pieces.  Yet his work here also has a quieter quality particularly in the subtle piano riff which reminds us quite a bit of his classic score for To Kill a Mockingbird.' As a director Haynes shows himself in total control of his medium blending all these elements into a complete and satisfying whole.Far From Heaven' is really unlike any movie you have ever seen a fascinating admixture of the old and the modern.  It also happens to be one of the very best films of 2002 a true work of art.".

When this relationship is noticed by the townspeople the ugly realities of bigotry and prejudice come to the fore proving that even in a place like Connecticut where no actual laws segregated blacks from whites the attitudes of the common citizenry were no more enlightened than those that permeated the Deep South.In a stroke of genius Haynes has patterned his film after actual 1950's melodramas particularly those by director Douglas Sirk whose movies like Imitation of Life' and Magnificent Obsession' provided daring for the times studies of social issues like racism and MayDecember romances within the context of what were essentially glossy visually palatable soap operas.  Sirk's films are often honored for their ability to inject subtly subversive sentiments into popular mainstream entertainments.  Far From Heaven' looks exactly like those films from the colorsplashed autumnal setting to the pictureperfect interiors of an uppermiddle class home in suburban New England where familial and personal problems appear as out of place as Leave it to Beaver' would seem if it were on network TV today. The astounding achievement here is that Haynes is both paying homage to and utterly destroying the period at the same time.  He succeeds in immersing the audience for nearly two hours in this amazingly recreated world.  We come to feel as trapped in the stifling setting as the characters themselves do.   Haynes captures with emotional force the sense of helplessness these characters feel at not being able to measure up' to the demands of their world and the utter sadness and loneliness caused by the fact that they don't even have anyone they can truly open up to and discuss their problems with for they become instant candidates for rumormongering and societal rejection the moment they do.  Keeping up appearances' becomes the sole consideration in such circumstances leading many people to lead lives of quiet desperation hidden behind blandly conformist upbeat exteriors. In our day and age when people have gone to the other extreme  pouring out their every twisted idiosyncrasy on daytime TV talk shows for the benefit of a sensationcraving audience  it's important to be reminded of how much worse the alternative can be.  If nothing else Far From Heaven' is a study of the kind of emotional and psychological damage that can be inflicted on an individual when a society encourages repression and conformity at all costs.As Cathy Julianne Moore gives a performance that can be called nothing less than overwhelming.  She is utterly heartbreaking as a goodnatured woman totally baffled by the curves life is throwing at her trying to maintain a faade of normalcy and happiness even though inside her psyche has been inexplicably and irrevocably torn to pieces.  She wants desperately to figure out where her husband is coming from but the distance he keeps putting between himself and her precludes any such understanding.  Yet Cathy is also a paradoxical figure in that even though she is struggling to keep her life and marriage appearing normal' to the outside world she is subtly undercutting that goal by challenging the status quo in her relationship with Raymond the gardener.  Her genuine revulsion at the racist attitudes she sees around her compels her to act in a way true to her own convictions. Moore does a perfect job conveying every facet of this richly detailed and complex character.  It is certainly awardworthy work from one of our very finest actresses.  As Frank Dennis Quaid in a controlled restrained and heartwrenching performance captures the sadness of a man who wants desperately to live the life he's chosen but who just can no longer fight against the truth of his own nature.   In a way Cathy and Frank's situations are mirror images of one another.  Both discover a love' on the outside of societal norms yet because of the personal pain that that love is inflicting on the other partner in the marriage his for another man and hers for another man as well the two hurting people seem unable to perceive that connection they share.  These two fine performers turn what might have been just a cold exercise in style into a deeply moving and profoundly meaningful workTechnically the film is a masterpiece on every level from its art direction to its costume design to its cinematography.  The veteran composer Elmer Bernstein has provided a richly evocative symphonic score modeled on actual '50's style soundtracks that brings out the melodramatic richness of the film's many set pieces.  Yet his work here also has a quieter quality particularly in the subtle piano riff which reminds us quite a bit of his classic score for To Kill a Mockingbird.' As a director Haynes shows himself in total control of his medium blending all these elements into a complete and satisfying whole.Far From Heaven' is really unlike any movie you have ever seen a fascinating admixture of the old and the modern.  It also happens to be one of the very best films of 2002 a true work of art.";

	schema:reviewBody "Todd Haynes' achievement in his homage to the films of Douglas Sirk is so complete and seems so carefree that it is easy to dismiss FAR FROM HEAVEN as a trifle. The look of such ease is deceptive however. Haynes' accomplishment that of telling a new story through a loving recreation of the 50's weepy is visually sumptuous and sweetly moving. The painstaking effort from the amazingly overblown dialogue ever so slightly exaggerated from the style of the actual 50's weepy to the oversaturated colors and evocative score never strains the film. In Julianne Moore he finds the perfect heroine. Her performance is so skilled that we don't see her at work. Though nominated Ms. Moore was sadly overlooked at the 2003 Oscars. Apparently no one could see past Nicole Kidman's prosthetic nose in THE HOURS. When a beautiful actress plays ugly she wins an award. Ms. Kidman's performance in THE HOURS is one of her best in that deeply moving film but it hardly matches the subtlety and difficulty of Ms. Moore's work in FAR FROM HEAVEN. With such breathtaking ease that we forget she is acting Ms. Moore scales the grand challenge of using melodramatic dialogue that verges deliberately on camp to reveal the tenderness and desire of the naive 50's housewife who is the center of FAR FROM HEAVEN. Watch her face in an early scene where she and the excellent Patricia Clarkson talk with their girlfriends about their respective marriages. Credit must be given to Haynes as well who asks his cast to play it straight. Ms. Moore who consistently achieves beauty and depth with each performance brings this tender film to life. She has a fine counterpart in the handsome and Dennis Quaid who has not had such a plumb role since his early days. Though every film should stand on its own you should check out the milieu that Todd Haynes is working in  the oeuvre of Douglas Sirk being the main source  but you can also check out earlier films like DARK VICTORY and other domestic dramas.".

Julianne Moore is excellent and deserving of the acclaim she's received for this role as well as Quaid in the supporting role. The thing I think most people missed or haven't made much comment on is that both Kathleen and Frank are victims of heartfelt emotions at a time when expressing them is unthinkable. They are equally challenged by simple and earnest desires to fill the void in their lives Kathleen with her giant colorblind heart in a cold society of bigots and Frank in his corporate supremacy and his It's a different kind of love Charlie Brown headache. One reviewer said Frank was abusive closeted sure obviously duh and an alcoholic. I guess if you'd ever been through that type of situation you might be a bit more forgiving because it is hell and I came from the 50s so trust. Each of these obviously welldeveloped characters is simply doing the best they can in a world where their groundbreaking feelings are out of place. I loved it. I own it. And I clearly do not advise that slim minds or socially challenged people attempt it. However if you can watch a movie and not be a judge if you can accept things not from your time and not about you but about very very grand new ideas it's an extremely wellmade wellacted and accurate film. I personally forgot we had so much orange and green furniture. And Moore is to be also commended on how well she wore those giant skirts ".

This man is a homosexual.Yes it is true this man is considered sick but that is just one of the many skewed attitudes of the 1950's that director Todd Haynes brings to light in Far From Heaven. Julianne Moore plays Cathy Whitaker the wife of Frank Whitaker Dennis Quaid who are the proud parents of two children. The live the life that people envied. A nice home money success and happiness. All of that comes crashing down when Cathy discovers her husband is not who he really is.Cathy goes to Frank's work to drop off some dinner only to discover that her husband is in the arms of another man. Frank says that he is sick and wants treatment. Cathy the super wife is behind him 100 percent as if he really had an illness to beat.

Cathy comes to confide in Raymond and find peace of mind in his attitude and his overall good nature. The neighborhood looks down on their friendship and casts a shadow on the household. Raymond a black man is much like Cathy seeing not color but people. Even in New Haven Connecticut the feeling of white superiority still runs through the veins of its inhabitants.The movie from start to finish is wonderful. It is a rollercoaster of emotions. Moore Quaid and Haysbert give fantastic performances. Even Patricia Clarkson who plays Cathy one true friend in the neighborhood gives a delightful performance.It's not just the acting that gives this movie it's lift off of the ground. Haynes direction and the art direction of the film create a pallet of colors and emotions that set the mood for each seen. The film opens in autumn. The leaves are shades of red yellow and orange a true autumnal foliage like you would see on a Vermont postcard. The clothing is a perfect time capsule of the 50's. Haynes also uses a lot of colored lights to directly influence the mood of a scene. The green neon light of the gay bar Frank enters gives a strange feel like an alien world. The blue light that comes in through the windows in his office at night and in their home after a party means something dramatic is taking place.Elmer Bernstein has racked up 14 nominations for his music including a win for Throughly Modern Millie. His score for this film is the current that pushes the story along. Like so many great composers he doesn't create music but a character. Everything is different with the right score to back up a great story.A story and a script that Haynes wrote so beautifully. He captured the lingo that kids used in the 50's and gave us a look at how kind people can be and how despicable some are.The issues that Haynes tackles in the film are still around today just not taken so seriously. It is hard to think that only 50 years ago homosexuals were looked at as sick people and the AfricanAmerican community was still not welcome. To this day there are still hints of this feeling around the country but most is left to be talked about in the privacy of our own homes.Whether or not you are straight or gay black or white democrat or republican we all are people. Haynes shows that even if two people are in harmony it is the outside influences that can rip them apart. Hatred and tolerance cannot coexist.".

	schema:reviewBody "Far From Heaven is an effort from acclaimed director Todd Haynes Safe 1995 Velvet Goldmine 1998 that ranks as one of his best works perhaps his most accessible to date. He doesn't make many features but every feature he has directed has been lovingly created with a visual style so strong that his films sometimes are worth watching again just for its miseenscene. In Far From Heaven Haynes recreates the 1950s melodrama of which films by Douglas Sirk All That Heaven Allows 1955 Written on the Wind 1956 serve as his greatest influence.Far From Heaven stars Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid as wife and husband respectively. They live in a huge house with a wellmaintained front lawn in Connecticut and have a daughter and son. Cathy the wife is conservative wellmannered and understanding. She supports the black cause amid increasing racial tensions and is a role model in her town because of her effortless ease in balancing family life and presenting an amicable and cordial public face. It is a very effective performance by Moore who manages to win our empathy for her character with her mastery of emotional expression.Quaid's character Frank is the source of conflict in this tearjerker of a story. A successful company executive Frank however has a soft spot for handsome men a weakness laid to its bare essentials in the first major turning point of the film  a scene showing him and another man kissing in full view of Cathy. Quaid's performance is more intense than Moore's but is only effective in a handful of scenes most of which are responsible for changing the direction of the narrative. There is also a subplot involving a blooming friendship between Cathy and a friendly male Negro neighbor that adds complexity to the tale.Haynes' film is less admired for his narrative treatment of themes such as racism and homosexuality than his remarkable attention to detail to the film set and cinematography. The composition of each shot is deliberate and Haynes makes no effort in concealing the fact that he is directing from a set which I feel gives a unique experience for the viewer because it feels like watching a dramatic play on the big screen. Dialogue exchanges between characters are also short and tothepoint with emphasis on nonverbal cues that dictate the characters' hidden emotional state.Finally in the tradition of melodramas music plays a significant role in Haynes' film. Composer Elmer Bernstein infuses in his melancholic score played mainly by strings and piano a heavy sense of yearning and nostalgia not dissimilar to his score for To Kill a Mockingbird forty years ago. Despite its slow pacing Far From Heaven is a straightforward film that mainstream audiences can enjoy. For more critical viewers there is plenty to appreciate and admire in this work of art.

	schema:reviewBody "Far From Heaven has been explained as a woman's film and a surefire tear jerker but in fact it's intended for the kind of woman who would cry at the sight of a washing machine that wobbles a bit during its spin cycle.Todd Haynes has lovingly perfected the surface of this film with the skill of a master mortician.  However beneath its perfect surface it's equally dead.  All of Haynes' energy has gone towards recreating the details and trappings of a past era of let's face it relatively minor film making and there's no energy left to imbue the characters with power believability or any trace of interior life.  Therefore Kathleen can utter ridiculous lines some ice please after she's just been belted by her husband and without losing her pastedon smile for a second can make chirpy little jokes about her husband's disgustingly ugly drunken behavior at the party that she has spent most of the film and perhaps most of her life planning.  As game as Moore's acting is her character is like a windup doll.Quaid's part is even worse.  Although I like him as an actor he has no clue how to portray the inner conflict of a gay man trapped in a suburban marriage trapped in the 1950's.  For someone who feels despicable he somehow has no difficulty ogling a cute blond kid in full public view  in front of both his own wife and the kid's parents.  And though he's already been caught by both the police and his wife in flagrante delicto he has no problem getting it on with the blond boy in his hotel room while his wife reads Cosmo by the poolside we don't see this happen but it's clearly implied.  This is simply ridiculous.Dennis Haysbert's character is forced by the script into similarly disingenuous behavior.  We're expected to believe that he's a Miro scholarbotanistMBA and man about about town yet he somehow thinks he could bring a whiterthanwhite upper class woman into a negro blues bar and the patrons would be really friendly?  And he's surprised when his fellow Blacks shower him with the same onedimensional hatred that all of Kathleen's friends shower upon her?Haynes seems to view the 50's as if they occurred 1000 years ago the characters seem not so much as from a different time as from a different species.  The result a potential story of tremendous personal conflict and suffering ends up a curiously uninvolving pastiche although one in Amazing Living Technicolor.  This is perhaps the only film ever made in which the leaves are more alive than the characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "FAR FROM HEAVEN is like a long elaborate joke that seems to build and build to a punchline that never comes. As it goes along you patiently wait for it to have a point your interest ebbs and flows but it is fanciful enough that you stick it out to the end only to discover that it was not a joke and was never intended be. And you're left confused embarrassed and more than little bit irritated.FAR FROM HEAVEN is a detailed recreation of a very specific type of drama from the 1950's a highgloss emotiononthesleeve women's picture wherein everything has the rich Technicolor tone of an ad for refrigerators or hair care products from out of the pages of LIFE LOOK or the Ladies' Home Journal of that era. Yet this studied look of perfection is undercut with a melodramatic angst of social disorder and class dysfunction. It was high class soap opera and it's chief practitioner was Douglas Sirk though he had his imitators.This sort of pastiche of cinematic artificial perfection died even before the beginning of the sixties and took on a dinosaur like quality with the advent of the French New Wave social unrest and the long overdue death of the production code. Therefore when director Todd Haynes serves up this painstaking recreation of this antique genre one has the right to be suspicious Hollywood usually only visits it's past for the purpose of parody think MOVIE MOVIE or YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. The film is so straightfaced in its recreation of the genre  lush melodramatic music heightened emotional line readings etc.  that one assumes that Haynes has his tongue firmly in his cheek. But he doesn't he genuinely wants to explore how this type of 50's film with would have dealt with the issues of interracial romance and homosexuality had the times permitted those themes to be openly explored way back when.This leads to one simple question Why? If you take a very real situation and set in down in a very fake setting it doesn't make the real situation feel even more real it makes the situation seem fake as well. And therein lies the problem with FAR FROM HEAVEN instead of being an honest exploration of the themes of bigotry and homophobia it only seems to trivializes it's own intentions without even a fig leaf of satire to disguise it's failure.Julianne Moore is charming in the lead role but you have to be willing to accept the idea that she is sophisticated enough to understand her husband's closet homosexuality on one hand yet be so naive that she doesn't realize that running around town and socializing with a black man is a nono even in the relatively liberal setting of suburban Connecticut. And her stylized suffering seems as artificial as the picture perfect set design and lush background score.FAR FROM HEAVEN can be appreciated as a wonderful if utterly hollow exercise in style but as an exploration of social mores of the 1950s  or of contemporary standards  it is far from heavenly.".

Yet this studied look of perfection is undercut with a melodramatic angst of social disorder and class dysfunction. It was high class soap opera and it's chief practitioner was Douglas Sirk though he had his imitators.This sort of pastiche of cinematic artificial perfection died even before the beginning of the sixties and took on a dinosaur like quality with the advent of the French New Wave social unrest and the long overdue death of the production code. Therefore when director Todd Haynes serves up this painstaking recreation of this antique genre one has the right to be suspicious Hollywood usually only visits it's past for the purpose of parody think MOVIE MOVIE or YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. The film is so straightfaced in its recreation of the genre  lush melodramatic music heightened emotional line readings etc.  that one assumes that Haynes has his tongue firmly in his cheek. But he doesn't he genuinely wants to explore how this type of 50's film with would have dealt with the issues of interracial romance and homosexuality had the times permitted those themes to be openly explored way back when.This leads to one simple question Why? If you take a very real situation and set in down in a very fake setting it doesn't make the real situation feel even more real it makes the situation seem fake as well. And therein lies the problem with FAR FROM HEAVEN instead of being an honest exploration of the themes of bigotry and homophobia it only seems to trivializes it's own intentions without even a fig leaf of satire to disguise it's failure.Julianne Moore is charming in the lead role but you have to be willing to accept the idea that she is sophisticated enough to understand her husband's closet homosexuality on one hand yet be so naive that she doesn't realize that running around town and socializing with a black man is a nono even in the relatively liberal setting of suburban Connecticut. And her stylized suffering seems as artificial as the picture perfect set design and lush background score.FAR FROM HEAVEN can be appreciated as a wonderful if utterly hollow exercise in style but as an exploration of social mores of the 1950s  or of contemporary standards  it is far from heavenly.";

Todd Haynes both wrote and directed this study of the cruelty of prejudice in a manner that is disconcertingly sterile on the surface  a surface that the period of the 1950s cloaked everything with that should have been matters of intense public discussion and correction. Cathy Whitaker Julianne Moore in a radiant profoundly sensitive performance is the picture perfect carefully groomed crinolined wife of successful Frank Whitaker Dennis Quaid mother of two just right children and plastic hostess for parties that include her proper friends  such as Eleanor Fine Patricia Clarkson. Frank drinks too much makes a few public scenes and it is apparent he is dealing with his private very secret demons Frank is trying to live a perfect married life but his true physical desires are for men. Cathy copes confides in her 'colored' gardener Raymond Dennis Haysbert and her 'colored' maid Sybil Viola Davis. Cathy's friendship with Raymond utterly innocent though it is is the cause of immediate racial hysteria in the community of Hartford Connecticut. Frank is having an affair with a man Cathy discovers this and tries her best to understand but when Frank comes home intoxicated and threatens Cathy about HER 'affair' with Raymond the perfect bubble of this plastic marriage bursts. Cathy turns to Raymond for solace but both understand they are living in a time when they cannot be friends because of the racial difference the core of their relationship is as pure a respectful and honest love as any Cathy has ever experienced. Frank finally confesses his homosexuality to Cathy they decide to divorce and Frank goes off to his lover while Cathy finds some measure of solace in Raymond's honest friendship. The period of the 1950s is crisply captured not only in the settings and clothes and cars but also in the phrases of language used during that time the script is on target. So much has happened since the time of the story of this film  Martin Luther King Jr's 'We shall overcome' and the changes that started at Stonewall both only ten years later  and yet we still suffer from the effects of unfounded cruel prejudice on many levels.

Moore develops a deeply warm deeply caring character who discovers pools of rebellion in her that she didn't know were there. Quaid while perhaps having an easier character to play gives a fierce performance as a man whose struggles with his inner demons are so intense that they manifest themselves almost physically in his face and demeanor.A lot of criticism has been leveled at the film for its treatment of the character of Raymond Dennis Haysbert the black gardener with whom Moore strikes up first a friendship and then a forbidden romance. Detractors say that Haynes stacked the deck too far in Raymond's direction making him too educated too articulate too everything just to make a point. I can see where that criticism is coming from but I'd have more of an issue with it if the movie as a whole was less stylized. In context it works.On top of the terrific performances and Haynes's meticulous direction the film is visually stunning with cinematography and colorcoordinated costumes that are used alternately to highlight the harmony and dissonance of a world that looks perfect but isn't.

	schema:headline " If Bobby and Chazz are reading this...I couldn't thank you more!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This might be a matter of taste but A Bronx Tale remains Number 2 on list of Favorite Movies of All Time.  It just happens to be one of the most deeply moving powerful films I've ever encountered.  Yes some may consider this a simple story but that's the beauty of it.  It's a downtoearth comingofage story that perfectly mirrors the life of a boy like C growing up in the Bronx at such a hectic time.  Of course this is based on Chazz Palminteri's real life experiences and I envy Chazz being an aspiring screenwriterdirector.  I wish I had life experiences like that to put on film.  And I have to commend my man Bobby D for bringing these images to life in such a vibrant engrossing way.DeNiro captures every element of the 1960's Bronx with a great opening sequence featuring doowop singers sweetly singing the movie's theme.  He captures so many elements of the period and it was nice to see only one goof was captured.  It was interesting to find out that most of the movie was actually shot in Brooklynmy hometown.  Then again the two places are alike in their own simple ways.  Bobby D has a short but memorable role which is against type as a workingclass bus driver.  He's desperately trying to get by and support his son Cologero I think that's how to spell it...LOL and disapproves of his son's new job with gangster Sonny Chazz who gives a landmark performance.  The interactions between DeNiro and his son are extraordinary in the way they mirror the way a real father and son would argue in those situations.  As I said it's the whole downtoearth quality of this movie that I think made it tick.  It's nothing pretentious.  This is a simple movie about humanity.  The gangster plot is merely a backdrop. The only other movie I've seen him in was Crimson Tide in a very small role but Lillo Brancato who plays DeNiro's son in the later years is a revalation!  He gives one of the best performances I've ever seen and I'm surprised I haven't seen him in any more recent movies.  And I have to say DeNiro did a dynamic job of casting.  As far as I know Brancato and Bobby aren't related but please tell me if I'm wrong because they look EXACTLY alike!  If you've seen any of DeNiro's very early films Brancato is a mirror image of him.  Is it coincidence or what?  I've rarely seen a film where the sondaughter even directly resembles the parents but Brancato has the DeNiro nose and everything.  If you observe closely there's a scene where Brancato is wearing a black jacket and a black hat and if you were to see this in a splitscreen with DeNiro in Mean Streets it would be uncanny.  There are so many people I have to commend for this film.  That also includes the supporting cast.  Taral Hicks as C's love interest was also impressive.  And of course you can't have a movie directed by DeNiro and starring DeNiro without his main amigo making an appearance.  Hopefully you haven't read the cast list on the IMDB.  Because I was surprised and overjoyed when the man appeared in the final scene. There are many lessons on life to be drawn out of this film some of which given by Chazz's character Sonny who plays the most likeable gangster I've seen in cinema.  Yet at the same time you can't consider him too nice. Which was a good move.  Sonny was a nice guy in the core yet he still has a heart of a gangster.  In a great monologue he explains how he'd rather be feared than loved.  And of course there's the great monlogue that everyone remembers  the car door scene.  That was really an unforgettable speech. Plus there's funny moments too.  The gambling scene in the basement for example.  Get in the fking bathroom!!!  LOL...that was hilarious. To add to the emotional intensity we have an interracial relationship between Brancato and Hicks at a time when Bronx was heavily segregated and whites wanted absolutely nothing to do with blacks.  The scene where the boys beat those innocent black boys down was an extremely powerful scene. And through DeNiro's direction we feel the characters' every emotion.  I like how he used the doowop music to contribute to the soundtrack.By the end I was almost at tears.  I'm virtually tearing up just writing this review and looking at this masterful drama in retrospect.  This is something ONLY Bobby D and Chazz could've done!  No one could've done it better!  For me to be this deeply moved by a motion picture is unprecedented.  I wish I could be thanking the two guys in person.If anyone hasn't seen this movie please don't hesitate to pick it up!  This is one of those great underrated masterpieces that you feel sad after finding out about its poor success.  A film like this really deserves more recognition.And Bobby D....I think you owe a bunch of thank yous to your buddy Scorcese.  He's taught you well.My score  A perfect 10! out of 10".

Robert De Niro's directorial debut proves strong and lively evidenced by how he stuck to a topic close to home a young impressionable Italian kid growing up little Italy in the late 60's.  As the naive protagonist Calogero or 'C' as he is nicknamed Lillo Brancato gives a great performance as a young man torn between the workingclass honesty displayed by his strict father and the ruthless world of organized crime demonstrated by the neighborhood crime boss Sonny Chazz Palminteri adapted his own play and cast himself as a burly laid back world weary knowitall.One key element that snags you in is the narration.  Like equally personal films of its stature Scorsese's gangster trilogy Taxi Driver Election Bringing Out The Dead SLC Punk! the voiceover guiding brings you in even further into the already detailed landscape and story presented. I don't really consider this a mafia movie it's much more of a comingofage tale.  However the background De Niro provides is so intimate and thorough that you wish for another film chronicling the life of Sonny.I have to admit that for a debut De Niro's judicious use of music seemed to rival that of Spike or Scorsese in turns of effectiveness.  First of all De Niro kept a much more grass roots approach sticking to doowop soul rock mobster pop Dean or Frank and a little jazz.  Whereas Scorsese will use anything at his disposal Casino had two Devo tunes in it De Niro really seems to search for what really makes the scene.  My favorite is the scoring of a street fight scene to Nights In White Satin... De Niro must of knew before we did it was all in the violins.  De Niro said he knew this type of story had been done before and didn't want to repeat anything so he viewed Scorsese's mobster trilogy to see what already had been done.

	schema:headline " Growing Up In The Bronx";
	schema:reviewBody "A Bronx Tale does take me back to New York City in the sixties. I grew up in Brooklyn then which certainly has always had its own identity. I'm glad that Chazz Palmentiri has given the Bronx an identity of its own. There are still parts of the Bronx which have the Italian neighborhood you see depicted here. But the Bronx is a Latino majority borough now ironic when you consider part of the story of A Bronx Tale is the racial tension between the blacks and Italians.The movie divides in two parts the first is around 1960 with the background of the 1960 World Series one of the best ever played where the Yankees of Mickey Mantle lost to the Pirates in seven games. Robert DeNiro is your average Joe a bus driver by profession trying with his wife Katherine Narducci to raise their son who is eight years old. Young Francis Capra who is fascinated by the gangsters hanging out at the bar down the street witnesses the local boss commit a murder. True to the neighborhood code he doesn't snitch to the police and the local boss takes him under his wing.Chazz Palmentiri is the boss and he's an interesting character. A man who's risen to the top of his profession he's got a sense of himself and what it took to get there. Life is about choices he made his and he's going with the flow but he knows it isn't for everyone. He advises young Capra to stay in school but the more he advises the more fascinating Palmentiri becomes to DeNiro's dismay.The second half of the story is in 1968 the Bronx as part of America ravaged by racial tensions assassinations and the war in Vietnam. The little boy is now teenager Lillo Brancato who gets interested in a black girl a big nono in the crowd he comes from but Palmentiri is the one person who encourages the relationship. Let's just say that everything every element of the story comes full circle on one night in the Bronx in 1968.The comparison to Goodfellas for me is obvious. The two kids who grow up to be Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta are taken under the wing of neighborhood boss Paul Sorvino who sees them as promising gangster material and they grow into the roles. Palmentiri keeps telling the young kid here do what I say not what I do but in the end it takes some tragic events to set him on a right path.DeNiro who you would normally expect in the gangster role is just fine as the father a good man not a perfect one by any means but just a guy trying to do right by his family. It's Palmentiri however who really steals the film as the local gangster boss who's as street smart as they come but even with all that can't anticipate all contingencies.Lillo Brancato who went on to several other film roles and a long running one in The Sopranos certainly in real life didn't make the same choices as his character Calogero Anello did. Life really imitated art in his life story.Nice to see the Bronx get its due.".

Despite the language  moderate violence such as the bar scene there isn't anything graphic certainly not on the scale of Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan! and no nudity just a good story.

	schema:headline " Vintage Robert DeNiro";
	schema:reviewBody "The amount of brillance that Robert DeNiro puts into all of his performances is unmatched and he proves that he can also be a fine director by debuting in that field as well as starring in this 1993 Savoy release. DeNiro is top billed but you actually don't see very much of him. The film's major focus is that of a little boy named Calogero and his idol a mobster named Sonny Chazz Palminteri. Sonny owns the Bronx neighborhood where Calogero and his honest bus driver father Lorenzo DeNiro live. He also basically owns them. Sonny's heavy amount of power and wealth make him an intimidating force throughout the neighborhood but his mob gang make their fear of him look like complete respect. Sonny knows that he's feared and it just encourages him to keep trying to rise in power. Calogero grows up watching Sonny cavorting on the street with his gang and secretly imitating him much to Lorenzo's chagrin. Lorenzo wants the best life possible for Calogero and doesn't want to see him fall into a life of crime or looking up to crime figures. Calogero doesn't listen because he idolizes Sonny too much and his chance to get Sonny's attention comes when he witnesses Sonny fatally shoot a man. When Calogero is questioned by police his loyalty comes before his conscience and he doesn't rat out Sonny's guilt in the shooting. Sonny strongly appreciates this and so he gives Calogero an easy money job serving drinks for his high rollers gang. As several years pass and Calogero nears the end of his childhood he must learn to make the ultimate choice between his two father figures. Just like in Goodfellas a classic soundtrack and excellent period detail is evident here and this film stands out as yet another classic in the modern day organized crime film genre. Palminteri makes a strong film starring debut and DeNiro makes the very most of his rather small seeming part. Joe Pesci also appears briefly as another respected crime boss. An instant new classic.".

	schema:headline " One of the best films in decades";
	schema:reviewBody "Once in a while you see a movie that absolutely nails a time and place and 'A Bronx Tale' is one of those movies. This comingofage story about a young Italian boy growing up in the heart of Little Italy in The Bronx in the 1960's is Robert DeNiro's directorial debut and it's an auspicious one. Everything about the story rings true the neighborhood the mobsters his family and friends the gambling all of it. I visited 187th Street in the Bronx just 2 months ago and I could easily imagine everything happening there even though the bulk of the movie was filmed in Astoria Queens. I also saw the Broadway play starring Chazz Palmintieri less than 4 weeks ago.The principal character is a young boy named Calagero and the movie is the story of how his life was molded by his experiences growing up in the neighborhood. Through a serendipitous event he is befriended by a neighborhood mobster Sonny who takes him under his wing. His hardworking busdriver father opposes the relationship and confronts the gangster at one point. But Calagero's friendship with the gangster continues to flourish through his teen years. As he reaches his midteens in the late 60's his racist friends lean towards troubles beyond the usual teenage rowdiness and try to drag Calagero with them. A large subplot is the interracial romance he pursues with a girl from school. It seems doomed from the outset due to pressures from all their friends and families and society itself. Everyone except Sonny.It took me a few months to fully appreciate this movie. Everything about it is so honest. It is at times happy sad funny crazy romantic terrifying and nostalgic. I won't reveal the dramatic ending but I will spill one bean. The author of this semiautobiographical story is also named Calagero but he's better known as 'Chazz' Palmintieri who is also the star. It rates as one of the better movies I've ever seen. Salut Signor DeNiro.".

	schema:reviewBody "There has never been any doubt that Robert De Niro can act rings around just about any actor today but it came as a surprise that he is also a director of some skill. It is clear who he has drawn a lot of inspiration from but unlike Scorsese his film A Bronx Tale is a quiet character study where the violence doesn't hit you over the head.Chazz Palminteri who plays the local mob boss Sonny wrote a play about his childhood and De Niro read it. He then met with Palminteri and said this is how Palminteri himself described it on the AFI Awards show for De Niro You can get anybody to make this movie but if I'll make it fing right! Boy was he right. The director could have made this into a clichd gang flick but De Niro made it with heart and wit.De Niro also plays the father Lorenzo and his son Calogero based on Palminteri is played by Francis Capra as a child and Lillo Brancato as a teen. The latter was a real find. He actually looks like De Niro and he can act too. The way the relationships between Lorenzo Sonny and Calogero are portrayed is the best parts of this movie. You can actually buy that Sonny could get a boys respect and still maintain his feared image and you can also buy that Lorenzo does make sense most of the time but that it is the boy who teaches the father a lesson at the end to respect another person even though he does not fulfill your perception of a model citizen.The things I have just written maybe sound a bit hard to swallow but it shouldn't turn you off seeing the movie because it is the most accomplished piece of work by a first time director that I have ever seen and I hope De Niro will make another stab at directing soon. Lately he doesn't seem to have that much interest in making anything other than comedies and that's okay but he should consider making at least one film more that you can relate to like this one certainly did to me.".

Thats exactly what it was about.A man trying to hold on to his son before the streets swallow him up.From the time Cologero saw Sonny murder a man in front of his house this 9 year old was consumed with the idea of Not Being a RatRemember he told his father I didn't rat dad! I didn't rat...and his father saysNo son you didn't ratYou Just did a Good Thing for a Bad Man.Everything his father would tell him would always come back to mind sooner or later.Even as he got olderyou could still see the struggle his father was going through just to keep his son on the right path..At the end when Sonny got killed Who was there ...his dad. The line I liked was I never hated Sonny I just didn't like the fact that he was making you grow up so fast.This movie was truly brilliant.I would suggest if you haven't seen it ..Check it out".

But this is the first one I have seen to actually make him somewhat of a saint. SonnyPalminteri is the example of a split personality with a criminal. He is very tough with a community that he loves and basically runs but is also very protective and guiding to many people. I found this to be quite interesting in this type of genre.Robert De Niro's character on the other hand is very bold. He plays the father who is concerned with his son's well being and is just your normal flat character. He was unimpressive but effective for a movie that was by no means perfect in the first place.The idea of this movie was what made it so intriguing. At two hours long it consists of a large epic story of a young man trying to make it through a part of New York. Some important events were perhaps too close together but it was still entertaining and quite moving. Overall A Bronx Tale is a fine experience of cinema with a wonderful story.I highly recommend this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here is a realisticlooking and an involving story of the street life in New York City's Bronx section in the 1950s and 1960s. Excellent acting and a good job of recreating the era and site's atmosphere are main things going for this film. Also the soundtrack is very very good. The main problem I have with the film is the fact that a coldblooded killer is made to be the hero  a guy that you root for! Unbelievable. Playing that killer is Chazz Palminteri who outperforms the more famous and great actor and costar Robert De Niro. Actually the costar is Lilo Brancoto who was recently in the news for allegedly committing a major crime himself.Anyway supposedly this is Palminteri's story of his childhood and features him as a young boy and then as a 17yearold. He has a straight father De Niro but looks up to the area's Mafia leader Sonny Palminteri who takes the kid under his wing for not ratting on him when he witnessed him killing someone.It may have a bad message and gives a couple shots at the Catholic Church along the way but the characters and the story keeps one tuned to the screen for the full two hours. It was good to see De Niro play the honest hardworking bus driver who wants his kid to have character and not emulate the local hoods.This is a not a movie for those who wince at the fword because it's used frequently. This is more of man's movie really with males dominating and some good advice on dating and what to look for in women! Sonny despite being a killer is shown to be a caring compassionate guy who cares about young Calogero Brancoto and earlier as a 9yearold played by Francis Capra.There are so many mixed messages in here  good and bad  it would make your head swim but it is a crime film very much worth investigating.".

The script of the movie which is a mix between a gangster story and a drama is unique and the actors are splendid. It's nice to see Robert De Niro starring in a gangster movie without being one of the gangsters himself. The movie is cool emotional and has a deeper morally message at the same time which is why the movie is still printed in my mind today two years since I saw it the last time. a one of a kind movie which I will not hesitate to salute with a maximum score of 10! Do yourself a favor see this movie today!".

	schema:reviewBody "For much of A Bronx Tale firsttime director Robert De Niro seems to be aping his friendcollaborator Martin Scorsese's directorial style with the period soundtrack and gritty depiction of the mean streets of New York City. But A Bronx Tale is more than that. It isn't as flashy as Goodfellas or Casino but is indeed a rather realistic and true picture. While not a great film A Bronx Tale is still a worthwhile effort from De Niro.The plot involves Calergo C Anello Francis CapraLillo Brancato the son of an Italian bus driver Lorenzo De Niro who grows up in the mean streets of the Bronx in the 1960s when blacks are moving into the neighborhood causing inevitable ethnic tension with its primarily Italian residents. Anello finds himself being metaphorically seduced by Sonny Chazz Palmenteri who cowrote the movie based on his own experiences a big shot gangster who seems to represent a glorious exciting way of life. After C watches Anello shoot a man to death but refuses to identify Sonny as the killer he becomes sort of a gofer for the gang a la Henry Hill in Goodfellas. Eventually Sonny and Lorenzo come to blows over C's future while C falls in love with a black girl Taral Hicks which doesn't square well with the activities of his bigoted friends.The plot may seem a bit cluttered written down but it all flows together really well. The movie does play sort of like Goodfellaslite and one can't help but think that De Niro is trying to replicate Scorsese's directorial style. The racial angle which may sound a bit out of place in a gangster flick is worked into the main plot very well. The movie contains some powerfully directed scenes  particularly the unforgettable in the worst way sequence where C's friends attack a group of helpless black bikers whose only crime is riding through the Italian section of town.The acting is very good though that's to be expected. De Niro gives a very understated performance as Lorenzo a working class guy who honestly believes that it's better to be a hardworking nobody than a successful gangster. However kudos to Chazz Palmenteri for making his Sonny a likable character who while a gangster tries his hardest to keep C from getting into serious trouble or even into the gang. Most writersdirectors would've made Sonny a violent psychotic and put him into a goodversusevil tugofwar with Lorenzo over Calergo's soul but Sonny is a genuinely nice guy though a bit rough around the edges and Palmenteri delivers a knockout performance. Capra and Brancanto both do nice work as well. The rest of the cast is mostly a group of relative unknowns though De Niro regulars Joe Pesci and Clem Caserta pop up briefly but their performances  particularly Hicks as Calergo's love interest  are still solid.Overall A Bronx Tale is not a great or classic film but it's memorable in its own right and does a great job of delivering its message of rightversuswrong racial discrimination and the daily life on the streets. Don't expect a Godfathercaliber film but if you want a wellmade and entertaining gangster pic by the greatest gangster actor of all time albeit playing a nongangster than take a chance with this film. You probably won't be disappointed. 710".

At the same time Colgero falls in love with a woman a young black girl at his high school where interracial relationships is consider a nono to both the black community and the Italian neighborhood. It doesn't bother Colgero one bit while asking both his father and idol for advice where he's growing up to be a man.A Bronx Tale is not only a life lesson movie but a coming of age story where not only does Colgero witness everything in front of him from death to prejudice but it's about how two men from separate worlds want the best for this kid.".

As an average movie watcher this is one of the most emotional movies I have watched.What sticks out for me is the amazing soundtrack which can really capture the emotion of the scenes and what I think is an excellent performance by Chazz Palminteri Robert De Niro and Lillo Brancato. I wouldn't agree with people expecting it to be another Goodfellas or Godfather cause this movie is in a category of its own. It is an excellent coming of age story and you really feel as though you grow up with CalogeroLillo Brancato and there is a strong emotional connection to the characters Sonny a crime boss who takes Calogero under his wingChazz Palminteri and Lorenzo Calogero's fatherRobert De Niro. Now I wouldn't consider this a spoiler but the ending is probably the most emotional ending I have seen and it left me so proud of the movie that it motivated me to write this review My first review. I highly recommend this movie to everyone whether or not you love gangster films because I really feel as though it is a gangster movie the plot involves more of the coming of age of Lillo Brancato's character and less of the gangster aspect of the story. From what I understand there is also a Broadway play and I would expect that to be golden as well but overall PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE it is that good. There are tons of amazing quotes and scenes and this movie leaves you with a deep lesson which I really didn't experience in Godfather or Goodfellas but I still consider those movies to be top notch. For this I applaud Robert De Niro and Chazz Palminteri and all the actors involved with this picture and I hope that more people see this movie and really appreciate it.".

I really had no idea what to expect. Unlike the Godfather Trilogy which show you the intricate interworkings of the mafia this movie is really an introductory to mafia life  Mafia 101 if you'd like. It's seen though the eyes of a young Italian boy named Calogero. Not to repeat what's been said in every other review but Calogero lives in Little Italy New York. His neighborhood is a hangout for the mafia headed by a man named Sonny.   One day Calogero witnesses a shooting by Sonny but refuses to turn him into the police. I particularly liked the scene where the boy was brought to look at a lineup of hoodlums to pick out who the shooter was. When he came to Sonny there was a long gaze between Calogero and the mafia king. But the boy didn't turn him in. After that Sonny befriended the boy  and became a second father. Through the years there was a battle between Sonny  Calagero's real father played amazingly by Robert DeNiro. Of course the father didn't want Calogero hanging out with those types of people. A side story involved the battle between black  white neighborhoods  and Calogero falling in love with a black girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Personally I thought this girl Jean could've been more likeable. She didn't seem like anyone you would risk your life to walk home.This movie has a surprising  sad ending  which I won't tell you in case you haven't seen it. All things considered this was one of the best movies I've seen. Definitely one that I could watch over  over again. And a definite must for my video collection.".

The fact that this was his screenplay it was evident that he poured his heart into the role and he was thoroughly believable as the neighborhood boss Sonny. Nuances are very important in a film and DeNiro manages to capture the turbulent 60s perfectly. One particular scene is especially memorable. In the first conversation between the teenage Colagero and Jane  when he's walking her home from school  I'm not sure if the actors were allowed to adlib but the dialogue was perfect because it epitomized the awkward interaction of young love. Aside from that the movie is honest about gangster life racism and loyalty. The movie isn't preachy and it doesn't have the feelgood ending of an afterschool special. What it does is show that even the worse people have good in them and that our choices are what ultimately decide our fate. A film with very few flaws.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think this is a great coming of age movie because of its heart. The soundtrack is very good and De Niro was obviously watching all the great directors he's worked with over the years as his direction is stong especially for a first time director. The dynamic between the three main characters is an interesting one and it is good to see that they did not just settle for Gangster bad parent good as both these men are father figures for the main character and both give good and bad points of view. The film at the end of the day is about the decisions you make and C learns the lesson that both men try and teach him in thier own ways. If you apreciate good films then you should like this movie and although for some viewers it may not contain enough violence and swearing for their liking I think its a wonderful film that doesn't need these elements to make its point and so wisely keeps it cool. I love De Niro's use of slow motion in some of the sequences as well as his use of music. Check it out.".

	schema:headline " Excellent Drama About Morals";
	schema:reviewBody "A Bronx Tale 1993  out of 4Magnificent story about a young man Lillo Brancato growing up in the Bronx and being confused about life as most kids are. Growing up he had his hard working father Robert DeNiro preaching about keeping a clean life while he also got advice from a wise guy Chazz Palminteri from the neighborhood.A BRONX TALE is without question one of the greatest films of the decade and I think it also contains one of the greatest screenplays ever written. I remember when the film was released it got a lot of very good reviews but several people claimed that it didn't stack up to the type of films that influenced it. Of course with DeNiro directing it a lot of people compared it to the work of Scorsese and I think that's unfair because this wasn't meant to be a Scorsese film. There are obviously influences here but I think this film holds up very well on its own and its message of morals and consequences is something very few films has mastered like this one.I will openly say that this is a film that I really love because the setup is just so perfect. You've got a middle class father who has a set of morals that has him hating the gangster who has attached himself to his son. You've got a gangster with a different set of morals who believes that working people are stiffs. Both men have their own set of rules and they both love this young kid and want to see him succeed even if their advice often isn't something the other agrees with. The screenplay by Palminteri is perfect in so many ways as it really is a great comingofage story and it also has some terrific life lessons. I was thirteen when I first watched this movie and its message hit me then and it hits me even harder today now that I have my own kids.The setting is really remarkable and I think DeNiro did a terrific job at capturing an era that he grew up in. Obviously he knew a lot about it and it translates perfectly to the screen. The music selections something I'm going to guess was inspired by Scorsese are also wonderfully done. The film has a very good flow to it and I thought the director did an excellent job at keeping the film moving. He certainly helps bring these characters off the page and we're given some very memorable and powerful scenes. One of the strongest is the first time the father confronts the gangster.The performances are certainly terrific with Palminteri stealing the film as the wise gangster. I really thought the actor did a remarkable job with the part and especially the laid back approach. Brancato is also extremely good as the older kid and Francis Capra also deserves credit playing the younger kid. Then there's DeNiro who is usually playing the gangsters but here he's given the role of the father. It's pretty much a supporting part but the actor turns in another terrific performance and there's a lot of heart in the part.A BRONX TALE works on so many levels and it's really too bad so many people has overlooked the film. Those who know the film love it and I think if more people would give it a shot even more would love it.".

	schema:headline " My ALL TIME favorite crime genre film  Unbelievably an epic picture";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a lifetime fan of the gangster genre' and there are very few titles I have not yet seen but if I could only own one gangster movie without doubt that title would have to be A Bronx Tale. A Bronx Tale is sheer genius screen writing by Chazz Palminteri who also plays one of the three starring roles in the movie and it is based on Chazz's real life experiences as a young man growing up in the Bronx. Chazz plays Sonny LoSpecchio the leader of the local gang who is feared by all the neighbourhood. One exception in the neighbourhood who refuses to live in fear is a Bronx bus driver named Lorenzo Anello played by Robert De Niro. Lorenzo and his strongly opinionated wife Rosina played brilliantly by Katherine Narducci are the parents of a son named Calogero.We first get to know the young Calogero at the age of 9 years as an industrious hustler who likes the action of the gambling scene run by Sonny LoSpecchio. Sonny immediately forms a special bond with the young Calogero and nicknames him C. This bond is so strong and public that the young C is treated like royalty by the neighbourhood store vendors who live in fear of Sonny. This special bond between the gangster Sonny and the 9 year old C causes grave concern for C's father Lorenzo. Tempers flare between father Lorenzo and mob boss Sonny over Sonny's mentoring of young Calogero. Somehow the father and gangster learn to respect each other's position with the upbringing of C and over the next decade we watch as C grows in to a young man loving both his father Lorenzo and his mentor Sonny and of course C had a love interest. The movie takes place in the 1960's when racism was very much an issue and C's love interest only adds to the parents worries as C's girlfriend is a very pretty and bright black woman named Jane Williams played by Taral Hicks. There are so many interesting stories and characters to follow in A Bronx Tale so much so that I rate the movie above The Godfather. I even thought the musical score was fantastic. There is one particular scene in the movie when a gang of bikers decide to take up residence in Sonny's bar. Sonny remains polite to the biker's leader but when challenged Sonny turns the tables on the feared bikers with one statement which sent chills down my spine when he said to the biker leader well now you can't leave....and he locks the front door. It is a chilling scene that wreaks of the don't mess with me mob mentality. It is the type of movie that you just do not want to stop watching until the very end. Even after the movie ended now twenty years later I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd.This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century. Chazz Palminteri originally wrote the story as a one man play. In 2013 Chazz brought his one man live show to Toronto and my wife and I were lucky enough to purchase tickets to see Chazz in person act out all of the main characters that were in the film version. Wow Chazz is very talented and passionate with the characters he portrays. If you have never seen this film you are missing one of the top 100 films of all time. As for his live one man play even if you have to travel to see Chazz on the stage go see it as it is worth any price to witness Mr. Palminteri live and in person portray the many characters of A Bronx Tale. I give it a perfect 10 out of 10 rating.".

The movie doesn't have much of a plot and more of it takes place in Casablanca than in Bangkok or the Orient so both the English and Italian titles are pretty inaccurate. For the record Emanuelle has sex with an archaeologist played by Gemser's reallife husband Gabrielle Tinti a female Thai masseuse a male Thai bellboy some swinging American Republicans Ivan Rassimov and the lovely Ely Galeani the entire strangely allEuropean contingent of the Thai king's bodyguards a Thai customs official after her passport is stolen the Republican wife again in an airplane bathroom the archaeologist and his new fiance the fiance again along with a black dancer and an entire horde of horsebackriding Arabs and finally the lesbian daughter of the American consul in Casablanca Debra Berger.Most of these sex scenes are all pretty truncated which may frustrate the hairypalmed viewers out there but the movies probably would have been six hours long otherwise. There's also a lack of the depravity we've come to expect from D'Amato aside from an obviously unstaged snakemongoose fight and the scene where Emanuelle is gangraped by the king's bodyguards which she either enjoys or doesn't mind too much since she later takes her lover's fiance off to dance naked in an Arab tent and get gangbanged again. These scenes though are really no different than the African village scene or the literaltrain scene in the first Black Emanuelle and they take place mostly offscreen anyway.Still the girls are very pretty the cinematography and natural scenery are appealing the music ranges from execrable to enjoyably cheesy. And this is now paired with two slightly better Black Emanuelle movies in the new Black Emanuelle's Box DVD set so check it out for yourself.".

Quite logical since the titles on his repertoire go from nauseating horror films Anthropophagous Beyond the Darkness to hardcore porno flicks Tarzan X and sometimes even a combination of both Erotic Nights of the Living Dead Porno Holocaust. D'Amato pretty much behaves himself here and follows the formula of the original Black Emanuelle film released one year before but that doesn't mean avid D'Amatofans have to worry as there still is an enormous amount of genuine sleaze to enjoy. Emanuelle in Bangkok has virtually no plot at all and you can't even fully believe the title as our sexy protagonist's journey to the Far East is very brief and she only has contact with two Asian people a masseuse and a bellboy. The film most crucial sequences are set on a cruise ship and in Morocco where she has an offon relationship with a persistent archaeologist. I have no complaints though since the camera beautifully captures Laura Gemser's erotic adventures with men women couples and herself. Joe D'Amato's trademarks are bizarrely tinted sexual situations and there's only one such sequence in this film namely the Japanese stripper who puts pingpong balls up her vagina. Weird One aspect about Emanuelle in Bangkok as well as in the entire cycle is downright brilliant and that's the music. Nico Fidenco's score is mesmerizing and without exaggerating at least ten times better than every other score that ever won an Oscar. The dazzling soundtrack alone makes Emanuelle in Bangkok a true cult classic that every fan of the genre will enjoy watching.".

Laura Gemser stars in her second foray as Black Emanuelle this time heading off to Bangkok for more sexual and social exploration hopping from one adventure to another and one person to another but remaining rather tame in the pornographic sense. If that's your game just go rent a porn. But if you are looking for a softcore adventure with plenty of carefree mentality this is it. Joe D'Amato pleases the eyes with stunning cinematography and lush tropical locales. But surpassing even all these merits is the mesmerizingly beautiful score from Nico Fidenco  it is absolutely breathtaking and makes all the images on screen melt together with the music for a rare cinematic experience. Well done!".

If that's your game just go rent a porn. But if you are looking for a softcore adventure with plenty of carefree mentality this is it. Joe D'Amato pleases the eyes with stunning cinematography and lush tropical locales. But surpassing even all these merits is the mesmerizingly beautiful score from Nico Fidenco  it is absolutely breathtaking and makes all the images on screen melt together with the music for a rare cinematic experience. Well done!";

Or maybe a toothpaste commercial its stuck in my head now and fortunately for my sanity its not bad. I'd whistle it for you if I could and can't help but wonder if that's Alessandro Alessandroni doing his trademark thing there. He's the guy whistling on the old spaghetti western soundtracks proof once again that while often derivative the Italians managed to create some new forms. The movies may often be cheap  boring but they almost always have great musical scores.I would paint this one into the same category. It looks pretty much like Joe D'amato took a sprawling vacation with some of his favorite stock players Laura Gemser her husband Gabrielle Tinti a couple of Italian genre cinema leading males he maybe owed a favor to Ivan Rassimov  my hero Giacomo RossiStuart and a few sexy Euro body babes with no problems with nudity group groping and the occasional half naked lesbian makeout with Ms. Gemser Ely Galleani Debra Berger Gaby Bourgois. He brought along a camera maybe a mistress to hold the scripts while somebody made sure there was enough light and went about their touristy ways while filming a scene or two here  there as they traveled about.Two scenes sort of spoil the fun first another barbaric episode of Italian filmmakers using animal violence to fill some screen time then an inexplicable sequence where Ms. Gemser is sexually assaulted by a mob of greaseballs who make a point to humiliate her while getting their jollies off. Inexplicable because afterward she seems quite at ease with herself and chats pleasantly with her attackers as if they had just met at a diner. Then again its all just a silly phallocentric fantasy really about guys with unlimited means traveling exotic lands in the company of attractive women in their 20s whom they have random sex with often playing erotic group games for grown ups  swapping partners though the version I saw was strictly a softcore engagement. The most arousing display being a scene where the girls all get up strip down to their panties and dance like a harem for an Arabian prince.Or something like that to tell the truth I was hardly paying attention to the story and frankly couldn't care less. Like a spaghetti western you watch stuff like this for the individual moments rather than the cumulative effect and most of it passed quite pleasantly with the occasional raised eyebrow. Like the scene were Emanuelle entertains a crowd in a private club by dripping hot candle wax all over her magnificent nude body. For all we know and given the way Joe D'amato worked the whole film might have been just an excuse to put that up on the screen. It may not pass as entertainment for some but for those two minutes this movie was the only thing I was thinking about.410".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Black Emanuelle collaboration between Laura Gemser and her Svengali Joe D'Amato is merely a taste of the shocking things to come in the likes of Emanuelle in America and Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals. Emanuelle in Bangkok is a kind of dry run with Gemser repeating her Black Emanuelle character from the first nonD'amato film and D'amato finding his feet with this new character and genre he's lucked onto.Yet there are signs of things to come. The bulk of the film is sexual travelogue with Emanuelle exploring Bangkok and then Casablanca sightseeing and shagging  but some of the sights she sees are not quite what they recommend in the Visitor's Guide to Bangkok a cockfight a snake loosing a bloody battle with a mongoose a dancer who has a speciality act with pingpong balls  guess where and the sex becomes dangerous as Emanuelle is gang raped by a battalion of the king's bodyguards. This last scene is the film's most contentious as Emanuelle lies back thinks of previous exhortations to use her body for her own pleasure and ends up on friendly terms with her assailants. The scene could be seen as the first real throwing down of the gauntlet by D'amato in an Emanuelle film with the heroine taken into places she and we never imagined by her post60s free love philosophising and also there's the curious effect of Gemser's performance or rather lack of one. She walks through the entire film as if sleepwalking greeting all things good or bad with the same blank affectless nonchalance a kind of erotic robot either without emotions or with them so deeply suppressed as to suggest some past trauma. There's something about D'Amato's vision of Emanuelle which is both a lure and a fright as we're compelled by her freedom as much as appalled by her lack of passionate engagement with well anything including sex where she invariably just goes through the motions.My suspicion is that D'Amato had very conflicted feelings about the sexual freedoms which arose in the post60s consumer West a fear and fascination that sex can lead not to ecstasy and freedom by dehumanisation and death. It is no mistake that he cuts from Prince Sanit's sexual philosophising about giving yourself over to pleasure to the death of the snake at the claws and teeth of the mongoose the petit mort alluded to by the cutting.Emanuelle in Bangkok also works as a kind of satirical critique of consumer tourism with exotic backdrops being used as a sexfilled break as so many Westerners have used the real Bangkok yet the real world of politics and human jealousy keeps interrupting exposing Emanuelle's travels as the banal escapism they really are. The plot like homeless and rootless modern man lurches from one country to the next one meaningless encounter to another one shortlived and doomed relationship to its successor and it is in this much criticised plotlessness that the film makes its point. D'amato frames the story with two episodes from the relationship between Emanuelle and her erstwhile lover Roberto played by Gemser's reallife husband Gabriele Tinti the first setting out the plan to enjoy each other for the time being but not get bogged down in ideas of fidelity and love the last showing their dream ruined by his foulmouthed jealous homophobia about her love for a young female artist the idea seems to be that Emanuelle cannot escape from the old ways of possessiveness male chauvinism and all that messy stuff but she'll wander on regardless. What we are meant to make of all this D'Amato like a true democrat leaves entirely up to us".

Yep that's all there is to it.Gabriele Tinti actually comes off best and the sex scenes between he and Laura Gemser are quite nice. I was confused by Emanuelle's struggle with her lesbian feelings for Debra Berger's character. I remember seeing her have sex with two women in the last film.Ely Galleani is her usual smiling self I've never seen her not smile in a film and Ivan Rassimov has those sexy eyes and of course Laura Gemser is gorgeous as ever but this film is just kinda a timepasser. Now the series would reach it's pinnacle soon with Emanuelle Around the World but that's another story...EDIT June 2007 On reflection having seen this film again after several years I have to admit that I have a new appreciation for how the romance between Emanuelle and Debra was handled. It's really quite sweet. Emanuelle's struggle isn't with feeling attracted to a woman but feeling stronger emotions thus she flees India back to her old ways. If you watch their scenes in Italian with the English subs on on the Severin DVD release the dialogue between Emanuelle and Debra is a bit different and more moving. It makes the bathtub scene much more significant rather than just a random moment of titillation as it appears in the English dub.".

	schema:reviewBody "To say that this movie is disappointing would be the understatement of the year. It is truly one of the most unenjoyable movies I have ever seen and I'm a big Laura Gemser fan. I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane or Apocalypse Now...1. This movie lacks coherence which I blame on the producers and the editors. It jumps all around and doesn't make much sense. For example Emmanuelle is having sex with the prince after having smoked some opium God I wish it was that easy... and then they cut to her going to take pictures of some mongoose cobra fight which has no purpose other than gratuitous violence as the mongoose rips the eyes out of the cobra with his teeth. After this she is back in her room taking off her top with no continuity no explanation. It's like they had this footage of the animal fight and they had to stick it in somewhere. It just doesn't add anything to the movie. It comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere.2. The MUSIC IS HORRIBLE! It isn't just bad annoying and totally incongruous it's totally WRONG beyond wrong. It's the kind of music they would play in the 60's or 70's while a mime and a clown interact on the streets of Paris. The only problem is this movie isn't set in Europe it's set in exotic Asia featuring exotic looking Laura Gemser. The music is unforgivable.3. THE MOVIE IS NOT EROTIC!! When I watch an Emmanuelle film I want to see gorgeous Laura naked and having sex long enough so that my eyes can focus on the action. The sex scenes here are a jumbled mess with too many cut aways from the good stuff. There's no flow and these scenes are very short. By the time I see Laura's beautiful naked breasts they've already cut away to some guy's face or a trip to take some pictures. The strip sequence in the Bedouin tent is a perfect example.I think the thing that angers me the most about this film is the lost potential. They had a great asset in Laura Gemser and totally frittered it away. I've been watching all of Laura's films chronologically and this has been the worst so far.".

As for the rest of the film it's amazing that D'Amato would make so many softcore and hardcore adult films this one is soft and yet never manage to capture anything remotely erotic ala other directors in the field like Franco and Rollin. Gemser is a hot piece of ass but D'Amato does nothing with that beauty and the nonerotic moments is what really kills this thing. The so called story is boring enough and while there's plenty of sex and nudity this too gets boring after a while. This film was followed by Emanuelle in America which also features Pedro the horse.

	schema:reviewBody "No one has commented that Dante's Inferno starring Spencer Tracy was clearly based on a true story.In the main part of the 1935 movie Tracy plays an unscrupulous amusement park owner who decides his next attraction will be a trip through Hell called Dante's Inferno. In his usual cornercutting manner fire protection measures are shortchanged with the inevitable result that there is a disastrous fire. Following this is a dream sequence in which Dante's vision of Hell is reenacted and Tracy is appropriately punished. Finally there is an ending that I won't reveal.The nonfantasy part of the story is strikingly similar to an actual highly publicized event that took place about 20 years earlier than the conception of the movie. At that time Coney Island which is part of Brooklyn itself part of New York City was the premier amusement park area of the world. There were two parks Steeplechase which emphasized fun and sex and Luna Park which emphasized art and youth. William H. Reynolds an underhanded real estate developer and former Republican state senator was attracted by the profits and decided to create a third giant park. He called his Dreamland.Following his typical pattern Reynolds through his ties to the corrupt Tammany Democratic political machine was able to have streets closed to make some inexpensive land suitable for a large amusement park. This deprived poor people of access to the beach but so what? Patrons of his park and of luxury hotels had no problem.Oddly his concept despite the usual sleazy attractions also had morality even religiosity as a major theme. It started off with an attraction called Genesis the Bible story of the creation of the world. There was another called Destruction of Pompeii presumably as payment for wickedness. His crowning effort along this line was called Hell Gate a fantasy ride through Hell with a gigantic Satan smirking over the entrance. In the early hours of May 27 1911 as they rushed to ready the attraction for the Spring opening workers accidentally started a fire. Firefighters responded but because of low water pressure for which many also blamed Reynolds' machinations could not prevent its spread and all of Dreamland including Hell Gate was destroyed. Don't you agree that the inspiration if not the actual plot of the movie Dante's Inferno was drawn from real life? And isn't it amusing that considering his behavior Reynolds was so preoccupied with morality and retribution?Incidentally I saw this film when I was 15 and it scared me silly.".

In his usual cornercutting manner fire protection measures are shortchanged with the inevitable result that there is a disastrous fire. Following this is a dream sequence in which Dante's vision of Hell is reenacted and Tracy is appropriately punished. Finally there is an ending that I won't reveal.The nonfantasy part of the story is strikingly similar to an actual highly publicized event that took place about 20 years earlier than the conception of the movie. At that time Coney Island which is part of Brooklyn itself part of New York City was the premier amusement park area of the world. There were two parks Steeplechase which emphasized fun and sex and Luna Park which emphasized art and youth. William H. Reynolds an underhanded real estate developer and former Republican state senator was attracted by the profits and decided to create a third giant park. He called his Dreamland.Following his typical pattern Reynolds through his ties to the corrupt Tammany Democratic political machine was able to have streets closed to make some inexpensive land suitable for a large amusement park. This deprived poor people of access to the beach but so what? Patrons of his park and of luxury hotels had no problem.Oddly his concept despite the usual sleazy attractions also had morality even religiosity as a major theme. It started off with an attraction called Genesis the Bible story of the creation of the world. There was another called Destruction of Pompeii presumably as payment for wickedness. His crowning effort along this line was called Hell Gate a fantasy ride through Hell with a gigantic Satan smirking over the entrance. In the early hours of May 27 1911 as they rushed to ready the attraction for the Spring opening workers accidentally started a fire. Firefighters responded but because of low water pressure for which many also blamed Reynolds' machinations could not prevent its spread and all of Dreamland including Hell Gate was destroyed. Don't you agree that the inspiration if not the actual plot of the movie Dante's Inferno was drawn from real life? And isn't it amusing that considering his behavior Reynolds was so preoccupied with morality and retribution?Incidentally I saw this film when I was 15 and it scared me silly.";

Eventually he gets a glimpse of Hell and sees the error of his ways ... but is it too late for him to repair all the damage he's done to other people's lives?This film was inspired by but is not a remake of a 1924 film with the same title both films have the same premise but very different plotlines.We first see Tracy's character Jim Carter on the bottom rung the Depression is on and Carter is so desperate he takes a job as a blackface performer. Then he gets a job in a carnival attraction which offers the customers a quick ride through Hell made of papiermache.There's a brilliant performance by Alan Dinehart one of those great supporting actors from Hollywood's golden age. Dinehart specialised in playing sharp guys on the edge of the law or slightly beyond it and this is one of Dinehart's best roles. Henry Walthall the silentfilm star is also excellent here.The standout sequence in the film begins when Tracy is in hospital recovering from injuries. Walthall brings him a copy of Dante's Inferno and proceeds to describe the horrible fates awaiting sinners in the afterworld. On screen we see a series of stark tableaux in which naked men and women suffer eternal torments in Hell ... dodging flames writhing in chains turning into trees. For some reason all the naked people in Hell have gorgeous physiques apparently Hell doesn't take any chubsters.Dante's Inferno is often mentioned by Rita Hayworth fans because this movie includes one of her very earliest film roles. She was still performing as Margarita Cansino her original name. HayworthCansino appears very briefly as a ballroom dancer aboard Tracy's gambling ship. This is a standout film but if you think it's a Rita Hayworth movie you'll be disappointed.I strongly recommend Dante's Inferno.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is no denying that Dante Alighieri is not only a major literary figure of Italy's Renaissance but one of the world's greatest poets.  Actually he left many poems in his works especially regarding the forbidden love of his life Beatrice but the poem most associated with him is a 33 canto poem entitled INFERNO.  Most people don't realize it is actually the first third of a larger book of poetry called THE DIVINE COMEDY.  Dante wrote three sections of this book in which he a traveller is escorted by the ghost of the Latin poet Virgil through the nine levels of Hell then into purgatory and finally into paradise.  The conclusion of the poem is when Dante is able to see the grandeur and beauty of God's love which is the ultimate position at the top of the universe's order.  Although Purgatory and Paradise have moments of exceptional power in them they are less exciting than the human tragedies that make up the cantos of The INFERNO.  What story about redemption or love can compete with the hideous doom of Count Ugolino of Pisa and his children condemned to starve to death by a political enemy Ugolino had betrayed the enemy once a friend of his.  The punishment is very gruesome  Ugolino is forever hungry for his crimes and is gnawing at the brain of his political foe forever as a result.Nothing quite that gaudy here  The central figure Tracy begins as a stoker but slowely rises in the world frequently not realizing that his greed and drive have alienated friends and relatives.  The source of his wealth is the carnival and gambling empire he has put together.  In the course of building it he meets Henry Walthall who wants to build a midway building that shows Dante's Inferno  Walthall believes it will be beneficial to the public as it will show the public the dangerous ice they are on if they continue to sin.  Of course this is the screenwriter's take on Dante's Divine Comedy and the Inferno in particular  actually Dante is far too clever a poet to have such a trivial motive in the actual work for writing it that way.  That Tracy is saved in the end is due to heeding the wisdom of his friend later his fatherinlawand due to a sea tragedy  Tracy's latest addition to his empire is a gambling ship which catches fire off the coast of the U.S. and requires Tracy's leadership qualities to save the passengers and crew.  A suitable fiery conclusion to the film  and also an historic footnote the boat is made to resemble the illfated Morro Castle which burned in a fire in 1934 the year before this film off the coast of New Jersey killing 130 passengers and crew.  As such this is the sole movie I know of that refers to that disaster except for a line of dialogue in the contemporary satiric comedy BOY MEETS GIRL.".

All preZanuck Fox films have a rustic quality to them the reason being that Fox catered to rural audiences and so their warnings of the sins of big city life and straying from the teachings of the good book were never subtle and this movie is no exception. So if this one at first comes across like DeMille meets Indiana cut it some slack.Tracy plays conman Jim Carter who stokes coal to earn his way home where ultimately the only job he can get is being the target in a carnival game. He loses that job like he loses so many and in the aftermath meets the reverendlike Pop McWade Henry B. Walthall. Pop gives Jim a job and says it is better to give than receive but Jim has a point when he realizes you need to have something first if you want to give anything away. And that's a problem for Pop because his lowkey sermon like deliveries when advertising his carnival attraction themed after Dante's Inferno are not getting many takers. Thus Jim jazzes up the carnival barking and pop's revenues increase. Jim falls for Pop's daughter Betty Claire Trevor and the two are married and have a son.All is calm on the domestic front but apparently Pop might as well be talking to himself when it comes to Jim's business morals. Jim ultimately builds an entertainment empire by driving people out of business by threatening building inspectors and bribing them and there is more than one suicide caused by his ruthless ways yet he never repents  that is until his high seas gambling ship catches fire with his small son aboard.The one sin Jim never commits is disloyalty to either his wife or father in law. Pop is too good to be true in how he repeatedly forgives and patiently waits for Jim to have an epiphany and his wife is just plain blind to the truth  for awhile anyways.If Pop's talk of hell isn't enough to get the viewer's attention there is actually what some call a dream sequence of hell in the middle of the film as Pop goes through Dante's Inferno and describes hell to Jim via a sequence that is supposedly from a silent film Fox had made ten years before. It's a long scene of innumerable people suffering in hell and strangely enough since this was made after the production code took effect there is quite a bit of nudity shown.Watch this one for its odd plot for some pretty good action scenes its strange dance of the condemned in the hell sequence and for a 16 year old Rita Hayworth seventh billed in the ending credits as Rita Cansino in a spectacular Latin dance. She sets the screen on fire  almost literally. The one bad thing I could say was that there was no perceivable chemistry between Tracy and Claire Trevor. I like both performers and normally Tracy sparkled with almost all of his leading ladies but here it's like they're practically reading their lines to each other. I just don't feel it. It's one of the few times you'll actually catch Spencer Tracy acting  which is one thing he said an actor should never let the audience do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dante's Inferno 1935  out of 4 Impressive drama about a con man Spencer Tracy who gets a job at a carnival when an elderly man Henry B. Walthall hires him as a barker. The two men create the Dante's Inferno show which Walthall uses to warn people but Tracy sees it as a way to get rich. Soon he will stop at nothing for the all mighty dollar but this will soon backfire when his wife Claire Trevor has to betray her own morals for him. There are a few faults in the film but overall this is a pretty strong little gem that contains three great sequences that make it a must see. The first one is the carnival attraction that has some rather amazing sets and terrific visuals. Another brilliant scene is the ending with a large ship catching fire. The third masterful touch is a famous sequence of Hell where we get to see thousands of people burning for eternity. All three of these scenes contain some thrilling entertainment and especially the sequence in Hell. I was really surprised to see how graphic some of these scenes where considering the Hayes Office was coming down on this type of thing. I also could have sworn there were a couple nude shots during this sequence but it was somewhat hard to tell. Another reason to watch this film are for the performances with Tracy delivering once again. The most impressive thing is that Tracy is so good at playing cold that you can't help but fall for everything he does in the film. He gets to show off a nicer side as well and he perfectly blends the two depending on the scene in question. Trevor is also in fine form as his wife and she gets some pretty good moments early on as her good ways must be thrown out the window in order to save her husband. Walthall turns in one of the best performances I've seen from him in the sound era and he actually steals the film from everyone. He's tour of Dante's Inferno is very good as is another sequence where he first meets Tracy's character. Rita Hayworth shows up at the end as a dancer so keep your eyes open for her. The film's major fault is that it gets too preachy at times and I think it goes a tad bit over the top in regards to some of the deeds that Tracy does. I think the film could have done without Hayworth's dance sequence as well as it really feels out of place with the rest of the film. And if you're keeping track with how many Alist Hollywood stars who appeared in blackface at some point in their career then you can add Tracy.".

You might say all hell breaks loose on board. Spencer Tracy strongly disavowed his work on this movie but in actuality it's one of his better roles in the 1930s. Tracy plays a carnival barker who works his way up the ladder of success until he's the head of several lucrative enterprises. His first claim to fame is the establishment of Dante's Inferno as the leading attraction at an eastern city most likely NYC amusement park. There he meets his future wife Claire Trevor and her uncle Henry Walthall who is the attraction's proprietor and main creative force. Tracy soon builds up Walthall's modest carnival concession into something out of this world and it becomes the hit of the boardwalk. It also becomes an unsafe structure that causes death and destruction. The movie follows Tracy's rise and fall in the business world and he pretty much ends up exactly where he came from at the bottom. Luckily for him Ms. Trevor is never far away to give him the love and encouragement that he really doesn't deserve. Old Walthall does his best to give Tracy some much needed advice about the wages of sin and immorality but it falls on deaf ears. Tracy ends up in his own private hell but he's given an unnecessary reprieve in the final reel along with a hokey ending. This is one of those films that could stand a good remake and an updating to the modern era. Dante's version of hell might be something that could attract some presentday director into developing his own interpretation.".

	schema:headline " I disagree  a really good film that is different";
	schema:reviewBody "As I was reading the new biography on Spencer Tracy  which incidentally is the definitive one to be produced  the section about this film filmed when he was transitioning from 20th Century Fox to MGM was quite negative so I expected a real lemon. At first I could only find it on You Tube divided up into several sections but complete and a surprisingly good print. In October 2012 it became available on TCM with again an excellent print. And now it is out on DVD!What a surprise I think it's a terrific movie particularly for 1935 and I would have to say that it's Tracy's best film in the preMGM period. Tracy's acting here is very smooth and convincing as a man who becomes a carnival barker you actually get to see him in black face! but then promotes an attraction based on Dante's Inferno. It begins innocently enough but greed leads to Tracy's character's downfall. Ever more impressive sideshowpier entertainments slipshod construction with no regard to safety gambling and bribery all figure into this morality play. And then the pier collapses killing and injuring scores of people. Tracy's fatherinlaw a follower of Dante's literature then shows Tracy what hell is going to be like and for 1935 I found the sets to be extremely eerie and impressive...the images you see are far beyond anything I would expect from that era not to mention scenes of near nudity particularly from the rather poor Fox studio shortly before merging with 20th Century Studios.But justice must be served and soon with his son aboard his own ship Tracy again cuts corners endangering many more people when a fire breaks out on board. Tracy manages to save the ship...and his son...but in the mean time scenes abroad the ship mimic the hell of Dante's Inferno.What I feel makes this film so interesting is that it's something really different. I can't think of another film that was this original and clever. If there is one criticism I have of this film it is that there is a relatively happy ending when frankly one was not appropriate.I found the cast here to be very interesting. Spencer Tracy is one of my two favorite actors the other being Cary Grant. And I think he was surprisingly good considering this was before his MGM years. Frankly I didn't recognize Claire Trevor but she was perfect here as Tracy's wife. And it was interesting to see Henry Walthall once a famous silent film star and a leading actor in the granddaddy of all silent films  Birth Of A Nation. He is excellent here as the humble and moral professor and father of Trevor. Also worth mentioning is an excellent child performance  Scotty Beckett  as Tracy's small son. A fine young actor that unfortunately lived a spiraling life down in his early adult years.It is great to see this excellent film back for viewing! Recommended particularly for Tracy fans.".

	onyx:emotionText "As I was reading the new biography on Spencer Tracy  which incidentally is the definitive one to be produced  the section about this film filmed when he was transitioning from 20th Century Fox to MGM was quite negative so I expected a real lemon. At first I could only find it on You Tube divided up into several sections but complete and a surprisingly good print. In October 2012 it became available on TCM with again an excellent print. And now it is out on DVD!What a surprise I think it's a terrific movie particularly for 1935 and I would have to say that it's Tracy's best film in the preMGM period. Tracy's acting here is very smooth and convincing as a man who becomes a carnival barker you actually get to see him in black face! but then promotes an attraction based on Dante's Inferno. It begins innocently enough but greed leads to Tracy's character's downfall. Ever more impressive sideshowpier entertainments slipshod construction with no regard to safety gambling and bribery all figure into this morality play. And then the pier collapses killing and injuring scores of people. Tracy's fatherinlaw a follower of Dante's literature then shows Tracy what hell is going to be like and for 1935 I found the sets to be extremely eerie and impressive...the images you see are far beyond anything I would expect from that era not to mention scenes of near nudity particularly from the rather poor Fox studio shortly before merging with 20th Century Studios.But justice must be served and soon with his son aboard his own ship Tracy again cuts corners endangering many more people when a fire breaks out on board. Tracy manages to save the ship...and his son...but in the mean time scenes abroad the ship mimic the hell of Dante's Inferno.What I feel makes this film so interesting is that it's something really different. I can't think of another film that was this original and clever. If there is one criticism I have of this film it is that there is a relatively happy ending when frankly one was not appropriate.I found the cast here to be very interesting. Spencer Tracy is one of my two favorite actors the other being Cary Grant. And I think he was surprisingly good considering this was before his MGM years. Frankly I didn't recognize Claire Trevor but she was perfect here as Tracy's wife. And it was interesting to see Henry Walthall once a famous silent film star and a leading actor in the granddaddy of all silent films  Birth Of A Nation. He is excellent here as the humble and moral professor and father of Trevor. Also worth mentioning is an excellent child performance  Scotty Beckett  as Tracy's small son. A fine young actor that unfortunately lived a spiraling life down in his early adult years.It is great to see this excellent film back for viewing! Recommended particularly for Tracy fans.";

	schema:reviewBody "Here it is 1935 and Spencer Tracey as the ruthless but not heartless entrepreneur gone wrong is already the Spencer Tracey of twenty years later utterly believable as an ordinary guy. His style is perfectly natural. I was tempted to attribute his being so comfortable on screen with his previous stage experience but it can't be that. The early sound years were filled with Broadway actors with all kinds of fustian mannerisms shouting their lines as if projecting to the balconies overdoing their gestures for the sightchallenged and pronouncing words like New York as Nyew York an affectation borrowed from a relatively recent development in the British regional dialect of a few hundred years ago.Of course his range like every other actor's had its limits. I don't see him as King Lear. I don't see him as any king at all. But as a representation of everyman he can hardly be beat. Even his face. That face. Lionel Barrymore shouldn't worry.It's a familiar story. Tracey begins as a lowdown stoker promoting bets on who can stoke coal the fastest. Thrown off the ship he's befriended by a couple of people at a carnival one of whom Henry B. Walthall who has a face that belongs on a monument buys him a meal out of kindness and offers him a job as the rundown show place he owns. Dante's Inferno is just a path through different levels of hell populated by statues in various stages of suffering. It's making no money but Walthall is satisfied because it gives him a chance to sell a moral message against sinning.Tracey gets the place up and running. By shady means he acquires the whole amusement park and builds Dante's Inferno into its showcase. He's a rich man and has married Walthall's pretty niece young Claire Trevor. They have a son and Tracey is as happy as a pig in gumbo.But then Tracey has to go and smoothly bribe a reluctant building inspector and Dante's Inferno comes crashing down in a flurry of plaster and dust almost killing Walthall. The bribed building inspector commits suicide. Tracey is prosecuted for bribery but he lies on the stand  very convincingly too. Trevor volunteers to testify and she perjures herself too just to save their young boy the pain of having a father in the slams. Then she leaves Tracey and takes the kid with her which is just as well because he's one of those frightfully cute kids. All kids are like that. I think they're born suffering from a medical condition called neotenosis that only maturation can cause to remit.Anyhow Tracey bets big on an offshore gambling ship. Alas there is a strike and the ship's captain under Tracey's orders hires some really irresponsible gutter types who feel like joining the first night's festivities and start ingurgitating pilfered champagne. Well the hoi polloi don't know how to deal with champagne so we know what happens next.The ship's ballroom is bigger than my whole house by a factor of ten. The featured act is a dance by a lady called Rita Cansino and a partner before her hair was electrolyzed or whatever it's called and she became Rita Hayworth. Among the stokers is Don Ameche.One of the drunken guests sets the ship on fire and chaos ensues. It's quite exciting. The memory of the Morro Castle fire a burning ship in which 134 people died only the year before was probably still fresh. The Paradise like the Morro Castle is beached saving many lives. In the case of the Paradise it was due to Tracey's heroism. More important he learns that true love and real rectitude are better than plain old money.If the performances are uniformly good  and they are  the director has nothing to be ashamed of either. He manages the often corny dialog with aplomb. The camera tilts slightly during scenes of disaster. He uses overhead shots and makes judicious use of silhouettes and shadows. The special effects folks went ape and there is a boring tenminute speechless extravaganza of seminude bodies writhing in agony in Dante's hell. Tracey himself is at least spared the damned biting and itching insects who attack everyone else who pursues self interest in Dante's limbo.".

Though a wonderful husband and father in his corporate world he stops at nothing to get what he wants including cheating bribery and ignoring possible dangers. The consequences are disastrous.This film features three giant set pieces that must have thrilled audiences in 1935. Two of them are large scale disasters the first on the boardwalk pier and the second aboard a luxury liner. But the most memorable and eye popping of these set pieces is a lengthy dream sequence where Tracy descends into hell. We see mountains of tortured souls writhing naked in lava masses of hooded demons marching into oblivion the damned suffering screaming as they are tortured for all eternity. Even if you don't believe a hell exists this is some visually powerful stuff.Unfortunately besides these memorable sequences the story is pretty routine. Poor man makes it big destroys his soul in the process and in the end repents to his loving wife only after countless people are killed by his greed and carelessness. Twice. At times it seems that the rest of the film was written around the amazing dream sequence.

	schema:reviewBody "Spencer Tracy plays a scheming promoter who takes nothing and parlays it into a fortunemostly because he manages to lie and use people to his own selfish ends. At the same time they show Spencer as a devoted family manan odd juxtaposition indeed! I am amazed when I read the other reviews. It sounds almost like I saw an entirely different film. Because of this and the very respectable score of 7.0 I guess I am definitely in the minority in seeing this as a secondrate film.My problems with the film have little to do with the plot idea. According to one interesting review apparently this is all based on a reallife man! No my problems lie more in the execution as I rarely have seen a trashier and more ridiculous film in my life.The film begins by introducing us to the poor guy played by Spencer Tracy before he became a firsttier star. He plays the ultimate selfish heela lazy guy who'd rather cut corners and risk others lives than do the right thing. Repeatedly throughout the film you'd think that Tracy would turn his life around and do the right thing but this only happened in the very end. Up until then it was years of selfish pursuit of money at the expense of others. Now I didn't dislike this aspect of his characterbut just felt his redemption at the end was completely out of character and this hurt the film considerably. Many years later Tracy made a similar film EDWARD MY SON but it benefited from playing the heel up through the enda much more realistic and less hokey film all the way.Another serious problem with the film is that again and again and again the most horrible tragedies occurred due to Tracy and yet people somehow emerged almost totally unhurt! My favorite part was when his amusement park attraction Dante's Inferno was a safety hazard and Tracy paid off the fire inspector instead of closing down the building. Only moments later the entire huge attraction literally fell on top of his fatherinlaw and appeared to kill dozensit was a very spectacular scene. Yet oddly despite tons of material falling directly on him the inlaw was just fine and there was no mention of any deaths or injuries!! Another instance was when the passenger ship at the end of the film caught fire. Hundreds should have died and the most surely doomed was Tracy himself. Yet at the very end he's apparently okay and everyone seems ready to live happily ever after!!! What about the victims and lawsuits?! The final serious deficit of the film is the lengthy and rather interesting but pointless segment where you go on a trip to Hell. It's like a scene from Dante come to life and the film makers managed to film hundreds of naked extras and yet hide all their naughty bits. The scene also was reminiscent of a Bosch or Dali painting and was amazing to watch....but also very very very preachy. Subtle this film was not. In fact it's one of the least subtle films I have seen and it's chock full of sledgehammer symbolism and predictable plot devices.Had they instead allowed Tracy to be true to his character eliminated the overly preachy and sentimental aspects of the film and allowed SOME semblance of realism to pervade the film it would have been much much more watchable. Instead it just came off as a very bizarre and ridiculous curio in Tracy's otherwise excellent film career.".

Following in the footsteps of the very similar GIANT OF METROPOLIS THE CONQUEROR OF ATLANTIS offers up that alwaysinteresting idea that Atlantis is somehow rediscovered and populated by an evil society.Luckily for the audience only one man can stop the aforementioned evil society in their tracks and that's Maciste or Hercules or Samson or any other of the halfdozen names that the Italian hero was called after international dubbing and retitling. Here the guy's name is Heracles for a change and the actor playing him is none other than Kirk Morris COLOSSUS VS. THE HEADHUNTERS who may just be my favourite peplum star of all time this has something to do with the fact he starred in my first and favourite peplum movie MACISTE IN HELL  catch it if you can. Here Morris' assured tough and undeniably wooden performance is one of the film's biggest strengths.Heracles certainly has his work cut out in this movie as the outlandish foes opposing him include not one but two rival bands of bloodthirsty Arabs the film is set in the Sahara you see a team of deadly female archers an evil wizard who desperately wants to be Ming the Merciless a sultry 3000 yearold evil Queen and finally and best of all an army of goldskinned autons who were once captured prisoners but who have now been turned into bluesuited robotmen with no will of their own. On top of this they're pretty tough and an obvious favourite with Italian audiences as they returned albeit in a different colour in 1967's delirious superhero outing SUPERARGO AND THE FACELESS GIANTS.What is most striking about THE CONQUEROR OF ATLANTIS is the use of extremely colourful costumes which stand out against the arid desert locations which act as a backdrop for the action. Although the city of Atlantis itself is somewhat underwhelming  achieved with a small model which ends up being destroyed in the conclusion  the blue bodystockinged robot men are a visual delight as well as the colourful death rays and the wizard Ramir's wacky wardrobe. The female outfits are designed to show off the ample curves of the willing actresses and quite rightly so and mention must go to Luciana Gilli who is indelible as the love interest  only behind Bella Cortez in terms of Italian beauty. Other nods must go to Helene Chanel who enjoys her rather small role as the wicked Queen and screen veteran Piero Lulli who really enjoys himself and goes beyond the call of duty as the cackling wizard Ramir. Keep an eye out for the second male lead whose resemblance to Steve Reeves is uncanny and exemplified by his Reevesstyle goatee.The music is suitably entertaining and suits the film just fine although I wish the opening theme the same classical piece as used in MACISTE IN HELL had been utilised a little more throughout the movie. Memorable incidents include a men being tortured by having the sun shone in his eyes ! weird electronic noises which sound like they come from a space movie an unexplained exploding mine buried in the sand the sosimplisticit'sdownrightnormal creation of the goldskinned humanoid robots Heracles cheesily romancing the ladies the search of the prison chamber in which Heracles gets his pal to simply stand in front of the spy camera while he searches for secret passages and lastly my favourite plot element the robotman I like to call the Energiser Bunny who contains to operate machinery at the film's conclusion even as the building smashes to pieces around him and he is only forced to stop when the machinery itself is destroyed!THE CONQUEROR OF ATLANTIS as well as being a fastpaced and colourful film which utilises some fine location work in the desert or at least an area of land purporting to be a desert offers up a wealth of fine action particularly the various fights between Kirk Morris and the gold robotmen which are full of fun moves and plenty of solid punches to the face and gut to keep things moving merrily along. The scene at the beginning in which Morris wields a huge log against bandit forces is also a classic moment. Kudos to director Alfonso Brescia for creating such wellstaged moments and a worthy successor to all those hugely entertaining American scifi serials of the '30s and '40s. Ignore the popular opinion that Brescia is one of the worst directors of all time  sure some of his movies are worthless and dull but others  like this  are undisputed genre classics. Any fan worth his or her salt would be wise to seek out THE CONQUEROR OF ATLANTIS as it's one for the collection.".

It is somber and dark. It depicts the average low life people the ones that no movies are made about. No one wants to see the miserable workers the way they are in a pathetic yet moving way. It is obviously a metaphor about today's society without its pretty facelift the supermarket cashier is not played by a glamorous JLO Jennifer Lopez.This film will thus be repugnant to watch to the viewer that cannot stand actors without make up fake body parts. Viewers who cannot stand to see the truth about the life of the ordinary workers with a surreal twist should be advised not to watch the film.The film was shot in a rather bad quality which does not only show how poor they were and incapable of raising the money for this awkward film for which Depardieu does not get a dime! but also set the film in a genre  social realism. Throughout the film Depardieu is naked without protection. What a great performer he is ! He does not care about his image being potentially undermined by this movie. He is truly pathetic which is exactly the feeling the directors want to bring out. That shitty life you live makes you pathetic but this is not only what the directors want us to see. Obviously  unless you're so blinded by Hollywood glamor  you cannot watch a truly weird and honest film about realities that are never featured on film. Ken Loach would never show his characters under such unkind light. That's why it is a necessity that films like this one continue to be shot. There is no glamor or dignity in leading miserable lives. So it is showed as it should be for an audience of people with a critical outlook on society who become nauseous after seeing yet another blockbuster made with beautiful perfect people evolving in a perfect plastic world.Extraordinary lines such as the dialog between Depardieu and the butcher at the supermarket where his wife works!Thanks to Depardieu for taking the part and making the movie possible. I pity those who cannot see how important this cinema is for the diversity of point of views not only aesthetically but politically in the movie industry today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some time ago I helped my mom look for some missing documents that she needed to have if she wanted to have her full pension when she retired. It was bureaucracy hell hurrying from one department to another long queues indifferent public functionaries. A person works all his life to survive and to have some peace in his final years but in the end all he has to show for is a collection of little papers that can be lost or destroyed. So I sympathise very much with journey the protagonist undergoes to recover his own missing documents in Mammuth.Grard Depardieu plays Serge nicknamed Mammuth because of his size? a man who began working at sixteen and who has reached retirement age. After a lifetime of work he finds settling down a difficult task he can't relate very well to his wife Yolande Moreau who continues to work for a minimum wage at a supermarket he doesn't have any hobbies and he's not good at fixing little things at home. To make matters worse or better depending on the perspective Serge discovers he's missing some paperwork that enables him to receive his full pension so he hops onto his old bike and goes out on a journey to find his former employers and to simultaneously rediscover his lost youth.Mammuth is a seriouscomic movie full of oddball characters and dark humour which tries to say something about modern labour. Minimum wages social resentment fiscal fraud exploitation and the erosion of labour rights are discussed with varying degrees of insight and success. The movie is very unbalanced and hits its targets as often as it misses them. The movie fares well during its comedy parts. But its attempt at seriousness is undermined by the superficiality of the way important matters are treated.The movie also suffers from trying to be too many movies in one. From road movie to social satire it's an easy jump you can mix the two together. But the filmmakers also decided to include an awkward subplot involving a bike accident in Serge's past that killed his true love played with usually creepy eyes by Isabelle Adjani. And what does that have to do with Serge's quest? OK he uses the journey to meet old friends and relive his youth but this ties directly to the main story of a man who wasted his whole life working and who's now trying to fill it with something. It makes thematic sense. But Adjani's ghostly presence seems to belong in a horror movie or a heavy drama and I can easily imagine Mammuth working without her subplot.In spite of the movie's shortcomings Depardieu's performance is spotless. First all I love how unglamorous he looks in this movie. He's old he's got long dishevelled hair and he's obese. And he's not shy about showing it as his many nude scenes prove. It's so rare to see characters without perfect bodies in movies except to be the target of bad jokes that Depardieu's shabby looks already make this movie stand out.But it's Depardieu's acting that deserves attention. The movie isn't anything special but Depardieu makes it soar above mediocrity. He took an incoherent screenplay and transformed himself into a moody brusque but likable working class guy. With Serge's rough manners and dry humour guiding us through the movie Mammuth becomes a palatable experience. Fans of solid performances will enjoy it and fans of Depardieu must watch it. Otherwise my suggestion is to give this movie a pass.".

If you can imagine how two of them would feel combined I think you would get this movie as a result. There was absolutely no weak acting here.

It was I found referential the central premise of Depardieu searching for documentary evidence of his work record harks back to Pinter's The Caretaker where the eponymous character refers more than once to 'my papers in Sidcuo' and the bizarre aspect of the film reminded one of Bertrand Blier's Buffet Froid which also featured Depardieu. Another fine actress Anna Magloulis turns in a fine cameo but Depardieu shoulders the lion's share of the weight as a man who has never taken a day off work in forty five years but unfortunately has spent those years in one deadend job after another some of them 'under the table' which is not much help in a bureaucracy when a pension is at stake.

	schema:headline " A French twist on the Merry Widow trope... close enough to be a great comedy if it wasn't for ONE scene missing...";
	schema:reviewBody "There was a scene in the excellent 1989 War of the Roses where Barbara Rose Kathleen Turner confessed to her husband Oliver Michael Douglas that the knowledge of his heart attack hadn't upset her at all on the contrary she felt like finally relieved from some life burden. That was a shocking revelation from a rather shocking film but it had the merit to highlight a tacit marital reality it's only with the people that you spend most of your life with that such perversely mixed feelings can invade you.Even the best mother thinks of throwing her baby out of the window once in her life it's a natural symptom of maternal psyche but when it comes to marriage psyche takes a further step. The merit of The War of the Roses is to have broken that taboo movies got us used to crimes motivated by vengeance passion and insurance money but not wives secretly wishing that Karma would get them rid of their husband if not in a natural at least a guiltfree way. At Last a Widow swims in similar waters it's not as dark and thoughtprovoking as DeVito's classic but within its comical vaudeville aspect it exposes the same reality of a woman who came to a point she became devoid of any tender feeling toward her husband.The woman is AnneMarie and she's played by the alwaysdelightful Michele Laroque. Anne Marie loves to jog at the beach with headphones singing romantic songs with the passion that seems to lack in her life. The movie opens with her repetitive attempts to meet her lover Leo a handsome boatbuilder played by Jacques Gamblin and in the cuckold's role Gilbert a rich and cold plastic surgeon Wladimir Iordanoff is naturally oblivious to his wife's doings. But the rest of the world knows and that includes AnneMarie's benevolent housemaid Valrie Mairesse Leo's friends and all the brave people of that Southern seaside town. And obviously Gilbert is the least likely person to solve the problem he IS the problem. It's up to destiny to give a salutary hand.But here is a movie that could have gone for a more meanspirited tone I'm sure if it was an American film the husband would have needed to be portrayed as a prick or even a wifebeater to make his death more acceptable. But AnneMarie can never have a free moment she can't even give her lover a call and the less she can the more it reinforces our empathy this is not the cunning sexy cheating wife but a goofy likable one and that makes for a more sympathetic 'merry widow'. And the first act of the film shows that the director Isabelle Mergault didn't go for the easy caricature but rather nuanced and realistic characters. I especially loved that beautiful moment where you'd just think an argument is about to break up in the car but then even the 'bad husband holds his wife's hand and smiles at her. This is not just realistic but heartwarming.So Gilbert isn't a bad husband and his death matters and it's all justice that his loss doesn't lead to AnneMarie's triumph. Indeed his death unfolds the film's comedic premises when Anne Marie learns the news she's shocked but you can't tell if it's joy or sadness. At this moment the story takes a great turn because AnneMarie is finally free to join her lover if only she managed to get rid of the inlaws. This is a terrific premise that the script manages to handle as a great continuation of the traditional infidelity trope but with a smarter twist this time it's the family to escape from. It's one thing to cheat a man but four or five persons including a loving son a jealous and suspicious sisterinlaw and a senile father isn't the easiest task. I have reservations though on the son's casting he looks like a weird combination of Hugh Grant with the supersized mouth of Owen Wilson and his facial expressions were too distracting besides he looked nothing like his parents but anyway the film made me smile a lot chuckle many times and laugh at a few hilarious bits. One of the film's funniest moments occurs during the funeral AnneMarie pretends to cry while in fact laughing her ass off. The humor is quite cruel regarding the late husband but the situations are dealt in such a lighthearted way and AnneMarie is given such a bad break that it seems fair enough to laugh with it. The situations go as far as remembering the plot of the film she supposedly went to see or find a way to leave the house as discreetly as possible I love how the film deals with such tiny details even the writing of a farewell letter isn't as simple as it sounds.And I also love that this is not a sort of feminist pamphlet about abused wives AnneMarie wanted to be freed from her husband because she loved another man she's still a woman in need for love and affection. This is why her climactic confession is a very powerful moment. But I have one regret. A simple one. It's like being given a good meal and one missing ingredient spoils the whole taste. There was one scene missing in the film AnneMarie visiting the cemetery and telling the truth in her husband's grave. Granted she felt nothing at this death but I wouldn't believe that such a significant event wouldn't have an emotional aftereffect and if he didn't deserve her love he deserved at least the truth. Of course he's dead and that wouldn't have changed anything but I thought that scene would have made AnneMarie really come full circle with herself.For such a good scene the obligatory happyending would have worked instead I liked the film but I feel like some great potential was wasted.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the early 60's a nun calling herself The Singing Nun released an album of musical hymns and religious songs that turned out to strike a chord with the public.  Just about everyone alive in that era still can recognize the strains of Dominique.  Naturally Hollywood chose to make her story into a movie.  What they actually did was make an idealized story into a movie pretending it is the true story.  As such the story comes off as syrupy and too much everyone's fantasy of the perfect nun.  She wants only to work with children she thinks of nothing but her service to the church she actually rails against abortion in the film.  This makes the movie plodding and very boring in places.  It also projects a toovirginal image that gets old very quickly.  And for some reason they felt the need to have an old flame to the prehabit days around to spice things up just a bit though she remains true to her faith throughout.  The true story is of Jeanine Deckers known to the world mostly at Soeur Sourire Sister Smile who called the film a film of fiction.  In the convent she was known as Sister LucGabrielle and did not like the Sister Smile moniker the record company came up with.  In contrast to the perfection of the movie Jeanine Deckers was a very conflicted personality who did not like the attention of the world and definitely did not hold an attraction to a male record producer as shown in the film.  In fact she left the order in 1965 accompanied by her lover Annie Pescher whom she stayed with until their mutual suicide pact in 1985.  Gee if you were an old Dominique fan I probably burst a few bubbles there. What I think is interesting is that the true story would probably be the Hollywood choice were it made today.  The 1965 film portrayed perfection and idealism.  I'm sure a 2002 film would search for the seediest of details and revel in her contradictions.  What is sad is that neither version would make a very good film.  The excessively sweet Debbie ReynoldsRecardo Montalban version is mostly pretty dull and the true story would undoubtedly resemble yet anther VH1 Behind the Music.Watch for Katherine Ross in her first year as an actress as about the only real character in the film.  The Ed Sullivan cameo is rather interesting as well.".

What is sad is that neither version would make a very good film.  The excessively sweet Debbie ReynoldsRecardo Montalban version is mostly pretty dull and the true story would undoubtedly resemble yet anther VH1 Behind the Music.Watch for Katherine Ross in her first year as an actress as about the only real character in the film.  The Ed Sullivan cameo is rather interesting as well.";

I don't believe that happened as Jeannine was a lesbian. The movie ending has the Nun leaving to become a missionary in Africa I believe. When the REAL Nun wanted to leave the convent  live with her longtime partnerPhillips Records dropped her recording contract. Evidently she fell on difficult financial times. Jeannine  her partner of 25 years committed suicide in 1985. Her music is still heard around the world and her song 'Dominique' is still fondly remembered and sung. 2005 is the 20th anniversary of her death.".

I HAVE NO AGENDA!The Singing Nun is a 1966 American semibiographical film about the life of Jeanine Deckers a nun who recorded the charttopping hit song Dominique. It starred Debbie Reynolds in the title role. The film also stars Ricardo Montalbn Katharine Ross Chad Everett and Ed Sullivan as himself.

Randy Sparks wrote the English translations of Jeanine Deckers' songs as well as writing a couple of original songs for the film.As for the film itself its Worth Watching. It come across like a Disney movie from the 1960's. However in reality its about as good as a Hallmark Christmas Movie.Debbie Reynolds does keep the film moving along. The story seems a little far fetched. I have a feeling the writer took major creative license with the facts. The story starts off as Sister Ann enters a new place of residence. Her singing catches the ear of a priest. The priest knows a record producer. Before you know Sister Ann is a huge recording artist. This spotlight however doesn't blind Sister Ann to her calling. Debbie Reynolds was an ideal choice to play sister Ann. However Agnes Moorehead plays a Nun Version of Endora. Now I am not a Catholic and I not a Born Again Christian but I like the film but not enough to want to see it again for a long time. It was nice however to see Nuns in a positive light.".

	schema:reviewBody "I agree that Debbie sings some of the best musical numbers of her career and between the songs in Bundle of Joy and The Singing Nun I'll take The Singing Nun.Just as the film Jeannie Eagels is a fantasy very loosely based on the life of illfated actress Jeannie Eagels and as such basically only got one or two facts straight so does The Singing Nun stretch reality and we wretch. Stretch and Wretch.On the other hand if we accept these films as the fiction they are then they become good moral stories. And so The Singing Nut Debbie Reynolds sings and dimples her way through a film that resembles reality in only the fact that a nun named Sister Smile actually put out an album of her songs and it caused a big flurry of worry for the Sister.Maybe some of the songs in the film were actually written by JeannePaul Marie Deckers but the words for Dominique seem to not be the same words shown in the English translation of the song on my copy of the original album. There is a song called Sister Adele about her Spanish guitar which is also not the same song as the one played in the film and another funny item is the guitar Debbie Reynolds wields happens to be a Nylon Stringed Classical guitar A Spanish Guitar does not have a round hole a Spanish Guitar happens to have FHoles and steel strings.Even though this film is fiction and fantasy and ideology I do not cringe when I see it like I do The Sound of Music or My Fair Lady where I do not know why they bothered to write dialogue when they could have just sung those movies all the way through with no dialogue whatsoever. although the music and song in those films is overwhelming the fact that they are nonstop though the films is also overwhelming and can only be enjoyed in very small doses. On the other hand The flying er Singing Nun has some good acting by Anges Moorehead who is my favourite Red Headed Actress and Beych oh I just loved Agnes she could do anything including all kinds of ethnic parts Ricardo MontalKhan dons a priestly habit rather than a pair of swim trunks or 23rd Century Barbarian Garb and Katherine Ross is very good Almost to the point that she does not resemble a girl who is heading toward prostitution she is too squeakyclean. Someone made a comment that all this film was missing was Bing Crosby and I agree where was he when this was made? The main reason I like this film is because I loved the song Dominique as a small child  Everyone loved that song and I mean it was everywhere when it came out. This film Although getting the life of Soeur Sourire totally wrong does NOT get wrong the feeling o the early 60's which I happen to remember because I was there. I do not mean in Belgium but in 1963 and although I grew up in southern California and not Belgium the outdoor scenes in this film make me remember things I have forgotten for decades.One thing the film is accurate about That a nun could write a song record it and it becomes not just a local hit that was apparently originally intended to be sold only locally to help the Convent but by a set of extremely lucky circumstances this song would also become an International hit a worldwide hit and a song of comfort after the assassination of JFK. The film does not exaggerate the impact the song had on the world as a matter of fact it waters that impact down a bit.Sister Anne had a different fate other than the one shown at the end of the film but that does not matter to me This film is fantasy not reality Because I want to think it could have been good like that for the real Singing Nun but life is sometimes not as simple as shown in movies.I am looking at the artwork on and in the Album Cover and there is even a set of lithographed prints... And ultimately that art speaks about a faith that is simple and that is the only thing that matters really and I wish that could have been brought out in this film But it is not it is not even mentioned at all and he artwork was just as important as the music.".

So remember that in those days you didn't know what the preview would be until the film started rolling in the movie theater and if my memory serves me correct it was given a sneak preview in Minneapolis and after the first half played everyone screamed clapped and whistled and after the second half it sounded like the roof of theater was caving in because of the positive response so Fox said Now wait a minute! Maybe we've got something here that we're not aware of so they released The Sound of Music nationwide on a Reserve Seat basis and when the critics saw it they all reported that it would put everyone in a diabetic comma and would last a year but they were wrong and the rest is history! O.K. so The Singing Nun is not The Sound of Music! Big deal! So The Sound of Music was just about playing out its 3 year run in most theaters and as usual someone in Hollywood says Let's cash in on the popularity of the movie and do our own musical about a bunch of Nuns and Metro Goldwyn Mayers effort was The Singing Nun with Jewish convert Debbie Reynolds playing a Nun that sings as well as Debbie Reynolds and in all fairness the movie might not be what the big boys at M.G.M. wanted but it gave Debbie Reynolds the chance to do her finest singing ever! Her vocals in the movie as far as I'm concerned are superb! So what about the cast and the film itself. Here's Greer Garson at the end of her career Marshall Thompson at the end of his Ricardo Montalban famous for swimming with Esther Williams in her swimming musicals Agnes Moorehead still looking like she'd like to cast a nasty on Darrin in Bewitched and Chad Everett still looking like Doctor Gannon who claimed more animism's in his hospital T.V. show than would ever see on T.V. Soap General Hospital or Greay's Anatomy! The Singing Nun is not a good movie but it's not a bad one either and in ways it's very entertaining but once again it does afford Debbie Reynolds to do her finest singing ever in any of her films! Her singing in The Singing Nun is superb and spiritually uplifting and fulfilling!".

The Singing Nun will leave you with positive messages and upbeat feelings. Wholesome Debbie Reynolds is perfect for a nun. Other great actors such as Greer Garson Ricardo Montalban Agnes Moorehead and Katharine Ross further lead to the enjoyment of the film. It is hard to picture Ricardo Montalban as a priest. He is totally handsome and debonair in whatever he does. However it is Debbie Reynolds who is the star. The Singing Nun has picturesque scenes and you feel warm and fuzzy throughout the film. The music is very good as well. It's a film that the whole family can watch together. Sit back relax and enjoy. I give it four thumbs up.".

The young nun with her guitar is played by Debbie Reynolds and her combination of music and faith wins over just about everyone around her.Including young recording executive Chad Everett who has her cut and album that becomes a worldwide phenomenon. I still remember her record of Dominique played right around the same time the Fab Four from Liverpool were bursting on the American consciousness. But as soon as she arrived The Singing Nun went back into the convent in the film she and fellow sister Juanita Moore go off to Africa as missionaries. By the way Moore has the best performance in the film.Debbie Reynolds performs the songs of The Singing Nun well and the musical numbers are well staged. Would that The Singing Nun did have a happily ever after life after fame.She didn't in fact. During the film Reynolds of course takes a strong antiabortion position as per the Church teachings. In real life she did leave the convent and became an activist for birth control. She also had tax problems from our government hardly the last celebrity to deal with that. She and a woman who had been her life companion for 10 years committed a double suicide together in 1985. She seems to have gone against her faith in any number of ways.Read the Wikipedia article on The Singing Nun it will be quite an eye opener.

I think that it would have been more appreciated if it hadn't come out on the heels of the supermoney maker Sound of Music which saved 20th Century Fox from going downunder into bankruptcy because of the very flopish Cleopatra which starred Liz and DickyBoy! We here we have the Aba Daba Honeymoon girl Debbie Reynolds who converted to the Jewish Religion because of her marriage to Eddie Fisher playing a Christian Catholic Nun! Debbie Reynolds had really come a long way in there career from the days of playing Maureen the sister of the Daughter of Rosie O'Grady with June Haver to playing Helen Kane in Three Little Words Three Weeks With Love with Jane Powell who was also born on April Fools Day same as Debbie was having a record hit with her and Carleton Carpenter singing Aba Daba Honeymoon. Then she later went to game in Singing in the Rain playing a dog reincarnated into a female human form and later in the wonderful Unsinkable Molly Brown but to Debbies credit n The Singing Nun she does some of her finest singing and it's incredible to hear her since she really never had one singing lesson exact for some coaching in her M.G.M. days and coaching is not the same as taking singing lessons. Her singing is wonderful to hear! Then we have the rest of the cast trying to not look embarrassed for agreeing to appear in this film. You sometimes think that Ricardo Montalban is looking around thinking Where's Esther Williams to throw me in a swimming pool to do a water ballet to save this turkey! Agnes Moorehead looks like she's trying to still play Endora on Bewitched. Tom Drake looks like he's looking around to see if Judy Garland will save him by doing some kind of singing duet. Greer Garson is playing the Mother Superior trying to still be Mrs. Minever. Chad Everett is still acting like Dr. Gannon in which he could say as he did almost every Medical Hospiital show he was on It's an aneurysm! I wonder if that's what he thought of the movie? Debbie Reynolds was in an interview on Turner Classics and even though she and Gene Kelly hated each other in the making of Singing In The Rain she did say that if it wasn't for what she learned from him she wouldn't have lasted in this business for 60 years. So put it all together The Singing Nun is not that bad of a movie and you should see it in a movie theater with it's widescreen and stereophonic sound to really appreciate it for what it is which is a great entertainment package for the whole family to enjoy together. Wonder what ever happened to that kind of movie? But again to give her credit Debbie Reynolds does her finest singing ever and she is a real joy to watch in this film!".

So put it all together The Singing Nun is not that bad of a movie and you should see it in a movie theater with it's widescreen and stereophonic sound to really appreciate it for what it is which is a great entertainment package for the whole family to enjoy together. Wonder what ever happened to that kind of movie? But again to give her credit Debbie Reynolds does her finest singing ever and she is a real joy to watch in this film!";

	schema:reviewBody "Debbie Reynolds had one more chance after her triumph as Molly Brown to sing in the movies and even if the critics carped that this was simply a ripoff of The Sound of Music craze she came off unscathed. Reynolds is Sister Anne a Belgian nun who brings music into her new convent and turns it upside down. Like Sweet Apple Ohio in Bye Bye Birdie she gets Mr. Showbiz Ed Sullivan into the act but unlike other sudden new stars cast into the limelight she doesn't get into any nasty habits. Sister Anne simply wants to praise God through her music and thanks to the kindly Father Clementi Ricardo Montalban her Mother Superior an overly chatty Greer Garson agrees. A grouchy Agnes Moorehead and a sweet Juanita Moore are the other nuns in the order and with Reynolds' charm working her over it is no time at all before Moorehead actually cracks a smile. Like Angela Lansbury sings in Dear World it only takes one person to play a drum in Sister Anne's case it is her guitar Sister Adele to get everybody marching.Sister Anne was famous for the hit song Dominque the only time in music history where a nun had music on the charts. The soundtrack is filled out with a few other small gems which include the touching Beyond the Stars and the lively It's a Miracle!. A group number Brother John features all of the nuns and is another highlight. With this music you won't need The Sound of Music's Eleanor Parker promising that next time she will bring in her harmonica.There are some serious plot points in this sentimental tale most sweetly Sister Anne's love for the young Dominic Ricky Cordell a feisty but lovable child she looks after when discovering the truth about his situation. When a young woman tells Reynolds of her intentions to have an abortion Reynolds acts appropriately to the convictions of a Catholic nun not judgmental even if it appears she is being so. And when she hears Dominique being played to a rather bad rock beat Sister Anne must find a new venue to continue to do her work for God.Reynolds is excellent while Moorehead Moore and Garson seem to be playing types of nuns than characters. It is nice to see Moorehead switch from grouchy to kindly but I found Garson's overly wise mother superior a bit pretentious unlike Peggy Woods' serene Reverand Mother in The Sound of Music. Of Nun films there are many! Reynolds' Sister Anne may not ever be compared to Deborah Kerr's Black Narcissus Heaven Knows Mr. Allison or Audrey Hepburn's The Nun's Story but she ain't no Sister Mary Clarence Whoopie Goldberg Sister Act either. Too bad Mary Wickes wasn't available here to be the bus driver! The real life Sister Anne did not end up as lucky having a rather tragic ending that is a movie of itself.".

I had the pleasure of attending the Canadian premiere of the Slammin' Salmon in Montreal recently and the Broken Lizard troupe was there to meet and greet the fans and answer questions after the movie. They are true class acts and friendly guys. While I won't give away any specific jokes I will say that from a fan's perspective this is their second funniest film with Supertroopers of course being the cult favourite. So yes it is an improvement on Beerfest the Slammin' Salmon is just straight up funnier. As for regular moviegoers and comedy fans I highly recommend this film. It was produced with a low budget during the writers' strike so without a big studio production it has the fast pacing of a stage show. The focus in this movie is on the JOKES... which is something refreshing to see in a comedy less emphasis on character development and a complex plot but more emphasis on keeping the audience consistently laughing. The humour is low brow at times but is also clever and welltimed there are many quick oneliners so pay sharp attention to this fast paced comedy enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Following up the excellent comedies 'Super Troopers' 'Beerfest' and 'Club Dread' the comedy troupe of Broken Lizard finally returns after a few years' hiatus with 'The Slammin' Salmon.' The story focuses on a restaurant owned by boxing legend Cleon Slammin' Salmon Michael Clarke Duncan of 'The Green Mile' fame. When he loses an expensive bet to the Yakuza he forces his restaurant's manager Rich Kevin Heffernan to make up the losses with a big night at the restaurant. To do this the staff including all the usual Broken Lizard cast is bribed with vacations money and Norah Jones tickets. As expected chaos  hilarity ensue as the crazy crew of waiters and busboys screw up just about everything possible throughout the night.Before anyone gets into watching 'The Slammin' Salmon' they should first visit the other Broken Lizard productions to know what they're getting into. 'The Slammin' Salmon' while not as funny creative or perverse as the troupe's previous films does have its fair share of comedy. This comes from what seems to be some unusually standard writing from a group that usually creates very wacky situations in their other movies. Like another similar film 'Waiting' with Anna Faris and Ryan Reynolds 'The Slammin' Salmon' hits most of the typical restaurant jokes but never goes as deeply crazy and hilarious as 'Beerfest' or 'Super Troopers.' This was probably the biggest issue the film had. After waiting three years for another Broken Lizard release I thought this would be just as perversely ridiculous as their past releases but they seemed to have tamed themselves a bit. The performances made up for the typical writing and dialogue with some spoton comedic performances. Jay Chandrasekhar as NutzZongo was an absolute riot and took the film to a whole new level of funny. No one however matched the hilarity of Michael Clarke Duncan as the Slammin' Salmon himself. His overthetop madness was absolutely the shining element of this film and alone makes it worth watching.Overall the film has quite a few laughoutloud moments but is consistently entertaining all the way through with the final act coming out as the highlight of the film. Fans of the other restaurant comedy 'Waiting' along with Broken Lizard's previous releases should certainly give it a watch.Final Verdict 710.AP3".

In The Slammin' Salmon the waitstaff of a high end seafood restaurant compete against each other to win 10000 for selling the most food in one night. The eccentric former heavyweight boxer turned restaurant owner Michael Clark Duncan is amusing throughout the movie as are the waitstaff themselves but only for the last 40 min or so of the film. The big problem with The Slammin' Salmon is that it takes too long to really get going. Its not until the waitstaff finally get fired up about the contest and start sabotaging each other the film becomes truly funny. It's not a bad movie and it is pretty funny at times but it really could have been so much better.".

As the stakes are continually raised so too are the antics that ensue as each waiter tries to outdo one another earn the ten thousand dollar cash prize or save themselves from a brutal beating  while all anxiously await the passing of a diamond ring the manager had swallowed.This is an enjoyable edition to Broken Lizards filmography. Like their other films The Slammin' Salmon features excellent quirky and weird characters and an outlandish plot. Here one can also see and appreciate the group's maturity as there is more situational humor far less shtick and relatively little scatological humor as compared to their previous films. This is also Kevin Heffernen's amicable debut as a director.The Slammin' Salmon has fairly good pacing though it does slow down at times there are still lots of laugh out loud moments throughout the piece. Of course the true strength of this movie is in the writing and performances. As per usual the Lizards play a host of characters with personality flaws galore such as 'Zongo' the OCDSchizophrenic waiter or Donnie the alcoholic bus boy with low self esteem. These quirky characters are joined by great performances form Michael Clarke Duncan as 'the champ' April Bowlby as the upbeat 'little train that could' waitress to the always levelheaded Tara played by Cobie Smulders.This film could have used a better soundtrack which had been a staple in other Lizard productions. Although they did write a humorous take off of The Eye of the Tiger which is featured during the credits. I also found the scenes in the kitchen and waiter prep area to be altogether unbelievable. Though I've not worked as a cook or a waiter I've scene the frenetic goings on in the kitchen and prep areas just passing by on the way to the restroom. They didn't capture that feel nor fully capitalize on this norm as these scenes are most always calm and free of frenzy. This I believe is one major element that makes the film slow down.I enjoyed the film. And a fan of the Broken Lizard troupe I agree with others that it is not as good as Super Troopers. However with a piece such as great as that it will be difficult for them to ever match it. An excellent comedy well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "The waiters and waitresses of 'the Slammin' Salmon' one of Miami's most popular seafood restaurants can't seem to get a break. Not only do they make a mere low hourly wage but now their boss a former world heavyweight boxing champion 'Slammin' Cleon Salmon Michael Clarke Duncan own money to a Japanese Yakuza and must paid the amount in one night business or else the restaurant will have to close. Will the manager Rich Kevin Heffernan  his crew including the likes of Nuts Jay Chandresekhar a heavily medicated man Conner Steve Lemme former actor Donnie Kinogie Paul Soter busboy turned waiter Guy Metdrapedes Eric Stolhanske arrogant prettyboy Tara Cobie Smulders med student and Mia April Bowlby balletbeauty queen be able to pull off the biggest sale in their little restaurant history? Watch the movie directed by Kevin Heffernan to find out! Without spoiling the fifth movie from the comedy troupe Broken Lizard too much I found the film to be hilarious but not as funny as their other works such as 2001's 'Super Troopers'. Some of the jokes did fall flat like the nosejob subplot with Conner Morgan Fairchild  Dick Lobo Lance Henriksen. Other jokes goes nowhere such as identical twins gimmick with Donnie and Dave Also played by Paul Soter. Furthermore jokes like Jay Chandresekhar acting crazy are just recycled humor from 2006's 'Beerfest'. None of them are particularly intelligent or memorable. However not all the jokes were bad. Michael Clarke Duncan steals the movie as the champboxer restaurant owner. Some of the best moments in the film involved him mispronouncing words and threaten his staff. Who knew that Duncan had a comedy side to him. Other characters that I love was Kevin Hefferman as the lovable Rich whom just trying to survive the night while also bypassing a wedding ring that he accidentally ate. I also found the cameos from Will Forte Sendhil Ramamurthy  Jim Gaffigan equaling as funny. Nevertheless as much as I love those characters the true reason while I really like this movie is because it cover pretty much all of the stress points about working in that type of an environment such as dealing with meanspirited  nitpicky customers or how there's always that party of one who sits there slowly taking their time during dinner rush hour. It even show some of the kitchen hijinx such as coworkers scarfing down extras in the kitchen or people getting orders wrong. All of these stuff actually happens in a daily basic! Yet the movie does completely exaggerates or go overthe top during certain stuff. Honestly I really don't see a waitress being able to serve food after third degree burns or another waiter going around buck naked without taking his meds. The restaurant would close down regardless if they make the money or not due to violations of many health and safety codes. Also the idea that a restaurant would rehired a worker after he storm out and make a huge mess with coleslaw seem very notliking to happen in reallife. Talking about unrealistic terms the rush relationship between Tara and Donnie was also jarring. It's weird that one day of work would make them into a couple. Plus treating female characters like Tara as a prize for males because they did good work doesn't sound right. Another thing I did feel the movie could work better if it was a little more grounded in its pacing as well. There were a little too much flashbacks that wasn't really needed such as Rich's prologue  wedding scene which really doesn't do anything to move the main plot. The film should had more of a oneday coverage approach similar to other restaurant comedies such as 2005's 'Waiting'  2006's 'Clerks II' with its timeline. Another thing the movie could had done is work on the editing a little more. There was a lot of continuity problems throughout the film. It was pretty jarring how fast the restaurant filled up or seeing characters pick up same items multiply times during a few shots. The last thing the movie could had done is feature more scenes with the other members of the staff such as the cooks and hostess. I felt like those characters was a bit underwhelmed as a lot of humor could had come with them. Overall Despite the childish amount of endless string of low brow vulgar profanityfilled insultdialogues and some pointless outlandish slapsticky scenes. This movie is not that bad. It was funny for the most part. Just wish it depict more of reallife workplace atmosphere than it did. Still I highly recommended watching for anybody hungry for a comedy. It's worth the time digesting.".

	onyx:emotionText "The waiters and waitresses of 'the Slammin' Salmon' one of Miami's most popular seafood restaurants can't seem to get a break. Not only do they make a mere low hourly wage but now their boss a former world heavyweight boxing champion 'Slammin' Cleon Salmon Michael Clarke Duncan own money to a Japanese Yakuza and must paid the amount in one night business or else the restaurant will have to close. Will the manager Rich Kevin Heffernan  his crew including the likes of Nuts Jay Chandresekhar a heavily medicated man Conner Steve Lemme former actor Donnie Kinogie Paul Soter busboy turned waiter Guy Metdrapedes Eric Stolhanske arrogant prettyboy Tara Cobie Smulders med student and Mia April Bowlby balletbeauty queen be able to pull off the biggest sale in their little restaurant history? Watch the movie directed by Kevin Heffernan to find out! Without spoiling the fifth movie from the comedy troupe Broken Lizard too much I found the film to be hilarious but not as funny as their other works such as 2001's 'Super Troopers'. Some of the jokes did fall flat like the nosejob subplot with Conner Morgan Fairchild  Dick Lobo Lance Henriksen. Other jokes goes nowhere such as identical twins gimmick with Donnie and Dave Also played by Paul Soter. Furthermore jokes like Jay Chandresekhar acting crazy are just recycled humor from 2006's 'Beerfest'. None of them are particularly intelligent or memorable. However not all the jokes were bad. Michael Clarke Duncan steals the movie as the champboxer restaurant owner. Some of the best moments in the film involved him mispronouncing words and threaten his staff. Who knew that Duncan had a comedy side to him. Other characters that I love was Kevin Hefferman as the lovable Rich whom just trying to survive the night while also bypassing a wedding ring that he accidentally ate. I also found the cameos from Will Forte Sendhil Ramamurthy  Jim Gaffigan equaling as funny. Nevertheless as much as I love those characters the true reason while I really like this movie is because it cover pretty much all of the stress points about working in that type of an environment such as dealing with meanspirited  nitpicky customers or how there's always that party of one who sits there slowly taking their time during dinner rush hour. It even show some of the kitchen hijinx such as coworkers scarfing down extras in the kitchen or people getting orders wrong. All of these stuff actually happens in a daily basic! Yet the movie does completely exaggerates or go overthe top during certain stuff. Honestly I really don't see a waitress being able to serve food after third degree burns or another waiter going around buck naked without taking his meds. The restaurant would close down regardless if they make the money or not due to violations of many health and safety codes. Also the idea that a restaurant would rehired a worker after he storm out and make a huge mess with coleslaw seem very notliking to happen in reallife. Talking about unrealistic terms the rush relationship between Tara and Donnie was also jarring. It's weird that one day of work would make them into a couple. Plus treating female characters like Tara as a prize for males because they did good work doesn't sound right. Another thing I did feel the movie could work better if it was a little more grounded in its pacing as well. There were a little too much flashbacks that wasn't really needed such as Rich's prologue  wedding scene which really doesn't do anything to move the main plot.

Jay Chandrasekhar the director of previous Broken Lizard entries was not the director. Kevin Heffernan was behind the camera. The film isn't poorly directed just very basic. With Club Dread and Beerfest Chandrasekhar was use to being in the directing chair and would get a little bit more creative with the camera. Heffernan seems a bit timid. The second would be the the film felt familiar. It could be that it's basically another swing at the dinning experience one which we had earlier with Waiting. The difference being that this is an upscale restaurant but the jokes which we have seen before are still there. Some fall flat others are just right up the groups alley. They also implore the use of twin characters which we saw in Beerfest. The film stars the usual boys all doing a great job of course. They have their sense of timing and comedy down pat. Some people don't get or enjoy their comedic nature but I do. The supporting players are April Bowlby a waitress who tries to score tips based on her looks and Cobie Smulders How I Met Your Mother as a waitress who also is trying to become a doctor. Both are great and fit nicely into the film with the boys. The stand out character is without a doubt Michael Clarke Duncan. He has the best lines the best mannerism and has the most fun with the character. While it is the weakest of the Broken Lizard films not including Puddle Cruiser it is still a decent entry.

	schema:reviewBody "Katharine Hepburn is a wealthy woman who uses her checkbook in the hopes of having her niece lobotomized in Suddenly Last Summer a 1959 film directed by Joseph Mankiewicz and starring Elizabeth Taylor Katharine Hepburn Montgomery Clift and Mercedes McCambridge. Hepburn plays Mrs. Venable whose son Sebastian died the previous summer of a heart attack. However her niece Cathy who accompanied Sebastian has had a sort of breakdown and is institutionalized. Mrs. Venable wants Cathy lobotomized. Before doing so however the gifted surgeon Clift sent there by his boss as Mrs. Venable dangles money for the hospital in front of him becomes determined instead to find out what happened and how Sebastian really died.This is a film that would never be made today  it's characterdriven and has too much dialogue. It's a shame because the dialogue is excellent. A previous Mankiewicz film All About Eve is wordrich as well and there the dialogue sparkles. Here it is more poetic. And like Eve the great roles are the womens.Though references to homosexuality are only inferred this film and the much more poorly adapted Cat on a Hot Tin Roof hold up very well today. With homosexuality much more discussed the role this plays in both plots is very obvious at least to this viewer. In Suddenly Last Summer Sebastian's proclivities are evident from the beginning as Mrs. Venable describes an almost husbandwife relationship with her son claiming to the surgeon that Sebastian was chaste and that her relationship with him was enough for her son.One of the comments here mentioned that Cathy is crazy like all Williams heroines. But in truth Cathy like Blanche is disturbed though Blanche may be a little closer to being nuts and both are put away to shut them up  Blanche for her accusations against Stanley and Cathy because she knows how Sebastian really died.Katharine Hepburn gives a brilliant performance as Mrs. Venable  charming but made of steel her anger and jealousy toward her niece just barely beneath the surface. Elizabeth Taylor gives one of her best performances under the strong direction of Mankiewicz. Taylor was blessed with great beauty but alas not a great speaking voice. However she is nevertheless very effective particularly in her long harrowing monologue near the end of the film.Clift's passive portrayal of the surgeon is problematic and one wonders why he was cast. The opening scene in which he performs an operation had to be redone many times because of his drunkenness and codeine addiction  he was washing down the pills with brandy his voice quavers he is unsteady on his feet and his eyes are glassy. He comes off a little better in the previous year's Lonelyhearts though in that film he actually winces in pain when he has to sit. While Clift had the support of his fellow actors he had none from Mankiewicz and producer Sam Spiegel. Had it not been for Elizabeth Taylor's insistence he would have been replaced. It seems cruel as it did to Hepburn at the time but Mankiewicz was trying to make a movie and Spiegel wanted it to be on budget  Clift's addictions and physical problems weren't helping. He couldn't remember lines when he finally said them he was often inaudible and he was always late arriving on the set. Fortunately for audiences this wasn't his last bigbudget role. Under the direction of Elia Kazan he would do the magnificent Wild River and seemingly be more in control.Despite this Suddenly Last Summer is an excellent disturbing film and is highly recommended. It's not Williams' best play but it is served well in its film adaptation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Longfabled as one of the most bizarre films to come out Hollywood during the years of the Production Code's strict enforcement SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER is a riveting psychological drama that remains absolutely gutwrenching even after nearly fifty years since it's original release. Screenwriter Gore Vidal takes Tennessee Williams' oneact play and runs with it fleshing out the central characters and expanding the story's central arc. Vidal had the seemingly impossibly task of taking a tale involving homosexuality incest pedophilia and even cannibalism and presenting it all in a manner that would be acceptable to the rigid Production Code yet still coherent to the average film audience. Not only did Vidal succeed victoriously but the slightly ambiguous nature of the film's climax and denouncement actually makes the twice as unsettling and disturbing.With relatively few characters to populate the story the performances are absolutely crucial and the tightknit cast delivers the goods in spades. Long after many of her acting contemporaries of the thirties and forties had been forgotten Katharine Hepburn continued to reign supreme on the silver screen and her sublime performance as the manipulative and cunning Mrs. Venable ranks among Hepburn's best work of the decade. The wounded vulnerability of a postcar accident Montgomery Clift serves him well in a difficult role as the middle man between the film's leading ladies and the stillhandsome actor provides a humane completely genuine performance that supplies viewers with levelheaded window into the offkilter story. Albert Dekker Mercedes McCambridge and Gary Raymond also excel in minor roles.The film's biggest surprise however is the exceptional portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor in the film's central performance. Although usually somewhat of an uneven actress Taylor completely nails a dauntingly difficult role in a complex multilayered performance that deservedly won her a Golden Globe Award as well as her third consecutive Oscar nomination. During the film's climatic revelation Taylor lets out a series of bonechilling screams that I could never imagine coming out of any other actress. Not only does it remain Taylor's finest performance which is a considerable achievement when one considers that WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF is also on her resume but it is also a performance that simply could not be bettered.Although perhaps he could never surpass 1949's A LETTER TO THREE WIVES or 1950's ALL ABOUT EVE in the eyes of most viewers SUMMER contains some of the finest work of director Joseph L. Mankiewicz' legendary career. Brilliantly combining southern Gothicism with straightfaced psychodrama and even grandiose horror Mankiewicz stitches the various seemingly disparate threads together in a harrowing yet perversely satisfying whole. Even the lengthy sometimes criticized flashback sequence is an absolute tour de force of filmmaking that leaves viewers emotionally exhausted as one experiences the on screen turmoil more than simply watching it. An often unheralded classic the film remains of the most sorely underrated films of its era.".

	schema:headline " Suddenly last summer in Cabeza de Lobo";
	schema:reviewBody "Suddenly Last Summer was perhaps Tennessee Williams most autobiographical play. Mr. Williams never forgave his mother for letting his sister Rose undergo a lobotomy to cure her anxiety problems something that he dealt with in this work as well. As a play this was done OffBroadway something unheard in those days about the work of one of last century's best regarded playwright. It proved to be a great artistic success for the author even with a cast of non stars in it. In fact Suddenly Last Summer was paired with a shorter play Something Unspoken under the title Garden District.Joseph L. Mankiewicz one of the best directors and writers that ever worked in Hollywood undertook the direction of Gore Vidal's screen adaptation. In a way it must have been a daring decision to bring it to the movies since the play speaks about things that in the theater it could get away with but in the movies a different medium and with the censure of those years not even a distinguished team as the one assembled here could get away with a movie that seemed to be years ahead of its time. The film is set in 1937.If you haven't seen the film please stop reading here.We meet young doctor Cukrowicz at the start of the film as he is about to perform a lobotomy on one of the patients in the public hospital where the lights go out during the operation. The ambitious director Dr. Hockstader wants to send the young doctor to talk to Mrs. Violet Venable one of the richest ladies in New Orleans because she is interested in donating money toward a hospital's improvements with the caveat that her young niece Catherine undergoes the operation. Evidently she has been babbling all kinds of nonsense and has been diagnosed suffering from schizophrenia.What Mrs. Venable doesn't tell the young doctor is the reason why her niece is acting in such a strange manner. During the visit she speaks of her dead young son Sebastian who died tragically suddenly last summer of a heart attack. Violet doesn't go into details but it seems there is much more to the story than she tells Dr. Cuckrowicz.

She was seen in the film at the height of her beauty and youth. Ms. Taylor in one of her best appearances in any film is convincing as the young woman who has been traumatized by what she had witnessed that fateful summer.Montgomery Clift who has the lesser part of Dr. Cukrowicz does what he can with his role. Mercedes McCambridge on the other hand is perfect as the ambitious poor relative without scruples who will do anything to receive the crumbs of her richer relative and couldn't care what happens to her daughter.This film was ahead of its times and still packs a lot of power because of the direction of Mr. Mankiewicz and his stellar cast.".

	onyx:emotionText "Suddenly Last Summer was perhaps Tennessee Williams most autobiographical play. Mr. Williams never forgave his mother for letting his sister Rose undergo a lobotomy to cure her anxiety problems something that he dealt with in this work as well. As a play this was done OffBroadway something unheard in those days about the work of one of last century's best regarded playwright. It proved to be a great artistic success for the author even with a cast of non stars in it. In fact Suddenly Last Summer was paired with a shorter play Something Unspoken under the title Garden District.Joseph L. Mankiewicz one of the best directors and writers that ever worked in Hollywood undertook the direction of Gore Vidal's screen adaptation. In a way it must have been a daring decision to bring it to the movies since the play speaks about things that in the theater it could get away with but in the movies a different medium and with the censure of those years not even a distinguished team as the one assembled here could get away with a movie that seemed to be years ahead of its time. The film is set in 1937.If you haven't seen the film please stop reading here.We meet young doctor Cukrowicz at the start of the film as he is about to perform a lobotomy on one of the patients in the public hospital where the lights go out during the operation. The ambitious director Dr. Hockstader wants to send the young doctor to talk to Mrs. Violet Venable one of the richest ladies in New Orleans because she is interested in donating money toward a hospital's improvements with the caveat that her young niece Catherine undergoes the operation. Evidently she has been babbling all kinds of nonsense and has been diagnosed suffering from schizophrenia.What Mrs. Venable doesn't tell the young doctor is the reason why her niece is acting in such a strange manner. During the visit she speaks of her dead young son Sebastian who died tragically suddenly last summer of a heart attack. Violet doesn't go into details but it seems there is much more to the story than she tells Dr. Cuckrowicz. Mrs. Venable talks about her summer trips with Sebastian and the horrible experience she had in the Galapagos watching the young turtles rushing to the sea falling prey to the predatory black birds that seem to cloud the sky.That there's something more is clearly noticed by the young doctor when he meets Catherine the lovely young woman being kept in another hospital's mental ward. Catherine comes across as quite sane which poses a moral dilemma for the Cukrowicz who is under pressure to rush Catherine's lobotomy. Since he has so many doubts and in trying to see what's wrong with the girl he hears about how Catherine and Violet have served as procurers to the late Sebastian.The climax comes as a family reunion in which Dr. Cukrowicz gathers in the Venable mansion's patio all the people involved in the case.

	schema:reviewBody "While the symbolism here is about as heavy as a sledgehammer it's offered in such artfully poetic style that only writers of the caliber of Tennessee Williams and Gore Vidal could give us. What they have done is provide KATHARINE HEPBURN with a role that fits her like a glove and where her mannered acting sits comfortably on a role she was born to play. She is totally mesmerizing as Mrs. Venable a woman who has lavished all her hopes and dreams on her only son only to have them all swept away on a brutal summer day suddenly last summer under the hot Mediteranean sun. She gets to spout the most poetic dialog in the film with ELIZABETH TAYLOR not far behind especially during their frequent monologues.This leaves MONTGOMERY CLIFT as a surgeon who is asked to perform a lobotomy on Miss Taylor hovering in the background and looking like a frightened sparrow most of the time although it is he who uncovers the truth about last summer. Mr. Clift must have been at a difficult phase of his own personal life because he performs in a stiff robotlike manner that makes him seem dubious as a skilled surgeon with steady hands.All of this is highly melodramatic as only Tennessee Williams can muster while at the same time affording us the luxury of watching two commanding performances from Hepburn and Taylor that were justifiably nominated for Oscars.The tale seems burdened by too much heavyhanded poetry but somehow it holds the attention because of the forceful acting by a fine cast. Mercedes McCambridge is a standout as Taylor's mother in the sort of fluttery birdbrain role one might suspect would be offered to Billie Burke if this had been filmed in the 1940s.By the end of the film Miss Hepburn is so far removed from reality that she thinks Dr. Sugar Montgomery Clift is her son Sebastian and seems more like a candidate for lobotomy than the plucky Miss Taylor. Taylor never quite has the air of vulnerability that the role demands but she gives a colorful if strident performance as the poor victimized girl who was used as bait by her playboy cousin.".

	schema:reviewBody "The moral majority's campaign to censor anything on the movie screen considered too taboo had an incredible impact on Hollywood during the 1930's right through to the 1970's.  Censors went through Hollywood scripts tearing out anything considered unspeakable no matter how important it was to the plot at hand.  It became an art form of sorts for Hollywood film makers to veil their nasty little subjects so that the censors who weren't that bright anyway couldn't find it but so that a smart audience could. Suddenly Last Summer is a classic example of this art in action.Tennessee Williams was the toast of Broadway in the 1950's with his melodramatic plays that often tackled heavy subjects such as addiction adultery and in the case of this story homosexuality.  Katherine Hepburn plays a classic Tennessee Williams vamp Violet Venable a lady of means who is mourning the loss of her son.  She has sought the help of a psychiatrist played by Montgomery Clift as she would like to have a lobotomy performed on her niece who is apparently off her rocker as most of Tennessee Williams' ladies are and is spouting nasty rumors about the dead son.Like most of Williams' work Suddenly Last Summer flows along with over the top dialogue the kind that actors love to sink their teeth into.  I have not seen the original stage play but I suspect that this screenplay has been severely hacked to obliterate any talk of homosexuality.  Venable's son was murdered while on vacation in Europe.  If you take the dialogue literally you might believe that he was murdered for his religious convictions.  If you read between the lines you will see that this was clearly a gay bashing.Hepburn and Taylor both shine in their roles that seem almost custom made for them.  It's rare that Hepburn is cast as a villain however her performance leaves me wondering why she hasn't done it more often. Taylor's hyperactive hyperventilating Catherine Holly works well here.  Her own brand of melodramatic acting seems to compliment Williams' work.Clift was a tad cardboard in his role as the psychiatrist however it is still interesting to watch this performance that was filmed after his facealtering car accident.  One might think that he recently underwent a lobotomy.  On the other hand he is competent and the performances of the actresses more than compensate.Suddenly Last Summer works as a film but I am hesitant to recommend to everyone.  This is not an action flick by any means but rather a character piece.  Scenes are long and they require your concentration as important statements can be found between the lines.  For fans of any of these actors this is a must see!".

	schema:reviewBody "Being an admirer of both Monty Clift and Tennessee Williams I went to see this film with great anticipation. I was eighteen at the time and topics such as homosexuality were taboo in the cinema back then. But with the by Tennessee Williams attached to it I expected to be confronted with material characters and situations that challenged my sheltered mind. But with Suddenly Last Summer I was amazed to learn that Williams surpassed even himself! From the very beginning I beheld a Katharine Hepburn playing a character so bizarre and cryptic that it bordered on the comical. Even Monty Clift his youth and tender looks despoiled by accident pills  booze looked tired. But Liz Taylor seemed perfectly okay her beauty never more radiant. The only thing wrong with her character was her sanity. Apparently she witnessed something so awful the summer in question happening to her cousin Sebastian that it drove her over the edge of sanity into madness. But the eccentric aunt and the deranged cousin aren't the focal point of this grim tale. Sebastian is the one who motivates all the others. The one we are tantalized with and shocked by and made so mysterious that we don't even get to see his face hear his voice or learn what made him the way he was. He's always shot from behind as if to see his face might just make the audience care about him know his humanity and possibly even sympathize with him. Sebastian was made to be abstract and censorship being what it was that made the producers breathe easier. Although he meets a horrible death at the hands of some Third World beach boys he's not meant to be the victim of the film. Instead his pretty cousin is the one who must be sacrificed to protect the memory and reputation of her cousin. Mama wants it that way and what Hepburn wants she gets even going so far as to blackmail two doctors to silence her niece! Mama Hepburn to me is the real monster of the film and Taylor her helpless victim. Made helpless by the need for secrecy at all costs. If anything this tale can be about how an obsession with secrecy leads to madness.As for Sebastian we are supposed to think he got what he deserved. As for me the movie left me emotionally drained. The predatory beasts unleashed the primeval gardenreplete with insectdevouring plants the attempted suicide and gang rape by loony inmates of Taylor.... the long speech at the beginning about swooping blackbirds preying on baby turtles that Hepburn delivers all made me limp at the end. Hepburn and Taylor both received worthy Oscar nominations for their work. The set designer as well for the foreboding lunatic asylum and simmering garden the primitive operating room where lobotomies are performed   all excellent. Rent the video if you can. But remember this is set in 1937 when homosexuals weren't getting elected to Congress. Remember also that Sebastian is a martyr if only because he was before his time. Just like the saint he's named after. I was made to realize above all else from this film that there is a beast that lurks in our unconscious mind a remnant from our prehistoric past and of which we are reminded by the frequent animal imagery used in this film. Something to think about whenever we see the strong preying upon the weak. To quote a line from the film Nature is not made in the image of man's compassion. Sound Track".

The cast more or less speaks for itself.

	schema:reviewBody "I recommend that you don't read this review if you haven't seen this film but intend to. This film is all about suspense that builds to a shocking end. It is usually classified as a mystery but could almost rank as horror.Suddenly Last Summer is an excellent film made by talented movie professionals and it deserved all the accolades and awards for which it was nominated and won. However I'm always surprised by some people who attempt to gloss over or even deny the extremely harsh subject matter of its story. Plain and simple the story is based on a wealthy man who was secretly a homosexual child molester  an intense subject for 1950s movies. This man also possessed a lurid charm and was loved and respected by family and community. The man spent much of his life traveling extensively overseas secretly using his inherited wealth to lure young poor foreign boys into sex until one summer his criminal escapades came crashing down in a bizarre dramatic and gory end that resulted in his death. The movie starts at the point of his death and this post plot is perhaps most shocking of all his wealthy mother played by Katharine Hepburn had actually assisted him in his past crimes and after his death she takes extreme felonious measures in a desperate attempt to bury her son's dark secret.Playing the villain in a movie was a departure for Hepburn but she performed it with her usual perfection as proved by both her and Taylor's nominations for best actress.Even today this would be a gritty subject for a movie so it must have been really taboo in the 1950s. It is my understanding that even Tennessee Williams author of the original play was not happy that it was made into a movie. I don't think a movie like this could easily be made today and be as successful. It is certainly not for children although they'd probably watch it without understanding its full implications. But I don't like adults who try to hide this movie's subject matter and pretend it's about psychiatry because it's not.This film also exemplified the social activism of Elizabeth Taylor and Katharine Hepburn both women ahead of their time both considered this film important in dealing with unpleasant truths something neither woman shrank away from during their careers. Both women were also expressly angry with director Joseph Mankiewicz's ill treatment of actor Montgomery Clift during the filming of this movie. Clift was going through a tough time having recently suffered his infamous car accident. I think Clift cast as Dr. John Cukrowicz was one of the key elements to this film's success.".

The movie starts at the point of his death and this post plot is perhaps most shocking of all his wealthy mother played by Katharine Hepburn had actually assisted him in his past crimes and after his death she takes extreme felonious measures in a desperate attempt to bury her son's dark secret.Playing the villain in a movie was a departure for Hepburn but she performed it with her usual perfection as proved by both her and Taylor's nominations for best actress.Even today this would be a gritty subject for a movie so it must have been really taboo in the 1950s. It is my understanding that even Tennessee Williams author of the original play was not happy that it was made into a movie. I don't think a movie like this could easily be made today and be as successful. It is certainly not for children although they'd probably watch it without understanding its full implications. But I don't like adults who try to hide this movie's subject matter and pretend it's about psychiatry because it's not.This film also exemplified the social activism of Elizabeth Taylor and Katharine Hepburn both women ahead of their time both considered this film important in dealing with unpleasant truths something neither woman shrank away from during their careers. Both women were also expressly angry with director Joseph Mankiewicz's ill treatment of actor Montgomery Clift during the filming of this movie. Clift was going through a tough time having recently suffered his infamous car accident. I think Clift cast as Dr. John Cukrowicz was one of the key elements to this film's success.";

Complicated story of innuendo and symbol one is never quite sure what happens to Sebastian who is symbolically eaten by the boys he has sexually preyed on heavens to Michael Jackson!. But the sight of his death drives Catherine nuts. The mother of course is in denial of every unsavory trait Sebastian possessed.Brilliant florid dialog and two wonderful long soliloquies by Hepburn and Taylor are highlights. The symbolism is fairly obvious but works well within the context of Southern Gothic. All the supporting cast is fine. Taylor and Hepburn earned best actress Oscar nominations. Gore Vidal Tennessee Williams and his partner Frank Merlo are in the opening surgery scene. A fascinating story and some great performances.Special mention must be made of Gore Vidal's brilliant screenplay expanding the oneact play by Tennessee Williams who had nothing to do with the screenplay despite his billing.

	schema:reviewBody "This screen version by Joseph L Mankiewicz of Tennessee Williams' play isn't as highly thought of as it should be. It's not a classic and on occasions it comes over as crude and stilted but it also has many fine things going for it. Although he never really opens it out Mankiewicz gives it a fluency that isn't at all theatrical and although he often films scenes intimately and between only two characters he ensures it is photographed and cut in a very cinematic fashion.Unfortunately one of the two people on screen during these 'cinematic' sequences is Montgomery Clift who is at his worst here. It was after his accident and he looks as if he's in pain. When he walks it's as if there is a board up his back and he talks as if out of the side of his mouth. Luckily with him in these scenes is either Elizabeth Taylor or Katharine Hepburn or both and when they are on screen you don't pay too much attention to Clift.Dilys Powell said Elizabeth Taylor was born to play Tennessee Williams and she was right. Indeed this may be her best performance after Virginia Woolf. Catherine's lines don't have the kind of poetry in them that Violet Venable's does but Taylor finds a poetry of her own in her readings. She builds on her long speech at the end and is very moving even if Mankiewicz can't resist 'showing' us in flashbacks what Taylor is telling us as if he doesn't trust an audience to sit still and just listen to Taylor. They would have to in the theatre.As Violet Hepburn has the showier part and she milks it for all it's worth. It's a great piece of acting because Violet never seems to be acting though she tends to think of her life as a kind of performance something she has passed on to her homosexual son Sebastian. If the old adage 'my mother made me a homosexual' has any validity you don't have to look any further than here. She enters from above descending in her small baroque lift and Hepburn can see the comic potential in such an entrance. Moments later however she is recounting how the seaturtles were devoured by flesheating birds in the Galapogos and you can see just how dangerously unstable this woman really is.Any film that has acting of this calibre automatically qualifies as worth seeking out you forgive the lame work of Clift and Gary Raymond and draw a blind over Mercedes McCambridge though Albert Dekker is very fine but this qualifies on other grounds as one of the better Tennessee Williams adaptations he cowrote it with Gore Vidal as a flawed dated but strangely fascinating example of how Hollywood viewed homosexuality at the time negatively naturally but any face no matter how horribly distorted so long as it was in the public gaze was better than no face at all and as a serious addition to the Joe Mankiewicz canon.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to take your eyes off an impossibly beautiful 27year old Elizabeth Taylor especially in her skintight white bathing suit and the fact that she gives a powerhouse performance likely her best prior to Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is reason enough to watch this 1959 Gothic melodrama from the fulsome pen of Tennessee Williams. She plays Catherine Holly a mentally unstable young woman traumatized by a violent incident which ended with her cousin Sebastian's death last summer in a Mexican beach resort.Trapped in a mental hospital that recalls the bowels of the asylum presented in The Snake Pit ten years earlier she cannot remember what happened and is constantly drugged but manages to exhibit enough credibility to make Dr. Cukrowicz assess that she may not be disturbed enough to warrant a lobotomy. The procedure is being pushed by the late Sebastian's grande dame mother Violet Venable who wants to silence Catherine lest she reveal the shocking secrets of Sebastian's life and death. A doyenne of New Orleans society Mrs. Venable dangles a tempting carrot of a 1 million donation to Cukrowicz's hospital for brain research if the lobotomy is done.As was common under the production code in the 1950's and similar to what was done to dilute Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof the film only alludes to Sebastian's homosexuality using rather graphic symbolism to bring across the dramatic tension of the situation. In this case it works because it's consistent with the Baroque style of the entire movie. Taylor goes toetotoe with the formidable Katharine Hepburn playing against type as Mrs. Venable a cold and manipulative character whose flamboyant hypocrisy hides her own unsteady state. Each actress gets a showy monologue with Catherine's climactic description of that infamous summer the true capper of the story.Saddled with the purely observational role of Cukrowicz Montgomery Clift seems rather passive as he has to explain the more convoluted plot points in a becalmed manner. Coadapted for the screen by Gore Vidal and Williams the film is dialogueheavy as most of Williams' works are and director Joseph Mankiewicz All About Eve A Letter to Three Wives is a master at this type of character interplay. Jack Hildyard's crisp blackandwhite cinematography works well for this story as color would have emphasized the melodramatic excesses note how pale Taylor's violent eyes look. The only notable extras on the 2000 DVD are some vintage photo stills. Unfortunately this film was not included as part of the recently released sixfilm Tennessee Williams Film Collection.".

Not really the face of God have you but the symbolism of death his own death and a scary subreality that can only come from the mind of one of the greatest playwrights of any time Tennesee Williams.The play Garden District was probably something that was very difficult to adopt to film that's why Gore Vidal recently deceased as of this writing came in to assist him. This is a story that is certainly not for all audiences and those expecting Elizabeth Taylor to be like she was as Maggie in Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof won't find that here. Hepburn too has crossed the line from her witty comedies with Spencer Tracy into the bizarre a tale of carnal lust that uses the tale of sea turtles burying their eggs in the sand and the flesheating birds who wait for them to hatch as well as tales of using beautiful women to procure and the eventual cannibalism that destroys its dead protagonist.Huh? you ask. In this viewing out of about half a dozen I had to research other people's thoughts on the film as well and came up with the thought that people will see things differently as they do in many of Tennessee Williams' writings. Having seen most of his work I can only conclude that he was writing through a tortured soul even as a genius though as they say every genius has some touch of madness.The performances are outstanding although some may see them as a lot over the top. But seeing Taylor and Hepburn together is a film lover's dream and they play well off of each other with Montgomery Clift still recovering from that dreadful car accident forced to be more of an earpiece to their dramatics. This asks the question Who really is sane? and gives some frightening visuals of an old fashioned Bellevue like mental institution. The sight of a delighted crazy woman rocking violently as everybody laughs at the sight of Taylor threatening to jump off a stairwell may give some people nightmares yet you feel strangely sad for the crying man whose cards fell when Taylor made her way onto the stairwell of the men's recreation area.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1930's New Orleans a wealthy and eccentric older woman named Mrs. Venable Katharine Hepburn wants a surgeon Montgomery Clift to perform a lobotomy on her niece Elizabeth Taylor for reasons that become clear toward the end of the film. This macabre Tennessee Williams story with overlapping adult themes must surely have been a shock to audiences in 1959. The film provides a great vehicle for the talents of both Hepburn whose acting is engaging and Taylor whose performance is superb.The Mankiewicz script is very talky. The characters of both Hepburn and Taylor engage in lengthy and at times tedious monologues. In all that talking at least there are some really good lines. My favorite is near the beginning.

	onyx:emotionText "In 1930's New Orleans a wealthy and eccentric older woman named Mrs. Venable Katharine Hepburn wants a surgeon Montgomery Clift to perform a lobotomy on her niece Elizabeth Taylor for reasons that become clear toward the end of the film. This macabre Tennessee Williams story with overlapping adult themes must surely have been a shock to audiences in 1959. The film provides a great vehicle for the talents of both Hepburn whose acting is engaging and Taylor whose performance is superb.The Mankiewicz script is very talky. The characters of both Hepburn and Taylor engage in lengthy and at times tedious monologues. In all that talking at least there are some really good lines. My favorite is near the beginning.

I enjoyed this movie and it kept my attention even though I had read the play I knew the outcome. It is another fine story from the mind of Tennessee Williams. The movie sticks to the play unlike other Williams' movies like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. The only problem is that like so many other Tennesse Williams'stories depravity and decadence are central themes which make it difficult at times to really like any characters or develop a fondness for the story itself.".

I once thought fans that spoke of 'loving' a certain actress and being able to watchlisten to them all the time were having me on if not themselves but I have it for Elizabeth Taylor. I watch in awe as she spills out her character and imbues already dramatic scripts with even more involving and inspiring emotions. And she looks fantastic. I thought she looked amazing in the early institution scenes and then she is glammed up! A great play given the very best treatment here and if Montgomery Clift was suffering during his performance he is still very effective in what he is asked to do which as it involves mediating between the two ladies is no mean feat.

	schema:reviewBody "I have been watching movies since the early 1950s and the title Suddenly Last Summer has bounced around my brain a number of times but until I watched it yesterday on the Movies! channel I had no idea what it was all about or who was in it. It is set in 1937 New Orleans for some reason but nothing of that city is shown and it was likely filmed in a studio somewhere. As it begins we learn that a young doctor has perfected the technique of performing partial brain lobotomies as a way to calm otherwise crazy people where conventional treatments do not work.Now along comes a rich older woman who wants to hire the doctor to do the procedure on her 20something niece she is convinced that the young woman desperately needs this. Remarkably the girl's mother seems anxious to go along with it perhaps because of the large sum of money she stands to gain.All of this very distasteful because as soon as we meet the young woman as the doctor also discovers quickly there really isn't anything wrong with her. So what is this lobotomy all about? That is the real mystery here. Elizabeth Taylor looking beautiful in her mid20s is the young woman Catherine Holly. Her rich aunt is Katharine Hepburn as Mrs. Violet Venable. The young doctor is Montgomery Clift as Dr. Cukrowicz. Even though I was already familiar with all the actors I had not seen much of their work in movies. It was a pleasure to see all three of them. The acting is fine but some of the 1950s melodrama gets a bit much especially when the characters are talking in circles while carefully avoiding discussing the actual issue at hand. SPOILERS Ms Venable just wanted to shut Katherine up to protect her poet son Sebastian who died suddenly last summer while on a trip to Spain with Katherine. The official cause was heart attack but when pressed to remember we see a reenactment Sebastian was a homosexual and his mother didn't want that to be generally known. He would spend his time at the beach attracting young men and in a strange finish to his life he was chased and then the young men tore at his flesh.".

	schema:headline " Tennessee Williams tale of homosexuality Southern aristocracy and madness";
	schema:reviewBody "Suddenly Last Summer is a dark tale involving a New Orleans matriarch whose twisted relationship with her only son results in his murder. The matriarch is willing to spend millions in order to rewrite her son's history and those millions are earmarked to go toward lobotomizing her niece who knows the truth.The dysfunctional relationship between Violet Venable Katharine Hepburn and her late son Sebastian is apparent during her initial consultation with a neurosurgeon played by Montgomery Clift. She speaks of Sebastian in the present tense and it becomes obvious that Sebastian rather than her late husband was her primary love interest.Elizabeth Taylor portrays Catherine Ms. Venable's niece who was with Sebastian when he was killed. Catherine is well aware of Sebastian's sexual preferences and her statements to that effect provide the impetus for Violet to insist on ensuring her silence. She first has her admitted to a private sanitarium that has a no visitors policy then she contacts Dr. Cukrowicz and insists that Catherine needs a lobotomy in order to be at peace. In the end Cukrowicz puts the pieces of Catherine's alleged hallucinations together injects her with truth serum and allows her to tell the story of Sebastian's death hinting that the reason he was killed was because of his sexual involvement with one or more of the young men he used Catherine to attract.Freudian imagery abounds throughout this movie which is something that may be lost on modern audiences and may well offend those who are gay. The Freudian concept that homosexuals are made not born by being in the presence of an overbearing controlling female is reinforced in several scenes Violet maintains a Venus flytrap that she pampers in a glass house while feeding it live flies Violet describes a journey to the Galapagos Islands during which flesh eating birds attack newly hatched sea turtles and devour them. Violet embodies the devouring female archetype and the fact that she followed Sebastian to Asia when he decided to become a Buddhist monk instead of remaining with her dying husband makes this even more clear.Overall the movie is well made although Clift's character tends to be more subdued than would be expected and it's difficult to make Taylor's character less than glamorous. It makes no judgments toward homosexuality rather it depicts how the denial of reality can destroy those who insist on whitewashing the truth.".

	schema:reviewBody "What you must know if you haven't seen this is that Suddenly Last Summer is film noir in the extreme. You must be in the right mood for some serious drama before watching this. And don't expect some cutesy happy ending. If that's what you want watch Harvey. Harvey and Suddenly Last Summer are polar opposites of the same theme A family member wanting to commit a relative to an insane asylum for questionable reasons. The parallels are so distinct I wonder if Tennessee Williams set out to do this.I see no one else has written a review since Elizabeth Taylor's death on March 23 2011. Some people assumed that a woman with such flawless beauty could not possibly also be blessed with great acting talent. I was never one of them and this movie certainly proves she was a great actress. We all know of the difficulties child actors have transitioning to adult roles even for great ones such as Margaret O'Brien or Shirley Temple. This movie illustrates the challenge You must also be able to convey adult emotions like anger fear terror sometimes even madness. Taylor comes through in spades. It is interesting comparing the performances of Taylor and Katherine Hepburn who normally is renown for her radiance and vitality. Here it is Taylor who exudes vitality while Hepburn appears to be a sparkling personality with an empty soul. This was surely deliberate and took great acting skill not to mention humility to stand in Taylor's shadow. What I admire about Taylor's performance is its many layers. We hear about her long before she appears on screen that she is a basket case in need of a lobotomy. And at first we might believe this to be true but gradually she transforms her character as the truth unfolds. We learn that she is acting crazy more or less deliberately but why? It is not clear whether she wants Clift to believe her to be sane or insane or even whether she might actually want the lobotomy though in the end she fights against it with every ounce in her. The problem is Taylor doesn't even know the truth herself is afraid of the truth but must face it or face a lobotomy a powerful incentive. What you get is a multilayered dynamic performance. It reminds me of Marilyn Monroe in Bus Stop another great beauty who did really have great acting ability. The madness of the scenario brings to mind Shakespeare and Taylor's acting rises to the Shakespearian level.The threat of a lobotomy provides a powerful driving force in the plot but what really charges it up is the issue of Hepburn's potential donation of 1 million if the lobotomy is performed. Now you have the issue of misuse of psychiatric diagnostics for money for prestige for social convenience. Not every psychiatrist would have had the integrity of Clift to insist on digging for the truth. As Taylor's character unfolds we see a very real very alive human being whom we can relate to. Taylor has produced such empathy it is we who are threatened with a lobotomy and all the horrors this would mean. This is not electroshock therapy a more common cinematic device but a method to keep the body alive while killing the mind a truth we suspect and she realizes as she looks down into the pit of mad women. The movie is becoming a living nightmare.And so we find a very beautiful privileged actress who somehow finds within herself the full breadth and depth of human experience much as Marlon Brando did. Taylor did not live a charmed life. Despite the beauty talent and glamor she had more than her share of tragedy and illness though this came later. She was also the first great movie star to allow her real private life to be covered in the press honestly without the PR hokum. I don't think that it was because she craved fame which she had since she was a child unlike some some modern celebrities without a fraction of her talent. What you see in Suddenly is a very open honest vulnerable Taylor who is able to project her humanness onto the screen. This isn't something you can fake. Elizabeth Taylor was a great actress and a fine human being who lived an extraordinary life. You won't soon forget Suddenly. But you might need an antidote for its bitterness. I suggest you follow it by watching Harvey.".

	schema:reviewBody "New Orleans 1937.  Doctor Cukrowicz is summoned to the home of Violet Venable he is encouraged to go by his father who sees a ripe opportunity to get a significant amount of funding directly out of the rich widow.  Venable tells Cukrowicz of her niece Catherine who has been diagnosed as having a mental disease that causes her to have outbursts etc.  She wants Cukrowicz to carry out a lobotomy on Kathryn without question.  However Cukrowicz meets with Catherine and finds her trapped behind memories that she won't let herself remember.  He tries to draw out whatever her stepmother is so desperate to have cut out.I watched this with no prior knowledge of what it was about or any of the hidden themes that are brought out after viewing.  I suspect I was able to come to it clean' as a result.  The plot starts simply and I wasn't sure where it was going.  Then Mrs Venable is introduced and we learn of her desire to have Catherine lobotomised.  This is followed by the question what happened to Sebastion Venable's son that has sent Catherine mad and sent Mrs Venable to the point where she wants to cut it out of her memory.  This question looms large over the film and is very effective in driving the plot forward.The clues are given all along to what a messed up situation the whole thing is and the final 15 minutes are powerful despite some weaknesses.  The plot has talked up the romance part of the film between Catherine and Dr Cukrowicz I assume to try and cover the unpleasant business and make it easier on a fifties audience this takes away a little bit but didn't distract me too much from the central tale.Hepburn is magnificent in her role and her opening scene does much to captivate you for the rest of the movie.  Taylor is good but at times feels too polished to be in her character's predicament.  Clift was too stale for me and didn't really stand out when placed beside these two actresses going hell for leather for their roles.Overall I enjoyed this film.  The tension of the central questions is built on well with mystery and dark secrets hinted at constantly.

	onyx:emotionText "New Orleans 1937.  Doctor Cukrowicz is summoned to the home of Violet Venable he is encouraged to go by his father who sees a ripe opportunity to get a significant amount of funding directly out of the rich widow.  Venable tells Cukrowicz of her niece Catherine who has been diagnosed as having a mental disease that causes her to have outbursts etc.  She wants Cukrowicz to carry out a lobotomy on Kathryn without question.  However Cukrowicz meets with Catherine and finds her trapped behind memories that she won't let herself remember.  He tries to draw out whatever her stepmother is so desperate to have cut out.I watched this with no prior knowledge of what it was about or any of the hidden themes that are brought out after viewing.  I suspect I was able to come to it clean' as a result.  The plot starts simply and I wasn't sure where it was going.  Then Mrs Venable is introduced and we learn of her desire to have Catherine lobotomised.  This is followed by the question what happened to Sebastion Venable's son that has sent Catherine mad and sent Mrs Venable to the point where she wants to cut it out of her memory.  This question looms large over the film and is very effective in driving the plot forward.The clues are given all along to what a messed up situation the whole thing is and the final 15 minutes are powerful despite some weaknesses.  The plot has talked up the romance part of the film between Catherine and Dr Cukrowicz I assume to try and cover the unpleasant business and make it easier on a fifties audience this takes away a little bit but didn't distract me too much from the central tale.Hepburn is magnificent in her role and her opening scene does much to captivate you for the rest of the movie.  Taylor is good but at times feels too polished to be in her character's predicament.  Clift was too stale for me and didn't really stand out when placed beside these two actresses going hell for leather for their roles.Overall I enjoyed this film.  The tension of the central questions is built on well with mystery and dark secrets hinted at constantly.  The underlying themes add to it but you don't lose anything if you don't see them and the dark secret is powerful and meaningful even if it must do well by the censors of the day.  Glad I stumbled onto it.";

Violet very concerned about Catharine and her hurtful ramblings enlists brain surgeon Dr Cukrowicz to see if he will perform a lobotomy on the poor girl but as Cukrowicz digs deeper motives and facts come crashing together to reveal something far more worrying.As one expects from a Tennessee Williams adaptation this picture is very talky perhaps borderline annoyingly so? Yet it has to be said that for those willing to invest the time with it the pay off is well worth the wait. Suddenly Last Summer is an odd mix of campy melodrama and Gothic horror leanings a mix that personally doesn't quite hit all the intended spots. It could have been so different tho for if Gore Vidal and Joseph Mankiewicz had been given free rein back in this day of code restrictions well the picture would surely have been close to masterpiece status. This adaptation only gives us little snippets on which to feed we are aware of the homosexuality of the departed Sebastian and other hints that come our way include incest sadism and dubious class issues but ultimately such strong material is never fully formed.Elizabeth Taylor owns the picture as Catharine sultry with heaving bosom she does an excellent line in borderline nut case all woe is me martyrdom and her final scenes are what pays the viewer off for their patience. Katharine Hepburn plays Violet and manages to chew the scenery and spit it out it's an elegant performance but you really want more than we actually get! Montgomery Clift is the good doctor not one of his better performances because he isn't asked to expand the character just say his lines right look baleful from time to time and play off Taylor's lead job done really.It's a recommended film to a degree certainly one that simmers with an almost oppressive feel but if the film is one to revisit often?

Let me be the first to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only was the film wonderful but Guttenberg's against type portrayal of a downonhis luck actor who begins to doubt his heterosexuality in the face of tragedy managed to completely make me reevaluate his acting prowess.  His hissy fit in the scene where he finds out his girlfriend is leaving him for another man is absolutely hilarious as are his comic interactions with his burglarprisoner Lombardo Boyar which are both touching and funny. All in all a very good adaption of a very good book...one of the better independent films of the year from Steve Guttenberg of all people...who would have thought it?

The Jimmy Zoole that I envisioned was more of a neat conservative drawinsidethelines type of guy. That is boring. However Guttenberg's portrayal showed only a very narrow part of Zoole the needy unhinged and sleepdeprived man who refused to be burgled one more time. Unfortunately because little of the character's history made it into the screenplay the impression that I got was that Zoole was always a sadsack. And that's what doesn't make sense to me how could such a desperately miserable man have ever occupied that amazing loft or won the affection of such a smart and beautiful woman or had such wonderful friends not shown in the movie? I'm curious to see how versions of this story are played out on the stage. Perhaps my read of the novel differs from most. Nonetheless I was sorely disappointed by the film in spite of the powerful performance by Lombardo Boyer.".

Trust me if the highlight of your year is a oneman show of Hamlet with puppets you're in need of some serious help.Guttenberg tells us all this in the opening voiceover piquing both our interest and our sympathy. Well WHAT ELSE can go wrong? we wonder. Plenty. His best friend died a while back and his girlfriend Kate Cynthia Watros is leaving him moving out and spending New Year's Eve with new beau Fred Tom Wright instead. Ouch! And that's just the start of Jimmy's misery. Did I mention he's being evicted? All he wants to do is go home make a TV dinner and go to bed. Uh uh. Before we're done his cat dying will seem like GOOD NEWS relatively speaking.Kate walks in on a burglary the third to hit Jimmy in recent months yep same guy each time. Eddie the thief Lombardo Boyar astutely hides in the closet while Kate leaves a Dear John letter with that bummer of a P.S.. Then Jimmy comes home and they get into a fight about his Aunt Claire Shirley Knight his liking to be alone and a couple dozen other things.So Kate leaves. Then Jimmy finds Eddie hiding under the bed and just plain loses ithe ties up Eddie he's so pathetic he doesn't even have rope and duct tape to do it properly. Then he steps out to put in an obligatory appearance at his aunt's party. She gives him his monthly support check but balks at providing front money for any more writing projects good move I say.Number one on Jimmy's angst list is the fact that Eddie previously stole the novel he wrote. To make up for that when he gets back he proceeds to interview the guy I told you he wasn't thinking straight. Eventually they arrive at a sort of camaraderie kind of a male Vampire Lesbians of Sodom. He comes to regret inviting over Crazy Carmine A.J. Benza and a couple of his pals. I'm not gonna say what THEIR idea of fun is but it makes Jimmy's previous tales of woe pale by comparison.Watros is ideal as the kind misunderstood yet subject to random rants and raves girlfriend. Alas she's onscreen less here than in an episode of Titus but considering what goes down in that apartment perhaps that's for the best.Guttenberg utilizes a nice slow pacing throughout the soothing jazz and opera strains playing a nice counterpoint to the building tension. I was left wishing the relationship between Jimmy and Eddie two opposites that somehow attract had been explored further. Maybe in a sequelP.P.S. Your Girlfriend's Still Gone perhaps. The confinedness and isolation of the apartment are palpable and reminiscent of Rear Window. In this sordid downward spiral of a tale Guttenberg definitely puts the noir in film noir.".

	schema:reviewBody "I never walk out on a film well hardly ever. But this one prompted me to do so often..and finally I left.The original play I had seen in San Francisco many years ago and I remembering laughing and thoroughly enjoying the performances. However it was so long ago I can't remember who the actors were.Guttenberg's first problem is looking depressed. He can't do it without looking like someone trying to imitate a monkey's mouth. His forced emotion is both false and nearly laughable.His rages of anger however are totally believable and near demonic. If he is ever cast in a role as a demented killer he'll do well. But as a depressed performer whose girlfriend has left him and whose apartment is burglarized and who's cat is dead.....sorry.He also directed the film. If the performances of the other actors or the camera work is a reflection of his work as a Director then I was impressed.But it MUST be difficult for an actor to direct themselves. In this business where nobody dares say anything to a STAR. That's a shame because he needed input regarding his acting.OK I acknowledge that by leaving the film about 34 of the way through I am subject to but it got better  the ending was great  you missed the best part type of comments.I don't care. The rule of thumb for any form of communications is get them in the first paragraphten minutes and you can keep them.As for Guttenberg's adaptation of the original material he cowrote the screenplay it was a nice expansion of the original play which only had two actors and one set I believe. The film added both cast and locations. One actor I began to like was the woman who plays his rich Aunt. I can't find her name among the credits on www.imdb.com however.It's only because I liked the original play that I stayed that long. And I'm glad because AJ Benza plays a nelly queen according to the credits. And I can't stand AJ Benza let alone ANYONE playing a stereotype nelly queen in features.Cudos ? to Steve Guttenberg for getting this play filmed however. It's a success just by existing I guess. And it does make one look at him without thinking of Police Academy films.But ........ don't bother!".

But this one prompted me to do so often..and finally I left.The original play I had seen in San Francisco many years ago and I remembering laughing and thoroughly enjoying the performances. However it was so long ago I can't remember who the actors were.Guttenberg's first problem is looking depressed. He can't do it without looking like someone trying to imitate a monkey's mouth. His forced emotion is both false and nearly laughable.His rages of anger however are totally believable and near demonic. If he is ever cast in a role as a demented killer he'll do well. But as a depressed performer whose girlfriend has left him and whose apartment is burglarized and who's cat is dead.....sorry.He also directed the film.

Not to mention is face the whole time is either woe is me or his acting was just bad not like the character at all. I've seen high school kids act better. Where's Vito Antonucci and who the hell is Eddie Tesoro? Jesus they couldn't even get the names right. I don't even want to get started on Kate or Aunt Claire.About halfway through I had to shut it off. Sitting there for half of the movie was even too long. A kindergarten class play has better acting than this movie. Honestly this shouldn't have been a movie but rather a late night series if on screen at all. Hollywood directors really should read the books carefully and try to connect with the characters before they cast.I don't recommend this movie to anyone it wasn't funny it was sad to watch.

Bad casting. Bad acting. Poor use of the small budget it had. The only believable performance was by the fool from 'E' Network. I reached a point where I realized I would have hated this movie even without my prior knowledge of the story.

The only legitimate copy of this film I have seen was the mideighties release from ThornE.M.I. The true title is Corrupt any other copy is a crappy transfer Cop Killer and their has been no official D.V.D. release either. Any copy on this format is nearly unwatchable and horribly edited. Try and find the old eighties copy on ThornE.M.I. Stay away from others.Highly recommended.P.S. John Lydon's pop group Public Image Limited was supposed to score the soundtrack for this film. He even worked on the soundtrack with his band mate Keith Levene and Martin Atkins over the phone long distance. The original title of the film was to be The Order of Death. The unused music appears on the semiofficial release You are Now Entering A Commerical Zone album. Harvel Keitel plays an early prototype of his future Bad Lieutenant character in this film.".

Keitel plays Fred O'Connor a dysfunctional police officer who coowns a secret luxury bachelor pad with his partner bought with dirty money. The city is going through a series of cop killings and paranoia is rampant though O'Connor doesn't really seem all that concerned at first. He becomes a little jumpy when he finds himself being stalked by a mysterious weirdo John Lydon yes Johnny Rotten of Sex Pistols infamy and positively freaks out when he turns up on his doorstep claiming to be the cop killer.

But this is only the beginning in a film that keeps you guessing as mind games and battles of will ensue with some strange identity and relationship swapping almost worthy of legendary 70s headtrip 'Performance'. This strange film somewhere between a hard boiled genre crime movie and an arthouse puzzler is flawed but fascinating and should appeal to fans of Abel Ferrara and Wim Wenders especially the latters overlooked 'The American Friend'.".

O'Connor faces losing everything when Leo Smith John Lydon turns up at the apartment claiming to be the copkiller.Faithful adaptation of a remarkable book by Hugh Fleetwood. The book is mainly Lt. O'Connor's rant against the dangers of liberalism opening with O'Connor buying his hated New York Times  hated because he considers the perceived liberal attitude of the paper to be compassionate with everything that is weak sick and degenerate in society he explains this theory to New York Times journalist  and wife of Bob  Lenore. O'Connor defends his own corruption to Bob by stating that it is the banning of drugs that is corrupt. This isn't really expanded on in the film. In the book O'Connor wants drugs legalised so that the aforementioned weak sick and degenerate people will be willing slaves to their addictions and won't go out and mug an old lady or kill an old man to feed their illegal habit. The only place that Keitel can find the order he craves is in his strange unfurnished apartment  witness his annoyance at Mann not tidying up. Keitel is utterly outraged when the deranged Leo Smith corrupts his secret refuge.Lydon is perfectly cast at least as regards his public image to coin a phrase  insidious sickly and unAmerican looking strange kind of a guy. In the book his character is even sicker his initial appearance is particularly disquieting as he apparently eggs Keitel on to kill him as part of a weird quasisexual game. In reality Lydon was really a decent chap  quitting the Sex Pistols because he refused to make a record with Ronnie Biggs Lydon felt uncomfortable that Biggs had heisted working class money and coshed a railway employee for good measure his morality contrasting sharply with the media's portrayal of him at the time as public enemy number 1. In reality it was the British tabloid press and particularly the Sun who were out of step with decency  the Sun a newspaper read by the working class which appeared to hate working class people being in the 80s at least a right wing and sporadically racist paper it's hatred of its very readership culminated in its shocking coverage of the Hillsborough football disaster.Of course Lydon isn't an actor and he isn't quite as good as Keitel here. The mind games they enter into once Keitel imprisons Lydon in the apartment are pretty interesting stuff though  at turns sinister camp and affecting  a real head to head battle of wills reminiscent of Performance. It's peculiarly touching to see a crying whimpering Lydon at one point. There's a few moody shots of early 80s New York but mainly the action takes place in the apartment  it's the focal point for the whole film. Here Smith acts out his obsession with the police. He's apparently read a book written O'Connor later finds out by Bob's wife Lenore which argues that the police are the real enemy of order in that they inspire us to commit crimes so that we may be punished for them. Lenore is played by the European Nicole Garcia who's decidedly unAmerican views O'Connor finds flabbergasting. Also of note here is the soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. Recurring throughout is a country song based on a Tchaikovsky melody. O'Connor puts the song on his record player at the start of the film it's an album but we never get to hear the rest of the songs and its lyrics It's been so long since I last felt this way equate to scenes of O'Connor smoking expensive cigars and relaxing. We next hear the song when Bob tells him that he wants to quit the apartment You bought it so that you'd have something to feel guilty about. After that it's playing when O'Connor tortures Smith with a lit cigar  and so on. It's the same song but each time it's used with progressively more desperate images. What starts out as innocuous becomes more and more sinister  with O'Connor incapable of understanding what's happening to him before it's all too late.".

Unfortunately the movie gets bogged down in a glum talky ponderous quagmire of murky moralizing and pretentious pseudointellectual psychology. The strange tense homoeroticsadomasochistic relationship between our two twisted main characters could have produced some amazing heartracing fireworks but Roberto Faenza's slack direction a dry dialogueheavy script and the numbingly languid pacing sink this flick it gets off to a ripping start but promptly runs out of gas and stalls at the thirty minute mark. However neither Keitel nor Lydon are to blame for the film's failure to realize its potential. Keitel gives a typically potent and ontarget fiery portrayal of a gritty streetwise cop forceful vivid brooding and commanding Keitel's part here neatly foretells his even more overwhelming work as the titular filthy pig in the much better Bad Lieutenant. Although he's too puny slightly built and babyfaced to be a totally believable psycho Lydon nonetheless still gives a solid earnest and fairly creepy performance. A wellmeaning and not entirely worthless misfire this halfadmirable and halfaggravating effort overall qualifies as a frustratingly uneven missed opportunity.".

The masked psycho kills the cops by slashing their throats with a long serrated knife. On the scene of one of the killers victims he left a phony police badge. While all this is going on we see NYC police Let. Fred O'Connor Harvey Keitle who's on the take with his partner police officer Bob Carvo Leonard Mann and who together with Carvo is living a double life. The two cops masquerade around as high living drug dealers at a 400000.00 apartment overlooking Central Park. Everythings going well for the two plain clothes policeman until one afternoon when this weirdo Leo Smith John Lydon shows up at their apartment unannounced. O'Connor at first doesn't know what to make of this oddball since he feels that he somehow has the goods on him in his illegal drug dealings together with his partner. How else could Leo have known about his and Carvo's secret apartment and the double lives that they lead? Later on Let. O'Connor finds out that Leo comes from a very rich family who live in the town of Rhiencliff in upstate New York and is being looked for as a missing person by the entire police departments in both NYC  Rheincliff. Having him locked up in his apartment O'Connor goes up to Rhiencliff to see Leo's grandmother Margaret Smith Silvia Sidney on official business pretending that he's on the case to find her missing grandson. O'Conner also find an audio tape that Leo left there implicating him and his partner as corrupt cops. O'Connor feels that Leo who told him about the tape in the first place must have made other tapes as insurance to keep O'Connor from murdering him and making him disappear. The film then takes a turn where it's Leo not O'Connor who seems to be in control of the situation with O'Connor trapped in his own world of corruption and feeling that Leo had this planned all along. Later in an heated exchange between O'Connor and his partner Carvo at the apartment over his treatment and confinement of Leo O'Connor accidentally kills him and with Leo's help makes it look like Carvo was the victim of the police serial killer to throw the police off his trail. The movie starts getting even weirder when Leo tries to get O'Connor to murder Carvo's wife Lenore Nicole Garcia. Both Leo and O'Connor feel that Lenore had found about her husband and Let. O'Connor's corrupt activities and make their murdering her look like she killed herself. By now O'Connor is a totally destroyed man knowing that he was somehow manipulated by the clever Leo from the start. It's only a matter of time before the law that he was sworn to uphold and enforce will catch up with him and bring him before the bar of justice. It was both Harvey Keitel and John Lydon's performances that made the film Copkiller aka Corrupt well worth watching. The catandmouse game between the manipulator and manipulated kept you glued to the screen until the ending credits and made you overlook the films many faults and inconsistencies.".

The first two thirds are a fiendishly crafty minuet of sudden reversals the last is a sadomasochistic folie a deux that's closer to Pinter or Genet than Don Siegel. Lydon is shockingly effective as the pettish punk he ought to have a cat to stroke Harvey Keitel seems Harveyish for a while until you start noticing his hundred strokes of physical inventiveness. A Scotch glass smashed to bits shocks O'Connor with his own unconscious fury a pair of chopsticks O'Connor doesn't know how to use turn into Saharan spears crudely crucifying a spicy tuna roll. Sizing up the averages Keitel has the coolest resume of any contemporary actorsand O'Connor goes up in that gallery of screamlikeamoose Harvey angst right next to Matthew the Pimp the shylockpianist from FINGERS and that very bad Lieutenant.".

The first two thirds are a fiendishly crafty minuet of sudden reversals the last is a sadomasochistic folie a deux that's closer to Pinter or Genet than Don Siegel. Lydon is shockingly effective as the pettish punk he ought to have a cat to stroke Harvey Keitel seems Harveyish for a while until you start noticing his hundred strokes of physical inventiveness. A Scotch glass smashed to bits shocks O'Connor with his own unconscious fury a pair of chopsticks O'Connor doesn't know how to use turn into Saharan spears crudely crucifying a spicy tuna roll. Sizing up the averages Keitel has the coolest resume of any contemporary actorsand O'Connor goes up in that gallery of screamlikeamoose Harvey angst right next to Matthew the Pimp the shylockpianist from FINGERS and that very bad Lieutenant.";

	schema:reviewBody "Dear Harvey Keitelin the 80s your contemporaries like Pacino and De Niro were beginning to sell out. But not you. You just kept motoring on like a menace. Order of Death has another intense performance by you as a corrupt police detective. You made this film Harvey. Despite some tepid and uninspired direction by Robert Faenza you made this film so watchable. Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols turned in a decent performance. The film is a rather confusing drama about the nature of policemen and their impact on society. I wished Faenza and the writers used a more straightforward method to convey their message. Despite some powerful moments the film is a confused mess. The one scene where we are shown what your character thinks society cannot be taken over by the weak was way too short. Morricone's score was tense pounding and powerful. One of the musical cues in this score was used more than ten years ago by Morricone for Uomo de Rispettare. The score was used to great effect in the title sequence in which all the characters are introduced. But with all its drawbacks I am glad I watched this film. The cast and the score made it worth my time.Best Regards Pimpin.710".

	schema:headline " Who was the murderer?";
	schema:reviewBody "Copkiller 1983 is a very interesting film that takes your breath through the whole movie. It's about a Lieutenant Fred O'Connor  that is connected with a corruption. He met a young man Leo Smith who claimed that he was a Copkiller. During the whole film we know more about O'Connor's work his personal life about the problems of corruption. And we follow the relationships between the cop and a 'Copkiller' Smith who lived with him at that moment. 'Is he really the Copkiller as he possessed himself?' it is the main question that is whirling in our minds. On the one hand he seemed a poor guy who had to live with the cop because he was suspected in a row of murders as we might think. And a cop seemed to be a tyrant. He was more likely to be a murderer than Leo. But who knows? On the other hand a reason should be there according to which Leo Smith came to the cop. Is he an innocent guy that selfblamed himself in all possible crime or not? The film has an atmosphere of constant tension. When I was watching it I was changing my mind for several times. I was totally confused and shocked by the end of the film. I had only one questionWhy? Why was that man a killer? And how did he managed to arrange the situation in the suitable for him way? Harvey Keitel as O'Connor and John Lydon yes that punk from the Sex Pistols Johnny Rotten as Leo Smith were starred in this film. Lydon's acting surprised me very much his character is sympathized by the viewers and you can see every emotion on his face you can feel what he felt. He seemed to be a good guy a victim of the crazy cop O'Connor but he was also a circumspect artful and coolheaded man. But what about Keitel's character? Was he a dangerous man? Or was he cheated and betrayed? The situation is like in 'Reservoir Dogs' where he played one of the main roles. I think the film as a whole is perfect but sometimes there were moments that were overextended. The soundtrack is awesome because I'm a fan of Ennio Morricone and his music always corresponds to the events of the film. The ending is unpredictable and I recommend you not to be distracted from the film otherwise you'll lose the plot the thread of the story. To sumup Copkiller is a great crime thriller film which is well worth seeing.".

The story is rather bizarre because pretty much from the outset you realize Smith is the perp who slashes the throats of New York City policemen but then he shows up at O'Connor's apartment and simply confesses to his crimes. I suppose it was necessary to set up the rest of the disjointed story seeing as how Fred and his partner Leonard Mann were into some heavy duty drug dealing of their own keeping an expensive Central Park West apartment with their illicit drug money. Somewhere along the line the logic needed to convince the viewer that Keitel's character was unraveling just didn't seem to make it. Leo Smith's preposterous set up for O'Connor to take the fall as the cop killer would have been more effective if the psychological angle had been explored more effectively.

The script to the Hot Chick is surprisingly good and wellorganized though it's premise is basically a raunchier riff on 80s body switch movies like viceversa and freaky friday without any moralizing. It may not be original similar to my other favorite comedy so far this year old school and it may not win any oscars  but it's funny follows an established formula well and doesn't deteriorate in the third act like a lot of comedies I've seen as of late into moralizing or seemingly tacked on drama. Rob Schneider and Anna Farris are incredibly funny together. Watch for a cameo by Adam Sandler. If youre in the mood for citizen kane or next year's oscar winners look elsewhere. If you're in the mood for good dumb fairly raunchy fun to watch with a couple of friends  this movie's great.".

It's not going to win an oscar but it's certainly far from the movie I expected to see.  Sure there were the cliches popular blonde cheerleaders fat chicks with food in their hands at all times scary goths...but somehow they worked together. It turns out that those cliches are simply empty pictures that we get of other people.  Who know a Rob Schneider movie could manage to point that out??As for Mr. Schneider....well he was pretty darn good.  I thought it would be incredibly silly watching him as a girl.  It was at times but overall I think this movie pulled out some of his best comic acting.  He was able to be sensitive and funny and pull it off believably.  I'd like to see him at least nominated for his role The other actors in the movie...mostly a bunch of nameless beauties...also pulled their weight.  The characters were pretty well fleshed out which was nice to see since my last movie was MAID IN MANHATTEN where no thought at all seemed to have been put into character development.  Matthew Lawrence was looking hot as usual I give the movie 9 out of 10 stars.  See it if you want to laugh.  It's actually worth the money ".

Still I enjoyed this film very much. When Clive Rob Schneider was eating nachos I thought to myself Oh gross! However when Jessica Rachel McAdams and Clive's bodies switched I was reminded of a 2003 movie starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan. Before I wrap this up I'd like to say Rob Schneider scores big laughs here! Also watch for a special appearance by Adam Sandler. Now in conclusion I highly recommend this wildly funny comedy that is raunchy at times to any Rob Schneider fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for lots of laughter so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it.".

The next day Jessica finds out she's switched bodies with Clive. She tries to tell her best friend April about it but she doesn't believe her at first. Throughout the movie a lot of hilarious situations happen such as Jessica trying to use the restroom standing up and getting her boyfriend to believe.

The delightful Rachel McAdams handles both her characters very well but is especially fun after the switch. It's a shame she's given so little screen time as she makes for a fine villain.The jokes aren't exactly plentiful but they're funny for the most part. What came as a surprise to me was the lack of crass humour and the fact the film had so much heart. The scenes with Jessica and her budding crossdresser kid brother Booger were underplayed nicely and were downright subtle by Schneider movie standards. The pep talk to the unhappy mother the locker room talk letting April down gently  it was all rather touching.I'm surprised so few people like this one but then again I enjoyed Deuce Bigalow. . .".

	onyx:emotionText "Delightfully stupid fluff The Hot Chick might be marred by Rob Schneider's eversoslightly annoying characterisation but it has many other good things going for it.Anna Faris is good as usual even if she does play the same role in everything she's in. The delightful Rachel McAdams handles both her characters very well but is especially fun after the switch. It's a shame she's given so little screen time as she makes for a fine villain.The jokes aren't exactly plentiful but they're funny for the most part. What came as a surprise to me was the lack of crass humour and the fact the film had so much heart. The scenes with Jessica and her budding crossdresser kid brother Booger were underplayed nicely and were downright subtle by Schneider movie standards. The pep talk to the unhappy mother the locker room talk letting April down gently  it was all rather touching.I'm surprised so few people like this one but then again I enjoyed Deuce Bigalow. . .";

I didn't read all of Dahl's books but I read most of them. I've also seen most of the movies based on his books. Out of all the Roald Dahl books I read as child I would say that 'Charlie And The Chocolate Factory' is my favorite but 'James And The Giant Peach' is my second favorite. The reason why I would say these two books are my favorites is because they're both about children who live miserable lives until a magical experience changes their lives forever and both end up becoming the luckiest kids in the world. For Charlie his life changes with a tour of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory but for James it's with a magical giant peach and group very friendly creatures.I first remember hearing about this movie back in late 1996 when it was released in America during the Christmas holidays and I was very excited about it but unfortunately I had to wait until the Easter Holidays before this movie arrived in Australia. I certainly loved it. James's two horrible aunt's who are nothing except cruel and nasty. Are as horrible in the movie as they are in the book.I really loved the creatures from the peach which I remember from the book James describing them as The friendliest creatures in the world. These creatures include Grasshopper Earthworm Centipede Ladybug Spider and Glowworm. My two favorite character's are Spider because her French accent made her a very smooth character and Centipede because of his sense of humor. I also liked the songs. My favorite was We're Family which the creatures use to express how much they love James. I certainly believe these creatures are the best family any child could have. So for anyone who loved Roald Dahl's books as a child you must...must see this film!".

And the blend of live action and stopmotion animation is a delight. The songs incorporated in this story is not very memorable but sweet and fit their purpose. And you simply have to love to hate Margoyles and Lumley in their parts as the aunts from hell. They treat poor James so horribly that I thought that Cinderella had it easy! Compared to nightmare before Christmas I actually liked this movie better. It has more of a heart even if the story itself may be just a bit less interesting and inventive. There are so many good scenes but among the highlights is the arctic adventure and the New York sequence. But mind you the opening is very deceptive and might scare younger parts of the audience. Otherwise a mustsee!!!".

And the blend of live action and stopmotion animation is a delight. The songs incorporated in this story is not very memorable but sweet and fit their purpose. And you simply have to love to hate Margoyles and Lumley in their parts as the aunts from hell. They treat poor James so horribly that I thought that Cinderella had it easy! Compared to nightmare before Christmas I actually liked this movie better. It has more of a heart even if the story itself may be just a bit less interesting and inventive. There are so many good scenes but among the highlights is the arctic adventure and the New York sequence. But mind you the opening is very deceptive and might scare younger parts of the audience. Otherwise a mustsee!!!";

For instance what was that giant rhino and if it was just smoke and noise how did it eat the parents? What was the mechanical shark? Where did Pete Postlethwaite's character come from?

The only warning I would give is there is a bit too much violence for very small kids and the ending is a bit silly for adults.This is a musical which I did not expect and the songs are nothing special.

So many parts of the book were missing and sorely missed. I was distraught that the Cloud Men who appear during the best part of the book were replaced by ghost pirates. Ghost pirates have been done too many times but how many times have you seen Cloud Men? And what was with that mechanical shark and the rhino in the clouds? In the book the rhino which killed James' parents escaped from the zoo but in the movie it just appears out of nowhere. And then we have Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker who were done away with early on in the book somehow went across the Atlantic ocean in an old car. All I have to say is What?Randy Newman music is good in stuff like Toy Story movies but here it'll make you be thankful for the fast forward button. The songs really have no reason for being there and you won't miss a thing when you skip them.Aside from that this was a pretty fine film but why did the writers stray so much from the book? True a movie adaptation doesn't have to follow everything in the book it's based on like 'Willy Wonka' but it needs to follow just enough. But I did like the Centipede.

	schema:reviewBody "i just watched a quality film named james and the giant peach i have to say i was very impressed on all levels of the film the acting was good the soundtrack was awesome by a couple of good medleys by randy newman the story was quite interesting but above what intrigued is that the character of james is a character many people cant identify with. now some idiot might say what identify with a kid who gets converted to small size and spends his adventures inside a giant peach with insects at his friends? lol it's that kind of narrow thinking by a narrow critic that tries to subdue the great qualities and messages the film has and i will explain them all and you will see this film is not just a film for kinds to enjoy but adults too adults who don't have any inspiration to follow their dreams like james does.storyjames paul terry is a nice and quite moral little boy who has two loving parents. while near the beach he and his mom get killed although this is not shown since it's a pg film by a rhinoceros. yes this is a fantasy film in part and there are many magical elements in the film. james custody then is then taken over by two ugly aunts aunt spiker joanna lumley from absolutely fabulous fame and aunt sponge miriam margolyes who are classic examples of adults who abuse their children. they are the classic example of the trash and evil nature that exist in all wretched adults who seek exploit others for their wealth. in fact james's aunts use him as basically a slave to work around the house. they starve him and feed the breadcrumbs that are in the trash. they yell at him when james wants to make new friends and talk to kids who he can't relate to. nah it doesn't get much lower than quality of life aunt sponge and aunt spiker have on james. one day a mysterious man gives james a mysterious bag full of crocodile tongues I believe which he says are magic and can make James dreams come true. In this case James dream was to go to New York City and see Empire State Building. It was actually both James parent's dreams and James dream. However even though James parent's are long gone James still wants to go to New York an accomplish the dream he and his parents set out to do. This is one impressive kid he has a big heart and the kind of determination that almost no adults have nowadays. That's one lesson of the film right there  which is not to give up on one's dream it's literally embodied in this great kid.So this special bag of magic combines with a small peach to grow into a gigantic peach which Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker capitalize for their own selfish profits!!!! Now if you think this made James's life any easier youd be wrong. Nope James's life continues as before even worse as his rich selfish Aunt have become greedier and more manipulative and more vindictive. It's hard to believe that these aunts are the blood relative of James. Now before I go on I couldn't help but think of James and Harry Potter. Sure Harry Potter was an orphan but he and James are taken in by their slimy relatives who basically want to exploit and abuse them without any rights whatsover. Potter eventually escapes his vile relatives and so does James. Potter becomes one of the most loved characters at Hogwarts and James also near the end without revealing too much becomes one of the most loved kids in the world. Anyhow James interests in the peach grows huge to the point with the aid of the magic bad of tongues  James becomes magically converted to small size and invades the beach. Inside the beach James discovers a group of zany characters all symbolizing common day insects who have now made James the center of attention. James meeting the characters of Mr. Grasshopper Simon Callow Mr. Centipede Richard Dreyfuss Ms. Ladybug Jane Leeves from Frasier Ms. Spider Susan Sarandon learns that they have been watching him as he is mistreated by his aunts and know that James dreams of going to New York City. Eventually James learns that the characters not only want to go with him but they are going to help him on his journey as well. This is a great movie about friendship as well. Let's face facts it's not likely James would have gone to New York on his own but these group of wonderful friends give the help and encouragement to do it when he needs it.When James and the group decide on a plan to go to New York City they're journey is stalled by several dangerous adventures which include a metallic shark dead caribbean pirates and the hazardous condition which threaten to end their journey. However that isn't stopping anyone and James and his friends as a group are determined to make it New York and James is determined to make his and his parents dream come true....As you can see you can describe the movie any better than better and the movie itself is loaded with amazing special effects that elevate this entertaining fantasy world that James has now come into contact with. In fact when I first looked at the effects I thought I was watching another classic fantasy film like in The Nightmare Before Christmas and guess what both films were directed by the same great director Henry Selick. I was success and an eye for greatness embodied in fantasy is a signature for Selick. He really outdoes himself here.Sony Imageworks and a trio of great animators provide the stop motion technology and animation that make the world of James and The Giant Peach so fantastic. Speaking of fantastic the voice talents in this film are all great with Sarandon Dreyfuss  Leeves and David Thewlis as Mr. Earthworm are great you can tell that they captured the characters really well but the person who outshines them is Paul Terry as James he give's quite a performance and I couldn't think anyone better to do the role he did.So as you can see James and The Giant Peach is far from being just a kids flick it's that kind of stupid attitude that shows the true ignorance of so called critics who we'll miss out on the many meanings of films like James and The Giant Peach. In fact one critic even mentioned that the film brings up ideas by Karl Marx for example the relationship of the slave and master which are true in some regard but above this a film that really does capture the spirit of having a dream and not quitting until he or she achieves that dream because as you watch the ending you can see in the ending that James's dream really affects many people not just himself.I could go and on about how great James and The Giant Peach but I think I've nailed everything good about it all that's left now is to recommend the film to those who haven't seen it.DVD DetailsAh the DVD is excellent coming up with several extra featuresCommentaryBehind the scenes on the making of the movie A special music video by Randy Newman who wrote several songs for the movie A beautiful transfer of the movie shown in letterbox format.Theatrical trailer About 13 character sketches on the characters themselves giving a glimpseinto the artistic process of the film Dolby Digital Surround sound.As you can see a good DVD definitely worth checking out especially if you want more details about the film.".

Many critics and fans of Roald Dahl alike were amazed about how faithful this movie was to the book but there are two problems that I do have with this adaptation.1 The beginning was quite dark and might frighten younger kids along with other scenes.2 The rhino in the sky and the scene where James battles it wasn't explained enough. That's it for the criticism.The positive aspects of this movie were excellent. The live action sets and the stopmotion animation have an astounding charm to the book. The character designs are pretty unique and the Jack Skellington cameo as the captain of the skeletons was amazing. The acting is very superb. The stopmotion insects were good the two mean aunts named Spike and Sponge were tolerable and the main character James is very likable. Even the action is very good. Musicsongs written by Randy Newman The Toy Story trilogy The Princess and the Frog were surprising good.

	schema:reviewBody "The 1996 Disney filmization of Roald Dahl's first book for children 1961's James and the Giant Peach is a delightful confection that like its original should prove as much fun for the adults as the kiddies. The film hews fairly closely to its source material with some important differences and really is quite the exemplar of modernday animation arts. In it we are introduced to James Henry Trotter an orphaned boy whose miserable existence with his two witchlike aunts takes a decided turn for the better when a mysterious old man gives him a bagful of magical green crystals. These crystals cause the previously barren peach tree in his front yard to grow the titular giant fruit and James soon meets inside the stone of the fruit six new friends giants all a grasshopper a spider an earthworm a glowworm a ladybug and a centipede the book's silkworm character for some reason has been omitted. The seven make a hazardous transAtlantic journey to NYC aboard the peach a journey that tests the mettle of each of the team indeed. The film differs from Dahl's book in that the journey to NYC is a goal rather than a happy accident. The film also tones down the book's violence James' aunts are not killed in the film turns the shark into some kind of killer robot and most unwisely drops the entire sequence with the Cloud Men in favor of a haunted pirate ship not at all present in Dahl's text. The nature of the rhino that ate James' parents is also strangely much altered. The filmmakers have added some musical numbers to the mix and although Randy Newman's charms are usually lost on me I found his five contributions here to be quite entertaining. The picture blends live action stopmotion animation and what looks to be in James' dream animated collages seamlessly and effectively and the whole production really is something of a technical marvel. Despite the changes this is one very winning entertainment indeed.".

Then a giant James picks the peach out of its center with now tiny set of characters including himself and we see he is on a larger peach.Its wonderful especially since that same peach elsewhere appears in such suggestive sexuality that I am amazed it was allowed a PG and that only for frightening images.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

	schema:reviewBody "A British orphan's James Henry Trotter dreams of emigrating to New York City are scuppered when his parents are killed surprisingly by a rhinoceros who appears 'from nowhere'. As a result he is forced to live with his two spiteful aunts Spiker  Sponge who treat him like a labourer and feed him very bad food. One day James receives a peach from a mysterious stranger. He explores the inside and enters in a strange world which may lead to his dreams coming true again. James  The Giant Peach is based on Roald Dahl's weakest novel. Tim Burton and Henry Sellick's film adaption is a larger disappointment compared to the book. I of course mean no offence to them as their other films The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline prove a lot better than this garbage. Here are the reasons why James  The Giant Peach is toxic. What you as a viewer are analysing as you watch the film is a synopsis which is exactly the same as in the novel completely random lost and quite frankly dumb. There is no reason why a rhino would eat a human being or two as shown in the film and in England as well. I'd probably understand if it was from a zoo but that's where the characters belong. This brings me onto the next bad point the acting. It is abysmal. There are too many repeated lines i.e. the aunts stating 'Work work work' and lines such as 'How dare you disagree' said over and over again. Anybody who writes a screenplay needs to think carefully about the dialogue you use. Joanna Lumley was so much better as Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous and Victoria's mother in The Corpse Bride. But it's Paul Terry who makes a huge mess of the film. He overacts and quotes some of the worst lines in cinematic history. Even the songs cannot grow any excitement. Instead they include the most overrated melodies and overrepeated songs. That's The Life? It'll tire anybody sitting on a seat in a cinema and cause buttache. The songs are absolutely abysmal and the film is simply the worst to have been associated with Walt Disney Pictures distributor the second being the equally toxic Pocahontas whose songs ain't as bad as on this. Good animation work though.".

	onyx:emotionText "A British orphan's James Henry Trotter dreams of emigrating to New York City are scuppered when his parents are killed surprisingly by a rhinoceros who appears 'from nowhere'. As a result he is forced to live with his two spiteful aunts Spiker  Sponge who treat him like a labourer and feed him very bad food. One day James receives a peach from a mysterious stranger. He explores the inside and enters in a strange world which may lead to his dreams coming true again. James  The Giant Peach is based on Roald Dahl's weakest novel. Tim Burton and Henry Sellick's film adaption is a larger disappointment compared to the book. I of course mean no offence to them as their other films The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline prove a lot better than this garbage. Here are the reasons why James  The Giant Peach is toxic.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Al Adamson's most popular masterpiece is often both revered and reviled but I'm not ashamed to say that I like it. For fans of the old Universal monster mashes of the 1940s this film sort of updates the exploits of Count Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster to the modern times of the late '60s and early '70s. What's interesting is that it was never intended as such when the movie was first conceived...Originally begun in 1969 producer Sam Sherman and director Adamson wanted to make a biker flick which would kind of be a semisequel to their recent SATAN'S SADISTS hit movie. They started shooting with Russ Tamblyn picked to reprise his role of a motorcycle hoodlum and then added a new plot where a mad doctor would be conducting weird experiments on young girls having his deformed servant stalk them with an ax supplying their blood to the doctor. At this point the film was going under a title of THE BLOOD SEEKERS or BLOOD FREAKS and then later it was decided to consider the crazed scientist to be none other than Dr. Frankenstein so the tentative title became BLOOD OF FRANKENSTEIN. But still the concept changed and eventually came to include the marketable characters of Dracula and the Frankenstein Monster  and over a course of three years footage was added or changed or deleted in order to create what's now known as Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN 1971. Whew! In the finished movie Count Dracula played by a deliciously incompetent curlyhaired  goatee'd stockbroker named Roger Engel adopting a dopey pseudonym of Zandor Vorkov digs up the comatose Frankenstein Monster 7' 4 accountant John Bloom and makes a deal with the elderly Dr. Frankenstein. The infamous doctor played by an aged J. Carrol Naish in his last role who has trouble reading cue cards and whose dentures can be heard clacking away as he delivers idiotic dialog is operating under the phony moniker of Dr. Duryea and runs a Creature Emporium Sideshow at a local amusement park. The show merely serves as a front for his gruesome blood experiments which he conducts down in the basement. Duryea frequently injects a serum into an oversized halfwit named Groton played by horror veteran Lon Chaney Jr. now sadly bloated and ravaged from years of alcohol abuse transforming him into a mad zombie. Growling and prowling under the boardwalk on the beach at night with an ax Groton decapitates young girls for his master's sinister plans. Regina Carrol wife of director Adamson plays an older sister of one of the female victim's who meets up with overaged hippie Anthony Eisley to find out what happened to the girl but gets tangled up in the web of Frankenstein and Dracula. Angelo Rossitto who costarred with Bela Lugosi in the '40s is also on hand as a shady dwarf who takes tickets outside of Dr. Duryea's Creature Emporium. The one casualty of the final film who gets a raw deal is Russ Tamblyn whose few surviving scenes from the original biker fiasco now seem out of place in a revamped movie about monsters and maniacs.Okay  technically this is a bad film there's no way to get around that. But it's also a good deal of fun if you take it in the right spirit. It's colorful groovy and is a final showcase for seasoned horror pros Lon Chaney and J. Carrol Naish even if they are on their last legs. Despite the fact that Lon could barely talk and therefore remained mute for the movie much to his credit he is still able to elicit sympathy and pathos in his scenes. For fans of the old monsters it's a kick to see updated re early '70s manifestations of Dracula and the Monster as they arrive into the 20th century Dracula not only looks like a mod he actually speaks in a voice that echos through a loudspeaker don't ask me why and shoots death rays from his ring the murderous monster has a mashedpotato face that looks like it was stung by a horde of a thousand bees and he even gets to strangle none other than Forrest J. Ackerman celebrated editor of FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND magazine! The final clash of the titans at the end of the film is pretty awesome considering it was filmed with a practically zero budget and was added as an afterthought. You have to be one of those viewers who get it when it comes to appreciating gradeZ lowlevel exploitation trash cinema  but if you do this is as good as they come and is a cult classic of its type. 12 out of ".

Angelo Rossitto who costarred with Bela Lugosi in the '40s is also on hand as a shady dwarf who takes tickets outside of Dr. Duryea's Creature Emporium. The one casualty of the final film who gets a raw deal is Russ Tamblyn whose few surviving scenes from the original biker fiasco now seem out of place in a revamped movie about monsters and maniacs.Okay  technically this is a bad film there's no way to get around that. But it's also a good deal of fun if you take it in the right spirit. It's colorful groovy and is a final showcase for seasoned horror pros Lon Chaney and J. Carrol Naish even if they are on their last legs. Despite the fact that Lon could barely talk and therefore remained mute for the movie much to his credit he is still able to elicit sympathy and pathos in his scenes. For fans of the old monsters it's a kick to see updated re early '70s manifestations of Dracula and the Monster as they arrive into the 20th century Dracula not only looks like a mod he actually speaks in a voice that echos through a loudspeaker don't ask me why and shoots death rays from his ring the murderous monster has a mashedpotato face that looks like it was stung by a horde of a thousand bees and he even gets to strangle none other than Forrest J. Ackerman celebrated editor of FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND magazine! The final clash of the titans at the end of the film is pretty awesome considering it was filmed with a practically zero budget and was added as an afterthought. You have to be one of those viewers who get it when it comes to appreciating gradeZ lowlevel exploitation trash cinema  but if you do this is as good as they come and is a cult classic of its type. 12 out of ";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't care what anyone says Al Adamson's Dracula vs. Frankenstein is loads of fun to watch and is very entertaining! Adamson is one of those directors that you either love or hate and I happen to love him!Dracula vs. Frankenstein is a throwback to the Universal age of horror films with some biker moviemusicaldrug movie ingredients thrown in. J. Carrol Naish and Lon Chaney Jr. are the classic actors thrown in as a tribute to the golden days of horror. Chaney isn't halfbad as murderous Grotto given that he's a mute the entire movie but Naish as Dr. DurayDr. Frankenstein is inexcusably wooden. This would be the last role for both of them. Adamson regulars Russ Tamblyn Regina Carrol Greydon Clark and Gary Kent are along for the ride as well! Tamblyn is not used very much but does strike a presence as Rico a mean biker who attempts to rape a girl on the boardwalk! I love Regina Carrol dearly and she is fabulous in what could be her best role that I've seen as Judith Fontaine a Vegas showgirl who sings a great song! who travels to Venice California to find her missing sister. Anthony Eisley is her love interest an aging hipster who is anything BUT hip check out his tooth necklace!. Clark is Weird a hippie who spends his time going to protests and venturing into Dr. Duray's Creature Emporium with his girlfriend Samantha. Gary Kent is seen briefly as the boyfriend who gets axed by Grotto on the beach! Now for the monsters Dracula is played by Zandor Vorkov an accountant with a whiteboy afro and Frankenstein is played by Bmovie big boy John Bloom whose makeup is...original to say the least.The plot is sort of weak the acting is a bit above average the scares minimal if not invisible and production values are cheap. Lots of people say that this movie should have played on MST3K. But who says this movie can't be entertaining? In my opinion a bad movie is one that can't entertain you in any possible way see my review of Demented!. Dracula vs. Frankenstein is striking in its ineptitude and unforgettable in its cheap presentation.".

	schema:headline " A Fun Schlocky Horror Film";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film on the Elvira mistress of the darkness show  sort of like the Joe Bob Briggs thing on TBS. I was about 5 or 6 when I saw it and like many of the movies I saw on that show it left a permanent imprint in my brain so I had to buy it and watch it again.Now that I have seen it again I must say that it is still a lot of fun despite being a really terrible movie.  The reason this one works and plays as a funbad movie instead of a badbad movie is because of it's pacing. It moves from scene to scene very quickly and most scenes have something funny or exciting going on. It never bores or wears out it's welcome.The story makes almost no sense. something about a descendent of doctor Frankenstein making a blood serum and killing people but not killing them. I could not decipher it at all. There is also count Dracula running around with the Frankenstein monster and using him as sort of a henchmen. I think this all ties together somewhere but I did not see more than a small connection.One of the funniest things about this movie is the fact that Dracula looks just like Frank Zappa. Another great thing is the way the Frankenstein monster looks. his head is all misshapen and looks like it is about to explode. You have never seen Dracula or Frankenstein look so wacky and the strangeness of the way they look adds to the films originality.This movie has lots of hilarious sequences.. lots of hippie subculture stuff and a cool psychedelic nightclub dancing scene. The Violence is pretty tame even for the time nothing like an H.G. Lewis movie for example so even those with weak stomachs will not be offended by it. It's a fun goofy movie but not really shocking at all.The overall production quality of the movie is a mixed bag. Some of the lighting in is truly unforgivable. There are scenes where it is so dark that you can barley make out any shapes. On the other hand the direction is pretty competent at least Adamson never slows the pace down long enough to bore anybody and there is nothing amateurish about the way he handles the scenes. He knows all the tricks to keep the budget down and he uses them liberally while still managing to keep them from being overly noticeable. Adamson was not a master of cinema or anything but at least in this movie he was better than many of his contemporary's working in the same genre take a look at Ted V. Mickles The Astro Zombies for a movie that is truly butchered by it's directorThe acting is also slightly better than some of the acting in other low grade American horror movies from the early seventies and late sixties and much better than I was led to believe. Adamson has a knack for grabbing professional actors with experience to play some of the roles. The guy that plays Dracula is pretty bad but when you realize that he was actually the filmmakers stock broker it makes his performance seem a little better. I was even impressed with the sad final performances of Lon Chaney Junior and J. Carrol Naish. They were obviously not in their prime and no these are not great performances but both still carry some screen presence and really add to the movies credibility.Don't get me wrong it's a bad movie probably one of the worst ever but it has a few good qualities here and there. I would definitely recommend this one to somebody looking for a fun schlocky horror movie with lots of unintentional humor.".

Lon Chaney Jr. in his last role is Frankenstein's moron assistant who obediently fetches the heads of young girls.  Russ Tamblyn West Side Story tom thumb plays an aging biker. Even Jim Davis Jock Ewing from Dallas has a part in this disaster. And Forest J. Ackerman editor of Famous Monsters of Filmland is one of the monster's victims along with Anthony Eisley The Navy versus the Night Monster.Adamson also manages to insult several famous props from classic films some of the lab equipment he used is from The Bride of Frankenstein. Adamson's busty blond wife Regina Carrol is bitten by Dracula played by an actor named Zandor Vorkov who looks like Frank Zappa in Kiss makeup. Frankenstein also has a dwarf assistant played by Angelo Rossitto who starred in the bizarre 1932 film Freaks.  All in all a remarkable film from the man who gave the world Blood of Ghastly Horror.".

Zandor Vorkov looks ridiculous in his afro goatee and white greasepaint but he gives a unique and interesting performance as Count Dracula and one that is not to be ashamed of. Likewise Regina Carroll Jim Davis Angelo Rossito Russ Tamblyn and the rest of the cast do their best to give this essentially silly patchwork a credible aura. Compare any of these actors with say the bored listless Brad Pitt in the abominable Troy for which he probably took home a 10 million dollar paycheck to see what I mean.Producer Sam Sherman a witty intelligent and erudite man provides one of the best audio commentaries that I have ever heard on the DVD of Dracula vs. Frankenstein. He readily admits that both he and Adamson did not make the kind of movies they would have preferred to make but given the budgets and conditions under which they were compelled to work tried to give their audiences the biggest possible bang for their buck.

The film then switches to a beach near an amusement park in Las Vegas. Jodie Fontaine Maria Lease is wandering around on her own when a big ugly guy called Groton Lon Chaney Jr. as Lon Chaney chops her head off with an axe. The film then switches to the Vegas strip where Jodies sister Judith Fontaine the director's wife Regina Carrol is a headlining act we see her performance for a few minutes as the film becomes a low rent MGM musical. Afterwards she discusses Jodie with Sargeant Martin Jim Davis from the missing persons bureau Judith doesn't receive much encouragement  decides to investigate Jodies disappearance herself. Meanwhile Jodies decapitated head has been reattached to her body by Dr. Duryea J. Carrol Naish who just happens to be the last living member of the Frankenstein family  now conducts his experiments from an amusement park attraction called 'Dr. Duryea's creature emporium' which exhibits various freaks. One night Count Dracula turns up  convinces Frankenstein to reanimate the monster. Judith teams up with a guy named Mike Howard Anthony Eisley a guy known as Strange Greydon Clark  his girlfriend Samantha Anne Morrell  they eventually stumble across the truth which be honest I don't really understand  have to fight for their very lives against Count Dracula  his silly looking laser beam shooting ring both Frankenstein's monster  mad scientist Groton a dwarf named Grazbo Angelo Rossitto  a rapist biker named Rico Russ Tamblyn whew what a crazy film  I've barely touched the surface of what happens!Produced  directed by the infamous Al Adamson I loved this crazy almost unbelievable film! You can't really judge Dracula Vs. Frankenstein by standard film criteria instead you just need to sit back  enjoy the ride because I personally think this film is great fun to watch. Dracula Vs. Frankenstein quite literary has everything it has a Frankenstein monster that looks like a speeding train has hit it's face head on Count Dracula with a silly looking beard  an afro hairstyle who talks with a bizarre echo throughout  has plastic teeth that bulge out of his mouth a drug addicted mute hunchback assistant a wheelchair bound Dr. Frankenstein with a gay looking goatee beard ancient comets lab equipment that would look dated during 20's we do indeed see well almost as it's filmed in the horrible dayfornight process a Dracula Vs. Frankenstein fight at the end a biker gang  a weird guy named Strange who gets excited about playing with an old tyre in an alleyway with his girlfriend! The script is all over the place the dialogue is insane as Dracula says things like your fear will fully energise the molecular structure of your blood or a cop that says if you've got a fireplace burn some wood in it it'll be a lot better than running around on the streets to a bemused Judith Mike  the hippies also provide plenty of choice dialogue  lets not forget Dr. Frankenstein's mumbo jumbo we are not butchers... we are scientists almost every line is an absolute classic laughoutloud moment  I loved all of it! Dracula  Dr. Frankenstein only meet once in the film  generally speaking Dracula  Frankenstein's monster are relegated to bitpart characters as the film focuses on Dr. Frankenstein's experiments  Judith's investigations which is a shame. Also the plot is hardly logical it makes virtually no sense whatsoever as Dracula says Dr. Frankenstein's serum will help him create an army of undead Vampires  some nonsense about the human body being reanimated with a natural substance made when someone is decapitated but what does that matter when a film is this consistently entertaining? The special optical effects are terrible check out the laser beam from Dracula's ring. I thought the makeup on the Frankenstein monster was OK  it looked quite freaky. There is some gore a couple of ripped off arms some neck biting  a few chopped off heads. There is also one brief shot of female nudity. Technically Dracula Vs. Frankenstein is a bit of a mess there are some awful dayfornight shots the performances have to be seen to be believed the music gets on the nerves after a while the props  sets are cheap  the photography is point  hope for the best stuff. But having said all this what it basically boils down to is that I found Dracula Vs. Frankenstein just so entertaining  loads of fun  surely that's what watching films is all about? Impossible to recommend as most sane people will hate every demented second of it but I'm not most people am I? I'll sign off by saying I loved this film so bad it's utterly brilliant!!!".

The script is all over the place the dialogue is insane as Dracula says things like your fear will fully energise the molecular structure of your blood or a cop that says if you've got a fireplace burn some wood in it it'll be a lot better than running around on the streets to a bemused Judith Mike  the hippies also provide plenty of choice dialogue  lets not forget Dr. Frankenstein's mumbo jumbo we are not butchers... we are scientists almost every line is an absolute classic laughoutloud moment  I loved all of it! Dracula  Dr. Frankenstein only meet once in the film  generally speaking Dracula  Frankenstein's monster are relegated to bitpart characters as the film focuses on Dr. Frankenstein's experiments  Judith's investigations which is a shame. Also the plot is hardly logical it makes virtually no sense whatsoever as Dracula says Dr. Frankenstein's serum will help him create an army of undead Vampires  some nonsense about the human body being reanimated with a natural substance made when someone is decapitated but what does that matter when a film is this consistently entertaining? The special optical effects are terrible check out the laser beam from Dracula's ring. I thought the makeup on the Frankenstein monster was OK  it looked quite freaky. There is some gore a couple of ripped off arms some neck biting  a few chopped off heads. There is also one brief shot of female nudity. Technically Dracula Vs. Frankenstein is a bit of a mess there are some awful dayfornight shots the performances have to be seen to be believed the music gets on the nerves after a while the props  sets are cheap  the photography is point  hope for the best stuff. But having said all this what it basically boils down to is that I found Dracula Vs. Frankenstein just so entertaining  loads of fun  surely that's what watching films is all about? Impossible to recommend as most sane people will hate every demented second of it but I'm not most people am I? I'll sign off by saying I loved this film so bad it's utterly brilliant!!!";

Now and then a few of the horror hosts would be around or horror related shows like Chiller Theatre with its leprous fingers shooting out of the ground and greedily grasping the letters spelling the show's name.  Good Times!  I like many of the reviewers here saw Dracula Vs. Frankenstein at least a few times.  There were scenes etched in my mind most notably the pier and J. Carrol Naish in a wheelchair barking out orders to a grunting balloonfaced Lon Chaney Jr.  I didn't really remember much about the monster or for that part Dracula but I gave that up to youth and decided to watch this classic of Al Adamson's.  Now I have seen Adamson's work before and knew what to expect.  I saw his Blood on Dracula's Castle and Nurse Sherri.  They were both real cheap movies but I liked them a lot.  So I figured same for this especially since this one was a part of my cinematic past.  Wow! Was I wrong!guess you knew this was coming!  Dracula was not the only thing that sucked in this picture!  This film is a tangled massmess of various plot strands corny dialogue bad bad bad acting cheap cheap cheap sets and props worthless cameos by what would have been a great cast twenty years prior to its production and a pretty feeble direction even by Al Adamson standardsWe're talking LOW!  J. Carrol NaishYes the great hunchback from House of Frankenstein was in a wheelchairthis was his as well as Chaney's last film playing a Dr. DureaAKA Dr. Frankenstein who runs a freak show on the pier in a carnival in California.  Almost everything he says is preposterous idiotic and totally wooden.  His performance is SO wooden it is as if he were practicing for his casket.  Chaney is almost as bad.  He look terrible and its not from makeup.  He plays a mute that mumbles and breathes hard named Groton who likes to cut the heads off of nubile young women with an ax and pet little puppiesan obvious homagereminder of his performance as Lenny in Of Mice and Men.  But wait!  We have more hasbeens to come.  We have Russ Tamblyn as a biker and Jim Daviswith some of the worst oneliners in film as a policeman.  And of course we have Adamson's muse and love interest and wife Regina Carrollooking as beautiful as ever as a sister of one of the missing girls.  Ms. Carrol actually gives the best performance of the film except when she sings some interminable Las Vegas show number.  Well it seems I have covered everything...wait what about the two great monsters...the film is about them isn't it?  I'm not really sure that is the case but they are in the film in all their lack of glory.  Dracula looks like he just got through teaching the sweathogs on Welcome Back Kotter and Frankenstein's monster...well he has definitely seen better days...and better movies.  For me aside from walking down memory lane and being reminded how bad filmmaking can be the one real bright spot was seeing Forrest Ackerman in his cameo.  He once told me how he did this film as a favor for Al and how he broke his glasses during the shoot and was not paid for either the cameo or the glasses.  Good times!".

Practiced mainly on girls between the ages of four and eight FGM refers to the removal of part or all of the female genitalia as a means of reducing a woman's desire for sex and the chances that they will have sex outside of marriage. According to Amnesty International an estimated 135 million women have undergone genital mutilation and two million a year are at risk  approximately 6000 per day. A procedure that has been performed for over 2000 years it is normally done without the care of medically trained people and may lead to death serious infection HIV depression or gynecological complications.In the film six girls refuse to take part in the purification ritual. Two run away to an uncertain fate and the remaining four are sheltered by Colle Gallo Ardo Sy Fatoumata Coulibaly a woman who is known to have mystical powers and has given the four girls the moolaade the spell of protection. She ties a rope across the entrance of her home and all are forbidden to cross it until she releases the spell by uttering the correct words. Colle refused to have her daughter Amasatou Salimata Traore submit to the cutting seven years earlier and Amasatou is called a bilakoro a woman who is unclean and her chances for marriage are said to be slim. She is however planning on marrying the son of the tribal chief Ibrahima Moussa Theophile Sowie a well off Westernized African who is due to return from Paris.Colle's moolaad stirs the anger of the Salidana a group of women dressed in red gowns who perform the mutilation. She is also forced to stand up to the intimidation of her husband and his brother and the male elders in the village who see her as a threat to their values. As a gesture of control the men confiscate the women's radios their main source of news of outside life. Rigidly defending their traditions and what they questionably see as a practice sanctioned by Islam they also turn against an itinerant merchant they call Mercenaire Dominique Zeida who comes to the aid of Colle in a shocking scene of public flogging. As the issue becomes crystallized many women rally to Colle's support whose courage in the face of determined opposition is of heroic proportions.While Moolaad is political it is not simply a polemic against injustice. The film is multilayered and the characters are complex individuals who are much more than symbols of right and wrong. Shot in a profusion of brilliant colors Moolaad opens the door to a little known culture and in the process brings a brutal practice to the world's attention. According to Nahld Toubia MD a physician from Sudan It is only a matter of time before all forms of female circumcision in children will be made illegal in Western countries and eventually in Africa. Moolaad shows us the way and few will leave the theater unmoved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Six girls from a rural village in Burkina Faso escape from a 'purification' ceremony the female circumcision ritual that is still practiced in 34 of the 58 nations in the African Union. Two head for the city. The other four know of a woman in the village who some years earlier had prevented her own daughter from being cut. They run to her home where she is the second of three wives of a man whose brother is a figure in the town's power structure. To protect them she pronounces a moolaad an unbreakable spell of sanctuary that can only be dissolved by her word and which is marked simply by stretching some colored strands of yarn across the enclave's doorway. This is the narrative set up of Ousmane Sembene's latest film Moolaad which had its Philadelphia debut in a packed literally sitting in the aisles auditorium at the International House cinema last week. How will the townspeople react to this open rebellion against female genital mutilation? How will the men who govern the town respond? What about the women who actually perform these ceremonies presented in the film virtually as a coven of witches dressed entirely in red? And especially what about the town's other women?

That's a combination that is uniquely the signature of Africa's master film maker Ousmane Sembene.Had Sembene not been drafted into the French army in his native Senegal at the age of 15 in 1939 he might not have joined the Free French forces fighting the Nazis in '42  thus might not have ended up after the war in France working on the docks in Marseilles where he wrote and published his first novel Le Docker noir in 1956. It was not usual in the 1950s that a man of his class background in Senegal  not a member of any tribal elite  even learned to read let alone became a critically  financially successful intellectual on a world scale. Which must be why Sembene made a conscious decision to study film at the All Russia State Institute for Cinematography founded by Eisenstein  at Gorki Studios in Moscow. In 1966 three years after returning to Senegal the then43yearold Sembene released La Noire de . . . the first featurelength motion picture produced in SubSaharan Africa. His films which can stand up alongside the best of Bergman Kurosawa or Godard are intended for audiences who will see them sitting on dirt floors in African villages. Feminist themes are common in Sembene's work. Ceddo my favorite of the three earlier pictures of Sembene's that I've seen looks at Islamic imperialism in SubSaharan Africa precisely in terms of what it meant for the role of women in the tribes.

	onyx:emotionText "Six girls from a rural village in Burkina Faso escape from a 'purification' ceremony the female circumcision ritual that is still practiced in 34 of the 58 nations in the African Union. Two head for the city. The other four know of a woman in the village who some years earlier had prevented her own daughter from being cut. They run to her home where she is the second of three wives of a man whose brother is a figure in the town's power structure. To protect them she pronounces a moolaad an unbreakable spell of sanctuary that can only be dissolved by her word and which is marked simply by stretching some colored strands of yarn across the enclave's doorway. This is the narrative set up of Ousmane Sembene's latest film Moolaad which had its Philadelphia debut in a packed literally sitting in the aisles auditorium at the International House cinema last week. How will the townspeople react to this open rebellion against female genital mutilation? How will the men who govern the town respond? What about the women who actually perform these ceremonies presented in the film virtually as a coven of witches dressed entirely in red? And especially what about the town's other women?

	schema:reviewBody "One of legendary Senagalese director Ousmane Sembene's defining films. A fascinating study of the clash between pragmatic modern thinking and staunch religious traditionalism in Senegal. The film focuses on the controversial procedure of 'purification' in which young girls are forced to undergo genital mutilation to supposedly make them better more faithful wives in the future. When six young girls flee the process four of them seek refuge with a wellknown woman Coll Fatoumata Coulibaly who is viewed with suspicion in the community for her stubborn refusal to adhere to all the societal 'norms'. Coll offers the girls protection moolaad a spell which can only be broken if she herself utters the words which will end the moolaad. Coll herself had refused to let her daughter be 'purified' and her actions prove to be inflammatory causing the elders to become increasingly nervy about her failure to conform. As their control mechanism is slowly eroded they lash out and the community takes on alarming animalistic tendencies. Although the film ends in a rather idealistic fashion Sembene's work is both moving and engaging. His stance on the core debate is clear but the views of the various community members are not so. In this way he is able to explore ideas of male hegemony while simultaneously studying the difficulties faced by the patriarch in striving towards accepted constructions of masculinity. Sembene understands the quirks of this society and his representations of these offer both light relief and food for thought. Ultimately the film swings back to the debate at its core  the battle between old and new. The modern approach is symbolised by the women's radios and the knowledge acquired from them and by the chief's Frencheducated son who becomes the first to turn his back on the male elders. Religious traditionalism manifests itself through a ruthless and outdated male hegemony and it is clear that Sembene sees feminism as a crucial means by which modernisation can be achieved. His film provides an insight into an underrepresented part of the world. It is a beautifully told story which offers a multilayered yet concise analysis of ongoing issues which are relevant to us all.".

The male elders set an almost Taliban like regime claiming that female genital mutilation is a requirement for women as stated in the Koran. This of course is wrong and one woman's bravery is enough to turn the tide and change things forever. Well worth a watch if you have the chance  don't be put of by the subject matter.....".

Wonderful performances are given by all the actors but especially by Fatoumata Coulibaly as Colle.

But unlike most of the reviewers I have read so far I did not think of it as an African film. I have seen the dynamics present in this film played out in many cultures and religions around the world including the West.Meaningless tradition in the face of humanity is a universal theme and this film sends the message clearly home. Anybody who watches this film and smugly thanks their lucky stars that they weren't born in such a barbaric culture has totally missed the point. They may even be part of the problem in their own culture though unwittingly as that is exactly how tradition works.But enough about the message of the film. Even with the heavy subject matter at hand the film takes us through the leisurely paced life in an anonymous subsaharan village and we get treated to many of the joys and even the humor of their daily life as well. I believe the director would like to say that village life and even many traditions are not inherently good or bad in fact many will probably feel even some envy of the idyllic village and its rich culture. This however also happens to be the backdrop of a ritual whose meaning is long forgotten not to mention excessively cruel. And cities are plenty filled with cruelty of different types.The fact that the director is male makes the impact of the film all so much stronger as he shows no sympathy to men in general and sees the weakness of the female role in African culture which is just an extreme picture of sexual discrimination everywhere and ironically men are always giving lip service to women. Thus the general shortage of strong men in the story may be pointed out as one of the film's weaknesses. On the other hand the women are all toprate actresses and their roles are realistic and the near absence of character clichs among major characters is almost stunning.The story is simply told and many may think it is all too painfully obvious but I think it is a work to observe on multiple levels e.g. when the story seems not to be moving ahead we get a chance to learn about village life albeit not unrelated to the overall work or we get generous helpings of the character development of the three wives. Subtle interactions among villagers may bore some but I found them fascinating. It's not made like some Hollywood movie and thank God for that.".

It is a social commentary on the position of women in many parts of the African continent focusing on female genital mutilation circumcision called as purification. The movie is tightly scripted full of subtle thoughtprovoking observations of the familial and social order in an unnamed African community. The director patiently tells the story of a woman Colle who is against female circumcision and offers a protection Moolade to four little girls who escape the ritual and seek shelter from her. The men in the community are unable to comprehend or handle her actions and the change it would bring in the community. They see her actions as a threat to the status quo and to the traditions. Ancient or modern many traditions are based on superstitions and worse yet are harmful to people. There is absolutely no question that female circumcision is a horrific practice that is not only physically harmful to women but also one of the worst forms of oppression. How deep this rot has spread in the community is lucidly depicted in the movie. The men in the community are unable to think outside the traditions and the women especially Colle end up paying a steep price for them to learn and grow.Some scenes in the movie were very powerful and disturbing  the female circumcision the actual process happens off screen the scene where Colle's husband fks her she is cut the climax and the denouement. However the movie proceeds at a relaxed pace in tune with life in the community and always has interesting things to say. I was fascinated by the culture and the people that were in the movie outside of the issues of female oppression. The movie is also backed by strong performances particularly from Fatoumata Coulibaly who portrays Colle with an interesting blend of resolution and motherliness  a powerful performance in a powerful film.DO NOT MISS! 9 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Ousmane Sembene is a colossus among African filmmakers. He is what Kurosawa and Ray are to Asia. At 82 this man is making films on women's problems on colonialism on human rights without losing sight of African culture.Moolaade deals with rebellion by African women against female circumcision a tradition upheld by elders Muslim and animist in a swathe of countries across Saharan and subSaharan Africa. Interestingly the film is an uprising within the social traditions that allow the husband full powers over his wives and acceptance of other social codes to whip his wife in public into submission. How many women and feminist directors who preach about female emancipation would have dared to make a film on this subject in Africa? The subject could cause riots in countries such as Egypt. Sembene is more feminist than women and I admire this veteran for this and other films he has made. He graphically shows how women are deprived of sexual pleasures through this practice and how thousands die during the crude operation.Moolaade deals with other aspects of Africa as well. It comments on the adherence to traditional values that are goodsix women get protection through a code word and piece of cloth tied in front of the entrance to the house. It comments on materialism including a bread vendor with a good heart for the oppressed who is called a mercenary by the women who claim to know the meaning of the word that pervades pristine African villages the return of a native from Europe and the increasing dependence on radios for entertainment and information.Sembene's cinema is not stylishits style stems from its simplicity and its humane values. Sembene's films allow nonAfricans to get inside the world of the real Africa far removed from the world of the Mandelas constant hunger and the epidemic of AIDS that the media underlines as Africa today. Sembene's film is not history it is Africa today. The performances are as close to reality as you could get.At the end of the film shown at the recent Dubai Film Festival I could not but marvel at a man concerned not at making great cinema for arts' sake but using it creatively to improve the human condition of a slice of humanity the world and the media prefers to ignore.".

The movie comes from Senegal and deals with the still common practice of female circumcision.This masterpiece has been created by Ousmane Sembene the 81year old father of African cinema. Besides having such a powerful a surprisingly applicable theme it is artfully filmed. The fact that it is created by someone who has lived in Africa making movies his entire life is reason enough to see this movie. Although there are many films are about Africa there are very few that capture Africa as it really is. Sembene is a master of it.Then there's the colorful story. It's hard to believe that this type of lifestyle is still very common in parts of Africa. The urgency of this message will captivate you. It may make you appreciate living in a country like the US that seems to have come so far when it comes to woman's rights but even more than that it will hopefully create a common tie across the board knowing that every human desires and deserves their right to life. The humanity of this film is painfully clear. There's no avoiding a change of heart and mind. All this said Senegal has some difficultly finding actors that can handle the depth of this subject. But don't let that take anything away from your experience. It's possible the most empowering movie I've this this year or any.".

	schema:headline " A Conventional Though Compelling Discourse On A LongPracticed Form Of Abuse";
	schema:reviewBody "In veteran African filmmaker Ousmane Sembene's final feature the viewer is transported to a remote village in Burkina Faso where one woman has dared to stand against the longheld local tradition of 'purification' the euphemistic term for circumcision in prepubescent girls. Giving sanctuary to a group of children due to undergo the often fatal rite of passage and with seemingly the entire village against her the woman's only recourse is to enact the moolaad or 'magical protection' which none dare oppose. Then her troubles really begin. While the film's anticircumcision stance will certainly be preaching mainly to the choir and its construction fairly conventional both in terms of storytelling and production 'Moolaad's subject matter cannot fail to strike a chord in the viewer dramatically bringing to life a custom that still affects the lives of many today.Burkina Faso is not the only country where the practice continues nor is it a practice exclusive to some Western African nations however a 2006 study by the World Health Organization found that approximately 72.5 of Burkinab girls and women were circumcised making the Senegalese director's choice of location a highly valid one. In the film the 'purification' carried out by an elite group of women in the tribe  importantly underscoring that proponents of the tradition are not wholly defined by gender  is seen to be highly traumatic and physically damaging to the victim and frequently fatal.The term 'purification' speaks volumes of the perception of females and sexuality held by those in favour of the custom. Other arguments supporting the practice as expressed in 'Moolaad' speak of a longheld tradition traveling so far back into the mists of time that noone seems able to explain the actual reason for it and finally that it is a requirement of Islam. Certainly there will be many Muslims who will take issue with this and Sembene makes a point of showing Burkina Faso's complex cultural potpourri. On top of its indigenous animist roots the society also shows traces of its French colonial past as well as being a melting pot of many religions the lines between which are heavily blurred. Add to this the increasing influence of modern technology and it is not hard to comprehend how beliefs have played a steady game of Chinese Whispers.Indeed technology is seen as the greatest threat of all to the preservation of the strongly patriarchal society with the village serving as a microcosmic standin for many cultures the world over. With the dreaded radio spewing forth subversive ideas from distant and notsodistant lands the local women find themselves increasingly able to articulate a 'worrying' desire for independence and opposition to values neverbefore challenged. A perhaps inevitable scene reminiscent of 'Fahrenheit 451' comes in answer to this rebellion though in a wonderful display of irony the most celebrated man in the village is the only one to have swapped the illiberal world of the tribe for the free market corridors of corporate France. Those responsible for challenging the status quo fight their corner in the flickering shadows of burning torches mob rule and genuine fear. Not all however are so easily cowed into submission.'Moolad' has an excellent and believable cast to bring this turbulent society to life from star Fatimouta Coulibaly as the brave Coll Ardo to Ousmane Konat playing her husband's unpleasant and hardline brother Amath. Joseph Traor as the victorious homecoming son Doucour skillfully depicts the mildmannered success story increasingly caught between the values of two very different worlds and special mention goes to Lala Drabo who though only in a supporting role conveys the raw anguish of loss caused by the purification.For all this 'Moolad' is constructed in a fairly simple and conventional way. The narrative is robbed of complexity by the strong stance against female circumcision by its writer as opposed to simply telling the story and letting the viewers decide. Instead the protagonists and the villains are clearly drawn and sympathetic to the cause the viewer takes no journey through the story  they have already arrived from the outset. How the film is perceived in nations where female circumcision is common would presumably be an entirely different matter and it would be interesting to find out if it has altered any viewpoints.The foreign viewer will also pay more attention to the cultural depictions of the colorful appearance of Burkinab culture of its tribal nature its sounds and the different behaviour of its people. It is as much a window into another world as it is a commentary on the struggle against a dangerous custom. This though is brought to the film by its overseas audience its director does not go out of his way to highlight the culture as a spectacle in its own right. It perhaps does not matter therefore that on the production side 'Moolaad' is not an adventurous foray into filmmaking. While I would have preferred a lessbiased and therefore more confident approach it is not as if I didn't go into the film with a firm view on the subject of female circumcision myself. Taking a stand on the issue is ultimately what 'Moolad' is all about.For this reason above all I highly recommend the film and of course foreign viewers like myself will also discover one of the multilayered cultures of Western Africa within of which it is such an ingrained part. Although not a cinematic masterpiece 'Moolad' is a very moving and very human drama that I hope will continue to get its point across in places where that message needs to be heard most.".

While I come from a very different culture I felt that I was able to understand what was going on the struggle for power in the village between the men and the women. And Sembene was a really talented director with a humanist sensibility. About the subject matter a group of women who oppose the genital mutilation of young girls well as they say about song or movies against war or hunger who can make a movie in favor of war or hunger? on second thought there has been many movies in favor of war. And it is touching that the village vendor who appears at first to be the least likable person in the town as he cares more about money than about the rural traditions ends up being a martyr in the cause of the girls.

Basically set in an African village the people carry out the tradition of 49yearold girls being cut the act of female genital mutilation. All children know that this operation is horrible torture and sometimes lethal and all adults know that following the ritual some women can only give birth by Caesarean section. It comes to the day for this ritual and six girls are going to be approached two of them drown themselves in a well to escape the operation the four remaining girls are protected by Coll Gallo Ardo Sy Fatoumata Coulibaly who seven years ago refused to have her daughter circumcised. The woman uses a coloured rope attached to the lower poles outside a house door this is is known as Moolaad magical protection no one dares to step over the rope to fetch the children the magic can only be revoked by Coll herself. The relatives of Coll's husband persuade him to whip her in public to make her revoke and opposite groups of women shout to her to revoke or to remain focused on protecting the girls but none of the women interfere. Coll is close to collapsing following the attempts from tormentors to end the protection of the girls the merchant called Mercenaire Dominique Zeda takes action and stop the maltreatment therefore after leaving the village he is hunted by those opposed and is murdered out of sight. In the end all women are united because of the pain caused by genital cutting they pursue those who carry it out and shout No more genital cutting! and Coll is able to remove the moolaad all four girls are safe. Also starring Mamouna Hlne Diarra as Hadjatou Salimata Traor as Amasatou Mah Compaor as Leader of the purifiers and Aminata Dao as Alima B. The subject of female genital mutilation has been tackled in film before it is a highly sensitive and controversial issue still practised in African countries this film truly does emphasise the human aspect of the topic there is some violence along the way of course but it is a compassionate story a most watchable social drama. Very good!".

I felt that the score on this website rated the movie a bit higher than its worth but hey that's what the mysteriously weighted votes came out at so someone must think its great. Essentially this movie deals with four girls running away from their female circumcision ceremony and taking refuge with a woman who herself had not allowed her daughter to be 'cut' a few years previously. The movie follows the controversy and confrontations of people and ideologies in the face of this woman protecting with the use of her own 'magic powers' the petrified children against tradition religious powers and patriarchal politics. The story is not overly complicated and the performances range from great down to the standard you'd expect to see at a primary school production. Cinematography and special effects don't really come into it either for this is storytelling at its most basic though the subject matter does lend the movie a level of emotion and empathy it perhaps would not otherwise have. Ultimately this is a movie with a message for the parts of the world where female circumcision still takes place and for this rather than for any merit it has a movie that it is important that this movie was made and is hopefully seen by those affected. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch this again but I'm not part of the true target audience!".

Though portions of the plot take dips into darker human emotion and character Lora's smile and the subtle crescendo of love keep the movie out of the melancholic. Unlike a previous commenter I had no trouble with Lucia's lack of Hungarian dialogue nor did it seem like the language issue effected the cast. In fact there seemed to be real chemistry amongst the cast which made for a overall cohesion storyline and energy. As viewers we have very little insight into the whys of filmaking perhaps we should be more concerned with the end product. If the dubbing was distracting to some I suspect that the subtitles were to others. Too often we get caught up in searching for imperfection and identifying things we disagree with i.e. a movie's use of liberal imagery subtitling or dubbing.

It is understandable why they didn't force the fact that this movie is about the love life a blind person because in reality it was not really and I acknowledge that it would be very hard to make a trailer which could suggest the overall feeling of the movie.The chronology is interesting as we gradually get to know what already have happened and it is rarely distracting. The acting is good with lots of good supporting characters the characters all felt real but not overacted and exaggerated as most of todays Hungarian movies do. This one was well above the other Hungarian releases of nowadays free of mindless jokes and funny acting but still not being overly heavy and depressing.

The narrative bounced effortlessly among different points of view and worked music and song seamlessly worked into the storyline.In Herendi's new film Lora two brothers are in love with the same woman. Making one of the brothers a performing musician enables Herendi to continue exploring the use of actual not sound track music in the narrative process.

But as Herendi tells blind Lora's story he intertwines with it the backstoryhow she came to her blindness. The before and after stories merge smoothly often with matched cuts between past and present. While there are moments of surprise as Lora opens a door in the present and we find her with a character in the earlier story there is no disorientation. The narrative is smooth despite the periodic switches into the backstory enabling him to present the past dramatically. While technically flashbacks the scenes retain setting sound especially music as live performance action and other elements in both time frames creating this uninterrupted narrative.The film is described as a comedy and it is characterized by many moments of genuine humor especially in the banter among the members of the group that includes Lora's great admirer and nearlover her boyfriend's younger brother. There are also moments of black humor that involve an urn repeated gags about the father's apartment and rather sweet exchanges between the musician brother and Lora. Herendi handled visual gags well in Valami Amerika and he offers some variations here of what worked earlier. A favorite is punishing the uninvited visitor by shocking her. In all the romantic story is handled well. Though blind Lora is a feisty selfsufficient character who generates admiration rather than pity. If anything she manages almost too well needing to decide if in fact real sight was not the factor that had prevented insight!

The supporting acting is uniformly excellent from the sexual predator of the older brother a reprise from the earlier film to the faithful younger brother the grieving father the faithless girl friend Lora's boss and hopeful swain and others.

The narrative bounced effortlessly among different points of view and worked music and song seamlessly worked into the storyline.In Herendi's new film Lora two brothers are in love with the same woman. Making one of the brothers a performing musician enables Herendi to continue exploring the use of actual not sound track music in the narrative process.

The story has a lot of flashbacks the writers of this movie must be love Lost. I loved the previous works of Herendi Gabor Valami Amerika and Magyar Vndor but this is far more different. The photography was like in a Michael BayTony Scott film. Beautiful. Just like Lucia. Heartwarming and cute. Anyway it was great. I give it 108.".

	schema:reviewBody "I honestly thought I had seen every Pink Panther movie. Or should I say every Clouseau movie' since I had even seen Adam Arkin's Inspector Clouseau'? I discovered tonight however that I had never seen the original 1963 classic The Pink Panther.' Or if I had I was far too young to appreciate it and had forgotten all but a couple of scenes.For those not familiar with the film this of course launched the Clouseau character and the Pink Panther series. Beyond the characters of Inspector Jacques Clouseau Peter Sellers and Sir Charles Litton David Niven and the fabulous Pink Panther diamond though there is little resemblance between the serieslaunching film and later Panther comedies. This is not necessarily bad although fans of the fastpaced slapstick of the later entries will likely be a bit disappointed.Of course this was the precursor and Sellers and director Blake Edwards were just beginning to explore the character and world of Clouseau that most incompetent and clumsy of detectives who nevertheless gets his man.The original Panther is a romantic comedy with Sellers as merely part of a very good ensemble cast. We see very little of the hilarious Clouseau schtick for which Sellers is best remembered. He has no bizarre pronunciations yet and even has a gorgeous  though highly devious  wife. We can certainly see flashes of the Clouseau to come though and Sellers blends into the exotic montage quite well.Niven is really the star of this first Panther production. As the swashbuckling womanizing aristocratphantom he turns in one of his best performances. A very young Robert Wagner also does good work as his longlost nephew George Litton.Two extremely attractive and exotic actresses also heat things up. French beauty Capucine plays Simone Clouseau and is at the height of her career in 1963. Director George Cukor said that The camera has a love affair with her face.' Edwards' camera certainly did. She handles both the romantic and slapstick scenes with equal aplomb. Compare the husband coming home unexpectedly' scene with Capucine Liven Wagner and Sellers with the same scene in Horsefeathers' with all four Marx Brothers Thelma Todd and her husband! The other enchanter is Claudia Cardinale as Princess Dala. The Italian beauty queen is perfect as the sexy exotic princess and owner of The Pink Panther diamond. In the champagne scene with Litten and the Tiger rug Cardinale is enticing enough to make a male viewer completely forget Sellers and his bumbling detective work!While Edwards and Sellers changed directions a bit in later films the original Pink Panther is worth renting for more than just its historic value. It is indeed a fine film and a wonderful work of art  something which indeed might be said for both Capucine and Cardinale as well! By all means rent the original Pink Panther just don't expect slow motion Kung Fu attacks and insane chief inspectors taking shots at Clouseau!".

Unlike most of the other reviewers I don't share the same admiration for the later Clouseau movies. I did enjoy A Shot in the Dark and even liked Return of the Pink Panther and its sequel but frankly Herbert Lom's twitch Kato's surprise attacks increasingly more ludicrous plot devices and the very fact that Clouseau was still in a position of responsibility was more disbelief than I was willing to suspend.The Pink Panther is a great Romantic Comedy. That in itself separates it from all the other Panther clones which are all farcical slapsticks. Different humor different purposes therefore a different appreciation.The Pink Panther was not a blueprint for other Clouseau movies. Only for the Clouseau character. This movie was the inspiration for an American icon. The Pink Panther cartoons came out well before the next movie. It also featured inspired comedy performances by its four leads. Yes FOUR leads. Just because Clouseau wasn't the only major character doesn't mean he was minor. Sellers has more scenes than anyone except David Niven.The Pink Panther deserves to be considered on its own merits and not compared to movies of another genre that strove to capitalize on the popularity of the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "The one that started it all and set Clouseau' on the path to becoming Chief Inspector The Pink Panther' directed by Blake Edwards stars David Niven and Peter Sellers.  This film is memorable for a number of reasons primarily for being the first in a tremendously successful and funny series which would ultimately showcase one of the world's favorite cinematic policemen the bumbling Jacques Clouseau Sellers.  it also introduced His Royal Pinkness the Panther himself to the format of the feature length motion picture.  And can anyone remember a time before Henry Mancini's familiar theme existed?Being the first of course makes this the prototype and though it's a good movie it's obvious that the formula for success which the following films in the series employed had not yet been honed to perfection. Consequently though funny the hilarity level of this one is comparatively low though it does have it's moments the best of which involve Clouseau.From the day it premiered it was readily apparent that what really made it a go was Sellers and Edwards and his team have to be given credit for recognizing it immediately.  Often a sequel fails because the filmmaker has attempted to capitalize on an element of the original that seemingly made it good only to discover that what the poet once said is true  You can never go home again.  Merely expanding the part that worked before doesn't insure success usually in fact quite the opposite is true as without fail it becomes a matter of overkill The Penguin was no Joker and those participating in The Return of the Seven' weren't so magnificent' after all.  There are the exceptions of course like the Stars Wars' saga the Indiana Jones' movies and it goes without saying the Panther' films.Edwards was clever enough to discern that key element in the original and not only expand upon it for the sequels but fine tune it as he did so.  In developing his formula he seemed to possess an innate sense of what was funny even from an objective point of view which is amazing given that comedy is probably the most subjective of genres.  And then again he had the inimitable Sellers as his star which was certainly no hindrance to their combined efforts.It's interesting to watch this movie again especially after seeing the rest of the series as you're seeing Clouseau in his raw stage of development the accent is not yet as pronounced as it will be later and his denseness' is not quite refined yet.  But funny he is even as he experiments searching for that perfect comedic note which he would finally find in The Pink Panther Strikes Again'.  Seller's performance is the highlight of the movie and it gave birth to what would become one of the defining characters of his career.  From the first moment Clouseau appears on screen you know that you're about to be treated to something special. And Sellers never disappoints from that first frame on he is a joy to watch.David Niven meanwhile lends an air of sophistication to the proceedings as the suave and debonair legendary jewel thief Sir Charles Litton. Though not a unique character Niven plays him well exuding the kind of charm possibly only Cary Grant could have matched at the time.  As usual he brings a smooth presence to the screen he plays comedy well and the facility with which he brings Litton to life is impressive.  Watching Niven and Sellers together calls to mind the pairing of Michael Caine and Steve Martin some years later in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'The supporting cast includes Robert Wagner George Litton Capucine Simone Brenda De Banzie Angela Colin Gordon Tucker Fran Jeffries Greek Cousin' and the lovely Claudia Cardinale as Princess Dala.  Sellers created a number of characters during his career that will live forever but with The Pink Panther' he carved out a special niche for himself when he created Clouseau.  There's never been anyone else quite like Clouseau or Sellers for that matter and it's doubtful there ever will be again.  As for the movie itself there's no denying it's place of significance in the history of the movies as the one that kicked off a series that made the world laugh and thanks to the magic of DVDvideo that laughter continues on unabated today with no end in sight.  That's the magic of Sellers and it's all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 710.".

From the first moment Clouseau appears on screen you know that you're about to be treated to something special. And Sellers never disappoints from that first frame on he is a joy to watch.David Niven meanwhile lends an air of sophistication to the proceedings as the suave and debonair legendary jewel thief Sir Charles Litton. Though not a unique character Niven plays him well exuding the kind of charm possibly only Cary Grant could have matched at the time.  As usual he brings a smooth presence to the screen he plays comedy well and the facility with which he brings Litton to life is impressive.  Watching Niven and Sellers together calls to mind the pairing of Michael Caine and Steve Martin some years later in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'The supporting cast includes Robert Wagner George Litton Capucine Simone Brenda De Banzie Angela Colin Gordon Tucker Fran Jeffries Greek Cousin' and the lovely Claudia Cardinale as Princess Dala.  Sellers created a number of characters during his career that will live forever but with The Pink Panther' he carved out a special niche for himself when he created Clouseau.  There's never been anyone else quite like Clouseau or Sellers for that matter and it's doubtful there ever will be again.  As for the movie itself there's no denying it's place of significance in the history of the movies as the one that kicked off a series that made the world laugh and thanks to the magic of DVDvideo that laughter continues on unabated today with no end in sight.  That's the magic of Sellers and it's all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 710.";

	schema:reviewBody "To me the defining moment in The Pink Panther comes when Clouseau is finally asked by his wife to get her a sleeping pill. Frustrated discouraged he tramps across the room for the umpteenth time to do his wife's bidding. We see him go into the bathroom and then we hear  not see  ALL the pills drop on the floor of the bathroom. Without picking them up or even saying anything or reacting in any way he crunches across the floor and back into our view carrying the water and the pill for her. You know exactly what happened you didn't need to see it.This is typical of this movie and this style the jokes are so underplayed quiet and perfectly paced that people accustomed to seeing American Pie and There's Something About Mary or even the bunch 'o sequels to this film that grew progressively coarser and louder with each installment may not get or even notice them. In the first sight of Inspector Clouseau we see him pulling the old leaning on a spinning globe and taking a pratfall trick. But the moment is over with quickly it's not made more than it is meant to because the point of the pratfall is to define Clouseau's character in a moment. Compare with later more painful reoccurences of this spinningglobe idea in the sequels. Most of the other moments derive from this idea at the center of this caper film is this man who is inextricably dense and clueless and yet retains a curious grace  not to speak of a total savoirefaire in all moments.This film could never be made today. In fact it's a time capsule of a certain sort of late 50's early 60's sensibility. Examples all the people showing up for the Princess's dinner in formal evening wear. David Niven's latenight repartee with the Princess  all about numb lips and champagne. The musical number  for no reason whatsoever. The glamorous locales  without a trace of irony straight out of To Catch a Thief the inspiration for this type of caper flick. The curiously innocent and unsexual bedroom farce moments. And of course the ending car chase with guests in ape suits a suit of armor and not one but two cops in a zebra outfit what a good choice for those interested in speed and efficiency! And these are just the moments  see how effortlessly the screenplay weaves all the story lines together and how beautifully the pace gets accelerated throughout the movie. Not to speak of the opening credits which are like a whole cartoon sequence in themselves. Obviously I'm crazy about this picture it's pretty it's captivating it's romantic it's funny and it weighs about two ounces  it's just delectable cotton candy. And through it all Peter Sellers gives one of the most subtle and funniest comic performances put to film walking around in a fog totally unaware of reality and underplaying his role to the hilt.Rumor has it that a remake is in the works with Mike Myers in the Clouseau role. Let's compare two moments to get a preview Peter Sellers bringing his wife a partfull glass of milk that he has spilled most of. At her quizzical look he innocently saysThat was all they had my dear! .... compared with Austin Powers drinking um the brown substance that is not coffee. Different strokes for different folks indeed. Looking forward to it uh huh.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is said correctly that the first two Pink Panther movies this and A Shot in the Dark are more sophisticated and for adults compared with the later series of films that began ten years later which are more blatant slapstick and somewhat juvenile. The latter are more purely entertaining because they cause people even adults to break out and laugh whereas the humor here is more elegant and less loud not to say it is not very good. Still I rate the original Pink Panther film very highly because of its own brand of entertainment and humor and I put it above most of its successors Returns and Strikes Again are at least as good but I think most people would agree that with the end ones things go downhill.Clouseau is one of the five main characters in the film but he is only the fourth most prominent. It might be said that David Niven as the manytimesover thief Sir Charles Litton is the most prominent followed by Claudia Cardinale as Central Asian Princess Dala owner of the Pink Panther diamond that is the bait to be stolen but I would argue that Clouseau's wife Simone played by Capucine is as at least equal to Sir Charles if not more prominent. After all she is effectively a double agent  Clouseau's wife while aiding and abetting Sir Charles  and she even has a fling with Sir Charles's nephew George Litton. Two different affairs but all of an extremely classy and gorgeous woman just like Claudia Cardinale and she seems to like all three men equally. Within her romances and the intrigue of the plot there is lots of hotel bedroomtobedroom back and forth and hiding etc. Simone's humor combined with her good bearing is great and she is the highlight of the film to me.Clouseau's bumbling and klutziness is there just lesspronounced less loud and dominant. The film flows well with good dialogue and comedy and elegant settings of upscale hotels and fancy parties. The wit and humor are perhaps not described as subtle but just less loud and more intelligent and refined than that of the later films. It seems that many comedies have idiotic goofy characters to such an extent that they may not be funny but in this film the five main characters are urbane and smooth. Even Sellers has that bearing while being a klutz too. But sometimes the presence of such more refined characters does not matter if the people are not appealing and the comedy is not funny. Here however the characters are definitely very appealing and poised within a wellwritten good script making for a good chemistry. There is a great scene in which Sir Charles attempts to seduce the princess who is laying stomach down on a tiger skin. The verbal reigns over the slapstick there as in many other parts of the movie.

To see THE PINK PANTHER today is to be transported to the stylish Blake Edwards '60s world of opulence Mancini and nutty but smart slapstick. The sequel A SHOT IN THE DARK may be funnier and more sophisticated but PINK PANTHER is still a peerless graceful treat pure entertainment.This doesn't really fit in that well with the rest of the series of which I'm a big fan but it's on a higher plane in a sense. Those seeking the usual slapstick fare will find plenty of it not to mention an engagingly worldly edge lacking in the sequels. Not only is this a fine comedy it's beautifully photographed and full of elegance. Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau is wonderful as always but is neither the central character  the jewel thief The Phantom played by David Niven is the real protagonist  or the source of the most laughs Robert Wagner the Phantom's nephew who shows up unexpected on the eve of a jewel binge provides the movie with a force of sheer subversion. That's not to say the greatest moments aren't Clouseau's particularly during the bedroom scenes with Capucine Sellers is in top form.An interesting note is the similarity of THE PINK PANTHER in many ways to Alfred Hitchcock's TO CATCH A THIEF made in 1955. The two films have morethansimilar story lines and both are glitzy and glamorous but the approach is different. PANTHER is a far less serious piece of work yet in the end it has more substance perhaps because it refuses to take jewel thievery with the stonefaced seriousness of its counterpart. Having said that both are great fun and what more could you want? There is simply so much to love about this movie it's hard to know where to begin. In the hopelessly romantic world Edwards and Mancini usually present it's pleasant to see a darker and perhaps more vibrant edge shining through. BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S might be the quintessential Edwards film of the '60s but it was released the same year as one of his best EXPERIMENT IN TERROR a daring violent noirish outing that couldn't have been more different. In the layers of irony and comic wisdom of THE PINK PANTHER Edwards finds a middle ground and it's savory.".

	schema:reviewBody "The early and mid 1960s were an interesting period sandwiched between the bland 1950s and the revolutionary end of the decade a relatively prosperous period people still dressed for dinner and the clothing styles were simple yet elegant. Audrey Hepburn in those Givenchy outfits. This flick is set firmly in that moment.The plot has something to do with the theft of the pink panther a diamond but it's nothing more than the MacGuffin and is of no particular significance. The humor lies not so much in the overall story but in individual sequences put finely together in pieces like a jigsaw puzzle. Each movement seems choreographed carefully. Three times Peter Sellers tries to embrace his wife Capucine on a slick quilt and three times her body slides off the bed under one of his arms. A good deal of effort went into milking each situation for its immanent comedy. Blake Edwards shares the writing credit and he's done several other comedies that work in one way or another. It's odd because Edwards himself in interviews is not a witty person  kind of somber in fact. That's Life makes his ontological Angst explicit. So it's all the more strange that this comedy doesn't try to say anything important  soul clap its hands and sing. It's funny all the way through. I must have seen it a dozen times and there are some incidents that still make me laugh out loud. I'd much rather have my funnybone tickled than my thought provoked wouldn't you?The best sequence in the movie takes place in the bedroom of Sellers and his wife in Cortina d'Ampezzo an upscale ski resort aren't they all?. It's impossible to describe really. It could have been written by Feydeau. Sellers is trying to get in bed with his wife Capucine is called away and she is visited by two men Niven and Wagner each unaware of the other. People hide in closets and under beds. Champagne bottles pop open at the wrong times. Sellers steps on his fiddle and remarks Once you've seen one Stradivarius you've seen them all. I will just mention two incidents. Wagner has been hiding from Sellers in a bathtub full of suds and when he comes up for air and climbs out trying to escape his formfitting wool sweater is now dragging around his ankles. Niven escapes by climbing out a window but falls off the balcony. Next shot a few people are chatting at the base of a vertical bank of snow. Niven dressed only in a bathrobe his eyebrows frozen pushes his way out of the snowbank and finds himself a few feet from this group. With an excess of savoirfaire he shakes the snow from himself salutes the group with a cheerful Good evening and strolls away without explanation leaving four gawking people in his wake. One more image from a later scene which I won't try to explain. A zebra sneaks up to a buffet table and begins slurping out of the punch bowl. A man in a suit of full armor takes a whip and begins beating the zebra on the head screaming No drinking on duty  I'll have your stripes for this! That's what farce IS.The performers are all good not that any particular attention from Thalia is demanded. Claudia Cardinale is pretty but a bit I don't know inanimate maybe. Wagner  R.J. to his friends  is handsome and plays a libidinous young con man. He's pretty good actually as he plays the idealistic college graduate for Cardinale and good physically as he makes a foiled pass at a woman at the top of a ski slope and finds himself flailing downwards. Sellers is as good as he usually is which is very good. Niven is in his element too a lighthearted dandy ever unflappable only a step away from boredom no matter how outrageous the situation. The editor deserves plaudits for catching Niven half frozen blowing into his cupped hands and for cutting at the exact moment Niven looks up and his eyeballs bulge with distress. Poor Capucine. What an exquisitelooking woman. She may have begun her career as a model but she turns in a decent performance here unlike many models before and after her. Her large eyes and feline body manage to suggest an almost childlike vulnerability beneath that womanhood. Of course death comes to all of us but when it's self imposed as in her case it seems more than usually tragic.Henry Mancini's score is part of the movie. It sounds as if he had a lot of fun writing it. It covers a wide range too. There are cartoonlike sound effects  men swing at one another deliberately missing and the track goes Wheee! He works in some delightful variations on Domani. He demonstrates it full blown in a very sexy samba number using Fran Jeffries who has a pelvic girdle that seems independent of the rest of her body. Wow. Then it becomes a slow dance using the breathy Dexter Gordonish tenor sax that Mancini is so fond of. The physical climax of the film is backed by a rinkytink gallop.That physical climax by the way may be the weakest part of the film. All farces are faced with the same problem how do you manage to top all the funny stuff that has come before? If you can't figure out a good answer as Feydeau could you must fall back on a pointless frantic chase as this story does. That's a minor carp though.Yes the early 60s were okay. Especially if you lived in Paris drove a Ferarri and went skiing at ritzy resorts and liked to drink champagne. The only thing most of us have in common with these elegant folk is that we like champagne. Pardon me while I open a Rolling Rock. Don't miss this one. It's worth repeated viewings too.".

	onyx:emotionText "The early and mid 1960s were an interesting period sandwiched between the bland 1950s and the revolutionary end of the decade a relatively prosperous period people still dressed for dinner and the clothing styles were simple yet elegant. Audrey Hepburn in those Givenchy outfits. This flick is set firmly in that moment.The plot has something to do with the theft of the pink panther a diamond but it's nothing more than the MacGuffin and is of no particular significance. The humor lies not so much in the overall story but in individual sequences put finely together in pieces like a jigsaw puzzle. Each movement seems choreographed carefully. Three times Peter Sellers tries to embrace his wife Capucine on a slick quilt and three times her body slides off the bed under one of his arms. A good deal of effort went into milking each situation for its immanent comedy. Blake Edwards shares the writing credit and he's done several other comedies that work in one way or another. It's odd because Edwards himself in interviews is not a witty person  kind of somber in fact. That's Life makes his ontological Angst explicit. So it's all the more strange that this comedy doesn't try to say anything important  soul clap its hands and sing. It's funny all the way through. I must have seen it a dozen times and there are some incidents that still make me laugh out loud. I'd much rather have my funnybone tickled than my thought provoked wouldn't you?The best sequence in the movie takes place in the bedroom of Sellers and his wife in Cortina d'Ampezzo an upscale ski resort aren't they all?. It's impossible to describe really. It could have been written by Feydeau. Sellers is trying to get in bed with his wife Capucine is called away and she is visited by two men Niven and Wagner each unaware of the other. People hide in closets and under beds. Champagne bottles pop open at the wrong times. Sellers steps on his fiddle and remarks Once you've seen one Stradivarius you've seen them all. I will just mention two incidents. Wagner has been hiding from Sellers in a bathtub full of suds and when he comes up for air and climbs out trying to escape his formfitting wool sweater is now dragging around his ankles. Niven escapes by climbing out a window but falls off the balcony. Next shot a few people are chatting at the base of a vertical bank of snow. Niven dressed only in a bathrobe his eyebrows frozen pushes his way out of the snowbank and finds himself a few feet from this group. With an excess of savoirfaire he shakes the snow from himself salutes the group with a cheerful Good evening and strolls away without explanation leaving four gawking people in his wake.

Honestly I wasn't very impressed.The first hour or so of this movie moves at a snail's pace if even that fast. There seems to be an endless list of characters in this film whose backstories have to be established before anything happens. Though all the loose ends are tied up eventually it just seems to take so long to get there that even the most patient viewer will find it hard to watch all the way through in one sitting.The comedy amounts to little more than Peter Sellers falling down repeatedly. There are moments of witty dialogue but not much to speak of and while some scenes are mildly funny even these scenes drag on so long that the comedy becomes stale and tedious.David Niven and Robert Wagner are both annoying more than anything else and same with the actress who plays Sellers' wife. Claudia Cardinale is pretty but there just wasn't much else here that I really needed to see.On top of all that the ending was extremely disappointing and unsatisfying. It left a bad enough taste in my mouth that I'm actually sorry I wasted the time to watch this movie in the first place. I most likely won't watch the sequels.".

It's just your average 1960's comic caper.  The plot really isn't anything special.  It's not that funny either most laughs derive from Simone having to live with Jacques.

If you looked deep into the rock you could see the shape of the pink one whose cartoon character started the credits on this film.The film The Pink Panther could best be compared to believe it or not is The Road to Singapore. That film was probably the weakest of the Road series but it showed that Bing Crosby and Bob Hope had a real screen chemistry and sequels were demanded.But the guy who made the movie going public demand the sequels here was Peter Sellers. Take Sellers out of the film and you have an average caper film held together by the considerable charm of David Niven and the rest of the cast. The movie stars David Niven but the man who stole it completely was Peter Sellers with his indelible character of that bumbling train wreck of a Surete detective Inspector Clouseau.Niven is the famous Sir Charles Lytton playboy to the world but really a legendary jewel thief known as the Phantom. He's after the famous diamond with the Pink Panther flaw that's owned by exiled princess Claudia Cardinale. Clouseau is on the case but he doesn't know that his wife Capucine his having an affair with Niven and keeps him in the loop on the investigation. In addition Niven has a nephew who doesn't know about his double life played by Robert Wagner who'd like to embark on that kind of life himself.People should keep several feet away from Sellers because the man is a walking train wreck. But for all his bumbling and for all of his cheating wife giving Niven inside information he actually does have a brain a facet of the Clouseau character in this film that a lot of people overlook. The final chase scene is something out of Mack Sennett. Peter Sellers made four succeeding Pink Panther movies and in the second one he got a good comic foil in the person of his frazzled supervisor Herbert Lom. But that comes later.The Pink Panther is an average caper film that has two distinguishing things. One of the most enduring and familiar film scores in movie history by Henry Mancini and it's the start of a string of films like the Road picture series centered around Peter Sellers's most enduring character creation.".

	schema:reviewBody "For me The Pink Panther is one of those films that seems to offer viewers what I like to call 'humour of the lowest common denominator'. It becomes evident very early on and throughout the entirety of the film that the only running gag that's on offer here relates to our bumbling and inept Inspector Clouseau. At sporadic intervals in the film we'll witness him trip over violins walking into doors fall over have doors opened into him etc. It's something that is moderately amusing for about 510 minutes but wears thin fast. Aside from sight gags the script offers no real laughs and it just shows a real laziness on behalf of the writers.The story involving 2 people one of whom is simply known as The Phantom trying to steal a precious jewel from a princess certainly held a lot of promise but for the first 75 minutes it gets no real focus and it just seemed to veer from one pointless scene to another. I think a big failing with this film is that it spent most of its time showing Clouseau as being inept in a clumsy way rather than making him inept as a detective  the latter certainly would have made the film much funnier. There also isn't much of a mystery here which to me defeats the whole purpose of the film. Most of the dialogue is inane and irritating the story is dull and unengaging and the turn of events at the end are both ridiculous and nonsensical.The only part of the film I found to be mildly amusing was the scene where Clouseau's wife is trying to prevent him finding the 2 men in their room. Like I say it was only mildly amusing and sadly for me the film failed to register any big laughs at all.If you like seeing cheap sight gags such as Peter Sellers falling over things him walking into doors etc then you'll be well catered for here. However if you prefer comedy where the humour stems from the characters and situations being funny then you're probably best avoiding this one.".

That first hour was so slow so annoying with unlikeable characters that I almost stopped the disc at that point. However it picks up after an hour and gets better and better. The traffic scene where the old man comes out stands in the road and stoically watches cars driven by apes and others whiz by is a classic  one of the funniest scenes I've ever witnessed on screen. Most of the comedy as usual was provided by Peter Sellers but his Clouseau really didn't start clicking until the next few movies. If you think this is the normal riotous Inspector Clouseau you will be sorely disappointed. David Niven Capuncine and Claudia Cardinale dominate the movie not Sellers and those first three give very dated performances.".

However this movie was more of a romantic comedy with some slapstick and situational gags thrown in. Most of the jokes didn't really land well for me. I felt like I had seen these jokes done much better many times before in movies that have come out since The Pink Panther. Probably the only two gags I got a kick out of were the men hiding in the room and the gorilla mirror. However like I said before I've seen these jokes done more effectively in other movies. Apart from the comedic aspects of the movie I didn't really find the story characters or dialogue all that compelling or interesting. Combine that with a lack of many laugh out loud moments and I would have to say I found this movie disappointing. On the other hand the biggest positive to come from this movie would have to be the iconic theme song. Anyway I wouldn't say that this is a bad movie it just isn't that good in my opinion. 510Recommended for those that enjoy cartoon intros clumsy french policemen suave womanizing cat burglars manipulative female seductresses breaking things spilling things tripping over things falling off of things unreliable door handles high speed costumed pursuits......but that's just like my opinion man Of Times Watched Once".

These early two films are both romantic comedies and work brilliantly as such by the way has anyone ever seen the 1968 film Inspector Clouseau starring Alan Arkin?.The real point about The Pink Panther is that the Inspector Clouseau character was supposed to be another in the line of Peter Sellers cameos in US films of the time. It was a David Niven film. It was during the shooting that Sellers realising that he had a chance to make a real name for himself in America set out to steal every scene takeaftertake. His part was continuously enlarged as a result much to the alleged chagrin of Niven.It is only looking back in the light of the films that followed that The Pink Panther seems a somewhat lesser comedy than the others.This is a beautifully overthetop sixties film. Stylistically it's very dated but a gem to watch especially when you know that Peter Sellers was trying so hard to make an impact.

	schema:reviewBody "First off do not get me wrong I greatly enjoyed this film it was beautifully written mostly and directed and of course Peter Sellers is absolutely fantastic as Inspector Clouseau as are the rest of the cast in their respective roles. However the ending is completely unjust. And for me while I can love a movie if I do not think the ending is justified and understandable then I will disapprove of the movie. Such is the case this time.I must state this first off when I watch a film or read a book where 'the bad guys' 'deserve to win' by some creatively genius planning or highly thoughtout intellectually reasoning then kudos to them and congratulations. However this movie is entirely different.The ONLY decent character in the film is the one to be punished. Inspector Clouseau loves his wife and by her words has many redeeming qualities he is Kind loyal obedient faithful. Yet in the end he is the one to suffer and face jail. The other main characters are deceitful manipulative untrustworthy and well...just downright evil. Particularly as the two main women one of course being the honourable Inspector's wife conspires to Clouseau's downfall. Yes he is bumbling foolish and an idiot but he has good values and ethics as he only attempts to achieve his goal and job.However this movie suggests that these are undesirable qualities as Clouseau is the one who ends up the worst of all the characters. Although as is stated in the final scene  women will be all over him when he gets out in just a few short years. I am sorry but being a male 'just a few short years of jail' would be too much for me no matter how many women throw themselves at me after I get out.The movie while excellent for 95 percent of its duration fails to win me over in the final few minutes and this is where I begin to dislike it. I have never watched a movie that has gone from an 7 or 8 out of 10 to a 2 or 3 out of 10 so quickly. What this movie suggests is that being sneaky underhanded deceitful devious sly and indeed Machiavellian are ways that people should act to get ahead in life. Whilst hard working honest truthful faithful compassionate and even those who love will end you up in jail. Whether or not this is the intention of the film makers it should be deplored.Whilst it may be considered a great film and hilariously funny the means can not justify the ends. However this should not discourage anyone from watching this film which contains one the finest film comedic performances of all time.210.P.S. I could of course be accused of over analysing the film and taking it too seriously when it should be enjoyed light heartedly and with good humour. Yet the ending still ruins it for me no matter what angle I attempt to take it from.".

But I had never heard about the movie before. And boy was I right.I looked this up on IMDb after watching what I thought was a charming and hilarious movie and was baffled about a score of 47. I understand this film didn't hit the right spots back in 1994 but I'll tell you That was wrong then and it's wrong now. If it felt was right to bash this back in 1994 this is still what should be considered as a gem now.The film is a typical Chevy Case movie from the 80'ies and 90'ies. It's almost like the Fletch movies or the National Lampoon's best vacation movies. But then it's also Fletch director Michael Ritchie. What's worse this is rated at Ritchie's worst movie. Well it's so wrong! I laughed way more then I have in many recent movies. Here Chase is doing a great job of a cops and robbers story where Chase's strange family called the Robbersons is encountered by and awful lot of challenges as he is when on his best. Jack Palance is great as the old Dr. Jeckyll and Mister Hydedetective and so is Robert Davi as the scaring and dangerous Osborn which is staked out from Robbersons house as their new neighbor. Diane Weist is lovely naive is the wife and the kids are also great with extra kudos to Miko Hughes as the youngest son with a Draculamania. He is so funny!This film is stupidly funny. It's silly and it gets sillier the longer into the film you get In the good way. It's charming with hitchcockian mystery music it's well played an it's funny without full of foul language being harassing or embarrassing the wrong way like many comedies do now.This is plain funny with stupid persons which is all quite lovable. In style of Dumb and dumber I recommend this for the whole family.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cops and Robbersons is a pleasant enough comedy with Chase playing a Clark Griswoldtype character. I found the movie funny and charming. But the movie doesn't seem to take its story very seriously. For example Chevy Chase goes next door to use the bathroom. Of course he's really there to snoop. This of course I expected. In a movie about a stakeout especially in a comedy I expected a lot more to happen. Chase goes through the guy's wallet why exactly I do not know ruins his mattress again I do not know then merely gets caught. But this guy Osborn doesn't seem particularly suspicious.

But the movie doesn't seem to take its story very seriously. For example Chevy Chase goes next door to use the bathroom. Of course he's really there to snoop. This of course I expected. In a movie about a stakeout especially in a comedy I expected a lot more to happen. Chase goes through the guy's wallet why exactly I do not know ruins his mattress again I do not know then merely gets caught. But this guy Osborn doesn't seem particularly suspicious.

The police are doing surveillance on a criminal who lives in the house across the street.Chevy is up to his old Boy am I a clueless ... or what? routine. What's extremely frustrating is the fact that nobody around him gives it any thought. Look at these two examples First he hides the two cops in the closet don't ask! and his wife comes downstairs. She asks what the noise is coming from the closet. He states that it is the cat. Then the daughter comes down the stairs holding the cat. What does his wife think about that? Nothing. Another example is when Chevy asks his neighbor who is under surveillance if he could use his bathroom. While his neighbor is on the phone Chevy sneaks upstairs and cuts open the guy's mattress to the point that springs are actually popping out. What does his neighbor think of this? Nothing!I think you get the idea. The people in this film are so completely ignorant that the comedy falls flat. To make it worse Jack Palance is downright vicious. I was absolutely stunned at something he stated to one of Chevy's kids. This is supposed to be a family movie.The only reason that this film gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the presence of Dianne Wiest. She appears as if she is in a film all her own. She is caring charming and feisty all at once. However I would only recommend this movie for diehard Wiest fans or for people who enjoy watching Chevy Chase act really dumb for 90 minutes.  310".

Soon enough he's living that life when detective Jack Stone and his partner use his house as a stakeout to watch his neighbour that's a dangerous counterfeiter. Stone then finds himself caught up with the family and Norman's cop show obsession could just endanger the whole operation.As much as I enjoy watching a Chevy Chase film it does pale in comparison to his early work but watching it again it surprised me how well it actually stood up. While not overly funny it kept me watching. Teaming up again with Michael Ritchie the director of his smash 1985 hit Fletch Ritchie and Chase might not have the luxury of that smart script but Cops and Robbersons is still sprightly written with the odd witty remark and amusing depictions of middle class suburbia. It's a typical formula but it raises some inspired shenanigans if growing a little repetitive with its choices. Thinking about it there was probably just not enough humour there or effectively brought across. It's madcap accidental gags relying more so on the psychical and visuals with comical interactions between the dysfunctional characters. Ritchie's direction is straightup competently tidy with a slick streamline to it and having confidence in his timing.The cast balances out quite nicely. Chase gives his usual quickonthefeet performance while alongside him Palance superbly grits his teeth. Dianne West is equally good with a levelhead turn and Robert Davi suitably goes with a mock serious approach in a pigeon hold villain role. There's decent support by David Barry Gray Jason James Richter Fay Masterson Miko Hughes and Richard Romanus.".

	schema:reviewBody "30 minutes into 'Cops and Robbersons' I found myself clawing at the sides of my seat cushion. An hour into it I found myself with my head down tugging at my hair and groaning loudly. This sounds a bit childish so I will elaborate. 'Cops and Robbersons' is a terribly unfunny movie made by talented people who have made excellent films and stars actors who have made me laugh in the past so it is frustrating when I see them entrenched in a laughless screenplay. When a good actor takes a bad screenplay you can always sense their talent trying to get out.The screenwriters have assembled a comic formula out of the nuts and bolts of other movies and tried to fasten them together to make a funny movie. This never works because 'Cops and Robbersons' is a movie pitch not a movie itself. It's the beginning of an idea that doesn't need fine tuning so much as it needs a complete overhaul.The movie takes The Robbersons an ordinary Ozzie and Harriet family and puts as its head Norman Robberson Chevy Chase a man who is obsessed with cop shows. The dilemma is that a mobster Robert Davi has moved in next door and the authorities want to use the Robbersons' home to stake them out. Leading the stakeout is a roughhewn cop Jack Palance who rolls his own cigarettes and always seems to have one planted in his leathery mug. Saddle that with a nagging wife a daughter who develops an unconvincing romance with the mobster's son and a 5year old who plays vampire and bites Palance on the neck.These are nuts and bolts not inspiration. They are the stuff of bad sitcom writing  the kind of writing that gets a show cancelled. When I see a movie like this that is directed at a sitcom loving audience I always marvel at how much less funny it sounds without a laugh track.Now onto the cast starting with Chevy Chase. My favorite Chase comedies are the ones that allow him to be a smartass mostly because he can do it without sounding like a bore. I've seen it in 'Spies Like Us' and 'Funny Farm' and the 'Fletch' pictures and a little in the first 'Vacation' movie. But here he's an annoying dope who is always in the way and just bumbles around reminding me that his Gerald Ford routine was funnier when he did it in a five minute sketch on 'Saturday Night Live'.Jack Palance surprised me in 'City Slickers' by taking his usual tough ol' buzzard persona and injecting it with humanity warmth and truth. Here he's the same crusty old guy but the warmth and truth are gone because the movie doesn't have time between painful slapstick.Diane Weist has done her best work for Woody Allen. So I try to measure Diane Weist's characters thusly Would the character she's playing be convincing if she were playing it in a Woody Allen movie in most cases yes. So she's playing a good albiet underwritten character here in the wrong movie. There is one rather serious moment when she talks to Palance about his smoking that I thought was the movie's only ray of sunshine.I don't know what dragged director Michael Ritchie into this film after directing Chase in 'Fletch' and directing the marvelous and somewhat similar 'The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader Murdering Mom'.By the way you will note that I have avoided describing any of the specific scenes. That's because I just feel that this talented cast has had enough.".

I liked the train scene most which initially seems to indicate trouble but leads to the protagonists bonding. And the many comments about rural vs. urban life.

But when a messy drunk driving incident lands him in jail Paul finds he was specifically requested by Warden Hazen James Cromwell a duplicitous prison official well aware of Paul's athletic skills. Paul has been assigned the task of assembling a team of convicts to square off in a big football game against the sadistic guards. With the help of fellow convict Caretaker and an old legend named Nate Scarborough to coach Crewe is ready for what promises to be a very interesting game. It's only the warden and the guards who have no idea who or what they're up against with Paul the driving force behind the new team.";

The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler is more of today's take on the story if you asked me. It has humor and is Sandler at his best with Chris Rock playing his role well too.

	schema:reviewBody "People who lined up to bash this film had better get used to seeing more like it. Hollywood these days is stuck in a rut where three types of films account for nearly every film they release. Those are remakes sequels and films based on comic book characters. The Longest Yard would of course fit into the first category. It is a slightly updated but fairly faithful remake of the 1974 film of the same name. This time we have Adam Sandler who plays the incarcerated quarterback that Burt Reynolds played in the original. Reynolds is on hand to play a minor role which the original film also contained. The plot is still the same. Prisoners vs guards in a game of football. Pretty simple.Did the film make me laugh? Sure it did. There are more than a few chuckles but not much in the way of sidesplitting material. Sandler is actually not that memorable in this film. Some of the best performances actually come from people you might not expect. I was truly impressed with Nelly and Michael Irvin. Both men had their characters down and really proved they could actually act. Chris Rock is about as good as you'd expect. Your own personal opinion of him will determine how you rate his performance. James Cromwell plays the corrupt warden about as well as you might expect. He's pretty much got the market cornered on evil white guy roles since J.T. Walsh's untimely death. The rest of the cast becomes a game of see if you can spot the NFL player WWE combatant or famous sports journalist. And what on earth was Cloris Leachman doing in the Bernadette Peters role from the original? Did she lose some kind of bet with Sandler on the set of Spanglish or something? Should this film have been made? Well we film critics can argue that point all day. The truth of the matter is that this film grossed over 150000000!!! As far as the studio bosses are concerned this film was more than worth it. This was actually one of the more profitable comedies released this year so you can expect more like it in the near future. I'll give it 6 of 10 stars. Don't expect anywhere near the film we got in 1974. But there are plenty of worse films on the shelves at your local video store.The Hound.".

And the original spent more time building the characters so that by the end the film really resonated in a way the remake does not.BUT the remake is a fun  energetic piece of pop entertainment. It goes much more for broad comedy and pretty much succeeds. It's not super hilarious but it's funny enough and much funnier than the original. Although Sandler is wrong for the part he's likable enough. Chris Rock is funny as are some of the others. And the overall brisk pace keeps the whole thing afloat.Yes it's a disposable movie. It lacks the dark undercurrents that made the first one so good. It even seems to selfconsciously acknowledge that it will never stand outside the shadow of Burt Reynolds.

All it has is the same basic idea and the characters. I found this an absolutely brilliant comedy filled with frequent references to the original. It's genius characterizations of what some prison inmates might act like work perfectly. Especially Richard Kiels character turned into a weightier less intelligent black man. I also quite enjoyed the frequent humor derived from taking scenes from the original and changing the words into PG13. Although it originally seems silly the player shng himself scene is so much better when you realize it was originally the broke his fng neck scene. Also the million oneliners I guess could be taken badly but only if you're looking for them to be.

I thought this was one of them. I was wrong. This remake had a pretty good storyline and a few laughable jokes and moments. I usually don't laugh out loud at movies but I did find myself doing so three or four times here. So that takes care of the Funniness Factor. The story is easy to get involved inyou want to see the prisoners kick the guards' butts in football. It is a well played story and fun to watch. Sandler is not one of my favorite actors but I have to give him his props because I am starting to see that he usually stars in movies that are at least remotely funny and that have a pretty decent plot. But the main thing is that his characters usually act the same. I would get into the slight lack of character development but I'm sure you don't care to read about that. You only wish to know if this movie is funny or not and if it's worth watching! Well yes the movie has its moments and it's good to watch especially if you like football or are a Sandler fan. This has its good kicks and it is near a touchdown in the comedy category. So if you want to have a good time and relax to some entertainment you can watch this one  6.610 Stars".

I know when my husband and I saw it the whole audience was roaring with laughter throughout the movie and my husband has informed me that he cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. It was a whole lot of fun to watch and I recommend it highly.";

But within the first 15 minutes there were so many stereotypes and really derogatory comments that I was disgusted. But I didn't have the opinion to stop watching it I was on a bus with 40 other people.I was so shocked that they would do that. I mean they talked about black people white people and gaytransvestite people is a way that you would think that the writers had never really met any of those people. The stereotypes of the black people was everything you would expect. Trash talking playing dirty. They are even playing street basketball. The white people are just as bad. The one that shocked me the most was the portrayal of the transvestites. These people were shown in such a bad way. It was suggested that they kind of slept around and that they pushed their sexual orientation onto everyone. Granted I have never been in prison. But those kind of people do not act like that in the real world. At least not the kind that I've met. If a person didn't know the facts they could easily assume that's how all transvestites act. And I would think that in a country like ours people would come to be a little more respectful and not pull stuff like that.I was basically appalled by the writing of this movie. It is one thing to write to what the audience wants to see. It is a totally different subject to write characters based on stereotypes and misconceptions. The writers really need to think about what they are writing next time.".

With all the TV advertising and trailers at the movies I thought the film was coming out soon but I just checked and they said it won't hit the Cineplex until May 27th!Prediction? It will the box office winner on Memorial Day weekend. Perfect time to come out with a football picture because all the NFL fans are fed up with Arena football and thirsty for any real football.Well what can I say about the movie? Loved it! Very entertaining. You could get into the characters no matter how despicable they were and you were rooting for them. Of course the story is an old one. They filmed it in 1974 with Burt Reynolds and it is about prisoners playing a football game against the guards. It's a comedy but boy it is Violent with a capital V.It is a real macho man movie and everyone is going to love it. Adam Sandler gets beat up or beat down a lot in the movie they give the best lines and jokes to Chris Rock and there will be a few other Saturday Night Live people you will recognize in it. There are a lot of scenes of cheap shots and unsportsmanlike conduct. Very physical very brutal. Some scenes will make you cringe. You will feel their pain. Not blood and guts with stabbings or shootings but extreme football hurts and hits.Yes it's a comedy and yes it's funny but also ultra violent did I mention that already? Now I know why I gave up on football in high school and focused more on Cross Country and Track  Field...because I realized I would live longer if I competed in a sport where no one is trying to injury me or knock you out of competition.A great film? No but people will feel they got their money's worth and yes it will be popular on DVD with outtakes and behind the scenes footage. I can't see it getting a PG13 rating not with all the language and use of the N word by the cookie cutter steroid popping sadistic guards.".

	schema:reviewBody "Revenge is the one thing on the mind that every prisoner wants to impose on the guards. This idea of revenge is exactly what Paul Crewe Adam Sandler does to help motivate other inmates to organize a football team in an inmates vs. guards football game.The movie opens up with Crewe being chased by cops after he stole a Bentley. The car chase ends with Crewe getting arrested and bragging to his girlfriend by jumping up and down in front of the media helicopters that were covering the chase. Immediately we get to see the personality of Paul Crewe as a cocky spotlight loving person. Crewe is a former NFL player who is the only player to be banned from the league for point shaving. When he enters the jail he is hated by everybody because he caused so many people to lose bets from the point shaving incident.An NFL player or any celebrity usually has special treatment in prison. Crewe's opportunity arises when the prison Warden Hazen James Cromwell offers Crewe a chance for a nice cell and good words in parole hearings. The offer was to organize the inmates to play the guards in a football team. The point was for the inmates to have such a horrible team that the guards would win easily and have high enough spirit to be able to compete in their organized league. After vowing to never be involved with football again Crewe declines the offer. The guards beat up on him and he is unable to socialize with any inmates. After not wanting to take anymore beatings from the guards Crewe accepts Hazen's offer.The first friend that Crewe makes is Caretaker Chris Rock. Caretaker had already spent a long time in prison and knew most of the inmates. Caretaker helps Crewe with tryouts for the team but there was no talent. As are most prisons the Old Main prison is racially separated. Crewe wanted some of the black players on the team but they wanted nothing to do with football. Megget Nelly had a respect for Crewe and was the first player to join the team. He was an extremely fast runner but there were not enough players to make a decent team.Enter Nate Scarborough Burt Reynolds a Heisman Trophy winner who still lived for football. He helped train the team but the lack of talent made it so that there is no chance for the inmates to win. After several racial incidents involving guards many other black players join the team and the inmates become a decent team. The inmates are ready to face to guards in the battle of revenge they have been waiting for. Most of the inmates only want to play so that they can impose as much pain as possible on the guards. Crewe and Scarborough want to take the respect out of the guards by beating them. They train the teams until the Warden asks Crewe for something that he will not do again shave points off the score so that the guards can easily defeat the inmates.The cast of The Longest Yard has many big names. Adam Sandler Chris Rock Burt Reynolds James Cromwell and Nelly are the main characters of the movie. On both teams there are many NFL players such as Michael Irwin and Bill Romanowski. One of the best roles in the movie is Chris Berman's cameo as the ESPN announcer during the big game. Berman is the benchmark for football commentating and for such an important game it is fitting to have such a personality as Berman.The visual effects of the film are fantastic. The bone crushing hits are presented well in slow motion and with up close camera shots. The set of the prison gives a realistic sense of a jail as well. It is in the middle of New Mexico with absolutely nothing but desert near it. The sense of isolation is similar to what the prisoners probably feel.The Longest Yard has the same basic premise as Happy Gilmore but football rather than golf. Adam Sandler is trying to get revenge but turns to a sport rather than fights. In both movies I found myself rooting for Sandler's character and hating the antagonists. This film is not as crude as other Sandler films but still has plenty of laughs. Chris Rock's humor is similar to his standup as most of the things that Rock says in The Longest Yard has something to do with race. Burt Reynolds is not given a lead role in this movie but he still has a tough guy attitude through his character.I have not seen the original The Longest Yard so I cannot compare the remake to the original. While watching the movie I found myself cheering for the teams as I do when watching the Bears beating the Packers. Chris Rock's character adds a lot of humor to the movie. The one complaint I have with the movie is that the conflicts at the end are not completely resolved and it is unclear about what will happen in the future. The Longest Yard is not an Oscar worthy masterpiece but for a typical sports fan The Longest Yard is a great movie. In all I give it a rating of 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crewe was a football superstar back in the day but cast a black eye on the sport when he sold out his teammates. Then a drunk driving accident sends him to prison but the thing is the Warden specifically requested he be sent to his prison. Now Crewe has been giving the duty of putting together a football team full of the inmates. Recruiting is hard until the inmates find out that they are playing the guards.Let me just say that I've never seen the original so my views on this film are not in comparison to it but as a film on it's own. I'm sitting here asking myself if I should judge this film against other football films or even other Adam Sandler films. I can't really do that with the latter because it's not like any other Sandler film. It seems that he has grown up out of the stupid jokes that involve him yelling a lot and hitting little kids. This seems to be a softer side a side that wants to show that he is not just a comedian but a money making star. If this is a side of Sandler that we will be seeing then I want to shun him out of the business right now.I've never seen Punch Drunk Love or Spanglish so I can't comment on those films but other then the recent Click Sandler hasn't had a good or even funny film since The Waterboy. The Longest Yard if I were to describe it in two words it would be NOT FUNNY. Now I know it's not suppose to be a flat out comedy but with comedic actors like Chris Rock and Adam Sandler you would expect to maybe laugh every once and a while this is not the case. Mr. Deeds was Sandler's worst film in his career not including that boat one and The Longest Yard seems to be giving it a run for it's money. I had a more enjoyable time watching Little Nicky then I did this.The film is full of clichs. I was rolling my eyes when the mean prison guard gave Sandler the you're okay speech at the end not to mention the useless and meaningless character of Chris Rock who is only there for sympathy only there to get a few tears but it doesn't even work. It's sad really. Let me tell you this just because there are stars in the remake that were in the original does not make it okay or good. Does having them in the movie signify some kind of blessing? Give me a break. I can see having wrestlers in the film to play football players and guardss but they didn't add anything to it. No star value of Hey look who it is because there are so many of them. Also Nelly makes an appearance yet another rapper trying to make it in Hollywood. Again I'm asking myself what's the purpose? Couldn't get real actors? So you try to reach out to the young crowd Hey look it's NELLY kids.Now after telling you that the film is full of stupid clichs that it's not funny and that it tries to pass of rappers and wrestlers as actors what else is there to tell? How about how it's not even a good football movie? Not once did I ever think that they would lose and not once did I ever think that any of this would ever actually happen. Never would the inmates be wondering around the prison at night. Basically you need to pass on this film all it consists of is poor McDonald's jokes that never hit the mark. Go watch the original insteadand I haven't even seen it.".

The only things there are to gain from a remake are self promotion and profits. Not because they love the movie but because they want to feed off of what others love.It's all about money. After all it's much easier remaking something that's already loved rather than creating and inventing something from scratch and hoping everyone will like it. That is the bane of today's filmmakers abandoning creativity and taking the shortcut to success. Now they introduce The Longest Yard to a younger ignorant audience. Where will it end?The first scene tries and fails to capture Burt Reynold's classic Paul Crewe from the start. Not only do we see that Sandler is not worthy but he really has no good reason to crash his girlfriend's car. Of course it is captured on CNN in a heartbeat when realistically cops these days take 20 minutes to even respond to a call unless it involves a life and death situation.The cons in the original were easy to side with and the Warden and Captain Knauer were much meaner. These 2005 cons are a bunch of lame cocky raplistening selfabsorbed jerks that reflect the me athletes of today. I could not find myself rooting for these shallow inmates.Richard Kiel's original character was copied into being a big dumb bald black fool who had some of the worst lines in the movie. I LIKE little Michael! WTF! The classic character of Connie Shokner was turned into some ugly bigjawed Mexican on steroids. Proof enough here that you can't imitate a classic with stupid wannabes.The gay cheerleader roles were expanded to give Tracy Morgan more air time. A convict is giving out cheeseburgers how stupid is all this? This whole movie is like watching a WWF wrestling match with all it's brainless chest beating suitable for rednecks with the brain of a fern. Of course today's MTV kids will love it! My god get a life!I saw this at work off a bootleg thank god I didn't pay for it. I mercifully turned off the DVD before the end not caring what happened. If this is going to be the sorry result of remakes the entertainment world is in trouble. I'll give it a 1 of 10 just to knock it lower than the overrated 6.3 rating that the ADDriddled youngsters of today have given it.".

It was recommended by a friend of a friend who we can only assume finds Police Academy 7 funny too.My mate wanted to leave after 10 minutes when we realised there weren't even any good looking women in it to distract us from another moronic Sandler remake e.g. Mr Deeds.The main premise of this 'comedy' appears to be showcasing how great popular and hard Adan Sandler is. Sandler seems unable to cast himself as anything other than a mistreated retard who beats people up the most popular man on Earth who always gets the girlwins a competition despite the efforts of a rich bad guy.Considering he was surrounded by a decent support cast in Chris Rock and Burt Reynolds it's amazing that he felt the need to give the 'funniest' lines to a group of wrestlers. I truly have seen better comic delivery at a nativity play. Steve Austin is the best of a bad bunch and to be honest noone could be as unfunny as Sandler's best mate Rob 'Deuce Bigalow' Schneider who has a cameo for no reason.So in summary never ever watch this film unless you want to not laugh or are trying to split up with someone.I read somewhere that Sandler was first choice to play the cab driver in Collateral. Maybe they wouldn't cast Rob Schneider in Cruise's role so he declined ?Seriously Sandler please please stop making films. Leave comedy to funny people like Ben Stiller. If you do carry on cos a seven year old once laughed at a fart gag in 'Happy Gilmore' don't do another remake and ruin the memories of a decent original.".

It was the same old tired gags that guys like Chris Rock and Adam Sandler have been peddling for years. Sandler had a chance to make a serious motion picture with some real drama and he blew it. There were various changes made from the original movie from specific lines to entire scenes and I honestly can't think of one that was an improvement. All the times where Crewe was a tough underspoken character that really shined well... he just became a smartmouth in the new movie. They also sanitized a couple of scenes that really bothered me...SPOILER ALERT Crewe no longer slaps the girlfriend at the beginning but now locks her in a closet. Not a big change and at the time I didn't think much about it but later on when it's revealed that he actually did shave points for money the new movie subtly changes it so that a reason is given and he says that his life was in danger if he didn't do it. I guess Sandler wasn't happy with Crewe having real human flaws like the rest of us and needed to justify Crewe's actions. I liked the original better where Crewe just made a mistake and felt regret for doing it. It somehow felt more real to me.END OF SPOILERS They basically turned a great movie into a movie with nothing but cheap gags. It was very disappointing.".

Sandler showed no emotion and gave the audience little reason to support of empathize with him. Rock does a good job adlibbing through a poorly rewritten script the original screenplay by Tracy Keenan Wynn was great. He must be cringing through every minute watching this hash. I found myself for much of the movie comparing scenes line delivery and dialog with the original. And nine times out of 10 the remake came up lacking. Sadly Hollywood is not going to get the message we all want this poorly made film to deliver because it will do extremely well at the box office thanks to the casting of Sandler Nelly and the exjocks bringing a builtin audience. Only source of enjoyment to me were the less obvious cameos including Dan Patrick as the Miami traffic cop.".

Basically it's about a washed updisgraced ex NFL star who loses the plot one night and crashes a heap of police cars. He goes straight to prison luckily besides the guards it looks like a lovely place to hang out. Pretty quickly the warden wants to put his football skills to the test and a guards vs crims match is setup.It's pretty predictable and focuses pretty much purely on the football game. There's plenty of stars in the movie but most went into this one purely to CTC. Rock and Sandler put in pretty lazy performances although they have a few good oneliners. The best performance comes from Terry Crewe playing Cheeseburger Eddy. He was also great in White Chicks and is likely gonna keep getting these same ridiculous roles for years to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1994 Peter Segal made his feature film directorial debut with NAKED GUN 33 13 THE FINAL INSULT the hilarious concluding chapter of the NAKED GUN series. His followup was the even funnier TOMMY BOY in 1995 one of the best comedies of the 1990s. His next film MY FELLOW Americans was pretty funny but failed to generate the same number of laughs as his two previous films. Still it seemed like Segal was destined to become one of the next great comedy directors. That is until 2000's NUTTY PROFESSOR II THE KLUMPS a lame rehash of the 1996 remake. Since then he's continued to direct pretty mediocre comedies like ANGER MANAGEMENT and 50 FIRST DATES so I had low expectations when I heard he was to direct the THE LONGEST YARD. Luckily THE LONGEST YARD his latest movie is his best film since TOMMY BOY thanks to Segal's great comedic direction. In addition to handling the comedy well he also does a fantastic job with the football scenes. In fact I think it is safe to say that because of Segal's direction THE LONGEST YARD is the best football film of the 2000s so far.Anybody that knows me knows that if there is one type of movie I hate it's remakes. There is no reason for them making them pointless. However for whatever reason I actually enjoyed this one. From the great opening shot of a beautiful girl swimming in a pool to the very last shot of Warden Hazen James Cromwell getting Gatorade poured all over him I found myself having a ball. It's just an all around fun film. Everyone does a great job with their roles especially Sandler and Rock and for an almost two hour movie THE LONGEST YARD is fastpaced.Still THE LONGEST YARD has its fair share of problems. The rap sound track doesn't seem to fit the picture very well some of the jokes fall pretty flati.e. most of the gay jokes and there's not nearly as much character development as there was in the original. Despite these flaws THE LONGEST YARD remains one of the highlights of 2005. Recommended.".

This is fine if you are a huge Sandler fan but if you are impartial to his work you will be losing interest quickly. Sandler needs to pop up with a few arthouse serious roles and evolve a little more with his own material.The rest of the cast plod along with less than exciting performances. Perhaps my biggest problem was the way violence was deemed to be the resolution to all the problems.

With movies like Punch Drunk Love and Eight Crazy Nights you had to ask yourself if Sandler had lost his golden touch though he did save himself with his dramatic roles in Spanglish and 50 First Dates. Sandler like Jim Carrey and Robin Williams really belongs in the comedic roles where quick wit and obvious ad lib are not only welcomed but expected. Sandler absolutely dominates in this film. He wasn't hurting for supporting characters either Chris Rock's role as Caretaker is a bit unbelievable but he delivers his lines with his well known standup approach to comedy. He's funny and lovable a definite asset to the movie. Burt Reynolds taking on the senior role this time around as opposed to the lead in the '74 version obviously has a lessor impact on the story but he plays it well with his hard nosed shy but deadly attitude. Then there is Terry Crews as Cheeseburger Eddy... if you thought that this guy was funny in White Chicks then you can expect more of the same hilarity in The Longest Yard. Every scene with Crews is laugh out loud.I didn't know what to expect from this movie being that it was a remake but I can say with sincerity that I was truly impressed with the acting and story line. With characters like Sasquatch McAsshole and Colonel Sanders it would be difficult not to be. This movie is not to be missed!".

I figured I'd watch a few minutes see what it was all about and finish labeling the tapes. Long story short the project was set aside for another day and Never a Dull Moment became a family favorite! This is a Disney movie from the '60's and as such represents some of Disney's best before the days of formulaic family movies. It's not really aimed at children the story is dialoguedriven and the lead character's predicament is presented through dramatic irony. Younger viewers may not get it. That all makes it sound heavy but it's actually incredibly funny. Three major aspects of comedy physicalslapstick situational and verbal. All three are present and woven together in a way that certainly held my attention. I can't speak for everyone but the title rings true for me over and over! The acting is solid all around. Dick Van Dyke steals the show as Jack Albany an actor mistaken for renowned hit man Ace Williams played by Jack Elam. Van Dyke is at his comedic best. Presumptious Florian Tony Bill having never seen Ace makes the mistake forcing Jack into a situation where his survival depends on his acting. On some level this movie pokes fun at the typical mob story. You have the boss the tough guy the inept guy the pro pickpocket the driver the dumb broad and the kid. The actors play their stereotyped parts well highlights being Tony Bill and Joanna Moore. This may be the best role Tony Bill ever playedhis other roles just seem flat in comparison to this punk who changes from a creepy armed henchman to a whining flinching doormat depending on how much trouble he's in. Bill has however become a successful producerdirector. Edward G. Robinson seems to relish playing Joe Smooth a powerful artloving mob boss who may be losing it a bit mentally. Dorothy Provine is good also as Smooth's art teacher but my biggest beef with the movie is the part of the script where she explains her connection to the boss. It works but it could have been better.Overall I recommend this movie. It's no cinematic triumph but it is good clean fun and it is very funny! Most parents are probably aware but for those that aren't the ratings system has changed since the '60's. This one was G in that time period when smoking was commonplace and violence in the movies wasn't the issue that it is in the 21st century. Not that one era is better than another I honestly can't fathom why Ice Age and Over the Hedge are PG movies but this one has some PG material by today's standards. An engaging story with lots of laughs!".

Add a Walt Disney movie to his list of screen credits and allow him to do a film about his passionate avocation that of art collector.Robinson combines it with the last of gangster roles that of Leo Joseph Smooth both gangster and art collector. Robinson is pretty much retired from the day to day business of running a criminal enterprise kind of like Vito Corleone only he's pulling himself back in for one last go.He has it mind to own a large mural that is being shipped to the United States for exhibit so he's going to steal it. With that in mind he hires a whole lot of his old gang back plus a couple of extra hands.Which is where Dick Van Dyke comes in. For reasons I cannot fathom Tony Bill mistakes actor Dick Van Dyke with hoodlum Jack Elam. To save his life Van Dyke goes along with the mistake for almost the entire run of the film as he's taken to Robinson's well guarded home. Van Dyke calls on all his acting skills to convince Robinson and his whole gang he's really a hoodlum.Fortunately for him he meets up with Dorothy Provine who's an art teacher that Robinson hired to improve him culturally. The two of them have a whale of a time trying to get out before the caper comes off.Never A Dull Moment has a few good laughs and also in Disney studio's tradition at that time employs a nice range of film character actors who were finding less and less work as the studios were putting out less and less product for the big screen.It does rest however on the weak premise that Dick Van Dyke could possibly be mistaken for Jack Elam. In that it's weak indeed.".

To save his life Van Dyke goes along with the mistake for almost the entire run of the film as he's taken to Robinson's well guarded home. Van Dyke calls on all his acting skills to convince Robinson and his whole gang he's really a hoodlum.Fortunately for him he meets up with Dorothy Provine who's an art teacher that Robinson hired to improve him culturally. The two of them have a whale of a time trying to get out before the caper comes off.Never A Dull Moment has a few good laughs and also in Disney studio's tradition at that time employs a nice range of film character actors who were finding less and less work as the studios were putting out less and less product for the big screen.It does rest however on the weak premise that Dick Van Dyke could possibly be mistaken for Jack Elam. In that it's weak indeed.";

	schema:reviewBody "The plot is as follows Jack Albany comic actor who ironically usually plays heavies walks off the set of stereotypical gangster TV movie still wearing his mobster outfit costume. He meets a young punk named Florian who confuses Jack for a hit man the former was expecting but has never seen. Jack calls upon his best acting skills to pretend to be the hit man known only as Ace Williams. He and Florian hightail it back to cultured gangster Joe Smooth's mansion. There while still pretending to be Ace Jack learns of a Smoothplot to steal a painting from the Manhatten Museum of Art the next day. Ace has the task of killing one or two Museum guards to make the theft possible. Jack makes the acquaintance of Smooth's comely female art instructor. A romance quickly develops between the two. To sum it all up Jack and the instructor then manage to foil the heist get Smooth and all his henchmen arrested and the new couple live happily ever after with Jack BTW getting favorable heistfoiling publicity which will undoubtedly help his acting career.Now to the misunderstanding part I wrote of in the title. This film is slightly dullbut on purpose. Ironic to its title. It is supposed to be about the difference between stereotypicalfilm gangster situations and real life gangsters. When the film opened up taking place on the set of a gangster movie the film Jack and the other actors are making looks all clichd with a big melodramatic shootout at the end of the story. There are no such theatrics when Jack is foiling the real gangster heist at the Museum just a lot of talk and clumsy chasing and stumbling perhaps more like it would really happen. The real gangsters are superbly drawn out even to the point of some of them like Cowboy Schaefer possibly being slightly boring but hey they are supposed to be more like real life hoods and they aren't supposed to exist for just two hours to entertain us. In short the misunderstanding was that no viewers who commented on here before seemed to realize it was all supposed to drag once Jack leaves the movie set in the name of realism. The realism is also heightened and contrasted by the very small enclosed movie set Jack was on early versus the very large ceilingincluded mansion he later finds himself in while pretending to be Ace. Also when the real Ace Williams actually later shows up he is wearing a thenmodern 1960's twopiece business suitcontrasting sharply with the stereotyped gangster way Jack is dressed see above. What is wrong with Dick Van Dyke Jack Albany being mistaken for Jack Elam the real Ace Williams? Nobody in the film was supposed to know in the slightest what the authentic hit man looked like.".

As an adult Vercingetorix becomes a brave and insightful warrior and at first joins forces with the charismatic Julius Caesar.

	schema:reviewBody "Vercingtorix is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's a catastrophe beyond your imagination. Christophe Lambert is ridiculous as young Vercingetorix and as old Vercingetorix too. The dialogues are so bad even I could have done better. The costumes look like rags. The fights are boring. Some scenes are so inconsistent it's funny... Example imagine you've been living in a forest all of your life without seeing the world. OK. Now you're going out of the forest obviously not a very thick one and what can you see? A via romana a roman highway. Yes. Just a couple of trees from your cave. And who's riding on it with a couple of bodyguards and one extrahorse? Julius Caesar himself and its fierce army. And the emperor just gives you a horse because he has an extra one. And this explains why some time later in the movie Christophe Lambert says giving a horse back to a roman soldier I give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. I'd say the following things to people who have the opportunity to see Druids by the way what druids? Those whiteclad weirdos jumping around with a sword? If you are a cinema student you might want to see this movie just to get what you should never do. If you are interested in bad movie experiments don't miss it either it's a cult movie for many people for that very reason. If you're just a normal person don't lose 3 hours of your life. The first hour is very funny but the 2 following ones are long.".

However as with all truly bad films this film really can't decide what it wants to be. It makes a game attempt at historical accuracy at least history according to Ceasar which is all we have to go on by portraying Vercingetorix as someone who is willing to deal with the enemy then betray them and there are some scenes such as the breastbaring women distracting the Romans which have a basis in writings of the time. OK  I'd be willing to forgive the historically inaccurate and very unscary German connection until... ...we see Vercingetorix chatting with busty druidesses and gaining a magic sword and magic powers which he proceeds to twirl around faster than is humanly possible. Err OK  so it wants to be a fantasy film. In which case why set it in a real historical time period with so many real events to build off  just go all out like Conan and be done with it. I mean  if he has magical power he should win at the end right?The film proceeds to both destroy history and ruin one's enjoyment of all fantasy films with ruthless efficiency. So thats the screenplay written off but perhaps it can be saved by some good performances?Lambert. Never before has there been an actor made entirely of wood. Does this man have more than one facial expression carved on his trunk? Ceasar was passable but lets face it if he wants to make a name for himself by playing famous Romans he is in for a long wait for that phone call. The rest of the cast act like and probably are extras. Good for them for getting some face time I say.OK  so the screenplay and acting are garbage. Perhaps the action andor special effects can save the film. Err. No. Sorry. Joan of Arc and Gladiatorstyle battle scenes this does not have. I'm willing to even cut it some slack for its obviously low budget but even taking that into account its a nonstarter.When you truly feel you could have made a better film with claymation figures and a shoebox camera then something is very very wrong indeed. However that is not the end of it. The awful choppy editing and lack of timing and pacing combined with everything else makes for a truly painful viewing experience one of the worst in my living memory. It is this which turns a merely bland and boring film into a bottom100 dweller.If the real Vercingetorix saw this he'd fall on his sword. Nul points as they say at Eurovision.".

This is an inferior Sword and Sandals tale and a standard film from the 2000s . It's made middling scale with some spectacular battles and in Peplum style .Young Vercingetorix Chistopher Lambert came of age in 60 B.C. as soldiers of the Roman Empire ran roughshod over Gaul and his brave father was imprisoned and fired alive by Romans  then he seeks vendetta  as every battle needs a hero . A wise and philosophical druid called Guttuart Max Von Sidow  tells the avenger Vercingetorix that he should seek peace  justice and vengeance by winning freedom for Gaul from the Romans. It concerns about angry Vercingetorix and conqueror Julius Caesar and their famous existence on Gaul  including feats  fights  political events  betrayal  wars and lover Ines Sastre . Vercingetorix provokes a general rebellion against Roman domination  he rallies his people and tribes when they are threatened by an army commanded by Julius Caesar Klaus Maria Brandauer  as an entire nation's destiny lies in the hands of one man. His people made hima leader the empire made him a renegade  history made him a hero.Although the deeds described are historically inaccurate  some events are vivid and authentic . The action is regularly done with middling interpretations and the story occasionally drags for an uneven script by Rospo Pallenberg who previously wrote Excalibur  however to be liked for Christopher Lambert fans . The picture is partially based on real events . These are the followings  Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix dead at 46 b.c was an insightful and heroic warrior  whose valiant father was captured and executed by Romans  he was leader a massive rebellion against Roman domination . He seeks peace order  justice and victory by winning freedom for Gaul from the invaders Romans  and soon he raises an army of his own to defeat Julius Caesar  but in time Vercingetorix is betrayed by a great leader and he joins a powerful army to vanquish Caesar and bring Guttuart's prophesy to life.

Then he's coerced to a handcuffed parade throughout the Rome streets  being killed after six years in prison . Later on  Caesar married Calpurnia and is appointed Consul for life and then he crossed river Rubicon . His history is written by Julius Caesar himsef in 'Comments about War of Gaul' or 'De Bello Galico' also he wrote in brilliant and elegant style 'Comments about Civil War' or 'De Bello Civili'. The film contains a colorful cinematography by Stefan Ivanov and Plamen Somov  shot in Bulgaria Sofia . And atmospheric and evocative musical score by Pierre Charvet.  The motion picture was regularly directed by Jacques Dorfmann and shot both in English and French . He's a good writer and especially producer as Quest of fire   Bethune  Shock treatment    Army of Shadows  and occasionally director as Vercingetorix and Shadow of the wolf.

There was not one redeeming thing to this film let alone the cheap wigs and fake moustaches Klaus Maria Brandauer doing Julius Caeser and sounding like Marlon Brando in the Young Lions as a Nazi officer and the intro and exit with the view from space that looked like the schlock film Hercules goes to New York with Arnold Schwarznegger back in the early 70's.If you haven't seen it save your rental fee...they must have burned theaters in Europe when it came out.Sorry Christophe...".

However the movie has nothing to do with the book.  The movie has nothing to do with Druids.  The movie has nothing to do with anything. I'm not even sure there was a script despite the fact that there were at least two writing credits.  If there was a script I'm not sure anyone in the movie bothered to read it.The casting is good for a mild chuckle.  I love how the young Vercingetorix who speaks with a distinct American accent grows up to be Christopher Lambert who barely manages to spit out vaguely understandable English warped by a grating French accent that could peel paint.Bad sets bad costumes bad cinematography bad casting bad direction bad acting bad editing bad research bad music bad hair.  I would recommend this movie only for insomniacs who have already tried all the other sleepinducing agents available on the market.Where can Christopher Lambert go from here?  1010220 commercials?".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I'd like to say that I saw the original version of the movie the title of which was much more appropriate Vercingtorix as this movie focuses on the Celtic hero and not on Druids. The movie uses a lot of fancy French words and their English translation might seem odd to you but the French version is really not bad! Therefore you might not enjoy this movie if compared to say Gladiator. For your viewing pleasure forget you ever saw Gladiator and Braveheart.And remember that the Celts were known for their eloquent wording and gestures so do not rant about how 'fake' the acting was. The thing is the movie is pretty realistic in this sense so realistic in fact that it's almost a documentary and a bit dull for those of you expecting attractive hunks driven by raging passion. Some of those who have seen it said the actors especially Lambert had bad hair in the movie as though they were rock stars of the eighties. Hello people this is not a Hollywood film where the hero has to look cleancut and shaven and nicely dressed! This IS how the Celts living in Gaul looked like so get over it! There were some nice scenery in the movie though they were not exploited to add romanticism and grandeur. The one thing I'm really glad about is that the two 'love' stories in the film were NOT used to spice up the mood. They were discrete and original though some may criticize the lack of emotion shown by the characters. The costumes were a bit fake they were obviously made of cheap material especially the uniforms of the Romans but I figured that's more historically accurate than those shiny clean perfectly sown costumes in Hollywood epics. The soundtrack is beautiful but I know that only because I have it on CD. Sadly it's almost nonexistent in the movie and the best song on the soundtrack is not even used in the film! I fail to undertand why the soundtrack hadn't been exploited in the movie it would have clearly played a major role in the occasionally present emotional manipulation of the audience! If you're interested in Celtic heroes do watch it it's the only film about Vercingetorix and it's not THAT bad!".

But it certain isn't a memorable epic. The storyline is a fairly historically accurate tribute to one of the great French ancients. Unfortunately the French didn't make a worthy tribute to a hero. Criticism falls all over whether it's boring poorly written is a waste of Max von Sydow and Klaus Maria Brandauer Christopher Lambert doesn't have talent to waste has errors or is poorly directed. I'm not sure if any of the reasons given is really true.For an epic it is weak as it lacks visual beauty that most epics e.g Gladiator Braveheart typically have. Most modern epics have large doses of action and gore but this film lacks either. Without visual effects it's more in the style of classic epics such as Spartacus but it also lacks fine cinematography necessary for an epic. Camerawork is also very mediocre. It seems the director Jacques Dorfmann lacked imagination and a flair for capturing the audience. It has the appearance of a madeforTV film. The script actually has some fine lines see the quotes on IMDb but runs into inconsistent and awkwardness at times and some poor acting by the supporting cast. It's dry lack of imagination inability to captivate the audience poor cinematography and poor supporting cast just stamp mediocrity all over it.".

Here we are given an account of Julius Caesar's excursion into Gaul. Of course this is 60 BC so we don't know if French men all sounded like Maurice Chevalier.Nothing should surprise a person on the world wide web and certainly nothing on IMDb should shock a person but the ridiculous reviews that abound here are embarrassments to the people who wrote them.This epic film worked on all levels. I am not easily entertained. Yet this smacked of old style epic directing of de Mille Lean Ford and others who knew how to sustain an audience's interest who made films for the audience instead of insisting the audience be made for the film.The film was well structured full of action and drama full of interesting characters. In fact this is probably the most realistic looking representation of a couple of specific historical characters I have seen in film. To say more would be a spoiler.The film had a few flaws. The child who plays the young hero is very wooden and sounds like he is reading words. A few lines look contrived particularly early. There is no real comic relief.But the film flows very well and has epic proportions. It is undeniably more entertaining than 90 of movies made after 1965. The characters seem alive and believable.Of the famous modern directors only Verhoeven and Jackson can rival this one with keeping an audience interested. They would have known the value of comic relief too.Now for the real kicker. The ridiculous pans of this film that flood this site are a total humiliation for IMDb. This is an very good film. The low ratings make IMDb lose what little credibility it has.And it reveals what we already know. That the main trouble with IMDb is that it is not representative of intelligent critics or of the populace. The fact is that IMDb by its nature is a site for many in the Entertainment business and their relatives.What we see here is sour grapes. Some one in the cast or crew really got under the skin of a few people. And honestly we do see proof to any rational mind that most of these pan reviews were written by one or two people with multiple fake user names.How do we know? Because this film makes two mistakes in getting good reviews. First it alienates the control freak. This is not a control freak's film. The control freak characters come across as control freaks. Look at IMDb's top 250 at the top 10. Most of them glorify and mollycoddle control freaks.Don't underestimate the psychotic persistence of the control freaks. It's unfortunate that mature oriented films with mature and credible characters have to deal with this ridiculous rabid obsession of morons.The other major reason for unprovoked poor reviews is that the film is very risk taking and iconoclastic. To say more is to be a spoiler again. Low ratings from the sheep of the world is inevitable for risk taking film makers.The low ratings bespeak of IMDb users with severe psychotic conditions.This is a very good film.".

	schema:reviewBody "No this is not classic cinema nor does it even approach being a superior film but when's the last time you saw a film about Galls and Gaul? Vercingtorix as one reviewer notes should be seen in the original French as too too much gets lost in the translation over to being dubbed.  If one is not familiar with Roman history and especially the military writings of Caesar the story will have little relevance.  All you have to do is read the scathing reviews herein submitted by indignant viewers who wanted a rerun of Braveheart.  The betrayal of Vercingtorix due to the intrigues and shifting alliances among the Galls is well documented by Caesar in his Gallic Wars. This film does capture some of that.  Having said that I must observe that after having seen the dubbed version released as The Druids and seeing the stilted performances I likely would have written a review like most of the others. However the French version comes across very differently.  I must add just one point to the one favorable review in the way of a slight correction  The film is about the Galls who were a loose association of tribesmen speaking a language Gallic which was related to the Celtic languages spoken today namely Scottish and Irish Gaelic and Welsh.  Manx and Briton are versions of Welsh.  Unfortunately while the Romans were great political historians and wrote extensively on the politics of the Galls they did no language studies.  Hence no texts in Gallic survive today and we have only bits and pieces to reconstruct what those original languages were like.  The same is true for Etruscan which did not belong to the IndoEuropean family.  My point is this film attempts to capture some of the cultural features of those people who were eventually absorbed by Rome and eventually became the nation of France.".

The betrayal of Vercingtorix due to the intrigues and shifting alliances among the Galls is well documented by Caesar in his Gallic Wars. This film does capture some of that.  Having said that I must observe that after having seen the dubbed version released as The Druids and seeing the stilted performances I likely would have written a review like most of the others. However the French version comes across very differently.  I must add just one point to the one favorable review in the way of a slight correction  The film is about the Galls who were a loose association of tribesmen speaking a language Gallic which was related to the Celtic languages spoken today namely Scottish and Irish Gaelic and Welsh.  Manx and Briton are versions of Welsh.  Unfortunately while the Romans were great political historians and wrote extensively on the politics of the Galls they did no language studies.  Hence no texts in Gallic survive today and we have only bits and pieces to reconstruct what those original languages were like.  The same is true for Etruscan which did not belong to the IndoEuropean family.  My point is this film attempts to capture some of the cultural features of those people who were eventually absorbed by Rome and eventually became the nation of France.";

However this French film about ancient French history does NOT follow the current mold for Hollywood epics that is to say it does not pander to an appetite for overblown action and bombast and it does not feature a selfpitying masochistic macho heroloser suitable for casting Mel Gibson or Russell Crowe. To be sure the zenlike attitude of the hero Vercingetorix is often obscure but that is the point of the movie. More firmly grounded is the character of Julius Caesar portrayed more intriguingly here than in almost any other movie he is urbane charming and as deadly as an asp. Diametrical opposites both men believe themselves to be at the mercy of something they call Destiny. One loses the war and one wins it but in the end they share the same fate. Such fatalism is entirely alien to American movies and probably hard for many viewers to swallow.So DRUIDS offends actionfantasy fans and it may also disappoint hardcore history buffs because of the liberties it takes with the details of Caesar's war against the Gauls. However the scene with barebreasted women taunting and distracting the Roman soldiers is actually based on history. The archDruid played by Max von Sydow is cryptic to a fault Lambert is too old to play the hero in the early part of the action. But the film's faults are largely redeemed by its cosmic view signaled by the comet that traverses space at the beginning of the movie and the matching pullaway into space at the film's end. The questions the movie raises about passive resistance in the face of aggressive warmongering are both timely and timeless.".

I cannot understand those who dislike it so! Maybe it has to do with how much preknowledge you have. I read Caesar's own account of the Gallic Wars recently so for me it was very interesting to see the events of the memoirs acted out before my eyes in very beautiful and  for the most part  historically accurate pictures.Everything is not right Vercingtorix' wife was NOT Caesar's mistress in reality at least nothing like that is taken down in the annals anywhere  but this is not more odd than the fact that Spartacus' woman was Crassus' mistress in the highly approved movie Spartacus from 1960! The Gauls' helmets with horns on them are probably not right either. But these are small things.The Romans are depicted very accurately with their uniforms weapons and helmets their fortresses and battle formations. The props in Caesar's tent are also just right the hanging oil lamps the papyrus rolls and feather pens the small models of war machines... Also there is beautiful and wise dialog  especially at the end of the movie. I listened to some of it several times just because it was so good. And magical music...Christopher Lambert is always a little wooden of course  he does not have very many facial expressions!   but I think he was very believable in this movie. It was just right to use a french actor for the leader of the Gauls! I see nothing silly with his wig either  the Gauls DID have hair like that!  But I would have preferred a more handsome man to play Caesar. This one was too short tubby and broadfaced compared to the statues of Caesar. This was the only real mistake in the movie I think that there was no really handsome man to admire in it  with a Rex Harrison for Caesar I would have given it ten stars! There was a very beautiful woman for the male viewers to look at though Ins Sastre.A movie truly worth watching!".

I dreaded this movie all the way home from the video store where my 2 year old insisted that we rent this movie thinking a movie about barbie has got to be horrible. But I was pleasantly surprised. The movie actually follows somewhat of a coherent plot. The animation is above average for these direct to video movies. The characters are of course beautiful but they are also pretty well fleshed out for a 60 minute long movie. Of course after seeing this my daughter wanted to immediately run out and buy an Elina doll. However for those of you who aren't excited about buying Barbie dolls due to the sexist and perfectionist attitude taken making the dolls can rest assured that the dolls are at least mythical fairies and therefore can't help being perfect. Or whatever just buy your daughter the dolls already. Okay so maybe the movie did make me want to buy the dolls but like I said it was a pretty good movie for what it is!".

I'm not normally one for writing comments on movies but i guessed because i just watched it it would be okay to comment on it. Fairytopia is a movie that i guess i would take on a car trip considering we have normally one or two days to watch movies. I'm not one for watching little kids movies but i guess if you're stuck in the car for two days with two little toddlers it's okay to watch Barbie movies or little kid movies. When you think about it maybe you should appreciate that not all movies are filled with violence and swearing. Well i guess they still make good movies now a days not that there are that many. It's not even safe for young children to be flicking through the channels at night. Well i guess that's when it's good to have appropriate movies to watch.".

I didn't really know what to say as she exploded into multicolored bits?? We enjoyed the Pegasus movie MUCH more. The villain got a satisfying comeuppance but did not die in the Pegasus movie. A better ending for my granddaughter than violent deaths such as the witches in Sleeping Beauty and The Little Mermaid.I was totally disappointed in the animation in Fairytopia the scenery could have been much more complex  beautiful. The animation in Pegasus was far more lovely IMO. The Barbie character had more expression  looked less like a plastic doll.My grandkids did get a lot of giggles over Bibble though.".

She reminds me of this girl Jessica i work with. I don't want to give away to much bu the animation is fantastic and the characters are all so beautiful and sparkle with Barbie magic.

Fairytopia is not my favouriteI have more of a soft spot for Nutcracker Diamond Castle and Prince and the Pauper but it shares pretty much the same attributes that make the Barbie movies in the first place. It is not a perfect movie with some dialogue that doesn't flow as well as it should and character designs that could've had more life and less of a plastic feel. However the backgrounds and sceneries are very colourful and I do like the whimsy of the music. The story a fresh concept rather than a loose adaptation of an existing story is cute and charming as you'd expect and the characters while nothing exactly new are still likable. All in all a very sweet movie. 710 Bethany Cox".

As an adult it's like getting high and falling into some surreal and rather sexist world of faeries and trolls.It's Barbie so that alone should have warned me right from the getgo that the main character would be a blonde ditz not that blondes are dumb most of my friends and I are blondes and a girlygirl who loves pink appears so thin she looks anorexic and lives in a giant pink flower. She has this weird purple and turquoise whatchamacallit as a pet named  now hang on this is creativity at its best  Bibble....sigh.Then as usual the enemies of the natureembracing treehugging hippie faeries are the evil earthhating antagonists. Ruled by a witch named Laverna who has knocked out the queen of the faeries god knows why there are strange assassins and lackeys with elf ears and bad acne called Fungusses. Not fungi that would be way too scientific for us dumb girls to grasp! The directors obviously never heard of proper terminology before. Anyway Elina the pink girly fairy notices all the plants are dying and she decides to go on a quest to find the culprit and to seek out a guardian fairy. Why doesn't she just buy some pesticides and spray what is killing the plants? The world may never know.Along the way Elina meets that grotesque butterfly I mentioned having a toy of Hue who has the creepiest damned voice I've ever heard. This is Barbie so of course she also meets a prince.Some people say that this movie is charming I beg to differ. It's about as charming as someone's toe caught in a mousetrap. Some people say this is a great role model for kids. Well sure if you want your kid to grow up to be a 50'sstyle housewife and fall to the pressure of superficial looks! Some people say this has a deep environmental message. Let me contemplate that while I litter and pour some bleach on the ground.This movie has no real deep theme it is just a really thoughtless lame kid's movie made to sell Barbie products. If you have any sanity left watch something else.".
