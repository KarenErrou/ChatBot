	schema:reviewBody "This early John Wayne Lone Star western has a bit more going for it than the runofthemill oaters Wayne had been making for Lone Star up until that time. For one it has his old friend Paul Fix in it Fix being a much better actor then the standard Lone Star villain brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant linereadings often delivered in these oaters. The plot about mistaken identity payroll robbery and murder is as trite and perfunctory as you'd expect it to be in a 1930s lowbudget western but Wayne's strapping good looks easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable. Plump balding Eddy Chandler isn't quite believable as Wayne's womanizing partner and there's a running gag about something that happens whenever Chandler and Wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome. On the other hand Wayne's love interest is played by none other than Mary Kornman the little Mary of the early Little Rascals fame. She is a grownup 20yearold now blonde and cute as a button. Most of Wayne's leading ladies in these Lone StarMonogram B's were fairly bland and colorless but Mary is perky cute and yes sexy. There's a scene in the general store where she works in which Wayne asks her to get him a bottle of nerve tonic which happens to be on the top shelf so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf. Wayne's ogling of her pert little backside as she ascends the steps then again as she comes down then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935. Wayne makes no attempt at all to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt. It's surprising that this got past the Hays Office censors but they were probably more concerned with the product that came out of the main studios rather than a cheap B western from someas far as they were concernednoname outfit.Anyway it's an interesting little B not great but not as choppy and disorganized as many of his Lone Star productions of the time. The final gunfight isn't handled all that well and Chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while but all in all it's worth a look if only to see a cute and sexy Mary Kornman.".

The dialogue surrounding Wayne's and Kansas's competition over the girls is delightfully funny. So is the scene with Anne having to stretch out for Wayne's ogling benefit. Credit should go to writer Lindsley Parsons and director Lewis Collins who keeps Wayne loose and in the mood. And where did the guy playing Kansa come from. He looks more like a banker than a sidekick. But he sure knows his way around a laugh line. Pairing him with Wayne is almost inspired.I guess an entry like this is largely a matter of taste. It departs from the matine formula by emphasizing a rather adult level of humor. Probably most kids didn't much like it. The plot is pretty good more coherent than most with the usual hardriding bigshooting action. One thing for sure Lone Star didn't pop for locations on this one. I can almost see the LA outskirts in the distance. Anyway this one gave me a lot more chuckles than I ever expected and I may be wrong but I don't think Wayne ever again reached quite this level of relaxed comedic acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I explain the Alias comment let me say that The Desert Trail is bad even by the standards of westerns staring The Three Stooges. In fact it features Carmen Laroux as semi bad girl Juanita when you hear her Mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita from the classic Stooge short Saved by the Belle. In The Desert Trail John Wayne gets to play the Moe Howard character and Eddy Chandler gets to play Curly Howard. Like their Stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53 minute movie is Moe hitting Curly. Wayne's character a skirt chasing bully is not very endearing but is supposed to be the good guy. Playing a traveling rodeo cowboy Wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been goodthe other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar actually even less after Wayne robs the box office. No explanation is given for Wayne's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl. Things get complicated at this point because the villain Al Ferguson and his sidekick Larry Fine played by Paul Fixwho would go on to play Sheriff Micah on television's The Rifleman see Wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager. Moe and Curly get blamed. So Moe and Curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to Smith and Jones. Who do they meet first but their old friend Larry whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest Senorita Rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie. Larry's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful Mary Kornman now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of Hal Roach's Our Gang shorts. Kornman is the main reason to watch the megalame western and her scenes with Moe and Curly are much better than any others in the production as if they used an entirely different crew to film them. Even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film making is staggeringly bad. The two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse. Both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground but there is no horse in the frame the film stock is completely different and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider. There is liberal use of stock footage in other places none of it even remotely convincing. One thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where Moe and Curly get on their horses and ride away to screen right from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left. The cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse. Outside of home movies I have never seen anything like this not because it is looks stupid which it does but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner. They would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action. Or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

The two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse. Both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground but there is no horse in the frame the film stock is completely different and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider. There is liberal use of stock footage in other places none of it even remotely convincing. One thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where Moe and Curly get on their horses and ride away to screen right from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left. The cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse. Outside of home movies I have never seen anything like this not because it is looks stupid which it does but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner. They would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action. Or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.";

	schema:reviewBody "Well this is the first I've seen one of John Wayne's Bwesterns preStagecoach and I watched for one reason only It's the only one that features a grownup Mary Kornman formerly of the silent Our Gang series. Her charms are still ample here as when she was a preteen but her part mainly calls for her to react to the arguments between Wayne and his conman cohort Eddy Chandler. There's a funny scene in the beginning where Wayne manages to woo Carmen Laroux while Chandler has to sit silently because earlier the latter promised to act dumb so he wouldn't get mixed up with another woman but the way Wayne stomps on Chandler's foot every time the latter tries to punch him never became funny with me. A later scene with the Duke asking for some tonic on the top shelf is funny though since Kornman seems partly aware of John wanting to check her out! The story itself fits the 52minute running time so there's no stretching at the seems. All in all The Desert Trail was a somewhat enjoyable timewaster. P.S. There's a mix of both actual score music by Lee Zahler from the original print and latterday additional scoring from William Barber that are obvious depending on how the music sounds though Barber's score isn't too distracting. And Ms. Kornman eventually became an expert horsewoman herself before she died on June 1 1973.".

The film follows their adventures as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the Mexican Juanita and later in their pursuit of perky Mary Kornman who has the inevitable evil brother though he'd been led astray by the real villain and wants to repent.

It all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western but it sounds better than it actually is. Sadly the exciting action elements we find in many other Lone Stars are sorely missing here. No Yakima Canutt. Cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses. No George Hayes. Tedious Stoogelike biplay between Scott and Charlie with Charlie swinging at Scott Scott stomping on his foot and then punching him repeated two more times!. The skilled Paul Fix is underused.

Mary Kornman of the twenties Our Gang see 'Mary Queen of Tots' 1925 is cute in her scenes with John Wayne but that's about it for this one. Seeds of a better western lie buried here.P.S.

Aside from obvious stock footage in the rodeo sequences this rates as an unusually wellproduced and smartly directed entry in the Lone Star series. Wayne turns on the virile charm and makes a most ingratiating lead. We love the sparks that constantly fly between him and his unlikely but fascinating offsider Eddy Chandler. We also enjoyed the performances of both Mary Kornman as the icy storekeeper who tries to put Wayne in his place and Carmen Laroux who turns on the heat as a Mexican vamp. Despite some familiar plot elements the script is both cleverly outoftherut and highly entertaining. The dialogue is especially deft. At the same time the plot incorporates more than enough action to satisfy the fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Give the producers at Monogram Pictures a. k. a. Lone Star some credit They gave John Wayne here a chance to try some comedy and the Duke delivers. It's a shame the result is buried in another lame C western with a poor script and belowpar acting.Rodeo rider John Scott Wayne and his gambler companion Kansas Charlie Eddy Chandler get mixed up in a case of mistaken identity when they are blamed for stealing money from a crooked rodeo and murdering its promoter. Lying low in another town under assumed names they find themselves on the wrong side of the law again thanks to the machinations of the promoter's real killers.Watching Wayne cut up here with Chandler is kind of fun especially early on. Director Cullen Lewis starts us off with a scene where the two are playing cards and a tight closeup shows Kansas Charlie dealing himself an ace from the bottom of the deck. Scott catches him though he's not angry at the duplicity so much as disgusted by the awkwardness of the move.You're terrible! Scott exclaims. Try any of those phony tricks at Rattlesnake Gulch they'll run you out quicker than they did at the last place!Watching Scott and Kansas Charlie bicker is fun for a while. Unfortunately that's about all The Desert Trail has to offer. The conflict with the killers is awkwardly presented and left unresolved even after one of them returns to steal Scott's money and Kansas Charlie's watch. Instead of trying to clear their names or catch the thief Scott and K. C. hightail it to another town where they meet pretty storekeeper Anne Mary Kornman and develop a new line of bickering over her. Seeing Wayne play a rather crooked character is kind of interesting unfortunately this Scott guy and his pal are pretty dumb too.Wayne enthusiasts may find his performance as noteworthy as I did they may also like seeing Paul Fix a regular in many Wayne movies playing one of the killers who's also Anne's brother. Fix is terrible in this movie perhaps because he was a busy guy he appeared in 14 other movies in 1935 alone and the character is so badly written. He doesn't want to kill and steal but his nasty partner Pete Al Ferguson keeps threatening to turn him in if he doesn't go along. How would Pete do this without incriminating himself? Scott and Kansas aren't the only two characters in Desert Trail not long on brains.The film ambles along fretfully with odd shootouts odd because Wayne is often shooting at good guys and cruel horse stunts they tripped the horses in full gallop with wire and a couple of the stunts here appear to have been fatal breaking up largely comic interludes involving Scott Kansas and Anne. Kornman a fetching woman with skills honed from her childhood career in silent Our Gang comedies plays well off Wayne especially when he tries to schmooze her by making her climb a ladder for some nerve tonic. She points out nerve tonic is something he doesn't seem to need.With some better scripting either in the way of a coherent cowboy actioner or a more focused comedy Desert Trail might have risen above the batch of cheapo films Wayne starred in in his own desert years after The Big Trail and before Stagecoach. But it just doesn't gel enough or go anywhere interesting beyond the occasional funniness.".

Some bonehead thought it was a good idea to add a musical accompaniment to the film. However the music is just awful. It's way too loud inappropriate because of its use of very modern electronic music often inserted haphazardly AND the same music is used in all the films! So each Encore presentation of a Wayne film has the exact same intro and incidental music! Now these Wayne films already are very similar to each other but with these 'enhancements' it's much worse. My advice is to download the films off the links on IMDbit costs nothing is perfectly legal and has the original music.The film begins with Wayne and his completely dull sidekick some bald guy with the personality of a shoe whose name I won't even bother to look up...oh heck it's Eddy Chandler coming into town. Wayne is there to participate in the rodeo but after winning some prize money he learns that the people running the event are crooksand they only offer him a quarter of the money he earned. Not being content with this offer Wayne and his bald buddy use their guns to convince the guy to pay them their due which from what I remember is a lot like what O.J. is now serving time for in Nevada. However soon after the pair leave another guy comes in and robs the same guythen kills him! And to cover his tracks the murderer claims Wayne and his partner are guilty. Since the two were seen leaving shortly before the murder it appears as if they are guilty.In another town Wayne and Mr. Dull assume new identities and blend in as best they can. But with Wayne being an action hero he soon draws notoriety by saving some guy....and is rewarded with being jailed when someone recognizes him no good deed goes unpunished. However the dull sidekick does have an ally...and naturally everything works out just fine in the end.One of deficits for the film apart from the musicwhich you can't blame on the original production company are the reuse of both footage from another Wayne Bmovie and the plot idea of a crooked rodeo from The Man From Utah. Another is pairing Wayne with a dull sidekick who is neither funny nor endearing. However like the rest of Wayne's films of the era it is pleasant and entertaining provided you can appreciate the niche such Bmovies played. They weren't meant as high art and at a breezy one hour in length or a bit less they were pretty much like a Gene Autry or Roy Rogers series filmand kids loved them. And like many of the Autry and Rogers films there are some odd anachronisms that seemed unusual in the Westsuch as the leading lady's very modern style of dress.".

	schema:headline " Not So Much Second Rate As Third Or Fourth Rate";
	schema:reviewBody "The Desert Trail is one of many Bmovies which John Wayne made in the late twenties and early thirties before he became a major star. Most of these were Westerns and many of them were made for Lone Star a production company specialising in that particular genre. In 1935 alone Wayne starred in eight such films in each of them he played a character with the Christian name John. This was presumably a deliberate move by Lone Star and their successors Republic Pictures to create a distinctive identity for their leading man.The title The Desert Trail might suggest either a hunt through the desert for a fugitive or a group of pioneers making their way to a new life in California but in fact the film deals with neither of those subjects. It was probably just a generic Western title which could be applied to virtually any plot. The film concerns John Scott a rodeo star and his gambler friend Kansas Charlie who are wrongly accused of murdering a man in the course of an armed robbery and their attempts to expose the real villains.The acting is almost universally poor Wayne is the only wellknown name here but he shows little of the talent and charisma which were later to make him one of Hollywood's biggest names. The action sequences are unconvincing including a badly choreographed fistfight with obviously pulled punches. The story is often difficult to follow. The filmmakers even seemed to lack much of a budget for costumes. Although the action presumably takes place in the late nineteenth century Mary Kornman as Wayne's loveinterest Anne appears throughout dressed in the fashions of 1935 rather than 1870 or 1880.By modern standards at just under an hour the film is absurdly short but this was a normal length for Bmovies in this period. What struck me most however was not the film's length but how cheap it seemed having evidently been made on a minuscule budget. It reminded my forcibly of just why studios like Monogram Lone Star's parent company specialising in Bmovies earned the nickname Poverty Row. It might be more accurately categorised as a C or Dmovie as everything about it shouts out not so much second rate as third or fourth rate. If it had starred anyone other than Wayne that future American cultural icon it would doubtless have long since been forgotten. 310".

Going to a film with the two of them and you know there is going to be blood violence killing action noise and an eventual winner. If this is not your cup of tea go see The Nanny Diaries and leave this to the fan boys.This is not their first film together. They both appeared in The One six years ago. This time they are the leads and on opposing sides  Statham an FBI agent and Li a contract killer. The action takes place in the middle of a Yakuza war in San Francisco.Fans of Jet Li will not be disappointed. he still has all the moves even if he is 47 however he does rely more on swords and guns and other weapons in this film. Statham is Li's equal and gives as good as he gets. The story has an interesting twist which i will not give a clue on as it is a major plot point.Interesting entertainment by girls in cages at the Yakuza club. I thought that went out in the 60s but it was a nice diversion.This film is red meat. It has no pretensions of quality and dialog is minimal which goes along with the story. If you are a fan you will be entertained. If you are not why are you there?".

In other words know what you're going to get here.We get many many gunshots to head. long range to upcloseand personal swords into mouths and through back of head and through just about any other body part a car chase motorcycle chases a few bare breasts and a bunch of attentiongrabbing scenes of brutality which definitely outnumber the quieter scenes.Jason Statham seems to be the new macho man of the day playing this kind of role in numerous films the past few years. Jet Li.....well you know him. Statham versus Li? Yes but not really. The two are only in the same scene twice once for a couple of minutes of Jason giving threats and Jet standing there passively and then in the finale fight scene. The latter unlike most of these action films of today is not overdone and go on and on. It's just about the right length.The best part of this ultraviolent movie dealing with rival Asian gangs and FBI agent s in the middle in the BIG twist near the end of the film. At least it makes this a little more than a brainless action movie. I think it's kind of cool although don't try to analyze it for credibility.While a number of reviewers here weren't happy that the two big stars weren't on the screen at the same time for long my choice for underplayed actor is Luis Guzman who is always very interesting but didn't have many lines here. I'd like to have seen his part a lot bigger and I would have liked to see Statham tone it tone and sound a little more intelligent in his role. In real life FBI agents have a lot more class.Having said that I still enjoyed the film because I knew in advance what it was that it wasn't Li's best effort nor Statham's but it sufficed for a 100minute diversion. I was looking for action...and I got it! I also recommend this for those who have HDTV and a BluRay disc player. This is a very slicklooking film on BluRay.Just don't bring the kiddies or grandma into the living room to watch this!".

	schema:reviewBody "Jason Statham is the new electrifying action star. Statham is an amazing athlete and accomplished martial artist. However Jet Li is still the screen's most explosive martial arts star. Be reassured that Li has not yet retired from doing action movies. Old school Li looks lean calm and stylish in his black Armani suits and proves deadly with and without guns. Li is such a dichotomy. On the surface he is clean cut and mild mannered but can unleash violence with such power and grace at any moment. Director Philip Atwell's War takes a while to get its bearing but once he does so he orchestrates an amazing action movie of blood and vengeance. He along with writers Lee Anthony Smith and Gregory J. Bradley culminates with anticipated payoff Statham and Li facing off. They also insert a shocking twist which makes more sense in retrospect. The martial arts as choreographed by Corey Yuen Transporter movies are exquisite and acknowledge for its variety. The Japanese katana training between Shiro Ryo Ishibashi and Kane Kosugi is classic. The kung fu sequences with Jet Li are crisp and deadly. Jason Statham uses speed and power in dispatching Chinese Triad assassins. There is an amazing sword fight scene with the Wushu style against the classical Japanese style. Through Atwell's lens one has to admire the mastery and physical prowess. War is surprising.Jason Statham plays FBI Agent Jack Crawford who leads a task force against both the Chinese Triad led by Chang cool John Lone and the Yakuza led by Shiro bold Ryo Ishibashi. Crawford's partner Tom Lone Terry Chen and his family are brutally murdered by the assassin known as Rogue. Crawford's life turns a shambleshis wife Jenny Andrea Roth and his son leave him during a divorce. Three years later Crawford investigates a horrific hit at a Yakuza club in San Francisco. A signature discovered at the crime scene leads Crawford to believe that Rogue Li is back. Consequently Crawford Statham becomes consumed by vengeance. Jet Li plays Victor Shaw a deadly hit man playing both the Yakuza and Triads. Shaw apparently is the mysterious Rogue. However as played by Li Shaw though a stone cold killer without equal operates by a code of honor. He too seems on a mission of vengeance. Shaw is in the middle of an all out war between the Yakuza and the Triads. Nothing good can come of that. There is an interesting subplot involving priceless stolen Chinese artifacts and the command of Yakuza operations in the States by Shiro's daughter Kira deadly Devon Aoki. The appeal of War remains its singular focus everything culminates in Crawford's mission of vengeance to kill Rogue. Writers Smith and Bradley effectively build the tension toward the finale and final plot twist.Atwell inspires strong performances from Jason Statham and Jet Li. Statham has a gruff charisma as Crawford. Also he demonstrates unexpected range in the character's complexity. Statham has a powerful physical presence and grace. Li is very good as Rogue. He plays to his strength which is expressing his anger and angst through his eyes and concise exchanges. He maintains a placid visage that disguises his sheer will and power. As Rogue it becomes crystal clear that one does not mess with him less forfeit one's life. Even with some awkward dialog exchanges Li is compelling and powerful. John Lone has a measured darkness as Chang always under control. He is good. Ryo Ishibashi is great as the larger than life Shiro providing is a captivating and powerful rival for both Li and Statham.War is a solid action movie with great performances from Jason Statham and Jet Li. Statham and Li are at the top of their games. The action is very cool. The martial arts fights are among the best out there. Atwell's storytelling is engaging and intense and delivers on all the hype.".

	schema:headline " Don't Go to War!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Jet Li  Jason Statham urban crime thriller War qualifies as one of their worst. Anybody that saw an earlier Jet Li actioneerthe futuristic science fiction epic The One 2001knows War represents the second time that these two action heroes have shared the screen. In The One Statham was confined to a secondary role. In War however Statham shares top billing with 44year old Jet Li but the two are never on friendly terms. Instead Statham wants to terminate Li with extreme prejudice while Li sets out to decimate the entire Japanese Yakuza as well the Chinese Triads in San Francisco. Unfortunately this oneversustheother opus never generates enough heat between its trim but grim costars. Surprisingly they aren't allowed to display their marital arts artistry until the end of the movie and the martial arts action scene itself is incredibly lackluster. Legendary marital arts choreographer Corey Yuen of The Matrix trilogy doesn't create any cool looking fights or any new gags that have made him one of the top stunt stagers in either Hollywood or Hong Kong. Most of the time in War Jet Li relies on an automatic pistol to gun down the opposition without an expression. Sometimes he wields a mean razoredged sword and slices off a head but you rarely see him do anything equivalent to Kiss of the Dragon Cradle 2 the Grave or The One. Similarly Jason Stathambest known for his Transporter movies and Crankdoesn't rip tear or shed his apparel during the fights. Basically if you march off to War thinking it is going to be the eighth wonder of the world where martial artistry is concerned you are drastically deluding yourself and the end result of freshman director Philip G. Atwell's realistic but slambang crime melodrama will disappoint you. Nevertheless Atwell delivers lots of savage action scenes with a high body count but War never degenerates into a big dumb action thriller with clever lines or flamboyant fighting. Essentially firsttime scribes Lee Anthony Smith and Gregory J. Bradley have taken the classic Japanese swordfighting saga Yojimbo 1961 with Toshiro Mufine later remade as the Spaghetti western A Fistful of Dollars 1964 and even later as 1930s crime opus Last Man Standing 1996in which the lone hero enters a town and wipes out two bloodthirsty crime families by swearing allegiance to each but betraying both until nobody is left alive. The biggest difference is that Smith  Bradley have grafted onto this simple but solid formula another timehonored formula about the two cops that have been partners until one dies at the hands of the mob and the other sets out to wreck vengeance on the evildoers that killed his friend. As War opens we're introduced to two FBI agents in San Francisco. Tom Lone Terry Chen of I Robot and John Crawford Jason Statham are best buds that keep their eyes on the Japanese Yakuza gangsters and the deadly Chinese Triad mob. They are after a notorious assassin named Rogue that nobody can identify because he has plastic surgery every six months and then kills the surgeon to preserve his anonymity. Rogue has a nasty way of going his own way but his trademarklike The Lone Ranger's silver bulletsis his titanium shell casings that he leaves behind at the scene of his crimes. Our heroes think that they have killed Rogue during the opening shootout but he survives and wipes out Tom Lone and his wife Diane Steph Song of The Long Lunch and their young daughter Amy newcomer Annika Foo at their cabin and torches the place. When Crawford hears about the massacre the bodies have been burned beyond recognition but he finds a shell casing at the scene that matches those that Rogue uses. Crawford swears vengeance and dedicates himself to killing Rogue. In the meantime his obsession with Rogue undermines his marriage and his wife Jenny Andrea Roth of Highwayman divorces him takes custody of their son Daniel Nicholas Elia of White Noise and moves out. Three years elapse with no sign of Rogue and Crawford retrieves a titanium shell casing from the scene of a particularly violent crime scene. When we see Rogue this time he isn't wearing a Phantom of the Opera mask. In fact this is the first time that we see Jet Li and he is playing Rogue. He enters a Yakuza nightclub and slashes the throats of the thugs guarding the entrance to the boss's gambling den. The Yakuza boss sends his two Dobermans charging after Rogue. We hear one yelp in pain and the second comes back with an explosives device attached to its collar and blows up its owner. Suddenly Yakuza killers as well as Triad gunmen start dropping like tenpins and Rogue is the wrecking ball behind their murders. Writers Smith  Bradley let this nonsense churn on for about an hour and a quarter and then they pull the biggest switcheroo in screen history that contradicts everything in my plot synopsis. Mind you they drops hints along the way that something isn't right but you'd have to have read the script to know how incredibly characters change in the last quarter hour. Freshman director Philip G. Atwell makes his directorial debut with War and he does just about everything to salvage this drivel. First he pares down the action to essentials so the whole thing is over with in 103 minutes. Second he stages the action as if he were shooting a Miami Vice episode. Everybody drives a cool car. Rogue tools around in a sleek shiny Spyker C8 Spyder a handmade allaluminum convertible equipped with electrically operated singlehinge tilted doors while Crawford steers a vintage Chevrolet Chevelle SS. War barely makes the grade as a crime melodrama.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Jet Li  Jason Statham urban crime thriller War qualifies as one of their worst. Anybody that saw an earlier Jet Li actioneerthe futuristic science fiction epic The One 2001knows War represents the second time that these two action heroes have shared the screen. In The One Statham was confined to a secondary role. In War however Statham shares top billing with 44year old Jet Li but the two are never on friendly terms. Instead Statham wants to terminate Li with extreme prejudice while Li sets out to decimate the entire Japanese Yakuza as well the Chinese Triads in San Francisco. Unfortunately this oneversustheother opus never generates enough heat between its trim but grim costars. Surprisingly they aren't allowed to display their marital arts artistry until the end of the movie and the martial arts action scene itself is incredibly lackluster. Legendary marital arts choreographer Corey Yuen of The Matrix trilogy doesn't create any cool looking fights or any new gags that have made him one of the top stunt stagers in either Hollywood or Hong Kong. Most of the time in War Jet Li relies on an automatic pistol to gun down the opposition without an expression. Sometimes he wields a mean razoredged sword and slices off a head but you rarely see him do anything equivalent to Kiss of the Dragon Cradle 2 the Grave or The One. Similarly Jason Stathambest known for his Transporter movies and Crankdoesn't rip tear or shed his apparel during the fights. Basically if you march off to War thinking it is going to be the eighth wonder of the world where martial artistry is concerned you are drastically deluding yourself and the end result of freshman director Philip G. Atwell's realistic but slambang crime melodrama will disappoint you.

I usually don't comment or review movies.. i just rate them but after watching this i have to say something i feel i need to.A lot of people say that this is an action movie and should be judged on the mindblowing action and just to enjoy the ride.. I saw no mind blowing action most of the movie was plot and if i was to ignore all of that i would be left with only a few minutes of horrible action.The action has little to no martial arts so Jet Li didn't need to be in the movie at all. The stunts were all tame and the editing cut every halfsecond in the action scenes so that it could make any actor seem like they could empty a room full of thugs.Jet Li started out great in America with movies such as Kiss of the Dragon and Romeo Must Die. Statham and Li have both worked together in The One which i thought to be a brilliant movie where the plot and the action worked perfectly together.. This movie is the evil twin of The One the actors stay the same but everything else is screwed up.Kiss of the Dragon was a movie that had the least amount of plot needed to drive all of the fantastic action scenes. This movie almost wanted the viewer to be taken into its plot and twists. You don't seem to care about any of the characters some lines you can predict yourself and most of all the action was mediocre at best.I wont even go into detail about how horrible the ending is but it left me and my friends in the cinema looking at each other thinking is that it?Jet Li can do better".

The movie left me thinking only about how bad the ending was rather than appreciating the plot and the movie prior to the final scene.

	schema:reviewBody "First let me start off by saying that I've seen every single Jet Li movie ever made. All the way back to his days of the Shaolin Temple up to his most recent film Fearless. Jet has had a lot of hit and miss movie's lately with the stupid rappers but his Martial Art prowess always saved the day. I am no rookie when it comes to Jet Li and the martial art movie scene believe me. And ever since I saw the Transporter I've been a big fan of Jason Statham and know he's been studying martial arts more and more especially since he starred in the movie The One alongside none other then Jet Li where they first got the idea to do a movie like this together.So as you can see my expectations for this movie were through the roof! It was the movie I've been waiting for since The One was made. I couldn't wait to see Jet and Jason go toe to toe in an all out martial arts bonanza. At least that's what the history of these 2 and the previews would have you to believe to expect....Unfortunately this was not the case at all. You'd be hard pressed to find any sort of martial arts action in this film at all. This was more like an actioncop drama with sprinkles of kicks and punches and a little sword fight. Bah! Just terrible marketing in my opinion. Jet Li should not be wasting his time trying to act first of all since you could barely understand half the lines he utters in the first place...The first hour is all story no fighting whatsoever then you'll get a quick little dose of what might be something only to end in gunfire and bullets. WHERE'S THE MARTIAL ARTS???? This movie keeps you hanging on the great story and keeps you hoping that there will be a huge payoff fight scene in the end between Jet and Jason that will make up for all this waiting finally payoff.2 words It Doesn't! The end fight is over quicker then you can blink and involves no heavy hand to hand fighting techniques that make Jet and Jason so awesome to watch...Instead we're forced to watch a hammer vs a shovel...LAME! If you're going into this movie expecting a martial arts fighting blowout you'll be sorely sorely disappointed. If you just want to take it for what its worth a stylized actiondrama then you'll be happy. I for one WAS NOT and will not be watching this waste of a great idea ever again.".

Most films of this genre have simple plots and stories that are predictable and only serve for awesome action. The story of war is deep with enough plot twists to entertain you but not so complicated that you can't follow along. The main story is the clash between the famous assassin RogueJet Li and FBI agent Jack CrawfordStathom.The acting is average for an action movie. Nothing to dull but no Oscarworthy performances either. You get what you expect from each individual although Jet does pretty well portraying Rogue. As for the action of this action movie it delivers. War has something for everybody. Fist fights gun fights car chases and explosions are delivered. Jet Li fans may be a little agitated however because most of his fights don't come until the second half of the movie. I was expecting more action from him and was slightly disappointed. His fight scenes were great. I just wish he had more in the first half. As for the final battle between Jet and Jason it was intense but too short. A much better fight than what we got between them in 'The One' though.I'd say this movie is renting or even buying. A good way to spend a couple hours. I give it 710.".

Rouge Assassin's no different.For the most part the story's about Jason Staham's character quest to avenge his best friend after he had been taken out by a mysterious hitman who seems to change his allegiances between the yakuza and triad mob bosses as easily as one changes his sweater.However no amounts of Jason Stahamrelated sceneshis scene where he confronts a Yakuza enforcer in Japanese is cool can make up such for a generic kung fu movie. But the twist which mostly likely nobody will see coming when it hits but careful viewers will probably notice some odd stuff at some point. Believe me it will change your entire perspective of all the characters involved in this odd conspiracy.I was also somewhat disappointed by Devon Aoki's performance who doesn't really do much then looking a little tough but just demanding a salad to his hench at gunpoint looked a little silly on screen.The cast was decent we had Jet Li once again giving his usual performance and Jason Staham who has pretty much now cemented himself as a top Hollywood bad boy gives once again  another of his great performances.The cast also includes some rising Asian stars who play their part with competencesave for Devon Aoki thought the movie seems a little too condescending enough and assume that the audience knows no difference between the Japanese mafia and the Chinese mafia.It's worth a rental it's a generic kung fu cop movie like many others before it but has only one thing that elevates it above everything else. And that's the said twist.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie I just have to comment on simply because it left me with such mixed feelings.First of all it seemed really well done on a first glance. There were flashy cars nice outfits good cinematography. I don't particularly recall the soundtrack but I guess that's a good point. On the downside the movie lacked a lot in story and character development. Alright so it's an action movie but for the first 95 of it you couldn't care less about where the story is going. The reason for that is that the characters never seem very likable. The main hero Jason Stratham's character is just out for revenge and treats his wife and kid bad because of that. While that's just one more reason to dislike the one character you're supposed to identify with the movie never goes indepth about it. For example it never really shows the hero's relationship to his wife getting worse. Instead they're just divorced all of a sudden. And while there seemed to be enough budget for nice sets and cool costumes some of the props especially the horses looked like they came straight from a toy store. Also this movie forces you to realize that Jet Li is simply not a particularly good actor.But my biggest pet peeve about War was that Jason Stratham and Jet Li seem to have traded places. If I watch a movie with those two actors in it I expect Stratham to shoot a lot of people and Jet Li to perform a couple of cool martial arts stunts. Instead you get some fist fights with Jason Stratham some stunt double even does a couple of kicks for him while Jet Li resorts to mostly shooting people. Why?????I looked forward a lot to seeing this movie because I liked both leading actors. I was rather disappointed but had a hard time disliking it despite its weaknesses. War is simply so pretty to watch that you're just begging for something cool to happen. And while the story seems like a sad excuse to fill the screen time with lots of dialogue you are rewarded with a couple of nice action scenes and a good if foreseeable ending.".

He is taken into a world of guilt and betrayal and Rogue does eventually come out of hiding to set off a bloody war between Asian mob rivals Chang John Lone of the Triads and Yakuza boss Shiro Audition's Ryo Ishibashi. So it is not just Crwaford trying to catch Rogue that is the war but this one that is supposed to be a bit bigger I will be honest I was only paying attention to the two stars returning after The One oh and this time the good guy doesn't win. Also starring Devon Aoki as Kira Luis Guzmn as Benny Saul Rubinek as Dr. Sherman Sung Kang as Goi Mathew St. Patrick as Wick and Nadine Velazquez as Maria. I remember maybe some banter a lot of guns shooting some explosions Li riding a bike and samurai sword fights but apart from this it's nonsense and brainless not in the good way action and not a good thriller.

Both are known for their insane action and martial arts sequences but for all that talent we never really see one good hand to hand fight between the two. It's your basic revenge story Jet Li kills Statham's partner and Statham wants to crush his nuts. You know your basic action movie. Don't expect War to win any awards. Unless there's some sort of awards show with all action movies in it nowadays. If you go into this movie expecting the next Shakespearean masterpiece you're in deep deep trouble. It's a little more paced than some people make it out to be. There are huge breaks in the action that take time to tell the story and a little character development. Note that they are not small breaks but huge ones. Action comes in doses but when it does it hits you like a train to the jaw.There is a slight twist in the movie that helps to accentuate that it's trying to be different from other movies in this genre but it doesn't quite succeed. The twist ends up coming off as another of a hundred ways this is just like every other action movie ever made. In the same way most action movies treat themselves and they should lightly and with as little detail to realism as possible so too does War. It knows that it's an action movie and never expects you to think any thing more about it than that. In this same genre I would recommend Shoot 'Em Up over this if you have already seen that this might feel a little tame in comparison. In that same way though this movie has a different flavor and succeeds in its own way. Worth watching but there are much better picks in this genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "War undergoes one of those unnecessarily title changes for this part of the world naming itself after Jet Li's assassin character Rogue. Billed as The Ultimately Martial Arts Duel of the Year the person who wrote that blurb for Rogue Assassin obviously hasn't seen many movies or martial arts ones for that matter or is plain lying through the teeth. You'd half expect that pitting two action stars against one another will instantly mean box office success by pulling in fans of both Jet Li and Jason Statham but it's a downright insult as you don't see any punches pulled between the two for 99 of the time.Jason Statham actually starred opposite Jet Li in the movie called The One back in 2001 where Li had no decent cinematic opponent to spar with and had to do so with himself assisted by CGI. With his movies like Crank and The Transporter doubles becoming guilty pleasures read just Statham kicking up a storm without a reasonable story to boot I'd actually come to enjoy his work choreographed by Corey Yuen who also does the action choreography here together with other ensemble movies he starred in like The Italian Job and Snatch amongst others. It's no doubt I'm a fan but in Rogue Assassin all he had to show off his fighting chops was a sequence in a ubiquitous teahouse.But Jet Li fared no better too. His Hollywood foray had been more misses than hits either playing assassins or cops like in Kiss of the Dragon or be stuck in roles that require little dialogue and only to look badass like in Lethal Weapon 4 and Cradle 2 the Grave. Or the easiest of all forget dialogue and kick around like a mad dog  no offense but that's what he really did in Unleashed which I thought the notion of it all was rather degrading for an action star. Nonetheless he goes back to a story on warring factions again ala Romeo Must Die but this time it's not between boyz in the hood but putting Japanese Yakuza and Hong Kong Triads in the streets of San Francisco. As I mentioned earlier there's nothing martial arts here. Everything is guns guns and more guns with a complimentary sword fight put in but not between the touted leads. The action sequences from fights to chases to stunts all looked rather tired and rehashed with absolutely nothing that will make you go wow that's nothing I've seen before. Statham and Li share no more than 5 minutes together in the same scene and only at best a minute bashing each other up in the dark in a narrow dock warehouse before launching into more verbal mumbo jumbo.Everything here is a caricature and not even a clichd revelation saved the movie when it had expected to except to give some runway to a possible sequel. WarRogue Assassin reeks of plain laziness and plays out like a cartoon. In trying to be sophisticated having to label locales with The Triad Warehouse or The Yakuza Lair was just plain hilarious unintentionally of course. The number of supporting caricatures some recognizable Asian actors all fall into the realm of predictability and the villains are all too smug and too boring. You have HK actor Mark Cheng from his latest movie Invisible Target lending his charisma but becoming a laughing stock John Lone demonstrating he's still very much being typecast in Hollywood roles Devon Aoki continuing to be that flower vase who doesn't look good up close somehow the cinematic camera dislikes her and hey once TV actress from this part of the world Steph Song gets a cameo too spending most of the screen time screaming.Everything's pure flash with zero substance. Even in trying to be a little sophisticated in its plot it decided to allow some plot loopholes to go through an exercise of the implausible and put in some major character motivation error. But then again we're talking about cartoony caricatures here so that probably won't matter. It became a victim of its own star casting  you don't know who you want as the bad guy and as a result becomes a below par mediocre generic action movie that you can stick some other monkeys in and still work.".

Many people expected or it feels like they were expecting a movie whit twisting plot color full characters and many more..I don't understand that..THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT KILLING AND ACTION!!!!THIS IS WAR. What more can you expect?? Watch this movie as a action moviedon't ask what just happened just enjoy the action!";

But then the movie ended and i though why do they do this again?. Jason's character who turned out to worked for the triades and know of the attack on his partner. This is so clichd and come out of nowhere. It would be better if the triade guy lied that jason was one of them. And the last scene ended that tom lone got killed just after he found out that jason was not one of them.but know jason jumped for the shot after telling he was responsible and jet li stepping into his car and drives away end of the movie. awful ending and ruined the movie for me.".

War is one of those movies that reminds you so much of other movies that you aren't interested in the plot so much as you are by the derivative thing of what comes next. Among the steals I noticed were Yojimbo The basic premise Death Wish 4 The way the families are depicted on a board with Xs through them indicating who is dead and introducing the next one to die and of course tons of steals from dozens of Yakuza and Triad flicks from yesterday. I'm not saying that the movie is derivative i'm saying that the movie has no imagination in presenting a new twist on such a serviceable formula. The movie goes for a plot and in those regards the movie fails since the story has no real characters that are all that likable and watching Jet Li and Jason Statham violently dispatch bad guys without once feeling vulnerable is among the film's biggest tedious points. War is an action film with no sense of imagination fun or focus. It's a straight to DVD product that somehow got Jet Li and Jason Statham involved and honestly this doesn't even pass muster as that type of movie. So avoid this movie because the real war declared in this movie is basically on the viewer. out of 4Bad".

	schema:reviewBody "War walks in the footsteps of movies like Kiss of the Dragon and the Transporter series. It blends martial arts with stylized shoot 'em up action fairly well to create visually stunning action sequences. One of War's strong points is that none of these action sequences feel too contrived or pointless most of them advance the plot in some matter. War attempts to blend it's action with a surprisingly compelling story line the film's build up unfortunately falls apart in it's lack luster third act.Jason Statham plays Jack Crawford a special ops agent in L.A. we never truly know the unit he's a part of but face it it's not important. L.A. is seeing the beginning of a gang war between two Japanese gangs the Changs and the Triads. As he investigates it soon becomes apparent that an assassin by the name of Rogue Jet Li is involved the same assassin that killed Statham's partner 3 years ago. This story line seems to be the weaker one of two that are explored in the movie. The more intriguing one involves Rogue who seems to be playing on both sides of the playing field. This moves the movie forward as his dark agenda is slowly revealed.The movie lends itself to some interesting fight sequences shoot outs and sword fights. There is a brief chase sequence between Statham and Li but it feels like an afterthought. The action is spread out well over the 100 minute running time there are no real slow spots and yet unlike many of Statham's earlier works Crank it does give you a chance to breathe. We're treated to one or two exciting twists that tie up a lot of the intrigue before the final act. This is where War begins to slip it is a very successful action thriller for the first ninety minutes it's the brief closing that doesn't satisfy.The ending feels forced and leaves you unsatisfied. It's unnecessarily bleak and doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie. They should have cut the final ten minutes of the movie and replaced them with a tighter ending. But even accounting for this War still succeeds in being a solid action thriller. Perhaps if it does well we'll be treated to a sequel that will pick up the pieces of the disappointing ending.".

This delightful screwball comedy with romantic overtones has kept its luster even after almost seventy years since it was produced. Jack Conway directed with a light touch.Libeled Lady got away with a lot having been filmed before the Hays Code got its grip in everything that was produced in Hollywood in the succeeding years. The dialog is quite frank and sophisticated even for that era. Jean Harlow had perhaps her best moment in the movies playing Gladys Benton the woman who is engaged to be married and has her wedding postponed. William Powell who was at the height of his career and popularity plays Bill Chandler the man who is called to do a favor to the man that has fired him by taking an interest in an heiress who is notorious for suing any newspaper that dares to print anything about her that is not true. Myrna Loy is the heiress Connie Allenbury who falls for the ruse that Bill Chandler is made to perform but deep down she has fallen in love with him. Spencer Tracy is the editor of the newspaper in question who concocts the plan to get the paper off the hook in paying the five million dollars.In supporting roles we get to see some of the best actors of the time Cora Witherspoon William Connolly Charlie Grapevine William Benedict Bunny Beatty and others that enhance the film with their presence.The film will not disappoint.

It was the year he made The Great Ziegfeld which won the best picture Oscar My Man Godfreyfor which he was nominated for best actor and one of the best screwball romantic comedies ever made.  That picture would be Libeled Lady. Although this film is widely viewedwith good reason as one of Jean Harlow's best films I think that Powell steals the picture and runs away with the best performance.Not that the rest of the cast is too shabby either. Myrna Loy as the titled character and Spencer Tracy as a newspaper editor from Hell add to the madness and mayhem. And Harlow is at her best in her role as a woman who is engaged to Tracy and married to Powell. That's as far as I'll go as far as the plot is concerned. Just see the movie.One of the best points about this film is the fact that it was made before the production code was put in place.  Movies like this could be much freer with sexual situations and dialogue while still leaving much to the imagination.The film is directed at breakneck speed by Jack Conway who smartly gets out of the way and lets his wonderful actors take over.If you haven't seen Libeled Lady yet you must make a point of watching for it the next time it's on Turner Classic Movies.  Then tape it.  You'll be glad you did.  You'll want to watch it over and over again.9 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "A film with four stars of this magnitude was an event in 1936 and indeed it still is in 2004.  Though the subject matter is slight and the acting is not too terribly taxing on the affable quartet it was wellthoughtofenough to rate a Best Picture Oscar nomination.  Tracy plays a newspaperman whose own wedding plans are interrupted by the fact that his paper has mistakingly run a libelous story about the daughter of one of his competitors.  Loy as the daughter slaps a 5 million libel suit against Tracy's newspaper which if won will sink it.  Since he knows he will lose he rehires former employee Powell who he feels will be able to charm Loy into an indelicate situation thus rendering her reputation spoiled enough to cost her her libel suit.  Part of the scheme however to make it seem legitimate is to marry off Powell to his own fiance Harlow.  It is here that the film gets a lot of its laughs as desperatetowed Harlow finds herself getting married......but to the wrong man!  Powell and Loy get most of the sparkling dialogue and sophisticated repartee but contemporary audiences are likelier to get a kick out of mouthy hilarious Harlow.  Her comedic gifts and her ample physical assets are on prime display notably when the judge says it's safe to kiss the bride and in a later scene where Powell is learning to flyfish.  All of the stars do very well and each gets a chance to rub up against the others.  Powell and Loy are a legendary pairing with 14 films to show them off.  Tracy does a slick job and shows his versatility.  They are aided by a stable of amusing character actors the type of people Hollywood was famous for and can no longer provide with regularity.  Today almost any character actor that scores a hit is thrust into hisher own TV show TV talk show or lead role in a film!  The film offers both wit and slapstick wrapped up in some gorgeous sets and costumes.  The MGM gloss is fully in place.  Sadly the light that was Harlow would be dimmed in just a year after this but audiences are still able to enjoy her fine work in films like this.".

	schema:reviewBody "LIBELLED LADY is a comedy about the world of newspapers and libel suits. Spencer Tracy is the editor of a leading New York newspaper and he is about to marry his longsuffering girlfriend Jean Harlow they have put off marriage several times in the past due to scoops Tracy had to pursue personally. This time it's not a scoop but a serious blunder. The foreign gossip correspondent has submitted an item that got printed concerning Myrna Loy's antics in England suggesting that she disgraced herself when drunk. This is bad enough but the newspaper owner Charles Goodwin is horrified by this error. It seems Loy's father is multimillionaire mover and shaker Walter Connolly who had political ambitions that Goodwin and his newspaper thwarted twenty years earlier. Goodwin realizes that an angry vindictive Connolly will very likely sue the newspaper for libeling his daughter and win disastrously large damages.While Harlow shows up in her wedding gown fuming at this new delay Tracy figures he will have to bury his own feelings and approach one time rival and foe William Powell to help him here. Powell is very clever at manipulating situations to get rid of troublesome problems i.e. he can possibly figure out a way of neutralizing the advantage Connolly and Loy have in the original libel article. Powell does come up with a scheme. If he can ingratiate himself with Connolly and Loy he might be able to create a compromising situation regarding Loy that if revealed will make the libel story appear to be true. Tracy agrees to this plan even though it requires Powell to marry Harlow so that Loy when she falls for Powell can be made to appear a home wrecker. Harlow at first is not too thrilled about this as she and Powell don't get along.What follows is a series of delays that prevent the rapid evolution of the plot and it's proper springing on the unsuspecting Connolly and Loy. First it is harder to get Connolly away from his regular business interests to take an interest in Loy's new acquaintance Powell. But Powell finds the key when he learns that Connolly is one of the best trout fisherman in the United States. However Powell himself has never bothered about fishing  we see him cramming from various books to learn the difference between fly fishing and other types. Then we see him practicing casting a fishing line with the assistance of E.E. Clive in the hotel rooms he shares with Harlow. He manages to snare Harlow while doing so again much to her anger.Invited to go to Connolly's favorite fishing spot to try to catch the elusive old wall eye Powell manages to just miss drowning himself in the river and does catch the fish the hard way  with his clothing. But it impresses Connolly and Loy. The scheme is seemingly working but three new wrinkles develop. Powell finds he is falling for Loy. Harlow is slowly finding the gentleman Powell is a nicer role model for a husband than the belligerent Tracy and is now falling for Powell. Tracy who barely tolerates Powell is discovering that Harlow is less interested in him than she was before and more interested in Powell  so Tracy is now jealous of Powell.I will only add that the comedy ends with four people arguing it out in a hotel suite.

	schema:reviewBody "Libeled Lady is yet another screwball comedy about a ditzy heiress. But it certainly is one of the best that came out of the Thirties. All four stars are at the top of their game in this one.The ditzy heiress is Myrna Loy. Some drunken correspondent from London filed a false story and Myrna and father Walter Connolly want to sue the paper. Owner Charley Grapewin and editor Spencer Tracy are worried. In fact Tracy has postponed his wedding to sweetheart Jean Harlow for the umpteenth time to meet this crisis.He hires back former star reporter William Powell to get something on Loy. Tracy and Powell hatch a scheme that would involve Powell marrying Harlow temporarily and then wooing Loy to get her in a compromising position. Of course the long suffering Harlow actually agrees to this piece of insanity.I'm convinced that Harlow's character is the model for Adelaide in Guys and Dolls. Adelaide put up with almost as much before she finally landed Nathan Detroit. It's hard to believe that a year later Jean Harlow was gone.Myrna Loy is not stepping too much out of character as the heiress. Her role her as Connie Allenbury is only about three steps from Nora Charles. She's a rich woman in the Thin Man also indulging hobby Nick in his hobby as a detective away from his full time profession as drinker.The women had worked with each other before and both male leads had played with both women before. But this was the only time that MGM heavyweights Spencer Tracy and William Powell were ever in the same film together. That in itself is reason to see Libeled Lady.The single most hilarious scene for me is Bill Powell trying to fish in order to get in with Loy and Connolly. His scene in the trout stream landing 'old wall eye' is priceless. In fact Powell's battle with the fish was the premise for one of Rock Hudson's best comedies Man's Favorite Sport.And Tracy proved he could play sophisticated comedy. No doubt the reason MGM cast him with Katharine Hepburn later on.Simply the best. Right up there with My Man Godfrey and all those sparkling comedies Tracy did with Hepburn later on.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the best movies of the thirties the stars are glib in the best way and glamorous. Libeled Lady is blessed with a clever script that serves up fastballs that the cast handles adroitly. And I have to credit the amazing wardrobe by Dolly Tree made all the more remarkable as she was responsible for the wardrobes of 23 films in 1936. Loy's wardrobe in particular is impeccable.This was the 5th in the series of William PowellMyrna Loy pairings. They were cranking them out at a rate of about 2 per year during this period so you might think that the chemistry between them would be stale or formulaic. But in Libeled Lady the chemistry is fresh and the relationship between their characters is not just another Thin Man performance.Then there are Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow. Tracy is adept at the machinegun delivery required by this screwball comedy and Harlow just shines showing more depth of character and emotion than she is sometimes given credit for. After Libeled Lady she only acted in two films so the screen never saw what greater depths of performance she might have achieved. She died of uremic poisoning during the filming of Saratoga TrunkThe plot involves a newspaperman Powell good at the con who ingratiates himself to a wealthy young woman Loy and her father in order to set her up for a blackmail situation. She suspects his motives but he manages to pull her in. Plenty of plot curves ensue adding humor and more character development.I particularly liked the fishing scene. Without much dialogue it advances the plot provides some laughs and shows that Dolly Tree can even make Myrna Loy look sexy in fishing gear.".

And I have to credit the amazing wardrobe by Dolly Tree made all the more remarkable as she was responsible for the wardrobes of 23 films in 1936. Loy's wardrobe in particular is impeccable.This was the 5th in the series of William PowellMyrna Loy pairings. They were cranking them out at a rate of about 2 per year during this period so you might think that the chemistry between them would be stale or formulaic. But in Libeled Lady the chemistry is fresh and the relationship between their characters is not just another Thin Man performance.Then there are Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow. Tracy is adept at the machinegun delivery required by this screwball comedy and Harlow just shines showing more depth of character and emotion than she is sometimes given credit for. After Libeled Lady she only acted in two films so the screen never saw what greater depths of performance she might have achieved. She died of uremic poisoning during the filming of Saratoga TrunkThe plot involves a newspaperman Powell good at the con who ingratiates himself to a wealthy young woman Loy and her father in order to set her up for a blackmail situation. She suspects his motives but he manages to pull her in. Plenty of plot curves ensue adding humor and more character development.I particularly liked the fishing scene. Without much dialogue it advances the plot provides some laughs and shows that Dolly Tree can even make Myrna Loy look sexy in fishing gear.";

Just thinkthe film starred Myrna Loy William Powell Spencer Tracy AND Jean Harlow!! It's like you are getting twice the usual film rolled into one! And they all did a wonderful job in the filmparticularly Powell and Harlow.Spencer Tracy plays a relatively heartless guy who has been stringing along the same girlfriend for years Harlow. When a crisis erupts on his wedding day Tracy is thrilled to have an excuse not to tie the knot and jumps into the thick of things. It seems that a false story accidentally was run in his newspaper and now the rich dbutante Loy and her father Walter Connelly are suing for 5 million dollars! So the scheming Tracy hires William Powell to discredit Loy by using his sophisticated manly charms. Then according to this plan Powell's wife will respond by suing Loya clever and very mercenary ploy to avoid the first lawsuit. But since Powell ISN'T married Tracy the big cad asks his fiance Harlow to marry Powell!! Of course the wedding is all a shame but any man who would ask his own fiance to marry another is just a colossal jerkand that's exactly what Tracy is in the film.While this is just a broad overview of the first 20 minutes or so of the film it sets the stage for the rest of the film. At first Loy and Powell do NOT hit it off at all but after a while nature takes its course and the film continues at a fast and funny pace until its wonderful conclusion.The film deserves kudos for having an excellent script and directionMGM did NOT just rely on its stars to bring in the money but actually pulled out all the stops to make an excellent film. While the movie is not exactly a screwball comedy it's a little more sophisticated than that it is nearly one and does provide some excellent laughsmostly when watching novice Powell try to fish like an expert. This and many other wonderful moments make this a mustsee film for old movie buffs.".

	schema:reviewBody "After Robert Osborne expressed the opinion that this film was better than the film that won Best Picture of the year in 1936 and was one of the very best screwball comedies ever I was superexcited about seeing it last night on TCM. It was even nominated for Outstanding Production Best Picture while in the same year My Man Godfrey was not! For my money My Man Godfrey is a far superior film.The acting quartet of William Powell Myrna Loy Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow is an incredible ensemble. To me nobody stole the show Powell Loy and Harlow were all fantastic and Tracy in his first comedy role is very good. Walter Connolly is also outstanding as Loy's millionaire father. All were deserving of nominations in my opinion. Do not blink you won't want to miss a moment of dialog. They never miss a beat in the rapidfire quips that characterized films especially but not only comedies of this era. There is nothing like it today. What a shame that writing such as this has become a lost art!However it is the writing in this film that in the end left this movie a couple of notches below My Man Godfrey. The dialog is scintillating throughout. But the ending fails to live up to the lofty expectations established by the rest of the movie.Without any prior hints we are taken by surprise by the illegal Yucatan divorce that William Powell uses to show that he did not really marry Jean Harlow. Coming out of the blue it is not only pretty contrived but smacks of the kind of device that Truman Capote rails against in the classic Murder by Death when he accuses the assembled mystery novel writers of introducing new characters and unforeseen plot twists in the last chapter to solve mysteries in a way that is completely unforeseeable to their readers. In Libeled Lady however there is not just one but two such surprises. Harlow counters Powell's illegal Yucatan divorce with a legal Reno divorce that is unknown even to Powell! Harlow's diatribe is outstanding and she nails the other characters who have simply been manipulating her to achieve their own happy ends. That speech however is not dependent upon the double divorce contrivance and it could have been used in any alternate scenario.Another weakness of the ending is Spencer Tracy. As Tracy prepares to depart Myrna Loy suggests that he has forgotten something. He says Oh yes my hat. He doesn't convey any emotional involvement with Harlow. He kisses her goodbye saying something like See ya later. This indicates at best that Tracy expects to resume his same old relationship with Harlow focusing his real attention on the newspaper. Harlow is fantastic and we hope that her fate is better than to be stuck with the same Tracy who has ignored her for their entire relationship. For the ending to be truly happy Tracy needs to show that he has learned that he needs to demonstrate affection toward Harlow rather than pay it lip service. But the evidence seems to show otherwise.In fact at the movie's happy conclusion Harlow and Powell are still married. Loy and Powell are not. And Harlow is stuck with Tracy who we aren't real certain has seen the light. For this to be a real classic the ending should have been a little less contrived and some of these loose ends should have been tied up. As is things seem too unresolved leaving us feeling slightly unsatisfied. Consequently it is an extremely enjoyable screwball comedy but it is a step or two below the classics.".

It has elements of screwball comedy but is not as furiously paced andor dependent upon ridiculous setups as most screwball comedies. It is sophisticated comedy yet doesn't have the drawing room feel that many sophisticated comedies of the 1930s have. This is partly due to several wellstaged outdoor scenes and the fact that the characters played by William Powell Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow are lower middleclass rather than upper crust or cocktailshaking types. In addition to his usual excellent delivery of witty lines William Powell gives an agile physical performance that is a delight. He plops himself attired in a suit crosslegged onto a table he stands on a chair in the hotel living room and practices fly casting and he ends up belly flopping in a trout stream in one of the funniest scenes I have ever watched on film. Myrna Loy is enjoyable as the libeled lady of the title although I wish she had been given more to do. My only quibbles with this film are the performances of Jean Harlow and Spencer Tracy. Harlow has several good lines but seems too rough and tough for the part she's playing. It's as if she's playing a gangster's moll but this is not a gangster film. Tracy is heavyfooted and seems out of place in a comedy. Fortunately Powell's performance is strong enough to carry the film and he manages to lighten Harlow and Tracy's performances whenever they share a scene with him. Libeled Lady is enjoyable funny and another success for William Powell.".

I agree with one reviewer that at times she was behaving like a gangster's moll. However her evolving relationship with Powell was a nice twist. The middle section where William Powell goes fishing was a refreshing change of pace especially with the outdoor setting though his ineptness was a bit over the top. I wonder if they derived some inspiration for the fishing sequences from Buster Keaton's 1923 short The Balloonatic. For me the scenes with Loy and Powell were by far the most satisfying. I doubt he has an equal in delivering witty lines oozing with biting sarcasm. I strongly disagree with many of the reviews rating this one of the greatest romantic comedies ever even comparing it to My Man Godfrey. While that movie had one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen with Powell delivering a surprising brutally honest assessment of the family he's been working for the ending to Libeled Lady is a dreadful contrived mess that attempts to dismiss rather difficult complications in noisy albeit trivial fashion as if they had no idea how to end it. Nevertheless it's well worth the watch to see William Powell in top form.".

I doubt he has an equal in delivering witty lines oozing with biting sarcasm. I strongly disagree with many of the reviews rating this one of the greatest romantic comedies ever even comparing it to My Man Godfrey. While that movie had one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen with Powell delivering a surprising brutally honest assessment of the family he's been working for the ending to Libeled Lady is a dreadful contrived mess that attempts to dismiss rather difficult complications in noisy albeit trivial fashion as if they had no idea how to end it. Nevertheless it's well worth the watch to see William Powell in top form.";

	schema:reviewBody "Possible SpoilersA libel suit filed against a newspaper that knows it won't have a leg to stand on in court triggers a chain of events that plays havoc with a number of relationships in Libeled Lady' a classic romantic comedy directed by Jack Conway.  On his wedding day newspaper editor Warren Haggerty Spencer Tracy is summoned back to work before he ever reaches the church there's a crisis at hand and he's responsible albeit indirectly. In his absence another editor allowed a libelous story to make the front page a story alleging a dalliance between a certain Connie Allenbury Myrna Loy one of the richest women in the country and a married man.  When at the last minute the paper discovers the story is false the edition is recalled but it's too late fifty copies make it into circulation and Connie Allenbury sues the paper to the tune of five million dollars.  If they can't convince her to drop the suit the paper is ruined.  That's a tall order however for the Allenbury's have a longrunning feud with the paper twenty years and Haggerty knows there's only one way to deal with it  They have to catch Connie Allenbury in a compromising position.  It just so happens that a former employee of the paper Bill Chandler William Powell is an expert at handling such matters.  According to Haggerty's plan Chandler will court Miss Allenbury and when the time is right his wife along with a photographer will catch them in the act.  But first the single Chandler needs a wife and it has to be a legal marriage that will hold up in court.  And Haggerty has just the woman for the part  Gladys Jean Harlow his own bridetobe still smarting from being left alone at the altar.  He convinces her it will be in name only for one month after which time she will enjoy a six week vacation in Reno allowing for the divorce proceedings and after that everything's jake.  When she agrees knowing how much the paper means to Haggerty it begins a comedic interlude with a new twist arriving at every turn. The legendary Harlow is an absolute delight here as the spunky Gladys the girl taken for granted for too long and who enters the fray determined to get what she really wants  A loving husband.  Tracy is right at home as the fasttalking newspaperman married to the job and too thickheaded to realize what a treasure he has in Gladys.  Loy is charming as the sophisticated Connie the guarded aristocrat with the downtoearth sense of who she really is and Powell is marvelous bringing a subtle selfdeprecating sense of humor to the evergentlemanly Bill Chandler.  This is a funny movie with some truly memorable scenes especially one in which Chandler first learns how to fish then must put his newly acquired skills' to the test during a fishing trip with Connie and her father Mr. Allenbury Walter Connolly who is an expert fisherman.  Watching Chandler being put through the paces is a riot. The supporting cast includes Charley Grapewin Mr. Bane Cora Witherspoon Mrs. BurnsNorvell E.E. Clive The fishing instructor and Billy Benedict Johnny.  With outstanding performances all around Libeled Lady' is a joy to watch from beginning to end.  The story is clever the dialogue witty and it's all charmingly put together and delivered by Conway.  And there's a kind of graceful ambience to this film that keeps the humor fresh no matter how many times you see it.  This is timeless entertainment a classic depiction of human nature that rings as true today as it did all those many years ago when it was created a priceless connection to another era of another time.  I rate this one 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "'More Stars Than There Are In Heaven'.That was MGM's oft boasted statement during the 1920's  30's  this was no shallow brag as by 1936 MGM had an enviable amount of talent on their books  judging by the principal cast of Libeled Lady they didn't need to spread this talent too thinly either.With the exception of MGM's 1932 classic 'Grand Hotel' most studio's had seldom strayed from the 'two huge stars plus handful of familiar character actors' format when casting their movies. MGM were to break this rule again in 1936 with this wonderful screwball comedy as the movie was to star four of Metro's then biggest assets Spencer Tracy Jean Harlow William Powell  Myrna Loy. To depression era audiences the maths were simple four popular stars for the price of one ticket stub. Because of this Libeled Lady was always going to do well upon release but I'm sure no one involved ever thought that the movie would still be finding an appreciative audience over 70 years later because when it comes to sheer enjoyment of an easy going film with lot's of good laughs they seldom come better than this.Tracy plays Haggerty a newspaper editor  marriage shy fianc of the eager to marry Gladys Harlow. After Haggerty's newspaper prints a fabricated story regarding the socialite Connie Allenbury Loy  her philandering with a married man while holidaying in England his wedding to Gladys gets delayed while he rushes back to the office to sort out the problem. It is here that an irate Gladys informs us that this is not the first time that his dedication to work has interrupted the couple's nuptials.After the paper is told that Connie  her father J.B Walter Connelly intends to sue for 5 million Haggerty decides he has to track down  join forces with his old enemy  former employee William Chandler Powell who's experience in combating libel cases seems to be the paper's only salvation.After offering his services to Haggerty for an extortionate fee Chandler shares his plan. He will find a girl to marry him  then sail for England purely so he can sail back to the States on the same ship as The Allenbury's. He will then use the five day cruise to successfully infiltrate the Allenbury's inner social circle lure Connie into what could be classed an 'intimate' situation leaving his faux wife free to sue Connie for alienation of affection thus destroying any chance of Connie successfully suing the paper. Haggerty agrees with the plan  even contributes to it by offering his own fianc as the sacrificial wife.Gladys however is furious at her fella's attempt to marry her off to another guy but devoted to him enough to go through with the scheme. The scene depicting this sham wedding is hilarious because the JP cannot understand the bride's contempt for the groom  her obvious romantic leanings towards the best man. After acquiring enough witnesses who can vouch for his married status Chandler sets sail across the Atlantic.In England Chandler enlists the help of some British newspaper men to purposely harass Connie so he can wade in at the right moment get rough with her attackers  be seen as a knight in shining armour by both Connie  her father. The ruse pays off when Connie's father invites Chandler for Cocktails that evening.In order to 'butter up' J.B a well known angling enthusiast Chandler rents every book in the ships library on trout fishing so he can brush up on the where's why's  what for's of a sport in which he himself has never partaken. Although J.B seems enamoured by Chandler Connie is less than impressed  although still unaware of his true intentions sees Chandler as someone who's not what he appears to be  for the rest of the voyage manages to avoid Chandler  the dastardly liaison he's trying to engineer.Haggerty is not happy when he hears about Chandler's failure but is reassured when Chandler tells him that he's been invited on a fishing trip by the Allenbury's  a plot is hatched for an emotional Gladys to present herself at the Allenbury's Glen Arden fishing lodge.However in order for the couple to still appear married Chandler  Gladys have to stay in the same hotel room overnight. Gladys needlessly worried that Chandler has aspirations to extend the faade to the bedroom ensures a locked door remains between them. It is only when she wakes up unmolested that she starts to feel some romantic aspirations of her own.After a brilliantly played out fishing scene which is the film's masterpiece in which the inexperienced Chandler manages to capture the biggest trout in Glen Arden Connie finally starts to succumb to Chandler's charms  before evenings end Chandler  Connie both realise that they are very much in love.Chandler no longer wanting to embarrass Connie yet still protecting himself  knowing full well that Gladys is now also in love with him tries everything to keep the two apart. This involves a lot of hilarious manipulation of all our protagonists.Haggerty thinking that Chandler has not only stole his fianc but abandoned the job he was hired to do visits the Allenbury Home to plead for Clemency only to find Chandler  Connie together. Now realising that both he  Gladys have been duped Haggerty covertly starts some manipulations of his own to ensure that a fiery climax to the fiasco is not going be too long in coming.All four of our stars give Oscar worthy performances but special praise has to go to Walter Connelly as after 1934's 'It Happened One Night' the 'Heiress's Father' role always seemed to fit him like a glove.Libeled Lady is nothing short of a milestone in screwball Comedy.Enjoy!".

Though it didn't win MGM along with William Powell and Myrna Loy couldn't have felt too bad. They all had a hand in that year's winner The Great Ziegfeld.The premise here was just ripe for a screwball comedy and the principals delivered. Powell Loy and Jean Harlow were all established comedy players at the time but this was new territory for Spencer Tracy who had only appeared in dramas prior. With his performance here his range was established as an all around actor and set him up for all those great Katherine Hepburn teamups in years to come.The picture moves along at a pretty fast pace and you have to be as quick as the players to keep up with the dialog. You also have to accept the premise of Powell's character Bill Chandler marrying someone else's fiance in order to stop a libel suit against the New York Evening Star. It's the kind of situation that lends itself to constant back and forth maneuvering between the players who jockey for position in order to come out on top.I would never have figured Bill Powell for such a physical actor but when he hit the trout stream I couldn't believe all the pratfalls he took in service to the story. Coming up with the most elusive trout in Glen Arden was the icing on the cake. I fully expected old Wall Eye to slip away from that net but son of a gun he wound up on a dinner plate after all.So anyway Nick and Nora fans ought to be happy with the finale here as Chandler and Connie Allenbury Loy wound up tying the knot at the end of the story. In real life Powell was courting Jean Harlow at the time and was set to marry her following this picture until her untimely death shortly later. It put Powell into a deep funk for a long time before returning to the screen to begin the sequels to the Thin Man series.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this film for the first time and it was delightful. I very much enjoyed it. But apparently I'm just about the only one who didn't think the fishing scene was especially funny. Indeed my thanks to the one other reviewer who felt the same way I feel less alone in the world. What I loved was the sparkling dialog. Very very funny. I particularly loved the scene when Spencer Tracy has discovered William Powell at Myrna Loy's house and they have this meaningful conversation made up entirely of pleasantries which are going right over Loy's head.My gripes are pretty minor. I too thought Harlow was a bit too shrill to be funny and very much agreed with the comment that she comes off as more of a gangster's moll than someone who is a suitable match for the editor of a major New York newspaper. The blame for this seems to lie with the director who instructed her to be broad. A bit too broad for my tastes I liked her better in her quieter scenes.I also agree with some comments I've seen about the ending particularly the way that Tracy just seems like a jerk when he starts to leave the hotel room forgetting only his hat. The character really is too ambiguous about whether he cares for Harlow or not. He generally seems not to so when he suddenly starts defending her honor at the end it seems rather outoftheblue and contrived.And I didn't care for the very ending when the father comes in and they all talk at once. Not particularly funny and way too abrupt. The movie should've gone out on a stronger note. I would've liked to have seen more denouement just how did they clean up the bigamy situation for instance? I thought it would've been nice if the movie managed to wrap around back to the beginning and we see the four all having a double wedding together. One idea I had how about if after they are all wed and everything is happily wrapped up if Loy were to come out and admit that oh by the way the original newspaper story that started the whole mess... was actually true and not libel at all.

But apparently I'm just about the only one who didn't think the fishing scene was especially funny. Indeed my thanks to the one other reviewer who felt the same way I feel less alone in the world. What I loved was the sparkling dialog. Very very funny. I particularly loved the scene when Spencer Tracy has discovered William Powell at Myrna Loy's house and they have this meaningful conversation made up entirely of pleasantries which are going right over Loy's head.My gripes are pretty minor. I too thought Harlow was a bit too shrill to be funny and very much agreed with the comment that she comes off as more of a gangster's moll than someone who is a suitable match for the editor of a major New York newspaper. The blame for this seems to lie with the director who instructed her to be broad. A bit too broad for my tastes I liked her better in her quieter scenes.I also agree with some comments I've seen about the ending particularly the way that Tracy just seems like a jerk when he starts to leave the hotel room forgetting only his hat. The character really is too ambiguous about whether he cares for Harlow or not.

	schema:reviewBody "It is amazing to think that a talented person like Judy Holliday really was a star only for one decade on film and only in a total of nine films. She actually made more than nine but several of them prior to Adam's Rib were actually small roles or small pictures  including interestingly enough Too Much Johnson a film that was made by Orson Welles for a Broadway comedy he was directing in 1938. From Adam's Rib through The Bells Are Ringing Judy managed to demonstrate she was a gifted comic actress a good dramatic actress and a fine even sexy musical comedy star. She would even win an Oscar for her second starring role Born Yesterday  the currently reviewed movie. This should have guaranteed some degree of posthumous movie glory. It does to those who take the trouble of watching her performances but most of her films are rarely shown or in the case of Adam's Rib they are shown because the real stars are Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn and The Bells Are Ringing is recalled as one of Vincent Minelli's musicals. Judy died of cancer in 1965 much too young. Had she lived twenty or thirty more years even up to the present her filmography would have been longer and more elaborate. A decade's worth of good performances is too dependent on the tastes associated with that decade. And Judy will always be part of the Eisenhower years  not the most glamorous period of our history.Born Yesterday was a play by Garson Kanin dealing with an unscrupulous selfmade scrap metal dealer and millionaire named Harry Brock. On Broadway the part was played by Paul Douglas opposite Judy and apparently they did not get along too well. Yet their stage chemistry worked and the show ran for four years. Oddly enough when the film was made Douglas was not the star  the role went to Broderick Crawford who had won the Oscar for best actor in All The King's Men the previous year. Yet six years later Douglas did very well as McKeever the Wall Street corporate leader opposite Judy as Laura Partridge in The Solid Gold Cadillac. In retrospect it would have been interesting seeing Douglas play a more violent type but Crawford does quite nicely as the street smart Harry.Harry Billie Dawn Judy  his girlfriend and his bodyguardcousin Eddie come to Washington D.C. Harry wants to expand his scrap iron  garbage dump empire by getting legislation passed allowing him an exception to certain tariffs and taxes. This requires his bribing a Congressman Larry Oliver who might sway the required committee in changing the law. Supervising this is Harry's lawyer Jim Devery Howard St. John an alcoholic who was once quite promising as a legal scholar he was close to the great associate justice Oliver Wendell Holmes whom he says was his god. But Harry although rather rough himself in manners decides that Billie should sharpen her image. She seems too naive but it is actually that she has never been stimulated certainly not by the rough unread uncultured Harry. Harry has attracted the attention of a reporter named Paul Verrall William Holden and on Devery's suggestion he hires Verrall to transform Billie into a socially acceptable girlfriend.Paul and Billie fall in love of course and the education works too well. In fact while comparable to Eliza Doolittle's education by Henry Higgins it is actually different. Eliza gains a firmer grasp on her self respect because her speech and manners improve. But she never questions the social order of things or Higgins' political and economic views. That's because Eliza is never trained to be thinking that widely. But Billie is  Paul has her reading books and looking up words. His education is far more sweeping. As a result she starts questioning what Harry and Devery are doing in Washington  which Harry is not very happy about.Born Yesterday works due to the acting of Holliday Crawford who for all his roughness is funny  see his constant frustration playing gin with Billie Holden and St. John. It ends up as reaffirmation of democracy over corruption and of the possibility of an individual to grow. And it did set the stage for Holliday's screen personae as the urbanite whose humanity and intelligence won out in the end.".

Crawford is able to swing you back and forth between anger and sympathy for his character. Not an easy task! William Holden is perfectly calm and reserved as Paul Verrall. His character forms a wonderful opposite to Billie. And with direction George Cukor worked his usual magic.Most of the themes are timeless. A person lives in ignorant bliss until their eyes are opened. They realize that there is a better life for them and begin their struggle for improvement. They discover that their greatest opponents to advancement are not those above them but those at their current level.A few of the elements are dated.

In 2020 hindsight have there not been enough scenerychewing overthetop dramatics that have won Academy Awards over the years?  Even the least of actors acknowledge that comedy is more difficult to play well than drama.When I watch Born Yesterday  I KNOW I'm observing two masters at work Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford.  Holden gives a good performance of course but can't hold a light to his costars in this particular project. Holliday is mesmerizing with every expression every screechy syllable  and watch those hands during the gin game!  Perfection in each gesture. Crawford pulls off a nifty trick by making the viewer simultaneously loathe and feel compassion for his character.Although she died before I was even a twinkle in my mother's eye I think I could have hung out with Judy Holliday nee' Judith Tuvim.  I like intelligent people and I've read that she was a brilliant woman.  Makes sense  it takes some serious smarts to play so dumb.  She was a funnier Marilyn before there WAS a Marilyn.  Partially because she died so young and partially because of her refusal to play pattycake with the HUAC she is now an underappreciated memory. There's one more reason to love Judy  can you think of any other person hauled before the HUAC who had the . . . ahem . . . gonads to confound the committee by appearing as a character from one of their own movies?  And pull it off?  Now that ladies and gentlemen takes guts AND brains!Treasure this unique gem and then . . . Thank God for the shortlived but stunning talent of Judy Holliday.".

In 2020 hindsight have there not been enough scenerychewing overthetop dramatics that have won Academy Awards over the years?  Even the least of actors acknowledge that comedy is more difficult to play well than drama.When I watch Born Yesterday  I KNOW I'm observing two masters at work Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford.  Holden gives a good performance of course but can't hold a light to his costars in this particular project. Holliday is mesmerizing with every expression every screechy syllable  and watch those hands during the gin game!  Perfection in each gesture. Crawford pulls off a nifty trick by making the viewer simultaneously loathe and feel compassion for his character.Although she died before I was even a twinkle in my mother's eye I think I could have hung out with Judy Holliday nee' Judith Tuvim.  I like intelligent people and I've read that she was a brilliant woman.  Makes sense  it takes some serious smarts to play so dumb.  She was a funnier Marilyn before there WAS a Marilyn.  Partially because she died so young and partially because of her refusal to play pattycake with the HUAC she is now an underappreciated memory. There's one more reason to love Judy  can you think of any other person hauled before the HUAC who had the . . . ahem . . . gonads to confound the committee by appearing as a character from one of their own movies?  And pull it off?  Now that ladies and gentlemen takes guts AND brains!Treasure this unique gem and then . . . Thank God for the shortlived but stunning talent of Judy Holliday.";

	schema:reviewBody "Any play that runs 1642 performances on Broadway for three years you know will wind up in Hollywood. But usually the Broadway cast never makes it intact. It didn't here but we were lucky to get Judy Holliday to repeat her acclaimed Broadway role her as Billie Dawn gal pal of junk tycoon Broderick Crawford. Judy only got the role because Rita Hayworth decided to marry Aly Khan and after testing several others who weren't quite right Harry Cohn decided to go with the original. She rewarded Cohn's late faith with a Best Actress Oscar for 1950.Speaking of Oscars Cohn had an interesting problem on his hands which he solved with Born Yesterday. Broderick Crawford had brought home an Oscar the year before for All the King's Men. But Crawford was hardly traditional leading man material. But there sure were enough similarities with the dictatorial minded Willie Stark with the tyrannical Harry Brock so that Cohn could cast Crawford and keep the momentum going for his career. Crawford's part was played by Paul Douglas on stage who would get to Hollywood right around this time as well.Still neither Holliday or Crawford were box office and Columbia needed one name that had some guaranteed pull with movie audiences. That's where Bill Holden came in. The part was built up from the Broadway version all that tourist business at the Capitol and other Washington sites were not on Broadway. The role of the intellectual newspaper reporter was played by Gary Merrill and Merrill was certainly better suited for the part than Holden. Personally I think that Cohn should have gone with his other reliable leading man Glenn Ford in this part. Still even with the built up role Holden was a definite number three in this film.The plot is very simple the magic of Born Yesterday is watching Holliday's character grow in awareness of what's around her. She's the play thing of junk tycoon Harry Brock a self made millionaire who's street smart rich and nothing else. He's aware of it though and aware that Holliday lacks the social graces as well.Since Crawford can't or won't learn them at least he wants a polished hostess to make up for it. He hires newspaper reporter Holden to teach Holliday. But he teaches her about democracy and the corrupting influence of special interests of which Crawford is one and she's now aware of.Crawford also put a lot of his holdings in her name for tax purposes. That's a created situation Crawford regrets starting.Holliday became so identified with the Billie Dawn role that when she started having blacklisting problems due to her left wing politics she went into character as Billie Dawn before Congress. The chumps in Congress actually bought it all and she skated. Actually in real life Holliday was a well read intelligent woman the last thing from Billie Dawn you could imagine.Judy Holliday spent the remainder of her career between Broadway and Hollywood so her film output remains small and she died way too young. Still as another uneducated character in a film said what there is is cherce.Born Yesterday is as cherce as it gets.".

A movie that should be seen by many politicians and anybody in power.  It's just too bad that this movie came at the time of Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve because it seems to have been neglected as of late. Also I would like to say to those who say Judy Holliday's performance isn't as deserving against Bette Davis' in All About Eve and Gloria Swanson's in Sunset Boulevard to figure out which one of the roles were the most difficult to play for each particular actress and in fact for any actress. I'm sure that Gloria Swanson's performance was difficult but it was seemingly so close to her real life that it doesn't seem so difficult Although that well known fact made 'Sunset Blvd' a greater Masterpiece. As for Bette Davis in 'All About Eve' it was also great but not very difficult for her She never had a bad performance in her movie career.

	schema:reviewBody "Are you folks sure this is a good movie? I'm halfway through and it just gets worse and worse moving slower and slower and slower to the point that I'm afraid it will never end.Comedy? Maybe people actually laughed in the movie theater 60 years ago but it's mighty quiet here.Hasn't anyone in this movie heard of subtlety? Talk about overacting. Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford look like they came out of a prequel to Dumb and Dumber. And William Holden is wishy washy never clearly defining his character or motivation for any of the things he is doing aside from getting laid by a not especially pretty moll of a gangster which is a pretty darn stupid thing to do for a supposedly in the know Washington reporter. This is either a violation of basic journalistic ethics or a deposit on some concrete galoshes.Neither Holden nor Holliday fit their parts. Put Marilyn Monroe and Kirk Douglas in them and this might sizzle. Monroe knew how to play the dual levels of a smart inner dame and an outer ditsy dame as seen in Bus Stop. And Douglas wrote the book on cynical reporting in Ace in the Hole. As it is there is no chemistry between them zero and none between Holliday and Crawford either. Crawford really loves Holliday? Why? She is as charming as screeching chalk on a blackboard.So Cukor rehearsed the cast before a live audience to get the timing. That might have had some relevance when this was shown in a theater. But on home video half a century later all this cast produces is puzzled silence.I suppose there was something edgy about taking on political corruption in a more innocent time. Except it had been done far better two years before in State of the Union and earlier by Frank Capra in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Meet John Doe.

To be specific the acting is boring the plot is boring the script is boring the characters are boring and the directing is boring. I don't remember if the music is boring.

	onyx:emotionText "Are you folks sure this is a good movie? I'm halfway through and it just gets worse and worse moving slower and slower and slower to the point that I'm afraid it will never end.Comedy? Maybe people actually laughed in the movie theater 60 years ago but it's mighty quiet here.Hasn't anyone in this movie heard of subtlety? Talk about overacting. Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford look like they came out of a prequel to Dumb and Dumber. And William Holden is wishy washy never clearly defining his character or motivation for any of the things he is doing aside from getting laid by a not especially pretty moll of a gangster which is a pretty darn stupid thing to do for a supposedly in the know Washington reporter. This is either a violation of basic journalistic ethics or a deposit on some concrete galoshes.Neither Holden nor Holliday fit their parts. Put Marilyn Monroe and Kirk Douglas in them and this might sizzle. Monroe knew how to play the dual levels of a smart inner dame and an outer ditsy dame as seen in Bus Stop. And Douglas wrote the book on cynical reporting in Ace in the Hole. As it is there is no chemistry between them zero and none between Holliday and Crawford either. Crawford really loves Holliday? Why? She is as charming as screeching chalk on a blackboard.So Cukor rehearsed the cast before a live audience to get the timing. That might have had some relevance when this was shown in a theater. But on home video half a century later all this cast produces is puzzled silence.I suppose there was something edgy about taking on political corruption in a more innocent time. Except it had been done far better two years before in State of the Union and earlier by Frank Capra in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Meet John Doe.

She might seem a caricature at first but there is a lot of subtlety to her actingwatch the hands the eyes looking away even her whole body which isn't a tart looking for attention but someone uncomfortable where she is. And the Holden character a writer of some kind who seems to have fallen into a scoop of surprising dimensions makes the most of the situation. Cukor isn't only a director of women of course he's a master at storytelling. That's what really shows here. It's fast without being dizzying. It's interesting and human and funny enough and rich enough to hold the line through even some rough patches. I found it all very entertaining and if you're inclined there's a lesson in how to be a good citizen built in. Never mind the ending which seems to wink at the audienceas if justice is all relative and everyone can get away with whatever they can get away with.Of course the point isn't so deep.

Her filmography consists of about 13 films and then she died in 1965 of breast cancer. Indeed had she been fortunate enough to live further she probably would have had a more illustrious career than she already had. 1950 was her best year as she got the starring role in Born Yesterday mostly thanks to Katharine Hepburn who she worked with on Adam's Rib and impressed so much that Hepburn pushed for her name to get publicity and fame.Based on a play by one of the screenwriters of Adam's Rib Born Yesterday is a rather refreshing look at the game of politics as well as American society and its views of education. Holliday is wonderful as Billie Dawn an uneducated and mostly subdued woman taken under the wing of a powerful loud boisterous steel tycoon Broderick Crawford who basically controls her every move. Wanting to impress the people he hopes to work with this Mr. Brock hires a smart but controversial reporter played very straight and forward by William Holden one of the most underrated stars of the early 20th century.In a movie like this with actors like Holliday and Holden love is never far away. Yet one of the things I loved about this film is that love is not the focal point of this relationship or the plot. Their attraction is immediate but they put it aside for something more important the education of this woman who has been under the foot of a man and never seemed to understand about the world outside of her own. As the two take tours of Washington DC and read books and newspapers information and knowledge abound especially about what the welloff Mr. Brock is doing in the nation's capital.This is Holliday's most celebrated role she won the Oscar that year over Gloria Swanson and Bette Davis and she certainly was the best choice for it. Her platinum blonde looks and New York accent strike well against the newfound knowledge she receives in this movie. Holden is good here as an idealistic and ambitious writer who never goes too far always staying true to himself and being a solid character for the audience to follow. Crawford is also quite good as the tycoon believing everything can be taken by force except for intellectual. There is a lot of talk about the importance of knowing about our nation's government and the things that go on in it. Watching it I never felt it was more prevalent than today. This is certainly a warm and funny comedy. But it also has a brain and something to say. Certainly that is a rarity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Born Yesterday is sheer delight. Judy Holliday won Best Actress for her performance. And she's surrounded by Broderick Crawford and William Holden equally terrific in their roles and a wonderful cast of supporting players. Garson Kanin's stage play is chock full of great lines. At its heart this comedy has serious ideas in mind.What's not to love? Nothing really. Born Yesterday is a classic character comedydrama with brilliant performances.Yet there's a builtin element that doesn't quite work. It's simply unbelievable realistically that a journalist as bright and informed and talented and ambitious as William Holden's character can seriously fall in love with and marry a character as consistently dumb and happy to BE dumb as uncouth and strident as Holliday's Billie Dawn.Billie is what used to be called a chippie. Holliday plays her to perfection. The largely silent gin sequence between her and Crawford is justifiably a classic.Crawford is also pitchperfect as a blustering ruthless obnoxious potentially dangerous fascist Billie's term with a soft spot for his chippie.Holden oddly is slightly out of place. He's far too smart too experienced too centered genuinely confident and nonneurotic to participate in this supposed triangle of characters.However delightful Bille Dawn is and she IS delightful she remains a cheap floosie with no social or intellectual skills or curiosity who's ready for a little action as she puts it.She's a dumb blonde from the burlesque chorus who's a kept woman in other words. A dumb whore to put it less politely. Whores on film can be wonderful see Melina Mercouri in Never on Sunday.Holden's character is so superior to her that when they fall in love one cannot help but think This is a guy who needs a weak cheap woman so he can feel superior. After all he's trained and educated her.Exactly the same premise as My Fair Lady. Except Billie Dawn's character NEVER exhibits the strength independence nor intelligence of Liza Doolittle. Nor was Liza Doolittle a kept woman. At the end of Born Yesterday Billie's learned to pronounce some words but she's still uncouth. Her last line to the cop is Look it up! She's as strident and defensive as she was in the beginning  just slightly less so.Holden's character meanwhile hasn't changed or grown one whit. Nor has Crawford's. Nor has anybody.Born Yesterday plays beautifully on stage. On film subject to more intimate scrutiny it plays funny but not real. Nobody changes nobody grows despite the superficial growth of Billie. There are some terrific lines and serious themes. But it's really a showcase for the actress who plays Billie. And Judy Holliday did it better than anybody.Won Best Actress for 1950 in fact.Which brings us to the controversy.Up against Bette Davis in All About Eve and Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard should Holliday have won? Depends on what constitutes Best Actress. Several comments on IMDb suggest that Swanson was largely playing herself and so deserved to lose. Other comments suggest the same about Bette Davis.Truth? Bette Davis WAS playing a version of herself in All About Eve as anybody who's read much about her or who is familiar with her films knows. She was and always will be a Diva. Brilliant. But a Diva.Judy Holliday's range as an actress was not much. She plays but a slight variation of her Billie Dawn character in everything she ever did. Again brilliant but one note.Swanson? Hardly. The actress was as far from Norma Desmond as you can get. As anybody knows who's seen her interviews in the Hollywood series narrated by James Mason she had an astonishingly versatile career from comedy to tragedy in all sorts of roles in silents and sound films from the time she was 14. Swanson's real voice in the Hollywood series or live onstage is NOTHING like Norma Desmond's. What an actress!When her film career ended she became a highly successful businesswoman in several fields. She NEVER looked back. She remained vital and theatrically active into her seventies see my review of Sunset Boulevard for a recollection of seeing her onstage when she was that age.Billy Wilder Director always thought of Sunset Boulevard as a comedy. Indeed he approached Mae West among others for the role of Norma Desmond. Remnants of that original concept still exist I AM big. It's the pictures that got small. But as for an actor going as FAR from herself and as deeply into the character there is no comparison between Davis Holliday and Swanson in 1950 Swanson wins hands down.Billy Wilder had to shoot Sunset Boulevard under a fictitious title A Can of Beans because if the actual script had leaked out the film would never have been made. For its day it was a shocking exposure of the pitiful underbelly of Hollywood  failed writers turning into male gigolos delusional former stars and all.The Academy conservative as always was outraged and denied Swanson the award she deserved.Today nearly sixty years later the American Film Institute lists Sunset Boulevard as number 12 out of the 100 greatest films ever made.Born Yesterday doesn't even appear on the list.There is no controversy.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Cukor's Born Yesterday was based on the successful Broadway play of the same name. Reprising her role from the Broadway production Judy Holliday played Billie Dawn former nightclub singer and current mistress of crooked junkyard tycoon Harry Brock Broderick Crawford. Brock hires journalist Paul Verall William Holden to make Billie presentable to Washington D.C. society but before long he decides that Billie's getting too smart for her own good or rather his good.The cast is unquestionably the film's biggest asset. Judy Holliday took home a welldeserved Oscar for her excellent performance as the dim but sweet Billie. Meanwhile Broderick Crawford gave a performance that's arguably as good as his Oscarwinning performance of a year earlier in All the King's Men. Rounding out the leads was William Holden who was solid if not as impressive as his costars.The screenplay snagged an Oscar nomination but I found myself less impressed than Academy voters. In particular I felt that the comedic  romantic elements of the story were overshadowed by the drama surrounding Brock's shady dealings. To me this was the least interesting aspect of the story perhaps because it led to some tedious moralizing.On the technical front the movie showcased firstclass production values. George Cukor earned his fourth Oscar nomination for his efforts and Frederick Hollander's score was above average. The Jean Louis costumes also garnered an Oscar nomination.Ultimately though I felt that the movie took itself too seriously to completely click as a comedy. That being said it still managed to get by on the strength of its performances. Thus I'd recommend it as long as you're not expecting a breezy affair.".

But after the murder the movie becomes a film in style of the poliziescho the Italian crime movie of the 1970s as the audience follows an undercover cop searching for the killer and also for the kidnappers of a young boy but the audience doesn't know for a long time either that the cop really is one and that the murder case and the kidnapping rely to each other. All this culminates within the first half of the movie in a car chase which offers enough gags to make the scene pure slapstick.After that the giallo style returns as the sunglassed killer goes on a killing spree. The crime movie is back as the plot unfolds to have its motive in mobstyle drug dealing. And let's not forget The killings have also to do with professional child prostitution and abuse. A really wild mix even more so if one considers that the film sometimes boosts cheap if mostly funny humor.The cool sound track is reminiscent of the early scores by Goblin for Dario Argento's films and it seems that Ernesto Gastaldi who wrote the story and cowrote the screenplay with director Martino was influenced by Massimo Dallamano's great La Polizia Chiede Aiuto that was made one year earlier.All in all this surely is not Martino's best film his pure gialli are more enjoyable but if one gets used to the unusual concoction of such different topics and styles it's an entertaining and sometimes hilariously funny fast paced and thrilling movie that even boosts some harsh social comment.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say that before I comment on this title that I am a fan of Sergio Martino's films. Particularly 'Torso' which I rate as one of the greatest of all Italian horror films. Therefore my enthusiasm for this film and my high rating should be taken with a pinch of salt by anyone looking for a classic giallo. This is no 'Solange'. In fact this film could easily slip into the comedyactionthriller genre. In its defence I would say that it does have gorgeous topless girls savagely murdered in fantastic closeup and a catchy score too. Therefore there is enough to keep fans of the genre interested. But and it is a big but there is no mystery element as we see the killer's face in all the death scenes. Are you still keen? Then read on.The plot A young hooker is discovered savagely murdered by inspector Germi played by Claudio Cassinelli. He then embarks on a rather unorthodox investigation in search of the killer. Along the way he happens to enlist the services of Giannino a little pickpocket and they both proceed to uncover a teenaged girl trafficking ring with connections that lead all the way up to the top.There are some fine comedy moments in this film. How about this little exchange between Germi and a young woman he is questioning to wet your appetite? I'm collecting Stamps.  Oh yeah? Far out. Then stick one on your ass and send yourself to New York 'cause you're getting on my nerves. If this is your kind of comedy then there is plenty more where that came from. I only wish that the jokes and slapstick could have continued throughout the film.Sazuma present the film restored and in 169 anamorphic widescreen. You get the original Italian language soundtrack with English German and Dutch subtitles along with a feature commentary by film critics Christian Kebler and Robert Zion. A featurette titled 'Crime Scene Milan' the Italian trailer and a poster gallery complete the package.The bottomline? Yes it is a peculiar film and in no way can it rank alongside 'Torso' 'Excite Me' or 'The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh'. Nevertheless for Sergio Martino fans and mustseeevery giallo types this has to be a mustbuy DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "An authentic Italian 70's CrimeGiallo movie with loads of comedy elements and even slapstick? What's next a Disney's Pixar movie featuring graphic sex and gory massacres? Say what you want about director Sergio Martino but you certainly can't claim he hasn't experimented with all the different genres imaginable. He directed several brilliant and prototype Gialli Torso Case of the Scorpion's Tail but also Spaghetti Westerns A Man Called Blade relentless cop thrillers The Violent Professionals sleazy comedies Sex with a Smile Apocalyptic SciFi After the Fall of New York Cyborg actionflicks Fists of Steel cheesy monster movies Big Alligator River and cannibal adventures Mountain of the Cannibal God. Yet of his entire versatile repertoire Suspected Death of a Minor is perhaps his most awkward accomplishment. Judging from the title the basic plot synopsis and the picture images on the back of the DVD box the film looks like a standard Giallo but the story further unfolds itself more as a bitter crime thriller interlarded with large bits of comedy. And the absolute strangest thing is that this unusual hodgepodge of styles and genre also actually works or at least up to a certain degree. It's hard to picture yourself a Giallo plot covering crude topics such as teen prostitution networks and vile murders and simultaneously witness comical car chases and clichd running gags. It's rather difficult to write a brief summary of the plot without giving away surprise details or essential twists. Most reviews  even the one on the DVD box  already reveal a nice detail regarding the main character's identity even though the script keeps it a secret up until 45 minutes into the film! I think it's best to know nothing about the story and simply watch it unfold. I'll simple reveal that all the required ingredients of a supreme Giallo dish are present including a vicious reflecting sunglasseswearing killer rooftop  roller coaster showdowns and perverted men with money  power. Claudio Cassinelli depicts one of the most likable characters I've ever seen in an Italian film. He's eloquent and witty but ultimately arrogant and provocative towards everyone who crosses his path. There are a couple of brutal murders on display but the amount of female nudity is sorely disappointing presumably because Martino didn't engage his heavenly luscious muse Edwige Fenech this time. Luciano Michellini's musical score is reminiscent to Goblin's work for Dario Argento and the photography is very nice. Suspected Death of a Minor is a good film and recommended to fans of the director and the genre. However make sure it's not your first acquaintance with the Giallo otherwise you might get a misconception of what this wondrous sub genre is all about.".

	schema:headline " Murder Meets Slapstick in Sergio Martino's Odd Last Giallo";
	schema:reviewBody "As many of my fellow Italian Horror fans probably do I consider Sergio Martino one of my favorite directors. The man has delivered great films in a variety of genres but he is doubtlessly and rightly most famous for his Gialli. Before seeing this film I had already seen his five other contributions to the Giallogenre The Strange Vice Of Mrs Wardh 1971 The Scorpion's Tail 1971 Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The Key 1972 All Colors Of The Dark 1972 and Torso 1973 all of which are nothing short of brilliance. I've seen all these films multiple times and while they all had the typical great Martinostyle each one of these films has something very particular. Especially the ingenious Poeinspired Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The Key is a personal favorite of mine that easily ranks among the greatest Gialli ever brought to screen. This La Morte Sospetta Di Una Minorenne aka. Suspected Death Of A Minor of 1975 is doubtlessly also a very memorable film and while I did not quite like it as much as Martino's other five Gialli one cannot deny that it has its very particular qualities. This is doubtlessly Martino's oddest Giallo as it is not a typical specimen of the genre but a weird and highly unconventional mixture of Giallo Crime flick and in many parts Comedy that even includes Slapstickelements.I do not want to give away too much of the plot since it is in many ways unpredictable and bears many unexpected twists. The mid 70s were already the end of the most successful heyday of the Italian Giallo whilst the heyday of Italian Crime flicks was beginning around the time. Several Gialli from the time therefore used elements that are mainly attributed to the Poliziottesco such as drugs underage prostitution corruption etc. The most famous example for that may be Massimo Dallamano's La Polizia Chiede Ajuto aka. What Have They Done To Your Daughters? of 1974 and it is also the case with this film. The overload of slapstick elements here is quite unique though which is not necessarily a good thing. True even the most famous Giallo of alltime and also one of the greatest Dario Argento's masterpiece Profondo Rosso from the same year has several comical moments. Not to the same extent though as these moments are just occasionally in Profondo Rosso where they actually greatly create more closeness to the characters. In Suspected Death Of A Minor these elements are not quite as funny but therefore including more slapstick omnipresent and used to a sometimes annoying extent. Even so the idea of a Giallo with slapstickelements is original to say at least and the film does not loose its compelling MysteryThriller parts. Leading man Claudio Casellini starred in a variety of Italian Exploitation and Horror productions including Flavia The Heretic Murder At The Etruscan Cemetery and director Martino's very own Mountain Of The Cannibal God. The role which Casellini is probably best known for is that of the investigating detective in What Have They Done To Your Daughters a film that bears many resemblances to this one even though What Have They Done To Your Daughters is more serious and a lot better. The film is superbly shot and the score by Luciano Michelini is brilliant and contributes a lot to the atmosphere and suspense. Overall. Suspected Death Of A Minor is a highly recommendable film for all my fellow Gialloenthusiasts and Sergio Martino fans. I would nonetheless recommend to see Martino's brilliant other Gialli first. Especially Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The Key which by the way is funnily referenced to in this film comes with my highest possible recommendations and films like Torso and The Strange Vice Of Mrs. Wardh are also essential for genrefans. My opinion on Suspected Death Of A Minor 710".

	schema:reviewBody "As other reviewers have said this is a strange movie. It is kind of an unofficial sixth entry to the series of excellent gialli directed by Sergio Martino in the early 1970's although as such it is definitely step down from his previous film Torso. It has a very familiar gialloesqe starting point where the investigation of a murdered underage prostitute leads to a lot of equally nasty killings. It also functions as a poliziani with lots of action and chase sequences and a cynical plot involving highlevel political intrigue. Claudio Cassinelli plays a cop who makes Dirty Harry look restrained and bythebook. He sleeps with prostitutes consorts with minor criminals feels up underage girls shoots at civilians and even leads the regular police on a wreckless highspeed chase for no real reason. The people he is after though are even worse involved in everything from kidnapping to drugs and teenage prostitution to money laundering.But if all this isn't a little too much the movie also tries to be a comedy. Cassanelli has a comical sidekick and there is a running gag where he keeps breaking his glasses. Sometimes the comedy works but other times it tends to sabotage the drama like when he incorporates slapstick pratfalls into what is already a very overlong car chase a bane of these type of movies ever since The French Connection was released in Italy. Fortunately Cassinelli has charisma to spare in his first of many roles for director Martino he didn't have the impressive breasts of Martino's other frequent collaborator Edwige Fenech but he was no doubt a better actor. Jenny Tamburi on the other hand was pretty much wasted both as an actress and pair of impressive breasts. But Mel Ferrer and most of the other obscure more actors acquit themselves pretty well. Not as good as Martino's earlier movies but better than his later ones and it has just been released in widescreen with English subtitles on import DVD. So check it out for yourself.".

Martino made a series of five Giallo's in the early seventies and while this could easily be seen as the sixth entry it rarely gets a mention in discussions about the others and the reason for that is down to the fact that this film arguably isn't even a Giallo. The film features clear cut Giallo elements we have a killer young girls being murdered fair amounts of gore etc etc but then we also have a barrage of car chases shootouts police procedure and most strangely of all a completely out of place dose of humour! It all starts like any other Giallo might as we witness the murder of a prostitute at the hands of an unseen killer. Then we are introduced to a man who hooks up with a local thief and the pair go round stealing prostitute's handbags. The mystery man is later revealed to be a police inspector and he has his own unorthodox methods for getting to the bottom of the convoluted plot.The film was released in 1975 which is towards the end of the Giallo's golden period and near the start of the Polizi trend that took over it. This film falls somewhere between the two successful Italian exports and the result is a bit muddled  with the emphasis being more on general crime than the murders. Then we've got this comedy element which really is completely misguided and all the more strange for the fact that the screenplay was written by the great Ernesto Gastaldi. It really does add nothing the only effect being the undermining of several tense and well worked sequences! It's all the more strange considering the plot  this is a dark film handling themes of underage sex murder and prostitution so I really don't know what Gastaldi was thinking! However the film is redeemed by plenty of tense sequences and a decent car chases which is sure to please the Polizi fans. The film also features a superb leading performance from Claudio Cassinelli as the unorthodox inspector. There's also an odd score which has shade's of Goblin mixed in with elevator music. Overall this is not one of the great Martino Giallo's but it's not too bad and should please a lot of Giallo fans.".

Are they successful? Not in the slightest in my view although other opinions are equally justified. To me they undermine the atmosphere without adding anything extra that is successful.Where Sergio Martino's direction really shines however is in the chase and shooting setpieces the best being a tremendous shootout on a rollercoaster ride. The fusion of calamity and the rattling soundtrack guarantees enjoyment.A shame that such urgency isn't injected into more of the 100 minutes or that some pruning couldn't have been done. For however energetic certain moments are the film is a little too long and could have done with perhaps losing 15 minutes.Is Martino's mixture of styles a success? Partially I'd say. But ultimately I prefer my giallo more consistently dark and without the flights of comedy. It is good but not great. Whilst it is pleasing to see the director experiment with an established style his crowning achievement remains 1971's untouchable 'Strange Case of Mrs Wardh.'".

	schema:reviewBody "When looking into this film before watching it I kept seeing it referred to as a giallo film those Italian films that featured a killer being hunted by police or more often someone affected by their murders. While watching it I found it felt less like a giallo and more like one of the police action films that seemed to pour out of Italy in the 70s known as Poliziesco police thriller. The end result will be up to each viewer to decide.The film opens with a young woman on the run a prostitute who is followed and found and quickly killed by a sunglass wearing killer. A man she bumped into at a dance hall begins looking into her death and it isn't until later in the film we discover he is police detective Paolo Germi Claudio Cassinelli. Recruiting the help of a street thief named Giannino he begins a rather strange investigation of the situation.Germi is unlike most detectives in that he has his own way of doing things. He inserts himself into the criminal world and isn't averse to opening fire when need be or slugging his way out of a situation. While not quite the vigilante style that audiences have come to associate with characters like Dirty Harry he does tend to ignore a number of laws while seeking out who the killer is.Along the way Germi learns that there is more to the case than a simple murder of a prostitute. It all revolves around a teenage prostitution ring and the powerful man behind it all. You know that a face off will eventually come the only question being who will walk away from it unscathed? The film features two items that fill a lot of screen time one different than most and the other part and parcel of the genre. The humor in the film is what is unusual even more so when it's not limited to Germi's sidekick but includes him as well. A running gag about him constantly breaking his glasses is a nice twist. The second and more common item is a lengthy car chase and this film has more than one. One of them brings these two elements together as Germi and Giannino toss the doors of Germi's car at a pursuing police car since Germi is undercover.In the end the movie is an enjoyable film to watch and entertains from the beginning to the end. The end itself is quite satisfying after having watched the rest of the film. Cassinelli never had the chance to make his way to starring in U.S. films because his life was cut short in a tragic helicopter crash 10 years after this film was made. He shows the potential to become a world class star here and it's sad he never had the opportunity.Arrow Video has done their usual bang up job for this release. To start with they're offering a brand new 2k restoration of the film from the original camera negative meaning you get the best picture quality for this film ever. Extras include a new commentary track by Troy Howarth the author of SO DEADLY SO PERVERSE 50 YEARS OF Italian GIALLO FILMS new interviews with director Sergio Martino and cinematographer Giancarlo Ferrando a reversible sleeve with newly commissioned artwork by Chris Malbon and with the first pressing only an illustrated collector's booklet with new writing by Barry Forshaw.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sergio Martino's name is pretty well known amongst Giallo and Italian exploitation fans  he's directed such classic Gialli as Torso The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh Case of the Scorpion's Tail and All the Colors of the Dark. He's also made some firstrate trash namely Mountain of the Cannibal God 2019 After the Fall of New York Atomic Cyborg and The Great Alligator. Suspected Death of a Minor is one of Martino's less recognized films as it has never until now received a widespread release. Sazuma Productions present here an uncut and restored version of this longlost piece of Italian genre cinema.When a prostitute is found brutally murdered in a sleazy boarding house renegade Inspector Paolo Germi Claudio Cassinelli teams up with petty thief and pickpocket Teti Gianfranco Barra to investigate. The trail leads them to discover a series of interlinking crimes including an underage prostitution racket blackmail kidnapping incest and drugs. The plot is extremely convoluted with many surprises along the way.This film is a unique blend of the Giallo and Poliziesco police thriller genres with the odd touch of bizarre comedy. There is your Giallostyle killer who wears mirrored sunglasses and slashes up women with a switchblade although overall there's very little blood in this flick but he's only seen in a few scenes as the police investigations take center stage here. Although Germi doesn't go about police business the usual way he's more like Dirty Harry or something he shoots at civilians sleeps with hookers and even leads members of his own police force on a huge carchase during which he tells his passenger to rip off the car doors his car's a piece of sh!t and throw them at the car behind him! There's also other comedic elements during this car chase  they smash into one dude on a bike and he's left riding a unicycle another guy narrowly avoids getting hit by jumping out of the way and when he falls he spins on his head a coupla times like a breakdancer ?!.The film is extremely well shot with gorgeous cinematography by frequent Martino collaborator Giancarlo Ferrando and an excellent Goblinesquire score by Luciano Michelini.Italian exploit fans will recognize a few familiar faces here too Claudio Cassinelli Flavia the Heretic Mountain of the Cannibal God and Lucio Fulci's The New Gladiators and Murder Rock. Mel Ferrer both Lenzi and Hooper's Eaten Alive films Nightmare City The Great Alligator. Jenny Tamburi Murder to the Tune of the Seven Black Notes The Sinful Nuns of Saint Valentine Women in Cell Block 7. And the Assistant Director was Michele Massimo Tarantini Massacre in Dinosaur Valley Women in Fury.Overall an OK film but probably more for fans of the Poliziesco genre than Giallo as its definitely more police  action orientated. 610".

	schema:headline " Underappreciated classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite the absence of an actual plot the movie is more or less a sequence of sketches Fantozzi is probably the last hooray of the Italianstyle Comedy. Sure the general tone is much lighter if compared to classic Italianstyle Comedies but nonetheless the fire of a merciless sociocultural criticism still burns under the seethrough veil of the farce.Accountant Ugo Fantozzi embodies every possible stereotype of your Average middleclass Italian of the 70s. Stuck in a frustrating job exploited and made fun of by his coworkers designated victim of his bosses unhappy and disheartened family man married to an unbelievably ugly and dull wife and with a simian daughter he always seems to draw the shortest straw. No matter what he does and how hard he tries Lady Luck will always turn her back on him. Better if after having given him some hope.But mind you behind all the improbable situations and the overthetop comedy stuff the message is indeed deeper. Everything Fantozzi wishes for is the socalled Italian Dream after the economical boom of the late 50s every Italian dreamt about landing a good 9to5 job buying himself a house and a car living a nice and quiet family life with summer holidays plenty of hobbies etc. And should things have gone very well maybe a mistress too...Instead poor Fantozzi is stuck in a rut he has a secondrate version of all of that... And the more he tries to attain happiness the worse it ends.Clearly the comedy aspect is prominent and the movie is also enjoyable for its slapstick comedy for its sketches and for its caricatural portrait of Italian lowermiddleclass. But once the funny parts are an acquired taste you can see past it and the sadness of the characters appears offering a whole new dimension to the movie.In origin Fantozzi was a literary character created by Paolo Villaggio himself who'll star as Fantozzi in all the subsequent movies and on the written page the social criticism was much heavier.

	onyx:emotionText "Despite the absence of an actual plot the movie is more or less a sequence of sketches Fantozzi is probably the last hooray of the Italianstyle Comedy. Sure the general tone is much lighter if compared to classic Italianstyle Comedies but nonetheless the fire of a merciless sociocultural criticism still burns under the seethrough veil of the farce.Accountant Ugo Fantozzi embodies every possible stereotype of your Average middleclass Italian of the 70s. Stuck in a frustrating job exploited and made fun of by his coworkers designated victim of his bosses unhappy and disheartened family man married to an unbelievably ugly and dull wife and with a simian daughter he always seems to draw the shortest straw. No matter what he does and how hard he tries Lady Luck will always turn her back on him. Better if after having given him some hope.But mind you behind all the improbable situations and the overthetop comedy stuff the message is indeed deeper. Everything Fantozzi wishes for is the socalled Italian Dream after the economical boom of the late 50s every Italian dreamt about landing a good 9to5 job buying himself a house and a car living a nice and quiet family life with summer holidays plenty of hobbies etc. And should things have gone very well maybe a mistress too...Instead poor Fantozzi is stuck in a rut he has a secondrate version of all of that... And the more he tries to attain happiness the worse it ends.Clearly the comedy aspect is prominent and the movie is also enjoyable for its slapstick comedy for its sketches and for its caricatural portrait of Italian lowermiddleclass. But once the funny parts are an acquired taste you can see past it and the sadness of the characters appears offering a whole new dimension to the movie.In origin Fantozzi was a literary character created by Paolo Villaggio himself who'll star as Fantozzi in all the subsequent movies and on the written page the social criticism was much heavier. The cinematic version made the satire more enjoyable probably less sharp but for sure not less noticeable.In the end Fantozzi is a classic of Italian Comedy and has had a longlasting impact on Italian language comedy and society. Every single character quote and episode is well known in Italy and can easily be recycled in everyday's life even 35 odds years after its original creation.Had it been just another silly comedy it wouldn't had the same impact.The only real downside of the movie and of the whole saga is you have to watch it in Italian possibly understanding the language to a decent degree.

This movie is based on a book written by Paolo Villaggio himself Fantozzi main character in the movie. You can define it as the first movie of a new italian comedian style. It was the breakpoint of Villaggio's actorcareer. Today he's one of the most famous italian comedians a lot of people know Villaggio but everybody knows Fantozzi. The success of this movie is probably based on the fact that everybody can identify with Fantozzi. He's a normal worker has a happy family an awfullooking daughter some friends and he is into Signorina Silvani who works with him. You can compare Fantozzi to Al Bundy. Nothing works like he wants but at the end everything is alright. I don't know if the Fantozzimovies have been translated to English but if you have the chance to watch one of them don't miss it!!".

Snakehead like all Hong Kong villains is actually English so when he kidnaps a boy with the power to control The Medallion Yang follows him to Ireland to reclaim the Medallion and find the child who just goes to prove that even if you live in a Buddhist temple in a sewer below Hong Kong you can still learn to speak perfect English with an English accent.Seems like 'The Golden Child'? Why yes yes it does. Its a fun fantasy movie for kids but anyone wanting to watch an action movie should watch this up until a short cameo appearance by Sammo Hung and then turn it off very quickly. Now I'm not a fan of CGI action but I assumed that with Jackie Chan starring and Sammo Hung directing the action  two action masters  could still pull of some entertaining action scenes. Apparently not as 'The Medallion' is only marginally better than oh say 'Charlie's Angels 2'.Fun for kids but action fans should avoid entirely. I'm being generous when I give this 510.".

The result however is that the kid and Eddie falls in to the water trapped in a container. Eddie drowns but saves the boy and in return the boy later resurrects Eddie. Now Eddie with superpowers must stop Snakehead once and for all.Comments I thought they really had something going there. Started out nice. As I expected a lot of martial arts and fights all nicely choreographed and with augmented with extra aids like wires of course but still with a good feeling and some nice touches. The story was nothing fancy but they had found the balance in the fights. Just enough fancy kicks and jumps. Action director Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan were onto something here. Then came the superpowers. Then everything went just silly. The balance went right out the window along with Jackie ChanEddie Yang actually. Instead of nicely choreographed fights we get ridiculous fights with a lot of special effects. Net result Silly. And the story didn't get any better either.Jackie Chan delivers what is expected of him he does what he usually does. But I can't do anything but wonder why the character Arthur Watson is in the movie? To add some comic element apparently as that was needed. Watson is annoyingly clumsy petty and incompetent and has mysteriously risen to a high position within Interpol. Evans plays the part well I guess he does what is asked of him but again why is the character in the movie? Claire Forlani got the role of Nicole James agentlove interest of Eddie Yang. Though Nicole is much more competent than Watson she is clearly sidestepped both in the movie and with the virtual Interpol. Therefore her role is small her potential and talent not used her major part is as the one taking care of the kid Doh she's a woman  and this is a boring stereotype. She gets to show her skill in martial arts a few times though showing she or her stunt double  some shots make it easy to assume she has one got them. Her only major fight though is of course against the female bad guy to the sound of screeching cats... oh come on!.So the beginning was promising the second half disappointing. On average a 5.".

Each half gives superhuman strength to the user but you have to be dead first. If the halves are combined you get immortality. Now Chan and his gang of Interpol cops must keep the medallion and the user a kid away from the people who want to use the medallion for bad. Jackie Chan is very clever in this film. He acts well and adds a bit of comedy. Claire Forlani also did a great job. Lee Evans was soso. He can be a bit annoying. The special effects sucked. A rule of advice is never add CGI to a Jackie Chan movie. It will make that movie bad. What is the point of the cat meowing? It made the movie even worse.

When I saw the trailer for The Medallion it showed Jackie performing as usual plus the cgi crap. But I wanted to give it a chance.  A lot of film experts and other sources of information gave insight into the movie and it received a lot of promotion. I thought Jackie would return to his original style in this one considering his age. I'm going to look at two perspectives of film the pros and cons.PROS  There were two action scenes where Jackie doesn't do any wire martial arts nor requires cgi involvement during the first half of the movie. Given the fact that Jackie is reaching 50 he can still get down. The female lead was great. Claire Forlani exceeded my expectations of the female character and her acting wasn't really bad either. She gets to do some martial arts herself couldn't stand Jennifer Love Hewitt in The Tuxedo egh!!!. Lee Evans provides the comic relief along Jackie's martial arts and stunt work. I liked the way Hong Kong and American filmmakers collaborated to do the film. Look out for veteran Hong Kong actor Anthony Wong in a supporting role as the bad guy.CONS  The cgi incorporated into the film just didn't do it for me. Filmmakers can't use cgi for everything. I'm tired of seeing people running through trees and jumping over things that's not possible in reality. The plot in the film had to many holes and seemed to be rushed at times. Jackie's acting didn't seem to fair well including the chemistry between him and Claire. It seemed to dull. Julian Sands wasted his time in this film. Hope he takes this as a lesson learned. Bey Logan's writing skills needs a brush up before he can continue on in my opinion. I hope he doesn't utilize the same form in the upcoming movie Kung Fu Master. The mystical kid in the movie annoyed me too much and he only said two sentences throughout the whole movie. Repeating the Golden Child theme is just ridiculous.All in all the movie was alright. Compared to Jackie's recent American releases this better than The Tuxedo but less than Shanghai Knights. Jackie doesn't have to take every movie offer he can. Take a break and come back with the Police Story series or something. This is a type of movie that can only be seen once or twice if you want to consider your judgement about the movie.My final vote 610".

But after Jackie dies and comes back equipped with superpowers there are no more real fight scenes for him they are all special effects  enhanced and wired. From a pure martial arts perspective Claire Forlani's closequarters fights near the end are the best that the second half of this film has to offer more proof that Sammo Hung can make anyone look like a genuine martial artist!. The story is basically a rehash of Eddie Murphy's The Golden Child and it has a rushed feel to it it's probably no coincidence that the DVD contains about 15 deleted scenes. But the cast is likable Forlani is utterly lovely Julian Sands is ideally cast as the immortalityseeking villain and Jackie is always Jackie. The Medallion will probably disappoint most martial arts fans but those who like the main actors will definitely get some enjoyment out of it. ".

	schema:reviewBody "They had 35 million or so dollars to make this movie! If you've seen plenty of Hong Kong movies like I have you know they are able to stretch a dollar to incredible levels. So you might think that this would be the Hong Kong movie to rule over all others.Think again! The first and obvious mistake they made was having Jackie using wirework and other special effects. Huh? Did they somehow forget that Jackie made a name for himself by NOT using wirework and special effects? Plus you could see that he was taking real risks by not using that stuff so his antics were more thrilling and entertaining as a result. Also ANYONE could have easily done what Jackie did in this movie because of all the special effects work  so what was the point of hiring Jackie?Even with all the money and time put into these action sequences they are a mess. The editing gives us a different shot every millisecond or so making it hard to get a handle on the action. Also the camera was a lot closer to the action than in Jackie's other movies so much so that even seeing the movie in widescreen still makes it confusing at times. Look at Jackie's other movies  the camera stays back and the editing is kept to a minimum. We see everything of the action in those movies and the minimum editing prevents any breaks in building excitement.Speaking of editing the American editors did a TERRIBLE job altering it for North American audiences. The story makes no sense with even a lot of the minor details not being explained. For example the surprise revelation of Watson's wife. The DVD contains a number of  deleted scenes though watching them clears up very little of the confusion  in fact the deleted scenes just reveal new murky details that add MORE confusion! I suspect there were a number of other scenes cut that did explain things better but that were left out by Sony in perhaps embarrassing realization their American editors did a terrible job.But even with a story that would make no sense this would still be tough going not just with the mishandled action scenes but also because of the movie's incredibly bad sense of humor. Particularly with Lee Evans' character who is unbelievably annoying  at least the editors showed SOME sense by cutting out some of his painful scenes. So even if you have a regionfree DVD machine and are a diehard fan of Jackie I strongly suggest you don't even pick up the Asian DVD release of this movie when it comes out!".

	schema:reviewBody "Not only does Jackie Chan produce some of the best action sequences of the year he produced 'The Medallion' literally.  The result a modern kungfu movie that retains its eastern heritage.  This movie feels like one of Chan's early rereleases.  Those films produced for Asian markets and imported to the US Big Screen had the feel of a 70's Bruce Lee movie. The only thing keeping 'The Medallion' from fitting the mold of the past is a heavy injection of  'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' special effects.The movie starts out slow spending a great deal of time introducing characters and establishing backstory.  Some of the early scenes must have ended up on the cutting room floor because there is a very confusing abrupt jump to the future after the first sequence.  After regaining my senses I realized the scenes in early Hong Kong were overdubbed a very cool homage to the films that made Chan popular in this country.  The movie is lightly sprinkled with nearly disappointing action sequences until the power of the medallion is finally revealed.From that point on the movie is full throttle and works on every level. Mixed in with all the newfound action is a ridiculously silly plot incredible gags and for good measure a slap courtesy of Claire Forlani of romance.  After the backstory scenes ended and the action picked up I stopped caring that everything that followed completely defied logic. The film became so blatantly over the top that my suspension of disbelief circuits overloaded.  I just sat back and enjoyed the film for what it was one of Chan's best.The film knows its role.  It tries to be nothing more than the fun filled action romp it is.  It is great to see that Chan play the buddy role with actors other than Chris Tucker.  In this case he does it with three of them. Lee Evans steps up and is hilarious as the bundling Interpol agent Watson. The only disappointment is that we don't get more of an explanation of his home life you will understand this complaint after you see the film.I don't see how anyone could not like this film.  The advanced screening audience was very diverse and all applauded when it ended and again after the out takes like always they were hilarious.   I highly recommend it and will see it again when it opens nationwide.".

I am a Jackie Chan fanatic and I can always tell whether Jackie's Hong Kong produced movies get cut or not. THE MEDALLION was sure cut down to 89 minutes from its original 116 minutes Monkeypeaches.com. Like little bits and pieces which makes the movie feel short and you think to your self that I paid this much to watch this short of an action movie?I feel the fighting got cut short too. It would have been better to see the longer length of a fight scenes. I feel the action will be considered choreographed well if it was the full movie. Although I enjoyed this movie. It had some very funny stuff in it thanks to Lee Evan's antics. Jackie did an OK job but not his best. It also seems we see the other coactors Lee Evans and Claire Forlani pretty evenly seen throughout the movie with Jackie Chan. This movie was entertaining for everyone I was with in the theaters. Lots of crying and laughing. The children in the theaters liked it. If there wasn't sex jokes this movie could have been better for the whole family. I feel that you should try and wait until this movie comes out on VHS and DVD to rent and or own because this version of THE MEDALLION made the CUT and lots of bits and pieces of it.

So what is the point of having half the film devoted to boring CGI stuff with people flying around and disappearing in puffs of smoke and so on? And if you are going to hire a REAL genius like Lee Evans for your comic relief why not use him properly let him do his own thing instead of making him adopt a silly Isayoldboy accent and utter lamentable lines? It's a shame as Jackie Chan comes over very appealingly on screen he has a genuinely warm and affable screen presence. The romantic element is especially embarrassing.

	onyx:emotionText "What a dreadful movie. Even my children were bored. I thought the point of Jackie Chan was that he did his own stunts? Isn't that his main claim to fame? So what is the point of having half the film devoted to boring CGI stuff with people flying around and disappearing in puffs of smoke and so on? And if you are going to hire a REAL genius like Lee Evans for your comic relief why not use him properly let him do his own thing instead of making him adopt a silly Isayoldboy accent and utter lamentable lines? It's a shame as Jackie Chan comes over very appealingly on screen he has a genuinely warm and affable screen presence. The romantic element is especially embarrassing. The film looks as though it's been chopped about like chicken livers to end up with an incomprehensible plot of no interest whatsoever.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the movie it was a big disappointment. Actually I didn't have high hopes because I saw the director was Gordon Chan that said enough.  awful acting over the top funny scenes etc. However I was hoping for some old school HongKong style action since the stunt director was Sammo Hung and the movie was a HK production. But no no crazy falls or stunts and what's even worse Jacky always mentioned that he doesn't like SFX. But in this movie there are loads of SFX and the fighting is not good at all. The fights were shot in an american style. That means close ups and a flurry of fists and feet and lots of fast editing techniques. Without actually seeing the whole wide angle shot. No better give me the original Drunken Master and the Fearless Hyena. I know Jacky becomes older and older maybe it should be better to show some impressive fighting techniques instead of filling up the movie with meaningless brawls and SFX. Tip have a look at the end fights from Drunkenmaster and Drunkenmaster II and the Fearless Hyena endless fights but immensely entertaining. That's the REAL Jacky and the kind of kungfu action I started to love a long time ago. Please let me be the director next time I guess everyone could be a better director than Gordon Chan. Actually the same thing goes for Jet Lee if you ever saw the Shaolin Temple movie one of his first movies then you know this guy is extremely good in KungFu. However when making American movies things aren't looking so good anymore. Why do they need to shoot those movies in such a unrealistic spectacular way while keeping things simple helps to create a greater impact. Because you know it's a real kick or technique and not a unrealistic movement. That's why Bruce Lee became so famous. His kungfu was serious off and on screen. And that made an impact on the viewers. the fight against Chuck Norris for example Just one punch or kick can level an opponent. I know that Jacky wants to entertain and with good reason he is very good in that. But please do it in the old school way and not the i must fight like an western actor way. Don't get me wrong I am a big fan of Jacky but I just have some comments on his recent developments that I had to post here. The music was composed by someone called something like Adrian Lee it was on par with the movie that's means it was bad.Sorry Jacky next time better I hope. Do it your own way not their way. Also a note to Gordon Chan just make local HK movies and don't try to make Western movies. People don't buy it. Sorry.".

It looks like the original title of this movie was Highbinders probably a take off on Highlander since this movie deals with immortal supermen. Maybe it was supposed to be a comedic Highlander originally or something like Eddie Murphy's Golden Child. Perhaps they decided that Golden Child had already been done and it wasn't that successful so they edited this down heavily. In the deleted scenes we see that the Watson character played by Lee Evans is even more frantic than he is in this cut. Bordering on Inspector Clouseau even. It even looks like they originally had plans to make a sequel to this movie and even put a hook at the end of the movie to allow it to continue. But they decided against all that and made it much less likely to have a sequel. This movie is 90 minutes but if they had kept the original plot it may have gone 22.5 hours. I think they made the right decision to shorten down and reduce the complexity of this movie. It keeps your attention longer this way. However I wouldn't have minded seeing the more complex movie either.".

From the town Big shot the future Race car Driver the Perfect Couple and the local Nerd it is amazing how the audience identifies with all these characters from out past. Like a page out of the high school year book this movie jumps back into the early 60's before the war before the lines were drawn the age of innocence in America would soon be coming to an end.

Though this movie necessarily sidesteps the boredom inherent in growing up in the pesticidechoked San Joaquin Valley the place itself is not as important the time it explores.  It was a time just before the 1960s descended into the beginning of the end of American culturethe prototypical middle America that existed in almost all its small towns and now has substantively disappeared thanks to the urbanization and suburbanization of much of this country.

I and II.  Lucas simply has been at the Ranch too long and his brilliant career has arrived parked in the garage at a large entirely perfunctory business and media empire.Anyway regardless of Lucas' drift far away from the cutting edge American Graffiti still stands as a kind of monument to his precocity.  It is the kind of movie that hits every note with effortless precision which I think is less the effort of great editing as it is a combination of youthful exuberance and actors and a director at essentially the beginning of their ascent as some of the best in the business.  This movie also withstands the test of time simply because it works magically both for those who have no particular emotional connection to the '60s and for those who were there on nearly equal levels.  There is tremendous humor and naturalistic character play and dialog that few can help but be drawn into.  Anyone with any sense of history will acknowledge that all the characters are standing at the edge of the deflowering and selfdestruction of America in the '60s.  It is a time of tremendous innocence change and harrowing decisions.  The Bay of Pigs Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam haven't happened yet.  With Iraq and terrorism chewing at our consciousness every day it's pretty easy for modern youth to identify and yearn for the nostalgia of such innocence.".

	schema:reviewBody "As many people know George Lucas is most famous for the fact that he wrote a certain series of fantasy films. Most of those films certainly were a great achievement but one thing that many Star Wars fans overlook is the other entries in Lucas' list of directorial credits one of which is this film American Graffiti. The movie tells the story of the last night in town for a bunch of school kids about to leave to go to college. Now this might not seem like a great base for a classic movie to work from and it isn't it's the handling that makes it great. In spite of his latest batch of movies Lucas has shown with this movie that he has the talent to create an innovative and groundbreaking movie in spite of the plot. It's this fact that made Star Wars work so well and it's nice to see the same effort transplanted into an earlier film that doesn't have the special effects and grandiose that Star Wars had. The energy and vitality that Lucas gives his multiple stories makes for a great ride and American Graffiti is a lot of fun throughout.The film is most notable for the way that it captures the American youth of the sixties. It benefits from a great soundtrack that adequately helps to achieve this and includes the likes of Buddy Holly and The Beach Boys. The film takes place in one night and makes use of a number of different characters and story lines all of which are interesting and unique. A lot of which are also really funny and this is where my favourite part of American Graffiti comes in. The film works because it's such a good time and the way that Lucas shows us that ensures that we have just as good a time as the characters on screen are having. The events that befall the characters in the movie will no doubt touch a nerve with anyone that has gone through childhood  things such as splitting up with your girlfriend to being forced into doing things that could get you into trouble...all the way to asking an adult to go into a store to buy alcohol for you are shown with great care and show that Lucas obviously knew what he was doing when he took on this movie. On the whole...it's very good stuff indeed.".

Even the music played a part of innocence back in the 60's where artist such as Fats Domino Beach Boys Bill Haley and the Comets The Platters even Chuck Berry were a pain in the butt to most of the adults of that time but a joy. Now? Songs about sex drugs and murder have become the new waves to today's youth of America.American Graffiti has four teenage boys who cruise in different directions in their hometown where some question their own faith. The main character in the story is Curt Henderson Richard Dreyfuss who is about to leave east for college where he is dubious on whether or not he should leave town in order to start a new life.

Even the music played a part of innocence back in the 60's where artist such as Fats Domino Beach Boys Bill Haley and the Comets The Platters even Chuck Berry were a pain in the butt to most of the adults of that time but a joy. Now? Songs about sex drugs and murder have become the new waves to today's youth of America.American Graffiti has four teenage boys who cruise in different directions in their hometown where some question their own faith. The main character in the story is Curt Henderson Richard Dreyfuss who is about to leave east for college where he is dubious on whether or not he should leave town in order to start a new life. Yet his friend Steve Ron Howard encourages him to leave and tells him not to crawl back into his little nest.

All of the characters in this film have an imperviousness to the objections related to a perceived totalitarianism brought on in the sixties not just because the radical aspect of the decade has yet to be but also because locking horns with the authority figures is not second nature to them ...Even Big John Milner... The bevy of Radicalism which besieges our nation over the remainder of this decade the 1960's created a metamorphosis in social behavior that would change all Americans even the people living in the town of Graffit California!!!

Although back in the '70s we used the word nostalgia. The movie's soundtrack album which was nothing more than a compilation of 1950s and early 60s Top 40 hits generated massive sales figures across the globe and immediately triggered a flood of similar vinyl offerings from other record companies. Being the ripe old age of 13 in 1973 I totally lost interest in the music of the day and started to collect many of the aforementioned compilation albums.Again as others have correctly pointed out the initial retro scene was mainly confined to the musical side of things which included the establishment of Oldies radio stations. It wasn't long however before the general mood of nostalgia became more widespread with an increasing number of people becoming interested in other pop culture commodities of the era such as moviesTV shows cars and clothes.Pretty soon the whole thing exploded and the Good Old Days suddenly became big business. And why not? There's some fabulous entertainment to be found in the archives for those who care to look.Give me 'dem ole' time movies any day of the week! In fact when you look back I think we owe a debt of gratitude to George Lucas and the gang for giving us American Graffiti. It started a positive and enjoyable marketing trend which has brought a great deal of pleasure to millions over the years. And that's a pretty nice legacy for any movie to leave behind.".

It's a paeon to a longforgotten world that was the 1950s and features as its cast a bunch of high school students celebrating graduation with all of the angst that comes with it.Films like this tend to be pretty easy to like because the topics are universal and the situations are easy to identify with. Some of the themes covered here include machismo gang culture romance nostalgia and the everdifficult transition from childhood to adulthood. American Graffiti isn't exactly a worldchanging film but I found it likable enough and the cast including Richard Dreyfuss Ron Howard Charles Martin Smith and Harrison Ford in early roles are very good.One of the things I liked most about American Graffiti is the soundtrack. It's much better say than the original music in GREASE I love 1950s film and many classics are featured here. Occasionally and annoyingly the song gets cut off halfway through but nonetheless the soundtrack helps to make this film both likable and fun.".

Essentially following a group of teens around during one night in 1962 American Graffiti essentially paved the way for a lot of things.

Ronny Howard as Steve Bolander is ruining his last night with his girlfriend LaurieCindy Williams because he thinks that seeing other people while he is in college would strengthen their relationship.

	schema:reviewBody "There is some kind of story behind Typhoon or at least the making of this film. Academy Award nominations for Special Effects are not given out to films that only run slightly over 70 minutes. I have a feeling that this film was a lot more ambitious undertaking than what eventually arrived on the screen.There is a 10 minute prologue where young Norma Gene Nelson is cast adrift in a raging sea as her father Paul Harvey and first mate Jack Carson go down with his trading schooner in the South Seas. The young girl has seen the effects that alcoholism has done to her family as she drifts toward what she hopes is survival.Fast forward several years and Lynne Overman kind of shanghais an alcoholic Robert Preston who was cashiered from the Navy and now lives hand to mouth in those South Seas. Overman knows where there's a bed of oysters who give off with pearls as we know and he's thinking of striking it rich. But the native crew he has needs someone else to keep them in line. One of them J. Carrol Naish is a real sneaky one with his own agenda.In addition Overman got one of the native chiefs against him when he picked a fight in the saloon where Preston is drinking for the purpose of getting Preston into the battle. It works only too well.Overman has a surplus submarine from World War I and he's forced to put in on a deserted island. Not quite deserted because Dorothy Lamour is the grownup version of Norma Gene Nelson. She's grown up like Brooke Shields on the island without Christopher Atkins.

Let's say no one's explained the facts of life to Dottie but the girl has instincts.Overman Preston and Lamour and her pet chimpanzee have to face mutiny a forest fire and finally a Typhoon before this film is over. Quite a lot packed into a 72 minute running time. What's left a really silly film with state of the art special effects for their time. That does not compute so I know Paramount had much bigger plans for this film when it started out on the drawing board. It ends up really as a B picture. But Dottie in a sarong singing South Sea island songs from Tin Pan Alley is what the moviegoing public wanted.".

	onyx:emotionText "There is some kind of story behind Typhoon or at least the making of this film. Academy Award nominations for Special Effects are not given out to films that only run slightly over 70 minutes. I have a feeling that this film was a lot more ambitious undertaking than what eventually arrived on the screen.There is a 10 minute prologue where young Norma Gene Nelson is cast adrift in a raging sea as her father Paul Harvey and first mate Jack Carson go down with his trading schooner in the South Seas. The young girl has seen the effects that alcoholism has done to her family as she drifts toward what she hopes is survival.Fast forward several years and Lynne Overman kind of shanghais an alcoholic Robert Preston who was cashiered from the Navy and now lives hand to mouth in those South Seas. Overman knows where there's a bed of oysters who give off with pearls as we know and he's thinking of striking it rich. But the native crew he has needs someone else to keep them in line. One of them J. Carrol Naish is a real sneaky one with his own agenda.In addition Overman got one of the native chiefs against him when he picked a fight in the saloon where Preston is drinking for the purpose of getting Preston into the battle. It works only too well.Overman has a surplus submarine from World War I and he's forced to put in on a deserted island. Not quite deserted because Dorothy Lamour is the grownup version of Norma Gene Nelson. She's grown up like Brooke Shields on the island without Christopher Atkins. Preston got separated from the rest and she finds him. Let's say no one's explained the facts of life to Dottie but the girl has instincts.Overman Preston and Lamour and her pet chimpanzee have to face mutiny a forest fire and finally a Typhoon before this film is over.

	schema:reviewBody "It's ironic that over the credits a tornado is seen over an account exotic setting as the titles appear. But that's a minor detail in a delightful adventure up there with the dozen or so sarong films starring Miss Dorothy Lamour. It's her and a cute chimp named Coco on a deserted island and it's up to the audience to be smart enough to realize that it was her character in the opening scene as a little girl facing a tropical storm as the ship her father captains prepares to go down thanks to a nasty typhoon. She makes her home all alone that is until shanghaied sailor Robert Preston and the creeps who knocked it out show up. How Lamour managed to survive a decade with just Coco to help her is too bizarre to try to comprehend so all you can do is take it all in and accept it.This colorful adventure is typical cheezy fun with Preston wearing nothing but a sarong made into tight shorts and looking pretty sexy as well as gifted. If the idea of the music man striving to be Tarzan for an hour seems amusing this will be fun viewing. Lynne Overman is a comical villain as the shangaiing skipper and J. Carroll Naish speaks with a hysterically bad Polynesian accent. Coco makes it clear why little kids of every generation wanted a chimp as a pet. MGM kept the Tarzan series in black and white but Paramount realized the benefit of putting Dorothy Lamour in color. The one common quality they have is camp and this one has a ton of it.".

They lend greater power to the words and emotions that are expressed. The dignity of the characters as they struggle with life is moving. Ozu is a masterof world cinema because he deals with themes of universal import and he does so with impeccable style. Especially noteworthy in this film is his effective use of music and sound.

While other directors were busy shamelessly masturbating the emotions of their audience with forced dialogue contrived plots and unbelievable amounts of glamorous cheese Ozu's films by comparison would be seen by many people as anticlimactic and boring. Yet never in his career did he make a poor film and mediocrities are few and far between most of which are lost in his silent work. Indeed even though 'The Only Son' was Ozu's first sound picture he had been working in film for many years before this production. What we see in this early film is the work of a director already confident with the medium in which he worked and the result is an understated dignified delight.It seems wrong to give a plot summary as the story itself is of little consequence. Ozu was one of the few directors who managed to master the art of transcending the confines of plot and escape to the much wider universe in which emotional honesty and character all come into their own.Some may be wondering what I am talking about considering that Ozu always seemed to focus on family relationships. There are many who would argue that in actual fact he never really experimented at all and limited himself to this one subject.But what a fascinating subject it can be. Ozu with graceful skill and extreme talent managed to explore human existence more completely than any director before or since all with a largely stationary camera disclosing to the viewer immaculately ordered shots and often placed at the eye level of a person seated on a tatami mat.In this film a mother working at a silk mill in rural Japan decides to send her son to secondary school in the hope that he will be able to escape his poor heritage and make something of himself in Tokyo. Sounds underwhelming and clichd enough doesn't it? But forget about that. As always with Ozu it is his humanity the nuances of the performances and the beautiful dignity and sympathetic nature of his direction that makes the film worth watching. His films tap into emotional realms that others can only make pathetic superficial attempts at penetrating and for that and that alone his films should be treasured. This is no exception and it is the perfect starting point to first time viewers of Ozu's work.PS  As it is no exception mind you have some Kleenex at the ready. Tears tend to run freely down the cheeks of the most hardened critics during these excursions into Ozu's Japan.And for Ozu fans this also stars Chishu Ryu Ozu's favourite actor in a minor role as the young boy's primary school teacher.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another interesting film from the Japanese director Yasujir Ozu. While he was extremely masterful at telling stories about ordinary peopleoften in a conflict between the modern and traditional worlds. Many consider him to be an extraordinary genius though I also felt that perhaps he was locked into an inflexible pattern that persisted through his film. The Ozu style meant a camera that did not budge and was usually set near floor level. This means that when the characters moved the camera cut to a new frameit did not follow them. And the stories though marvelous were very very similar. In fact I would say that Ozu's films are the most consistent in theme and style of any director I can think ofand I've reviewed a ton of films. Because of this the movies often tend to blend together in your mind. In light of all this I liked The Only Son because it was a bit different. While its style and camerawork were pure Ozu the story was a bit different. Most of his stories seemed to either be about the elderly and alienation or about marriage this one is a bit differentthough it's still a very personal story of ordinary folks.The film begins in rural Japan. A young boy desperately wants to continue his education beyond primary school but his mother is a poor widow. Yet she is determined to work her butt off and send him to a good school in Tokyothereby guarateeing him a great future.Years pass. The boy is now a man with a wife and baby. He is a school teacher and is quite embarrassed when his mother comes to the big city to see him after many years. Why is he embarrassed? He thinks that his job as a teacher is lowly and he should have achieved more with his life. Whether or not his mother agrees with this is never 100 certainbut what eventually does become certain is that she does not respect him because he sees himself as a failure and is too accepting of this. What happens next provides a nice look into what it really means to be a success.Overall an exceptionally good Ozu film. It's a bit different in tone than his later films of the 50s and early 60s and makes for nice viewingeven if you feel you've seen too many similar Ozu films. Well worth seeingwith the typical fine acting and direction you'd expect. The only serious negative and you cannot blame the filmmakers for this is that the print is pretty bad starting about one hour into the movie.".

In fact I would say that Ozu's films are the most consistent in theme and style of any director I can think ofand I've reviewed a ton of films. Because of this the movies often tend to blend together in your mind. In light of all this I liked The Only Son because it was a bit different. While its style and camerawork were pure Ozu the story was a bit different. Most of his stories seemed to either be about the elderly and alienation or about marriage this one is a bit differentthough it's still a very personal story of ordinary folks.The film begins in rural Japan. A young boy desperately wants to continue his education beyond primary school but his mother is a poor widow. Yet she is determined to work her butt off and send him to a good school in Tokyothereby guarateeing him a great future.Years pass. The boy is now a man with a wife and baby. He is a school teacher and is quite embarrassed when his mother comes to the big city to see him after many years. Why is he embarrassed? He thinks that his job as a teacher is lowly and he should have achieved more with his life. Whether or not his mother agrees with this is never 100 certainbut what eventually does become certain is that she does not respect him because he sees himself as a failure and is too accepting of this. What happens next provides a nice look into what it really means to be a success.Overall an exceptionally good Ozu film. It's a bit different in tone than his later films of the 50s and early 60s and makes for nice viewingeven if you feel you've seen too many similar Ozu films. Well worth seeingwith the typical fine acting and direction you'd expect. The only serious negative and you cannot blame the filmmakers for this is that the print is pretty bad starting about one hour into the movie.";

Many years later we follow her journey to visit that son in Tokyo. He hasn't kept in contact very well. His mother doesn't even know about his wife and infant son nor that he is a grade school teacher a rather low and lowpaid position. Simply put he's embarrassed at the little he has accomplished and he thinks his mother will be gravely disappointed that she went to so much trouble to educate him. The whole situation really hit home and I was deeply moved by it. The film also features incredible cinematography and editing.".

A widow attempts to save enough money for her son to go to college in Tokyo. She visits him years later only to discover that he is not living the kind of sophisticated welloff life she believed he would lead as a result of a college degree. What Ozu does with these characters is astonishing he shows them in the most serene and simple of situations and settings yet uses his unique directing style to elicit subtle feelings and thoughts simmering just below the surface. What this seems to suggest is Ozu's feelings regarding Japan in the 1930s a tumultuous period in which the age of modernization seemed to be waning and Japanese society continued to be pressured into a militaristic hegemony. Clearly Ozu resisted these transitions and his best offense was the films he made. The result is a quiet gentle yet intense story about simple people wishing their lives or the lives of their children were better than they are. Through this Ozu seems to reflect on the failure of Japanese innovation up to that point and the uncertainty of what the future might bring. Fortunately for the viewer his specific style and insight remain as coherent and profound as ever.".

More than that I've found this movie way more moving and sorrowful than most of his best work most of Ozu's work is about dealing with disappointment and the sad aspects of life in a society of failed expectations... And this one does it in such a clear sad beautiful way.More magnificent than its theme or the director's eye the performances are brilliant specially the mother's that it should be considered one of all time's best. Chko Iida goes from a hardworking selfless mother to a grieving desperate one. This is the story about a woman who sacrifices her life for her son's studies only to find out he's not happy or fulfilled with his career. One of the most poignant and heartbreaking takes I've seen on screen and owns it pretty much to Iida's extraordinary performance. Immediately became a fan of this lady.

It's natural subdued. Whatever antonym to obtrusive you may come up with likely describes it. But that's what Ozu is all about things happen below the surface reticently on all levels  characters' complex emotions have to be decoded from their smiles the visual intricacies aren't revealed in the movement of the camera instead it's the positioning of the thing that makes us go there into that space and notice things.I saw Vigo's whole oeuvre again with a friend a few days ago the four films during one evening. Especially L'Atalante 1934 struck me again as the most amazing film hardly anything happens and what happens is almost trivialized in comparison to the mood of the thing the visual atmosphere that has been set up and how the camera moves in that environment. Ozu is so similar albeit setting up his eye radically differently. No matter that the camera hardly moves it's the same kind of strong visual thinking throughout. Ozu doesn't have similar paroxysms of emotion but the poetry is there in how nothing seems to happen while everything is happening.".

I was mildly intrigued by descriptions of the story I had read and with the trailer so I thought to take a chance. I took someone very close to me an actual violin prodigy. Coincidently her and I have recently been searching for a decent violin for her that is affordable by actual humans so we could relate to parts of the plot firsthand. We arrived to a very thin theater in one of those megacomplex theaters and while everyone was queuing up nextdoor to see the latest blockbuster from Hollywood I settled into an amazingly comfortable seat with an excellent view and prepared for whatever might come.I was shocked. This film turned out to be clearly one of the best movie going experiences I have had in ages. We see this as the story unfolds and is creatively told through the reading of the violin makers wife's fortune with a deck of Tarot cards. It is the story of a part of the life of a violin of the humans who would dare to possess her beauty. A masterpiece of a craftsman's art it is desired by many for it's acoustic perfection. But as Tolstoy said how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness. Or more interestingly from Saint Augustine Beauty is indeed a good gift of God but that the good may not think it a great good God dispenses it even to the wicked. There seems to be a curse on this instrument as it brings ill to those who manage to possess it. This makes the ending especially eerie.An original imaginative and thought provoking story that engaged one's mind as American films almost never do. I will not describe more of the plot it's far too good to ruin. The memory of this film will be one long treasured.Oh as for my guest the honesttoGod prodigy she said the music was magnificent it was even though a real musician could tell the actors weren't playing it was well done.".

While this guy is also a member of the Academy and has steered me to some pretty good picks in the past I walked into the theater fearing the usual letdown that invariably follows going into a film with overly high expectations i.e. The English Patient The Truman Show etc. This film not only managed to exceed my expectations it restored my faith in the magic and mystery of cinema altogether.We start with a rather simple but cleverly structured story about a very unique red violin that emblematically and quite literally for that matter takes on the heart and fate of a 16th century Italian woman as it passes across several centuries and continents on its way to the auction block in present day Montreal.  The unfolding vignettes reveal more and more about the nature of this instrument and when strung together in the bigger picture play out like finely orchestrated movements of a great sonata each movement plucking out its own stirring and poignant variation on theme.  I was so swept up in the majesty and spectacle of this film that it didn't even occur to me until much later that the violin is nothing less than a personification of beauty itself okay okay maybe I'm starting to overly deconstruct things here in retrospect but the parallels are too perfect to remain unexplored. It's fascinating to watch both the transformative and destructive power of this beauty as it's placed into the hands of a sensitive young boy a self absorbed musical protege and a remorseful ring leader of a totalitarian regime.  Much praise goes to director Francois Girard in how he refrained from overplaying the social and moral commentary repeating this theme at mostly an emotional level rather than an intellectual one  much in the same way that beauty itself to some degree anyway defies analytical discussion and belongs in the realm of pure and simple experience.  You obviously can't dissect it as cowriter Don McKellars onscreen character thought to do and so it remains as it was in it's original form timeless magical elusive.  The stuff that pompous nobility and rich collectors the world over will offer a king's ransom for and still never manage to posses in the end.Performances were good to great all around.  It's hard to go wrong with Samuel L. Jackson in a leading role and I appreciated the fact that the actors actually appeared to be playing the violin on camera as opposed to watching the typical hokey cutaways and cheat shots often associated with onscreen musical performances nauseating contrivances that always tear down the wall of suspended disbelief with a resounding crash. The costuming set design and cinematography were absolutely stunning Oscar nominations soon to follow I'm sure without taking center stage from the story. I especially loved the amazing period recreations of China and Austria.  I felt like I was fully transported in both space and time to these places and walking among people who really belonged there.Overall I would rate this one as a true film classic on the level of masterpiece. Perhaps this is in part due to my love for music and the undeniable fact that being the sentimental guy that I am I'm always a sucker for haunting openended films like this where you leave the theater in a half daze pondering all the implications mesmerized by the lingering imagery. I'm still speculating about the future of Mr. Moritz and what will ultimately happen when beauty is placed into the hands of our modern world.".

S.L.Jackson acts at his best his performance is unforgettable and I am sure one of his own most favourite I can tell.

Now that's a shame but you know what I don't care what the Academy has to say important is my subjective feeling and this movie made my day and days to come.I couldn't wait to get hold of both the video and the sound track and I never seem to get tired watching or hearing that beauty all over again. And believe it or not that ingenious soundtrack can be so erotic at times that if I may give a little advice to all these men out there seeking to entice and seduce their partners  hey this might be the way to go  worked for me and her!!!!Anyways I'd like to recommend this movie to everybody with an open heart and mind I guarantee satisfaction and enrichment in every possible way.

The story follows a red violin an inanimate object although at times it seemed alive to me thru three centuries and the influences good and ill that it has on its possessors.

The writing which includes this parallel between the violin and its possessor  five somewhat independent segments that mell and converge in the final scenes and a story told by tarot cards make for an extremely unique experience.  Add to that the musical score scenery the varied languages and cultures and you have a great offering. The performances were all strong but I thought Jason Flemyng as Lord Frederick Pope stood out.  To say his character was eccentric and maybe a little over the top is justifiable but I'm sure that was intended.  English nobility has always been known for its idiosyncrasies.  The ending has incongruous feel with     the remainder of the film but is satisfactory and I can not suggest a better one.  Great entertainment!  Three and a half stars!!!".

That socalled incrowd believes that every movie that hasn't been made by a big studio is great art and that all other movies are bad. Never tell them that sometimes the opposite can be true because they can't and won't believe you. Well I'm not one of them and I watch all movies with a critical eye. And yes I try to see as many of those alternative movies as well. But that's just because I'm a movie buff who is interested in all kinds of movies not because I'm convinced that this kind of movies is automatically a lot better than the rest. In this movie we don't follow some people but a violin on its journey through time and the world. The movie starts in present day Montreal where the red violin a famous Nicolo Bussotti violin is being auctioned off. But instead of staying with the auction all the time we flash back to the creation of the violin in 17th century Italy and then follow it as it makes its way through an 18th century Austrian monasteryorphanage a violinist in 19th century Oxford and China during Mao's Cultural Revolution... Each time it brings the person who owns it a lot of fame but also bad luck and despair often resulting in the death of the owner or someone the owner really loves...What I appreciated in this movie is that it wasn't just an ordinary drama or thriller. It actually tried to be original and it succeeded very well. Another thing that I also really liked was the fact that not every detail of the movie was clear until the end for instance why the fortune teller's predictions come true but not for the woman but for the violin instead.. It sometimes seems that the creators of movies don't even bother about adding some mystery in their movies anymore and I really miss that. That's probably why I liked it so much in this one.Once in a while you come across a movie that you might call a gem. Well The Red Violin is one of those truly magnificent gems. It's beautiful in every possible way. The music is excellent although you better love violin music because that's all you'll here the acting is very nice and the story really is very beautiful. I guess I could talk for hours about this movie but it's better to watch it than to read about it so I'll end my review by saying that this is a wonderful and very musical movie that doesn't deserve any less than an 8.510.".

The segments follow a violin for 3 centuries obviously shooting for a wide range of settings thus a wide range of stories and characters. But they are all much different. The Red Violin will be rewarding for those who pay attention and a pain for those who don't because the transaction of the violin from person to person isn't smooth whoever is not willing to pay attention should steer clear. I definitely recommend it to all big movie buffs because those willing to see it should. I really enjoyed Don Mcellars work before and this is no different. Some segments like 'Vienna' are very enjoyable and sad in a good way like bambi's mom getting shot well some like 'Oxford' are dark and depressing. You may not leave thinking it's spectacular but ya gotta respect it. Thumbs up.".

First there is the small violin shop where it is made and the tragedy around this particular model the maker's last. It's supposed to come from the same era as the Strad and other timeless fiddles. It's a great place to begin a story filled with mysteries and the mystery of a great violin it's shape wood and varnish is given high tech reinforcement in the end with an electronic awe. So the violin is born.And it moves from a Austrian orphanage with an unbelievable prodigy to generations of gypsies some interesting filming with the violin suspended in space as one after another player takes it up to a crackpot British prodigy who acts more like a rock star and an indulgent one if that's not redundant. Finally it winds its way not so improbably because life is weird to China which of course echoes the modern rise of the Asian virtuosi coming from that part of the world.So the tale is the history of a violin a possessed one. The spirit of the instrument seems to inhabit the movie. This is reinforced by an Italian fortuneteller a kindly witch who has an early Tarot deck. The Tarot was not used for divination that earlyit was introduced a card game in Northern Italy in the late 1400sbut that's okay because it works into the plot really well. Five cards are chosen by the pregnant wife of the master violin maker. Each is turned over for another twenty minute chapter in the movie. In a key moment the wife asks the fortune teller what if I don't like what it says what if it's evil? And the fortune teller says I'll pretend not to notice. Promptly the moon is the first card the most ominous card in the deck I've studied tarot a bit which is why weirdly enough I watched the movie. But the fortune teller doesn't say that doom is facing the pregnant wife. Instead she lies and the movie takes one turn after another.You might think this is brilliant stuff and it has the trappings of that. It could have been with some slight twist of intentions artfully transcendent. But it's a hair long at times and by the last modern scenes a bit cold and unfulfilling. I don't know the solution to what might have worked but I know it left me interested and curious by the end not quite bowled over which is clearly on the sleeve the intention.Still an engaging musically rich tapestry of great scenes great music and a brimming story. Recommended with slight reservations.".

I found the writing horribly trite especially in the segment of the movie set in England. The dialogue between Pope and his lover was laughable.  In fact my friend an Englishwoman herself did laugh.  Samuel L. Jackson capped off a poor movie with a poor performance in the final segment of the film.  Then again maybe it wasn't his acting so much as poor writing.  I simply didn't care about him or his scheme.  The only redeeming aspect of the movie was the segment which centered around Kaspar Weiss.  The writing was much better in that segment partly because Kaspar rarely talked. In the whole film Kaspar was the only character I cared about.  If you're looking for a film that progresses through several separate stories check out A Night on Earth.".

Anyone who is a fan of great film and not just the mainstream mega blockbuster more cgi than story will love this movie. The fact that the movie is based on the violin rather than the people which isn't a new idea is what makes this film great because it shows that objects in our lives have stories all their own. I also loved this movie because I'm a huge Samuel L. Jackson fan and this is one of his best roles to date other than Pulp Fiction of course because I didn't know if I was supposed to like him or not until the very end. I also liked the twist involved with the origin of the violin's color because it was totally unexpected. Bottom line this movie was great and one of the best of the year.P.S.  If you liked this try Twenty Bucks with Steve Buscemi Christopher Lloyd Brenden Fraser and Elizabeth Shue. It uses the same idea of an object passing from person to person but in a span of a couple of days not centuries.".

	schema:reviewBody "Visconti's credit as director of this short documentary is a misstatement. There isn't a trace of Visconti's elaborate artistry here and he's obviously not directing anything what we see are makingofish images of Visconti looking grave tired and slightly bored as he travels around Europe Munich Budapest Warsaw Venice Helsinki and Stockholm with a small crew in the winter of 1970 looking for a 12yearold boy to play the emblematic role of Tadzio in his adaptation of Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice. Visually unpolished to put it nicely Alla Ricerca di Tadzio plays like a TV newsreel with a voiceover commentary full of grandiloquent remarks on Visconti's oeuvre and excerpts of Mann's physical description of Tadzio. The commentary is at odds with the images the pompous words don't match the improvised auditions in small hotel rooms with selfconscious inexperienced young boys most of them bluntly dismissed by Visconti with a grunt a few of them earning compliments like hmm yes pretty face. Especially ludicrous is Visconti's disappointment with Polish boys remember Tadzio was Polish in the novella  and in real life. Unable to find in Warsaw the GreekNordic living statue he is searching for  described by Mann as the 12yearold owner of graceful body golden hair framing a noble head with blue eyes straight nose majestic presence a sort of preteen reincarnation of Antinous  he blames the demise of Polish aristocracy through successive periods of war in Poland for the rather proletarian appearance of the young Poles a VERY politicallyincorrect comment by that walking paradox Visconti a Marxist aristocrat!Visconti's insistence on a Tadzio that would perfectly match Mann's description seems rather obnoxious if he took significant liberties with Gustav von Aschenbach and the novella itself not only by making Aschenbach a composer instead of writer but also by borrowing passages and characters from Doktor Faustus especially Carole Andr's Esmeralda why was he so particular about Tadzio's physique?Well it turned out he couldn't be THAT particular after all because in a Stockholm hotel suite a miracle happens enter Bjrn Andrsen for an audition and it's like the midnight sun broke into the chilly room. Unmistakably Scandinavian in his perfect blond beauty chiseled features long limbs and gazellelike grace he's older than Tadzio by two or three years taller than expected and hasn't REMOTELY got a MittelEuropean physique. Yet his audition is nothing short of spectacular he faces  well nearly melts  the camera with such bold precocious sexiness and complete selfconfidence you can feel the room temperature rise he's a natural born to be stared at. Visconti realizes he's got something extraordinary and orders him to take off his shirt it was the 70s folks. Bjrn reacts with an incredulous expression as in did I hear right? only to sportingly acquiesce a few moments later with a knockout smile. Even if Bjrn seems alarmingly aware there's something obviously wrong in being photographed by middleaged men in midwinter in a hotel room wearing nothing but briefs his spontaneous fantastic appeal shines through entirely  it's all there he IS the perfect Tadzio even before Visconti's direction. The rest is movie history.In 2005 Bjrn Andresen turned 50 oh time time... and gave a few interviews  you know the sadistic game of the press let's see how old and used up he looks now!!. And so he complained how he felt abused by Visconti who took him to gay bars and parties to publicize him exposing him to the gay scene when he was barely 15 turning him into a gay icon overnight which made Andrsen  a heterosexual teenager  understandably confused and rebellious. Furthermore he states that Visconti never again employed him as an actor or helped him get acting jobs. Feeling traumatized by the whole experience Bjrn went on to make a few minor Swedish movies got married faced the tragic death of his baby child by Sudden Infant Death Syndrome experimented with drugs and alcohol is now out of work as an actor and trying to make a living as a piano player...in other words a troubled life of unfulfilled promises. His face doesn't bear a single trace left of his former beauty he now looks haggard prematurely wasted deeply wrinkled completely unrecognizable. But despite the fact the he wasn't the Tadzio Visconti originally had in mind was Visconti looking for a 12yearold Helmut Berger? Bjrn Andresen will forever be  for better or worse  the one and only embodiment of Tadzio for all of us moviegoers. More than that since the opening of Death in Venice in 1971 it has become impossible to read the novella and not think of Andrsen as THE incarnation of perfect pubescent male beauty haunting Thomas Mann's alterego Gustav von Aschenbach.Alla Ricerca di Tadzio ends with a commentary that is objectionable and disrespectful  and scary. The narrator declares in a bombastic tone Visconti has found at last his Tadzio in Bjrn Andrsen. But why should we still call him Bjrn? From this moment on he is simply Tadzio and that's that   TADZIO E BASTA!. If you see this documentary today you'll feel chills up your spine when you hear that last remark that turned out to be a prophecy  and a curse.".

They slowly begin to lose that veneer of civilization that they though only they possessed the same patina these embattled locals once had but lost long ago. The director based many of the stories on actual events as told to him by Spanish soldiers returning from the region. It is filmed in a very gripping and heavy way  drawing you into it all along with the lost soldiers. It drew great acclaim at the Toronto International Film Festival 2002. For those who followed or survived the events of the last decade in the Balkans it is a stark and honest portrayal that will leave many rethinking the versions they may have formulated in their own minds reading newspapers and watching TV comfortable in their own very civilized and very insular homes".

	schema:reviewBody "This war film packs adventures  largescale blowup  thrilling plot  and lots of action for the most part  but also contains thoughtprovoking issues about courage and cowardice . The conflict between Servia and Kosovo serves as thrilling backdrop for this Wartime picture . It's a good mix of actionpacked  adventure  thriller and warfare genre . The tragic story of a platoon of Spanish soldiers in Kosovo 2000  at the beginning they are rebuilding a Church  restoring electricity and helping villagers . The platoon is formed by Eloy Azorn as Soldado Vidal  Carla Prez as Soldado Balbuena  Roger Casamajor as Soldado Lucas and Jordi Vilches as Cabo 1 Ballesteros  all of them commanded by an unexperienced Teniente Alonso played by Eduardo Noriega and a tough Sargento Rubio performed by Rubn Ochandiano . Later on  they are assigned a mission in the hell of the Kosovo war . On rout their destination  the bunch is ambushed by Kosovar soldiers and their military vehicle Oruga sinks into a river .

Every movie that describes history in a wrong way is to be judged. I have seen the movie out of curiosity but this production is far far away from qualitative movie. My tip for directors is before you shoot a movie analyze the culture of the people first... On the other hand KFOR soldiers were not positioned in mountains and rural areas of Kosovo they were positioned in towns villages and populated areas. Serb soldiers have fled Kosovo one week after KFOR troops marched. If you make a movie just to show the action then don't use someone else suffering to create so called art but create a fiction story don't mess with people feelings or on the other hand gather facts and then create a realistic movie what has happened... but it looks like Spanish troops in Kosovo were partying more than others and have done a movie just to show how brave they are.... pity shame for world cinematography... Spain is not for action I say stick with Almodavar".

The other characters  and their actors I've already forgotten ten minutes after it's finished. They might as well been office furniture for all their presence and acting.The script is obvious and rather boring as we now know all about Plutonium  it has no excitement value whatsoever. The movie seemed to have the budget of a TV pilot 'special'  it's so obviously struggling that it's rather embarrassing. The direction too is particularly feeble without any panache or style whatsoever.I've been generous with my 310. It's not going to be too awful for those that might buy the DVD if they have a good idea of what sort of movie they're getting but for most Hot Potato is a waste of time and effort. And yes I do enjoy and own many of the old genuine 60's films on DVD  Too Many Crooks for example  brilliant! Buy that instead!".

	onyx:emotionText "The premise for this socalled 60's style Brit caper sounded intriguing...except that only Ray Winstone has any sort of character or charisma.Where the likes of Terry Thomas and Peter Sellers had oodles of fizz and bang and entertained us when the script was a dud this is just a dud all round. The other characters  and their actors I've already forgotten ten minutes after it's finished. They might as well been office furniture for all their presence and acting.The script is obvious and rather boring as we now know all about Plutonium  it has no excitement value whatsoever. The movie seemed to have the budget of a TV pilot 'special'  it's so obviously struggling that it's rather embarrassing. The direction too is particularly feeble without any panache or style whatsoever.I've been generous with my 310. It's not going to be too awful for those that might buy the DVD if they have a good idea of what sort of movie they're getting but for most Hot Potato is a waste of time and effort. And yes I do enjoy and own many of the old genuine 60's films on DVD  Too Many Crooks for example  brilliant! Buy that instead!";

Not the usual role for Ray Winstone but nevertheless a winning performance as Kenny. Jack Huston played a very convincing but not very worldly Danny and David Harewood was brilliant as the FBi agent who seemed to be able to appear through walls.Great twist to the end of the film The European locations were very colourful and gave a greater depth to the movie. I particularly liked the old cars used and the car chase was wicked. All in all a great film for the family no bad language no excessive violence just a real good feel factor film.

Selfparodying at times the film also recalls the Carry On films and sixties classics like Alfie and The Ipcress File especially in the music  though The Ipcess File is much darker obviously.

	schema:reviewBody "In midAugust many an unknowing filmi buff was psychologically impaled in the cinema halls during screenings of Karan Johar's hopelessly awful Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna which purported to be a mature examination of extramarital affairs. It was of course nothing of the sort and despite raking in the moolah it has found little favor with fans or critics.About a month later a comparatively small budget film Onir's Bas Ek Pal reminiscent of experimental European cinema released dealing with a similar theme but without any of the reigning puerility and adolescent conventionality which made Johar's film so utterly absurd. Instead Onir infuses his film with a complex morality and a matrix of thoroughly realistic characters where there are no heroes and no villains no glamorized damsels and no bitchy mistresses. It is also impossible to say who is opposite whom there are no pairs as one is universally accustomed to seeing in Indian films. A brief recap of the premise will explain why The story begins with the reunion of two friends Nikhil Sanjay Suri and Rahul Jimmy Shergill. Nikhil becomes acquainted with Steve Rehaan Engineer a friend of Rahul's who is also an abusive alcoholic. Steve is married to Ira Malhotra a former beauty queen turned humanitarian Juhi Chawla who has suffered a miscarriage physical battery and a failed marriage. Nikhil becomes infatuated with a young engineer named Anamika Urmila Matondkar whounfortunately for himis attached to a trust fund named Rehan. At their second meeting Nikhil and Rehan scuffle over Anamika and in the midst of their battle Rahul is shot resulting in paralysis. Nikhil faces prison for three years which actually turns out to be the least of his troubles. During those three years Anamika becomes romantically linked with Rahul who it turns out had a longstanding affair with Ira who was tired of her pathetic husband's emotional and physical torture. Ira helps free Nikhil whom Steve suspects of having an affair with his wife. Rahul also accuses Anamika of rekindling her affair with Nikhil. Ira compels Anamika toward Nikhil in her final attempt at escape. Confused? You should be because like real life it's complex and disturbing and there are no designer outfits or grandiose dance numbers to numb the pain of the tragedy which unfolds around these five lives. Betrayal turns to Obsession Helplessness to Hopelessness and Attraction to Rape in this brilliantly constructed and acted film.Though the film's title purports it to be about how one incident transforms the lives of all those involved its final implications are of much more ubiquitous themes it is basically a filmed series of unending horrors and disappointments which shows life in its most bitter and grotesque form. There is also a shocking twist at the end which makes the film really work. It is a true Greek tragedy which should give you little doubt as to how it ends but there is more than general catastrophe there is murder suicide betrayal abuse deceit infidelity jealousy selfhatred enmity violence and whole host of depravities which are too many to be named here. On top of it all there's a rape which victimizes neither Ira nor Anamika but one of the male leads. Oh and the film also takes time to explore the realities of forced oral sex. Suffice is to say treacly Hum Aapke Hain Kaun this film ain't.Onir's tactfully written screenplay aside the real mainstay of the film is its performances turned in by a fine cadre of actors led by the peerless Juhi Chawla. She is simply outstanding in a role which makes one sit up and notice the currents of strength and despair in Ira which Juhi expertly etches in Ira's eyes and movements. This is not a character one expects to find in Juhi Chawla's repertoire Ira is bold selfloathing and desperate for affection which drives her into an affair with Rahul which is both emotionally and sexually satisfying. And yes she does something truly shocking at the end. But Ira is also something of a mystery whose acquaintance with happiness proves too short. Anamika conversely is easy to read though her lucidity does not translate to simplicity. Matondkar portrays her as the eternal romantic albeit a somewhat helpless one who frequently cannot tolerate her own circumstances. Less fiery and more vulnerable than her usual characters Matondkar plays her flawlessly as a little girl with adult ambitions. Love Success and SelfActualization are her goals but she becomes ensnared in a bizarre and almost inexplicable love for Nikhil. One expects Nikhil to be the centerpiece of the film but he turns out to be much more of a cipher than the others. Suri is always at the center of Onir's films but in this collaboration he gets a more supportive role which he carries effortlessly by turns suave angry and desperate. Jimmy Shergill is the surprise packet of the film one expects great performances from Juhi Chawla and Urmila Matondkar but the Shergill proves he can match their talents with a brooding and intense portrayal of Rahul. In many ways he is the character at the center of the film. Rehaan Engineer is somewhat of a mixed bag his delivery teeters between odd and satisfactory the main problem being his menace is somewhat flat and benign. In some scenes particularly those with Juhi his performance clashes with the finesse of the others.Unfortunately films which forgo formula and embrace innovation are too often ignored by the indiscriminate masses who would rather see Shah Rukh Khan in DDLJ Part VII or whichever configuration we're on now so don't be surprised by the many reviewers who have no idea how to react to it. It will join the league of thoughtful cinema rendered obscure by the very fact that it makes demands on its audience instead of bowing to commercial pressures. Bas Ek Pal holds the mirror up to Life and dares to show us that the reflection is sometimes purely shattered.".

	schema:reviewBody "As has happened so often before the Indian reaction to this movie doesn't predict my reaction at all. I have to say that Urmila Matondkar makes the most interesting movies! Banaras Bas Ek Pal Main Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara Ek Hasina Thi Tehzeeb. There is a MINUTE number of artists in the India movie trade who can produce on that level over and over. But in this movie she is matched with a fine cast. I'm not a great Jimmy Shergill fan but I gotta say that drop him down with Urmila Juhi and Sanjay Suri and he blends into that environment. And when that happens he's a different guy.This is a very mixed up but realistic plot about a guy who falls in love with a girl he runs into when he goes out for a good time with his buddy. But he has no idea just what a tangled mess he's stepping into sorta like Bush in Iraq! Soon he finds himself charged with attempted murder caged with the worst scum of Mumbai his life in tatters. I think this is also one of the SCARIEST movies I've seen because something like this could happen to any of us. It is really the grace of God that saves us nothing else.Juhi of course is pure gold. If its possible to be in love with a complete stranger you only see on the screen them I'm in love with her. I know if I met her in real life I'd be useless to the world because I'd be able to think of nothing but her.What I really liked in this movie was the quiet dialogue with moodsetting music in the background. It is so rare in Indian movies but I hardly wanted to breathe the mood seemed so fragile.Anyway the critics who badmouth this movie are TOTALLY wrong. The fans who shunned it are TOTALLY wrong. This is a 910 if there ever was one.But if your idea of a good movie is Krish or Rang De Basanti don't see this. You won't like it.".

I think this is also one of the SCARIEST movies I've seen because something like this could happen to any of us. It is really the grace of God that saves us nothing else.Juhi of course is pure gold. If its possible to be in love with a complete stranger you only see on the screen them I'm in love with her. I know if I met her in real life I'd be useless to the world because I'd be able to think of nothing but her.What I really liked in this movie was the quiet dialogue with moodsetting music in the background. It is so rare in Indian movies but I hardly wanted to breathe the mood seemed so fragile.Anyway the critics who badmouth this movie are TOTALLY wrong. The fans who shunned it are TOTALLY wrong. This is a 910 if there ever was one.But if your idea of a good movie is Krish or Rang De Basanti don't see this. You won't like it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Among all movies this year I was definitely looking forward to this one most. I wasn't let down. The movie is like a breath of fresh air. I don't think Bollywood has ever attempted to make such a movie with a dark theme and dark characters. The only other movie that is as dark is 'The Film'. Bas Ek Pal deals with with compassion anger love hate lust and jealousy. The characters are very human and you see that each of their decision has a drastic effect on what's coming next. The film also follows a steady pace and keeps you wondering what's gonna happen next. Once the movie ends it stays in your mind!!! The movie is loosely based on Pedro Almodovar's Carne Tremula. Almodovar based his movie on Ruth Rendell's original novel 'Live Flesh'. I read the book and saw the movie and except for a few similarities i found them both to be very different. And what makes Bas Ek Pal different is that it wasn't a carbon copy of either. It took some scenes from both the movie and the book. For example the rape scene wasn't in the movie but it was in the book.The movie can also be said to be a character sketch. Sanjay Suri Juhi Chawla Urmila Matondkar and Jimmy Shergill all play challenging roles. You've never seen them like this. You can identify with all the characters.The cast and crew are all worthy of awards but again Bollywood awards mostly go to the nondeserving.This is probably Juhi's most challenging role to date and she played it completely natural. The character has several layers and only a brilliant actress like Juhi could do justice to this part.Urmila's character was also one that required a fantastic actress and she did full justice to that role. I highly doubt whether anyone could have done better.As for Jimmy Shergill and Sanjay Suri they are becoming more versatile with each film. Both have done a great job and take big strides as actors maturing with every movie.Music is definitely a double plus! They're still pleasant to hear and add to the situation in the film.Onir's a remarkable director. He chose a bold theme and he chose the best actors not the biggest stars which makes this movie worth a watch. Whether you'll like it or not I'd definitely say watching it would be worth your time.I don't see why this movie was a flop. Well bollywood does have difficulty recognizing good movies otherwise why would crap like Krishh and KANK be superhits? This film should win several awards especially best director best music and best performances!".

	schema:reviewBody "Bas Ek Pal is a film I was waiting to savor. I had heard so much about the excellence of this movie about Onir's outstanding direction about the wonderful cast. This was clearly a standout movie for the year 2006. Why? For so many reasons really.. Let me enumerate... 1. The movie started out really well there was an atmosphere of impending doom throughout the film that was very well done. I felt like I was inside a Rohinton Mistry novel. 2. Some of the characters were ordinary and well etched. 3. The story twisted and turned and kept me engaged throughout. 4. The music was quite good though the whole package not as powerful as the music in Woh Lamhe. 5. The movie boasted of some excellent performances.A little plot outlineNikhil Kapoor Sanjay Suri goes to a night club meets and it instantly captivated by Anamika Urmila Matondkar. She is being elusive but is attracted to him. Nikhil's best friend Rahul Jimmy Shergill has a friend Steve Rehaan Engineer who is embroiled in marital strife with his wife Ira Juhi Chawla. One day Rahul and Steve accompany Nikhil to the night club one day and there he meets Aanmika again gets into a fight with her escort and with the escort's gun accidentally shoots Rahul. That lands him up in jail where he suffers through much beating and abuse of the imaginable and unimaginable type. Eventually Ira works on his case and gets him bail. He is trying to figure out why his friends abandoned him and refuse to see him Anamika is hooked up with the paraplegic Rahul and Ira and Steve are still going at each other. One finds out that he was set up in the night club. That was apparent in the beginning itself but now the details come out and the rest of the story is a fantastical resolution of the tangle everyone is embroiled in.So what does one see on close scrutiny?That Ira is too scared to leave her abusive husband but not too scared to have an affair. After she finds out he knows about the affair she is still able to rescue the man who was victimized by her husband but is still unable to find the courage to leave the husband. He goes away for weeks on end when she has her affair but she does not leave him during these prolonged absences instead she chooses a time when he is in town to finally muster up some courage. You learn that it is possible to plan a shooting using a gun carried by a person unknown to the planner. That a person who has an MBA from a US university and lived with his parents there upon relocation does not have enough money to afford top notch legal representation. And so on and so forth. So yes the plot is riddled with many such inconsistencies and it is not about relationships at all. Ira is an abused spouse and yet lives with her abuser  that makes her an enabler but that aspect is never explored. Hers is the worst fleshed out character. Anamika is a very fickle frivolous person and do such people exist? Steve is an abuser and a real person. Rahul is a strange mix of victim savior and avenger. Nikhil is the character that you sympathize with the most  he is not the protagonist but a victim the fulcrum around whom the story revolves but he is a passive participant for the most part.The performancesJuhi is outstanding. What a way to reemerge as a mature actress of note. She takes an ill drawn character and manages to infuse it with life and reality. She has the most scope for histrionics and yet never resorts to that  instead she is most understated and has maximum impact.Urmila  well I know I will get flak from her legion of fans but in the first part she is convincing as the peppy frivolous girl. Then the movie turns serious and Urmila loses it  she yells sobs screams and generally overperforms at every turn. In all fairness to Urmila  it is Juhi's underplayed acting that makes Urmila's look overdone but there it is.Sanjay Suri is quite good  I liked the character and the way he performed it. He showed obsession despair terror and selfdisgust with equal ease. Jimmy Shergill was good. I saw a decent role competently done  nothing outstanding nothing jarred.Rehaan Engineer was okay  sort of easy to play bad man role.About the direction.. I had heard so much about Onir and I think this was a very good effort. But this was by no means a flawless film. The story of ordinary characters stuck in some fantastical scenario was a problem for me. And the last 10 minutes were quite atrocious IMO. By the end I wanted the two remaining people to pick up the gun and BAM BAM! The setup was so mundane  it was all driven by jealousy? How fantastic is that! The bits in jail were extremely powerful. BTW guys just because it was a male being raped does not make it any outstanding act of bravery on the director's part. These things do happen just as much as women getting raped and abused in custody  so what is the big deal here? Was Madhuri Dixit not shown to suffer through such and worse in Anjaam?In the end I liked Bas Ek Pal for its unusual story but I felt it fell short of the mark in many ways and failed to achieve greatness. Of all the performances Juhi was simply awesome  she made me give the film 8 stars.".

It's mostly about finding and following one's love and it beautifully comes to a full circle where all the 5 main protagonists are connected to each other. There are every possible emotions that a human being can get identified with it deals with compassion anger love lust and jealousy.Watch this movie if you like some serious stuff.

	schema:reviewBody "After running a good trailer and Aatif's intense Tere Bin I was kinda curious about Bas Ek Pal. It genuinely sounded like movie which will take a fine look at relationships. This is second film by director Onir whose last 'My Brother Nikhil' was critically acclaimed. While promoting this film I still remember Urmila saying what I feel is best of this movie is even if characters are complex situations are complex but characters are written with clarity after walking out of the hall I could only give a sarcastic smile to this statement. Only thing I like in this is its central twist which I suspected coming but forgot as time passed some of its music and one of the relationships that happens after interval. That's the reason two and half stars are given.We get to know Nikhil Suri is back from US to India after five years bumped into Urmila in a disc where she helps him to get into there. They like each other and start to play. Urmila pretends to be hard to get and Suri continue to peruse her. Rahul Jimmy and Nikhil are friends Rahul is friend with Steve who is on down slope of his marriage with IraJuhi. Then an incident takes place which turns everything up side down. What happens after that is better left for interested viewers to go and figure out.Bas EK Pal does wander in the relationship pitfalls  insecurity paranoia misunderstandings jealousy lust but it would have been effective if it's supported by a strong plot rather than a fate play. Lots of drama goes on screen but it fails to make us care for what is happening on screen. There are many ridiculous scenes when Nikhil only looks like psycho obsessive lover despite a man with so much of bad luck. He is supposed to be lead character but nothing we feel about him. And same is the story for other characters. We never feel for them. They are like born with worst luck in the world tangled in such complex situation but still no. Why Nikhil is so deeply in love with her we never know. Is love at first sight is not enough to justify such a difficult subject? No. For other it will be revealing too much so I stop here. Only thing it manages it way up is one of the relationships. Its central twist is good one and justifies its fate plot after first half. Aatif's 'Tere bin' is there when credits are rolling but audience has suffered enough and is too late till then. When it comes to performances in such movies with such a subject  actors get chance to show what they are capable of but alas! Not even one of five has encashed this opportunity. Suri is capable actor and he has shown that in Zankaar Beats but here he is deadpan. Juhi Jimmy and Rehmaan are OK. And Urmila God actress of her caliber who was brilliant in her last outings like Ek Haseena Thi for me her best so far. Others are Rangeela and Kaun? and Pinjar is a huge let down. She has made comeback after such a long break but looks like has caught rust. Sorry to say Mr. Onir like your characters bad luck for you and for us this time.".

She has made comeback after such a long break but looks like has caught rust. Sorry to say Mr. Onir like your characters bad luck for you and for us this time.";

I don't think I've ever seen such a vague story line.

A sees B in a Discotheque and falls for her. C is friend from childhood days. D is C's Friend and E is D's wife. So an accident happens and A shoots C and C is crippled for life.A gets to spend 3 harrowing years in the jail. All the while A lives Solely with B's memories in his heart. Why? I cannot fathom the reason how he can fall in love sooo deeply with one e has met but twice! Meanwhile C is all set to marry B who probably loves me out of pity since she holds herself partly responsible.D is an alcoholic and a wife beater and does not allow E to leave.E meanwhile has had an affair with C.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is totally screwed up. The plot is as ridiculous as a soap opera. Everyone gets involved with everyone. While Sanjay Suri's character is shown to be very noble which he is I must add that he is by far the stupidest of them all. You don't just take a gun and keep on holding it in your hand in a crowd. He should've gotten the hint that Urmila doesn't want to dance with him after refusing like 10 times. As if he didn't learn his lesson by spending 3 years in jail he keeps on standing right in front of a gun pointed at him by a person whom he knows wouldn't hesitate to shoot him. The ending is just ridiculous. Seems like Shakespeare where everyone is just killing themselves. The movie doesn't seem too original eitherlike a combination of a bunch of other movies. What irks me the most is how superficial all of the relationshipsaffairs are in this film. Sanjay Suri sees a hot girl a couple of times and falls deeply in love with her to the point of being able to give up his life. Everyone gave a good performance but Urmila was a bit overthetop at times. No worries this flick won't make a dent in her career with fabulous performances in movies like Bhoot and Pinjar. Songs were great with Tere Bin definitely the best. Too bad it was just used for the end credits. The number in the nightclub was also good. One thing however that was kind of nice about this movie was that it shows you how shocking and uncontrollable life can be at times how the people you trust most can backstab you and play vile games and how we are sometimes helpless when destiny takes control.".

	schema:headline " 10 to the Mean Machine.";
	schema:reviewBody "Mean Machine is an English reworking of Robert Aldrich's 1974 beefcake Burt Reynolds starrer The Longest Yard. Substituting Gridiron for Soccer director Barry Skolnick along with his roll call of British faces is only aiming for one market.That of the footie worshipping clan that primarily resides within the United Kingdom.Very much a long way from competing on the same playing field as Aldrich's superior movie Mean Machine does have enough about it to make it an enjoyable viewing outside of the excellently constructed soccer match that fills out the last third of the piece. But with the film's reputation being far from good the chance that many others feel the same as me are pretty remote. About as remote as Accrington Stanley winning the English Premiere League one feels.The problem would seem to lay with the first hour violence and humour thrust together does not always yield great rewards and so it be with the wet behind the ears direction from Skolnick. Caught between a tough portrayal of British prison life and outright slapstick it's an odd bedfellow that Skolnick can't quite get right. And with Guy Ritchie on the sidelines donning the supervising producer shirt one can't help thinking that Ritchie would have made substantially more with the material to hand. But as I say there's enough there for the discerning fan of blood and banter.Led by the watchable Jones the cast outside of the miscast David Hemmings as the Governor pull out the stops to entertain the terrace faithful. Danny Dyer haters will enjoy him getting knocked about as he plays simpleton Billy Limpet while Jason Statham is a joy as Monk a Jock that even the Jocks are afraid of. While also putting in scene stealing shifts of note are Jamie Sives Vas Blackwood and Omid Djalili.

	onyx:emotionText "Mean Machine is an English reworking of Robert Aldrich's 1974 beefcake Burt Reynolds starrer The Longest Yard. Substituting Gridiron for Soccer director Barry Skolnick along with his roll call of British faces is only aiming for one market.That of the footie worshipping clan that primarily resides within the United Kingdom.Very much a long way from competing on the same playing field as Aldrich's superior movie Mean Machine does have enough about it to make it an enjoyable viewing outside of the excellently constructed soccer match that fills out the last third of the piece. But with the film's reputation being far from good the chance that many others feel the same as me are pretty remote. About as remote as Accrington Stanley winning the English Premiere League one feels.The problem would seem to lay with the first hour violence and humour thrust together does not always yield great rewards and so it be with the wet behind the ears direction from Skolnick. Caught between a tough portrayal of British prison life and outright slapstick it's an odd bedfellow that Skolnick can't quite get right. And with Guy Ritchie on the sidelines donning the supervising producer shirt one can't help thinking that Ritchie would have made substantially more with the material to hand. But as I say there's enough there for the discerning fan of blood and banter.Led by the watchable Jones the cast outside of the miscast David Hemmings as the Governor pull out the stops to entertain the terrace faithful. Danny Dyer haters will enjoy him getting knocked about as he plays simpleton Billy Limpet while Jason Statham is a joy as Monk a Jock that even the Jocks are afraid of. While also putting in scene stealing shifts of note are Jamie Sives Vas Blackwood and Omid Djalili. It's no piece of work to rank in the higher echelons of British movies  or sports movies in general for that matter. But in spite of its soggy formula and over reliance on the template film it's working from it's very funny at times and if you like soccer?

There are some flaws though one or two of the characters are thinly sketched the plot is a touch simplistic and the first half hour just lacked the energy of the latter half of the film. That said this is well worth watching. The whole film is excellently filmed and directed and the soccer scenes are very well done. The final third is absolutely riveting and really makes you want to see what the outcome is at the end. The music score is fine and the performances are very good. Vinnie Jones is convincing in his first leading role and David Kelly is stellar as the benevolent Doc. The best pieces of casting are despite the accent Jason Statham as maverick keeper and Jason Flemying's rather unconventional commentator. In conclusion this is a good film. 710 Bethany Cox".

But just to avoid any misconception this isn't a crimeflick and it's very different from the Ritchie films both in style and content. One doesn't have to be a football fan to enjoy it as the entertainment value is universal. The football match sequence was hilarious and if only the real matches were half entertaining! All the actors do a fine job but it is Vinnie Jones who carries the movie and it's nice to see him as a guy who gets beaten up in comparison to the tough guy roles he's typecast in.

Vinnie Jones does a good job as Danny Meehan and it's nice to see him in a role where he's not the scary one. I liked the subtle humour as well from Massive's ironic name to the unpredictable Monk the crazy Scot even the Scots are afraid of  convincingly played by Jason Statham to the pair of commentators Bob and Bob at the final match.The DVD I saw included audio tracks for both the original UK theatrical release and the domestic i.e. American release. After watching the original I learned that the American had a few words redubbed to make the language easier to understand for these audiences. I then watched the second version and didn't find much of a difference between the two. There were some things that the character Nitro said that were noticeably redubbed which didn't help much considering the way he shouts! and a few slang terms were changed to more international expressions. I think some reviewers of this film may have been unaware of this and so complained about the more obvious dubbing.The only one I actually found helpful was when a character says he's in prison for an abbreviation. I didn't catch what he said and the American version replaced the letters with assault and battery. I found one change a bit puzzling though Mr. Sykes gives the governor of the prison tips for horse racing writing letters next to his choices on a newspaper. After losing money on a false winner W Sykes explains to the governor that it got smudged in the rain. It says EW either way. This was changed to EW to place. I thought the original was quite clear and the new one no longer matches the letters.Overall it's not a bad film. I liked it enough to watch it twice and if you like footballsoccer and prison films there aren't many that combine the two to choose from.".

Look out for the characters  the Monk The 2 game announcers they make the movie very funny and entertaining.All of the characters were very amusing. Rent these other movies and then watch Mean Machine again and maybe you will appreciate it more. Rent Snatch Lock stoke and 2 smoking barrels. The 3 movies have a lot of the same actors in it and they are quite entertaining Watch it again give it a chance it is one of mine and my boyfriends favorite movies right now.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vinnie Jones plays Danny Meehan a retired footballer who disgraced his country by cheating an England v Germany football match to win a bet. The movie begins after his retirement with him speeding around town in his sports car drinking from a bottle of Vodka being chased by Police. He then proceeds to beat up the Police Officers and needless to say he gets arrested and sentenced to 3 years behind bars.In prison he swiftly brought back to reality and reminded that behind bars he isn't a footballer and the prisoners and guards haven't forgotten what he did in that England v Germany game. Danny Meehan is then ordered to captain the prisoners in a one off football match against the guards.The best thing about Mean Machine is the cast if you have watched other British Films around this time you will recognise so many of the supporting actors from films such as Snatch Lock Stock Football Factory. Not to mention Vinnie Jones Jason Statham Danny Dyer David Kelly  David Hemmings! The cast is fantastic but the characters are even better it has a great mix of different people serious one funny ones stupid ones  of course the prison nutteri.e. the Monk!.The Story is of course predictable it has many clich moments  it certainly doesn't offer anything new. But it is entertaining! The first half of the movie has quite a serious feel to it it moves along very fast  doesn't offer much character development. I didn't really feel like I connected with any of the characters  which is a shame as they were so many unique characters involved! The second half of the story when they start to train for the football match  the coverage of the football match itself is much more light hearted and funny there are many laugh out loud moments. The coverage of the football match is absolutely fantastic the best part of the movie by far. Bob  Bob as the commentators are hilarious football commentators could take a note out of their book! The way the match is filmed is also perfect a lot of sports films are let down by the camera angles  the speed of the action but in Mean Machine I feel the director got it spot on. You could really see what was happening and I think this was made easier by Bob  Bob! Overall Mean Machine is an entertaining movie but far from perfect in my eyes. I have seen the Adam Sandler  Longest Yard before seeing this and I think that spoiled it for me it is basically the same story and I had no surprises whilst watching this. The Second half outshines the first by quite a way in my opinion. I feel like they could have offered more in the first half of the movie Character development more tension make you feel for the characters more. As I said before the football match was brilliant and hilarious and saved this movie for me. This is certainly worth a watch and is entertaining enough to pass the time.710".

	schema:reviewBody "When I went to see 'Mean Machine' I could not help but think back to the original version starring Burt Reynolds and known as 'The Longest Yard'.

Struggling to fit in and threatened by guards and prisoners alike Danny accepts the offer from the gambling warden to stage a football match between the prisoners and the officers. However with few willing to stand up with Danny and against the screws things look like they will be near impossible.One of a couple of remakes of The Longest Yard this film goes for a straight remake but with a UK setting. Despite it occasionally having a serious edge to it this is mostly a film about laddish jokes banter and sports. It could have had interesting subtexts about corruption the impact of sport on society or the corrupting nature of powerauthority but instead it just goes for the lowest denominator every chance it gets. In this way it marks out its territory and its target audience and never really aspires to much beyond this. It is a shame really because it is clearly trying serious things but they just come off as clunky and not developed properly. The effect of this is that it regularly knocks the wind out of the fun aspect that only occasionally gets up a good head of steam.The cast do the best they can regardless and in fairness they do OK. Jones is pretty convincing in most scenes and only struggles when he is called upon to convey emotion or carry the serious stuff. Blackwood is good value in a silly role. Statham nicely sends up his martial arts personae well. The rest of the cast are soso and fit in with the general soso level the film is working on but you do have to wonder why Sally Phillips bothered to show up for such a pointless character.Overall a basic sports comedy. It isn't very funny doesn't have much of interest and it isn't much cop.

	schema:headline " Unholy Desire";
	schema:reviewBody "Shhei Imamura 19262006 was a director known for his dark themes and unique vision and his 1964 black and white drama Unholy Desire a.k.a. Murderous Instincts is a great example of his cold style. The story deals with a middleclass housewife Sadako Masumi Harukawa who lives with her commonlaw librarian husband Riichi K Nishimura and his young son Masaru. After she is raped by a burglar Hiraoko Shigeru Tsuyuguchi while being at home alone she cannot even think about letting anyone know about what happened and initially intends to kill herself but cannot bring herself to do it because of her love to Masaru. When the rapist keeps coming back claiming to love her and tries to convince her to run away with him deep inside she starts questioning if her suffocating life with the emotionally cold demanding and unfaithful Riichi is any better than what Hiraoko could offer.The idea of a woman falling with love with her rapist may sound misogynistic at first but I don't think the film ultimately carries such a message at all. The passive Sadako's past is so full of psychological mistreatment by her inlaws that it doesn't feel like much of a stretch to think that to her rape is not necessarily worse than her life as it is. To me the vibe the film sends regarding the connection between physical and emotional abuse and how they relate to love in general appears to be more pessimistic than outright misanthropic. Still as cruel as the picture is Imamura doesn't wallow in misery Sadako is able to stay strong throughout her trials even if she has occasional bouts of weakness amidst the contradicting forces pulling her apart. The very last shot a closeup of Sadako's face after everything has seemingly been resolved leaves the ending open for interpretation.The instantly striking aspect of the film is Imamura's stunningly beautiful visual style. The black  white cinematography stark shadows wonderful scenery and the thoroughly planned mise en scne ensure that practically any frame of the film could be hanged up on a wall to be admired as an artistic photograph. The cramped interior scenes make use of tight closeups and some unconventional camera angles while the spacious outdoor set pieces allow the use of wide angles and tracking shots for example during the climax on a snowy mountain or Sadako and Hiraoko's dramatic encounter on a moving train. The average shotlength is longer than in most modern films and the pacing always stays unhurried making the film long but never tedious. The somewhat avantgarde music is also used sparingly but all the more effectively.The recurring shots of Masaru's pet mice in a tiny cage with a hamster wheel are obvious symbols for Sadako's de facto imprisonment by her family and inlaws but shots of passing trains also keep reappearing in the film all the way through. Perhaps they are hints of possibilities for her to get away from her life either by jumping in front of a speeding train like she initially plans to or by accepting Hiraoko's offer and leaving with him for Tokyo? In any case the noisy screechy sounds of locomotives certainly heighten the tension of the disturbing scenes of abuse that take place in the family's house right next to the train tracks. A couple of moments such as Sadako watching a shirt flying in the wind above her also add a dreamlike feel to the mix softening the harsh realism a bit.In a way the directorial style and the examined themes reminded me of Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke's awarded 2001 film The Piano Teacher both films have a female protagonist who has grown up in an oppressive environment but while Imamura's Sadako is unwillingly pulled into an abusive relationship Haneke's Erika actively seeks men to mistreat her. Well even if the comparison is a long shot anyone interested in the nature of abuse should definitely give both films a look as both are masterly created pieces of art. At the moment I have only seen a handful of Shhei Imamura films but I have been impressed by all of them. Still Unholy Desire may be my favourite of them all the wonderful visuals and the calm observing handling of the controversial subject make the tale a highly enjoyable if distressing cinematic experience.".

That a loveless housewife married to an abusive husband who cheats on her should fall in love with the thief who breaks in her house one night and rapes her and the resulting movie is neither played for laughs nor reduced to hokey melodrama is a testament to the creative force at hand.Imamura's uncanny ability to find the absurd in the mundane the blackly comedic in the serious and the humane in the bleak and hopeless this curious heady mix eccentric but not for the sake of it with which the director as sympathetic anthropologist handpicks his characters from the lowest strata of society observes their struggles triumphs and follies like the shots of mice running aimlessly inside their cage he uses in the movie  animals a usual if not subtle metaphor for Imamura not with the detached amused air of the cynic like the Coens tend to do not to present them as quirks to amuse the sophisticated cineaste too inhibited to even aknowledge the trappings in himself but truthfully honestly with a hint of sadness but never without humour to admire their downfall when they succumb at the last to their animalistic desires.Beautifully filmed daring in its New Wave experimentation its dynamic shots the camera peering from improbable angles through doorways inside tunnels along with moving trains its great use of the widescreen canvas its sound design.

	schema:reviewBody "Yet another excellent film by Japanese director Shhei Imamura! I'm amazed by how much great work he made!'Intentions of Murder' revolves around Sadako a plump woman with a peasant background who is abused by her loveless husband and inlaws and is raped by a degenerate thief. Her life is so full of bitterness and suffering that she constantly contemplates committing suicide. Unbearably heavy as that may sound the film is very artfully carried by Imamura's skill inventiveness and great wisdom. The director never makes fun of Sadako's tragedy  on the contrary he shows the deepest sympathy for her much like he does for the female lead in his previous film 'The Insect Woman'  but he handles the film's material with a relatively light touch by making use of a playful soundtrack and by highlighting the absurdity of its situations in a way that sometimes verges on black comedy. This is the story of an underdog who while devoid of any wit much wealth or classic good looks is possessed with the strongest mettle and tenacity. A recurring theme in his work and particularly in my favorite film of his 'Profound Desire of the Gods' is the clash between the structured mores of society and our unruly human desires and emotions. Inconvenient as it may be our animal nature doesn't always accept the order that we try to impose on it rationally. This contradiction between different impulses can cause confusion embarrassment distress violence... And yet to some extent we're left with no choice but to somehow come to terms with that wild anarchic aspect of our humanity.I think it's fair to say that beyond our survival and animal instincts the director points to love both selflove and love for those around us as the best compass in life. In this case Sadako's love for her son serves her as a guiding light even when it all seems hopeless. Imamura despite populating many of his films with despicable selfish characters in the end seems to show some faith in human kind. It's a welcome spark of optimism in what would otherwise be a very darkly cynical perspective.In an interview provided as an extrafeature by the Criterion Collection Imamura explains that he needed to loosen up after having finished his 1960 film 'My Second Brother' which won international acclaim but was too straitlaced for his taste. His style began to change after that and I believe it's with 'Intentions of Murders' that the director began to play with surrealism something that would become more prominent in later films like 'The Pornographers' and 'Warm Water Under The Red Bridge'.It's true that a few of the metaphors in this film are a little too obvious particularly the hamster in the cage. But there's so much more going on here including beautiful black and white photography a powerful story in general and really solid acting. This is a film that I highly recommend watching.".

	schema:headline " Intentions of Murder 1964";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is likely a masterpiece and far ahead of most of the world cinema at the time of its release and it should definitely be more widely known but I didn't give it ten stars because of its rather lengthy runtime. Maybe it's because I've seen the film in fragments and not in one piece but I still think that the runtime could've been polished even though the pacing and the flow of the story is perfect. It's probably just the way I've seen it that made it a bit irksome.Intentions of Murder or Unholy Desire is partially based on a story by Shinji Fujiwara and partially on director Shohei Imamura's actual sociological study on a woman living in northern Japan. The film bears some resemblance to Yoshishige Yoshida's The Affair 1967 both are about female protagonists in lifeless marriages whose lives get thrown in a pot after getting raped. Comparing the two films we can see the differences between the two filmmakers' approaches Yoshida is reserved cold delicate and geometrical while Imamura's movie is messy burning instinctdriven and impulsive.Intentions of Murder revolves around the issues of women in '60s Japan presenting a cynical outlook with some dark humor and several moments of genuine suspense almost Hitchockian to a degree. Sadako the protagonist of the film finds herself in a conflict of multiple repulsion on the one hand there's her librarian husband Riichi who cheats her with a fellow lady of the library and treats Sadako like a slave and on the other hand there's the rapisthouse intruder who promises her better life but she's obviously repulsed by him. Both men are sick and of fragile health and technically weaker than her but due to patriarchal societal norms they naturally come on top and so Sadako has to fight against their influences the only light of her life being her son whom she loves immensely and who gives her hope in her life.The film also centers on a conflict between instinctual traditional nature of Sadako's peasant self and Riichi's strict ordered civilized way of life. The contrast is laid out not only through the differing locations the sunny farm and the categorized orderly library but also through the characters' bodies. As described by Imamura Sadako is Medium height and weight light coloring smooth skin. The face of a woman who loves men. Maternal good genitals juicy. She is like a Venus of Willendorf figure with a large figure plump breasts and strong maternal instincts Riichi calls her Mommy during sex. On the other hand Riichi is completely dry and pinched looking almost lifeless in comparison to his wife. Imamura was always against the veneer of business suits and advanced technology and in favor of the superstition and irrationality that pervade the Japanese consciousness and in this movie he certainly shows it by siding with a woman who best represents natural instincts.The cinematography in this movie is beautiful it just is. The utilization of indoor rooms moving setpieces freezeframes negative space snowy areas moving trains composition of characters and the placing of the actors behind various spatial obstacles to the obvious but certainly not needless visual comparison with animals see Imamura's The Ballad of Narayama in this case it's caged mice it all makes for a very visually striking picture. Some shots beautifully utilize everything they're given in regards to the setting like the swinging lamp scene where the lamp swings around a dark room partially illuminating Sadako's exhausted body in the back room at turns. The soundtrack is interesting too with many odd sound effects reminiscent of the boing! sounds from Ennio Morricone's music.Intentions of Murder is truly an underappreciated gem that should be known by everyone interested in '60 cinema. And when it comes to '60s movie industry I think Japan had the best films by far.The movie also deserves respect for having the only nightmare scene I've ever seen where the character DOESN'T spring up like on a trampoline as they're waking up. Here Sadako wakes up as usual only in cold sweat.".

Director Shouhei Imamura upends conventional contemporary film practices by showcasing strong women characters and wimpy male ones. Bravo! The evolution of leading actress Masumi Harukawa's character is the plot. She starts off as a lowly commonlaw wife former household maid fresh off the farm and ultimately achieves everything and a bit more on her thingstodo list of life goals. It is humorous to watch Harukawa often referred to as a large women in line readings fake being abused dominated by her male costars who appear physically smaller and play sickly characters to boot one has a serious asthma or TB? affliction the other an incapacitating weak heart when she could easily flatten them both perhaps simultaneously!. Supporting actresses also deliver strong performances including an obsessivecomedic one. Imamura's direction is fine but his simulated sex scenes meant to show Harukawa's sexual power and her growing awareness of same? are boringly repetitious and far from artful. Voiceover expository usually indicates that postproduction editing has tried to compensate for inadequate direction. But not for this film. The Director inserts Harukawa's commentary while freezing the frame to provide a window into her thought processes as her power becomes self evident to her character. Cinematography wide screen black  white and special effects are outstanding. Dolly tracking sequences are often remarkable and rear screen projections can be virtually flawless its hard to tell if an exterior has been shot on a sound stage or on location. Scenes photographed at floor level are for the most part effective in that they are interesting and do not distract the viewer from what is being performed. Lighting is a bit on the dark side until the snow scenes which occur toward the end of the film. A fair amount of back ground dialog is not subtitled. Some translations are too long and appear on screen too briefly. The score is a borderline joke. Highly recommended. WILLIAM FLANIGAN PhD.".

At the point where Mike decides to give in despite his idealistic motives to win the case the story ends with a staggering reality. The results of the story are given on the screen before the credits role. This is a very strong story well directed an written and in many ways due to the bravura performance of Chris Evans drives home some realities we all need to acknowledge money and greed speak louder than patient and hospital staff safety.

Chris Evans proved he can really act not just dress up as a superhero and run around a big budgeted set. Mark Kassen was marvelous alongside him as his legal partner and the Houston backdrop made for an unlikely protagonist in and of itself. A story that needed to be shared and with tremendous talent. I only wish there were more films like Puncture. I encourage people to go see the film.".

Here it is the hospital and pharmaceutical world. The trigger is a nurse who gets an accidental needle stick and even though there was and is a solution to most needle sticks the industry has been slow to change at the peril of many lives.The personal side of this is based on the lead lawyer who takes the case of this nurse which leads to a general uncovering of the problem and a pressuring of the industry almost singlehandedly. It also turns out that he's a total coke addict and his life is in overdrive all the time with the necessary crashes along the way. The actor here is Chris Evans who reminded me a little of a young George C. Scott but without the depth of character Scott managed to bring with his acidity. Evans is key here and not quite enough. The movie holds him more than he drives the movie mostly because he has a kind of blankness inside a practiced intensity rather than a really out of the box abandonment we might find irresistible.So why watch? Mostly for the plot the story as it develops and reminds you of how the world works and how some people have ideals that make them ignore the resistance of the rest of us. The only problem with this is that it's a story we've seen before in the outline. It needs to be known and told for sure but maybe a twenty minute spot on Sixty Minutes might serve the cause best. Here the drama and the social justice are jammed together into a single overlong somewhat predictable movie. Good might not be good enough.".

It might not be your typical legal drama with all the clich's you are used to but is that really a bad thing? The story keeps you interested in whats going to happen to the case and whats going to happen to Mike.Chris Evans does a good job creating a character and making you care for the character. Even if the character always does not make the right decision. Evans portrays Mike Weiss as a flawed anti hero. Yet you wonder if he is fighting this case because he wants to help others or if he wants to help himself.I really liked this drama especially since it was a true story. Especially since the project was started by Mike Weiss's real life partner who had no connections to Hollywood but worked very hard to get this movie made which has a very important message.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 because while it is a good movie it does movie a little slow. The ending is also abrupt and I think it could have been longer. But if you are a fan of Chris Evans please see this movie. He takes this role very seriously and you could tell he worked hard at this movie. You will not be disappointed in him.".

Mike wants to make it so every hospital only uses the one time use only needles that his other client manufactures. The only problem is that Mike is a drug addicted mess. This movie is deceiving. The first half hour to me was a little slow and wasn't sure if I could make it through. When it picked up it really picked up and sucked me in. By the end of the movie you are very engrossed and are pulling for someone you normally wouldn't. A movie much like Runaway Jury mixed with The Lincoln Lawyer not quite as good as Lincoln Lawyer though. Overall a very good law movie that will make you think.

	schema:reviewBody "I actually didn't know this was more or less a true story. Which does make it a bit more interesting although not in the least surprising since the medical industry has always been corrupt in this way. But on to the film.I agree with some other comments. This film only further shows how versatile Chris Evans is. Not sure how seriously I took him 10 years ago in XMen other than doing a decent job and being funny and quick witted. But he has definitely shown a larger range. He still gets thrown more action kind of roles. But if this movie is any indication he can definitely handle more complex dramatic roles as well. Personally I really liked this film. I thought the story was very engaging. And honestly I was very drawn in by Chris Evans' performance. Obviously there is no extension of the imagination in a drug addicted lawyer. But he plays it extremely convincingly. Other than that all the other supporting roles are done well and support well.Some of the small criticisms is that it is a bit clich in the goliath and David story line and all. And like one user pointed out I would have liked to see them show more about the court case itself that the entire film builds up to. But I don't really share the criticism of it being all about Chris's character. I think that was the intent. To show someone who was so smart with so much passion but also with many demons and vices. I think his story was as important as the case he was fighting for was.All and all I found very enjoyable to watch. I actually didn't have the highest hopes but was pleasantly surprised by the excellent acting which more than made up for some of the more common or clich parts. Check it out if you get a chance.".

Which does make it a bit more interesting although not in the least surprising since the medical industry has always been corrupt in this way. But on to the film.I agree with some other comments. This film only further shows how versatile Chris Evans is. Not sure how seriously I took him 10 years ago in XMen other than doing a decent job and being funny and quick witted. But he has definitely shown a larger range. He still gets thrown more action kind of roles. But if this movie is any indication he can definitely handle more complex dramatic roles as well. Personally I really liked this film. I thought the story was very engaging. And honestly I was very drawn in by Chris Evans' performance. Obviously there is no extension of the imagination in a drug addicted lawyer. But he plays it extremely convincingly. Other than that all the other supporting roles are done well and support well.Some of the small criticisms is that it is a bit clich in the goliath and David story line and all. And like one user pointed out I would have liked to see them show more about the court case itself that the entire film builds up to. But I don't really share the criticism of it being all about Chris's character. I think that was the intent. To show someone who was so smart with so much passion but also with many demons and vices. I think his story was as important as the case he was fighting for was.All and all I found very enjoyable to watch. I actually didn't have the highest hopes but was pleasantly surprised by the excellent acting which more than made up for some of the more common or clich parts. Check it out if you get a chance.";

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since the massive industrialization of Europe and America in the late 1800's corruption has been a close bedfellow. It stands to follow that the bigger the industry the more unsavory and in the dark the shady manipulation of how that industry flourishes is apt to be. Healthcare and related businesses contributes a usually large share of the GNP 20 in the US. It has been speculated to likely top 3 trillion dollars by 2011 based on figures from the previous years. With so many wheels being greased by so much money it would seem hard to control unless there exists a banding together of the giants within the industry. That is what the movie Puncture explores How the largest healthcare related purchasing organization has created an almost miraculous manipulation of the entire industry. It continues to affect not only paying patients but the frontline care providers such as nurses and to a larger extent the poorest countries whose associated outcomes circle back to spread disease think AIDS which circle the globe. More specifically Puncture tells the story of how a lone inventor created a needle that could prevent crosscontamination by accidental pricks and reuse the needle could only be used once. The retractable syringe remains basically blackballed by the largest healthcare buying group monopoly. The only reason for this is purely greed as the needle would be more expensive to produce profit margins would necessarily less. In other words untold numbers of healthcare providers are at dramatically higher risk for contamination by life threatening contagions. In a larger world view lethal diseases are spreading with such efficiency due to the standard plastic syringe's reuse that millions die annually needlessly because the retractable syringe is not universally adopted. Think of it this way untold misery in our world could be dramatically reduced if the greedy bastards who control the healthcare business would just allow fair competition. Enter the lawyers specifically one lawyer as no one initially wanted to take on this battle. Well that was a lengthy setup but it is the whole reason this movie came to be. Still as of 2012 dangerous plastic syringes that can and are being reused are still the US as well as world standard. Change is slow even with incalculable needless deaths hanging in the balance. So this movie has something important to say besides the story itself. Perhaps out of this most dark place the brightest light may shine to illuminate the tremendous human suffering this is causing and will thus affect change. Puncture is a movie somewhere between indie rawness and made for TV production values. That is to say it is humble yet it doesn't shoot itself in the foot as it begins with a single nurse's AIDS infection and her desire to champion a family friend's invention that would have prevented it. She sees a television ad for personal injury attorneys and surprisingly to them wants their services more so her friend's invention can be implemented than for personal gain. The two attorneys in the shoestring operation of Weiss and Danziger couldn't be more unsuited for taking on the wealthy and powerful healthcare establishment yet due to Weiss's obsessive interest in winning the unwinnable they do. Chris Evan's portrayal of the drugaddicted Weiss drives this movie. Yes the story is solid but the human frailty of Mike Weiss as brought to life by Evans is commendable. Weiss is a trainwreck of a person however he is an unstoppable force who becomes a big thorn in the side of the healthcare industries largest buying group. In spite of his drug use he makes a case that scares the hell out of big pharma. Besides this being a compelling story Chris Evans is the reason the viewer will want to watch this film. I was never bored even in slow spots due to the constant tension Chris Evan's character brought. Recommended.".

The crux of the case is that hospitals collectively shunned a safety needle that could've prevented this and hundreds of thousands of similar accidents across the USA from happening. So open and shut case right? ... enter corrupt healthcare suppliers and their topnotch legal team.To complicate matters one of the prosecuting lawyers has a serious drug habit. It seems the bipolar lifestyle the drugs provides actually fuels his legal brilliance ... up to a point. However it doesn't fly so well in the big leagues where it starts to undermine their image and jeopardise the case.So it becomes a test of ethics and staying power against a backdrop of money worries a campaign of dirty tricks and the lawyer's drug problem.These guys and their practice are really in no kind of shape to be in this fight so it's hard to see any kind of positive outcome for them which makes it interesting.This is the best performance I've seen from Chris Evans but the other supporting actors were great too.While scenes surrounding the druguse are more whimsical the bulk of it is filmed in a very grounded and unspectacular style. Don't get me wrong  it's still very competently directed and acted  just no fancy frills. For my money though fancy frills would be entirely inappropriate here. While not crowdpleasing or awardwinning the realism lends itself well to this kind of story and makes it believable.I don't think this will be a popular choice but I got a hell of a lot out of it and am glad I saw it.

The cinematography is really nice and the drug scenes are very interesting reminded me of Requiem of a Dream the camera puts you in the drug experience. Also the acting is great Mark Kassen who plays Chris Evans' best friend and partner in the law firm does an excellent job of being a supporting friend sort of an opposite to Evans character which brings a balance to the film.

Matt Taibbi Until very recently in the United States alone injuries involving medical needles resulted in healthcare workers being exposed to bloodborne diseases HIVAIDS hepatitis etc at a rate of about 800000 a year cf the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Today in the Third World millions still die to needle related deaths annually.In 1989 inventor Thomas J. Shaw stumbled upon a news report about a doctor who contracted HIV from a needlestick injury. Spurred by his belief that engineers were neglecting the dangers faced by medical staff Shaw set about designing a safety needle. With the assistance of a 50000 grant by the National Institutes of Health NIH he was able to do so. That's when the trouble started.Attempting to get his safety syringes into hospitals Shaw increasingly met resistance. The source of his woes? A corrupt arrangement between a big needle maker Becton Dickinson and Group Purchasing Organizations GPOs. What are GPOs? A union of small companies who buy products in bulk from bigger companies. This allows the GPOs to buy cheaply and pass on the savings to those they supply which in this case amounts to hundreds of private and staterun hospitals.Medical GPOs  essentially purchasing cartels  were originally formed with the intention of saving money and protecting hospitals. It turns out however that Becton Dickinson was bribing GPOs and politicians to block the implementation of innovative medical products not just syringes. Becton Dickinson's withholding of gear and its ability to manipulate the cost of the gear it allowed onto the market would cost its main consumer the US healthcare system billions of unnecessary dollars.In 1998 Shaw sought the help of Michael Weiss and Paul Danziger two lawyers. Michael and Paul drafted up a lawsuit against the GPOs but the case never went to court. The big companies bought off politicians lawyers put the squeeze on Michael and Paul crippled their law business and bludgeoned Shaw until he agreed to settle out of court.Unsurprisingly Weiss would soon die of an overdose. Some believe he was assassinated. If so his death would echo the mysterious deaths of many attorneys embarking upon similar cases. Consider the mysterious deaths of Shannon Roth and Thelma Colbert both US attorneys and both of whom were working on a case against Novation LLC a notorious medical supplier charged with anticompetitive practises. At least 5 other attorneys working the case were also pressured into resignation. Consider too US attorney Jonathan Luna suicided after being pressured to stop revealing links between cartels and government lobbyists. Journalists and whistleblowers like Lynn Everard and Mary Walsh are similarly blacklisted for talking about medical cartels.Directed by Adam and Mark Kassen Puncture is a legal drama which documents Shaw's attempts to get his needle on the market. It primarily focuses on attorney Michael Weiss Chris Evans the young lawyer who attempted to take the GPOs down. In the film Weiss is presented as a roiling cauldron of contradictions. Though a talented lawyer with an idealistic streak Weiss also forever indulges in drugs sex and booze and sees his GPO case as but a path to fame and money. Weiss' conflicts echo those of his partner Paul Danziger who's torn between the pragmatism of running a failing law business  a pragmatism which requires him to focus on smaller cases just to earn a living  and an idealism which mandates that he stands up against bigger fish.Puncture never pretends to be anything other than a humble genre film. This is a David vs Goliath tale in the vein of other fine whistleblower dramas Silkwood Norma Rae The Insider etc. The difference here is Puncture's grim tone. Here the bad guys don't get taken down the case never makes it to court and our heroes are virtually ruined. Epitomising the film's pessimism are its references to the Big Tobacco cases of the 1990s a battle which Michael Mann's The Insider presents as a victory won but which Puncture sees as just a conciliatory payoff designed to keep business running as usual.Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest place characters in Puncture repeatedly state. But the film itself cautions against gungho optimism. When you're talking about hospital supply and pharmaceutical industries which are worth hundreds of billions of dollars are expert at eradicating competition have politicians on their payroll have massive legal teams and which are themselves wholly or partially owned by giant banks or umbrella groups you must expect fierce resistance. Businesses have long demonstrated a willingness to kill in the name of profits and as the climax of Puncture shows even when you've limited the way they prey on the relatively welldefended they simply hop across the Atlantic and start preying on the defenceless.8.510  See The Verdict 1982 and The Lincoln Lawyer. Incidentally Puncture stars Vinessa Shaw as a young nurse who contracts HIV from a needle. Shaw famously played Domino in Eyes Wide Shut a young woman who is likewise revealed to be HIV positive.".

	schema:reviewBody "Truthfully this movie didn't deserve only one star it was well made and well acted. In fact if they didn't promote it as based on a true story then I would have likely given it at least seven stars. However they did call it true which is just not the case  this story is simply more Hollywood Hype. As someone who was and still is involved in the healthcare industry at the time I can point out the following facts1 The safety needle as shown in the film is a retraction model. In other words most punctures in a healthcare setting happen when the healthcare provider attempts to recap the needle after use or by handling the syringe until you could break off the needle into an approved safety container. However in the movie the nurse pricks herself as a result of trying to administer an injection to an unruly patient. In such a case even the safety needle would not have prevented the nurse in the movie from puncturing herself.2  It's also worth pointing out that an equal number of healthcare accidents resulting in infection from broken skin occur in the laboratory due to the inhand breakage of a glass test tubes which subsequently cut the hands of the laboratorians and infects them. The safety needle does nothing to protect these healthcare accidents either. In fact there is a company Greiner that sells only plastic test tubes but glass test tubes are still the majority of test tubes used in healthcare today. So where's Hollywood's outrage about this?3  I was around at the time this movie took place and can unequivocally tell you that since 1984 every hospital was searching for a better safer needle. The liability aspects of AIDS alone drove this movement. In fact there were a number of safety needles available at the time that were in use and were invented by a number of different peopleSo basically this movie was about some slick sleazy law firm that forced a hospital buying group to buy someones particular safety needle design over someone else's design thus giving that particular inventor a corner on the market.4  Why were safety needles not in use by the group already? You can thank Gov't healthcare reform for that. When the Clintons tried to reform healthcare and failed they did succeed at forcing the industry to reform itself. From this grew hospital buying groups which hospitals would join in order to have greater purchasing power by making group purchases as opposed to a single hospital making the purchase. These bulk purchases would have highquantity discounts thus reducing the cost of the item and reducing the cost of healthcare as the Gov't was forcing them to do. The problem is that high quantity purchases resulted in a large stock of inventory that had to be depleted before you could buy anything new like safety needles. However you don't see Hollywood making mention in this movie about how their favorite Democratic President was responsible for delaying the use of safety needles in hospitals or how the new social healthcare law pushed by our current President will create even more situations like the one in this movie.5  Lastly the stereotypes of this movie are sickening. First they showed a Hospital Purchasing Agent bureaucrat instructing the attorney not to show the safety needle to his nurses because they would want it. A few problems here first nurses aren't the only people that get infected from these accidents in fact of all healthcare workers they are in the minority. Second the nurses would have already known about safety needles as I stated above there were an abundance of them from a slew of different manufacturers. I work with Hospital Purchasing Agents and they are real Aholes but they would never say what this guy said in the movie.6  When they show the buying group conference the one that costs 25000 to attend they make it look like an insider meeting attended by the rich bluebloods. I've attended these trade shows and they are nothing of the type. Mostly they take place in a large open conference center with a crowd of booths filled with working people trying to make a living. The crowd of booths would also have multiple manufacturers selling a diverse line of products including multiple types of safety needles from multiple manufacturers. The fact being that there was no shortage of safety needles at these shows and they were offered from a diverse set of different manufacturers.Like I said if this movie wasn't advertised as true' I probably would have liked it. However I couldn't in good conscience allow them to perpetrate this lie without speaking up. If you doubt me think to yourself when was the last time a lawyer especially an ambulance chaser really did something that was not for their own personal gain?".

	schema:headline " The Other Guys Soars  Will Ferrell Is Finally Funny Again";
	schema:reviewBody "Adam McKay is not a household name yet but movie buffs like me know that when he teams up with Will Ferrell magic happens. The former Saturday Night Live writer directed Ferrell in Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy 2004 Talladega Nights 2006 and even the popular viral video The Landlord 2007. Movies with Ferrell that have not involved McKay have tried to duplicate the success of Anchorman but have failed  i.e. SemiPro 2008 Land of the Lost 2009.As director and cowriter of The Other Guys McKay brings the best out of Ferrell Mark Wahlberg and the rest of the cast. It combines action and comedy better than any similar comedy I have seen in a long time.The Other Guys refers to of course the detectives who rarely get a piece of the archetypal copsandrobbers shenanigans that are frequently seen in action movies or on Law  Order. They remain mainly at their desks doing paperwork something almost never seen in movies. Ferrell is Allen Gamble who is somewhat content with managing case work on his computer and Wahlberg is the far more forceful and ambitious Terry Hoitz.Their characters are in sharp contrast to the cops that Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson portray in this film and definitely in other films. Although Jackson and Johnson were also funny here I hate that the previews gave away their cameos in this movie. It would have been more exciting if the audience didn't expect them when they stepped into the theaters. Then again that is the fault of whomever marketed this film not the filmmakers themselves.When Allen and Terry start working on a case they have a lead in one they get to before other senior detectives do a really interesting detective story progresses that would not feel out of place in dramas like The French Connection 1971 or similar actiondetective movies to that nature.''When you do a comedy it does no good to reference comedies'' writer and director Adam McKay told Entertainment Weekly ''You want to treat it like a drama 80 of the way. Then at the last 20 you fk it up.The last 20 made this movie work naturally. More than that though Ferrell didn't get all the funny lines which is the mistake that many buddy cop movies such as the recent Cop Out 2010 make. Wahlberg is as intense as he usually is in most movies but he has laugh outloud hilarious lines that he plays effectively with a straight face. His line about being a peacock may make AFI's Most Memorable Movie Quote list in the next few years and the hot water his character got into in an incident involving Derek Jeter making a cameo as himself made the audience at my screening cheer. Of course I saw the movie in Boston but I'm just saying.However the 20 of the movie that was funny was further enhanced by the story. Again many buddy cop movies of recent years that have tried to be 48 Hours make the mistake of introducing the villain early on similar to a superhero comic book. This movie has you try to solve the mystery along with Ferrell and Wahlberg and there are some decent twists and turns that really make you wonder who the culprit is.I will say that the mystery was a bit confusing especially since it involves a Rupert MurdochmeetsDonaldTrump tycoon Steve Coogan and some financial plot. As a critic I could pretend to accurately interpret everything that I see on screen. However I'm not a Wall Street expert and numbers involved in trading stocks  bonds and all the rest confuse me. Nonetheless even if you watch this movie not knowing who's wrong or right and why you will still love the ride.The closing credits featured cleverlyanimated financial facts pertaining to the recent financial meltdown which appeared to be meticulously researched but still out of place. Their presence reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's antiNazi plea for humanity at the end of The Great Dictator 1941. His speech didn't fit the slapstick comedy of the first 90 of the movie but looking back it was still necessary to hear. I feel as though this montage of facts may have the same effect.Overall though The Other Guys is not just another movie. Some gags seemed a bit out of place and the tired plot point of the police chief pulling the main cops off the case still seeped its way into the story. However it helped that that chief was Michael Keaton in what could be a comeback performance and that he had some hysterical lines as well. The movie tells a great story everyone in the movie is funny without appearing to try too hard especially in Ferrell's case and the ensemble cast works together perfectly. In a year of mediocre nonanimated comedies The Other Guys lives up to its hype.".

If you are a fan of Will Ferrell's comedy and Mark Wahlberg then you will pretty much laugh throughout the film. Ferrell really gets to act like himself in this film. I mean he is playing a character but he gets to use his typical humor. Wahlberg plays a really angry cop and some of the things that come out of his mouth will really get you laughing. I actually laughed more at Wahlberg than Ferrell. Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are in the film a bit as the head cops like a newer Starsky and Hutch. They were entertaining. Eva Mendes plays Ferrell's wife and she is actually entertaining. Then the chief of the police station is played by Michael Keaton. Throughout the movie he kept quoting from the group TLC. He was actually also pretty funny. You will find yourself laughing a lot throughout the film. But there are some parts where they do try to be serious and most of the time it can be a turn off in a good comedy. There are some great one liners and scenes that will stick in your mind. So a pretty good comedy and I will end by saying I want to see Mark Mahlberg do more comedic roles because he is pretty good in them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Will Ferrell is back since the disappointing Land of the Lost! Who knew Mark Wahlberg could be genuinely hilarious? The Other Guys is the latest comedy to poke fun at the buddy cop genre but this one is one of the best because the actors and director knew what they were doing.Ferrell and Wahlberg have terrific chemistry and both of them have perfect comedic timing. But let's not forget the other supporting actors too many to list here as all of them have some memorable and quotable lines.The jokes weave through slapstick and crude territory while not being overly vulgar and overdone. The story is actually pretty engaging as it is a genuine cop mystery at its core but it is used as a vehicle for all the jokes to come in. And the jokes kept coming and had the entire audience laughing as well this one the loudest compared to the previous Steve Carell entries Date Night and Dinner For Schmucks. Sorry Steve this year Will and Mark stole the audience.Having said that the production design cinematography editing stuntsspecial effects are good and the direction by Adam McKay is lighthearted and brisk. McKay is seriously becoming a big name in comedy film directors and here is another memorable feather in his cap.Overall if you are in need of a laugh see this movie A.S.A.P. This one is one of the funniest movies in years and that's being honest.Overall rating 7310".

The only draw back was the length of the movie they could have trimmed it a bit but overall it's a solid summer comedy. Dare I say this was Will Ferrell's best performance since Anchorman.

	schema:headline " Everything you expect from Ferrell except with much more";
	schema:reviewBody "Just when you think you've seen one Will Ferrell movie you've seen them all think again. Try this on for size Usual Ferrell comedy plus crazy action plus subtle political and economical commentary plus excellent soundtrack. The Other Guys is a surprisingly hilarious and surprisingly actionpacked movie that will keep you entertained throughout without actually dumbing you down. Unlike most Will Ferrell movies you don't have to shut off your brain in this one you actually have to pay attention because aside from the comedy there is a complex crime to solve. Adam McKay delivers his best writing and directing performance while the excellent cast ranging from Ferrell to Wahlberg to Keaton provides plenty of laughs plenty of oneliners and plenty of entertaining moments that propel this movie past the slowest of scenes.The Other Guys is about two mismatched behindthescenes paperpushers Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg quietly investigating a series of suspicious events stemming from a unique bank robbery. Along the way they try to defeat their personal demons and try to figure out how to get along with each other. Unlike most Ferrell movies in which it's a simple concept and improv provides the filler material this movie actually has a mildly complex and heavy script but still gives the cast a chance for a little improvisation. Written by the director and also Chris Henchy I'll even go as far as to say that this among the best comedic scripts since last year's The Hangover. To add to that McKay and Henchy pull a neat trick by slowly feeding you some commentary about big business and its mannerisms. The last mainstream comedy to attempt this was the mildly underrated Fun with Dick and Jane remake with Jim Carrey.While this movie does not have the extensive magical gathering of comedians like Anchorman then again what movie does? the cast still does an excellent job bringing the comedy from the script to the screen. Will Ferrell is a little more toneddown this time but still has his usual moments screaming like a girl random quotes random singing quirky oneliners. Mark Wahlberg however steals the show with his angry lines his bitter delivery and his outbursts. The only thing hindering Wahlberg is the PG13 rating who knows what more classic lines he could have pulled off if he was allowed to go uncut Remember him in The Departed?. Smaller roles fill the bill in the laughs department including Eva Mendez beautiful as always Michael Keaton Steve Coogan Samuel L. Jackson Dwayne Johnson and the cameos.Even though Farrell has been hitandmiss with the public and the critics his best work always has been with Adam McKay. Anchorman Talladega Nights and Step Brothers were their previous collaborations and those three clearly top anything else Farrell has pulled off. The Other Guys in terms of directing and pacing dethrones them all. McKay does more than just handle the camera and let the actors mouth off he stages some great action sequences and does a fantastic job directing a slowmotion bar sequence that displays the coolest slomo effects since Zombieland. The first half was so overloaded with funny scenarios the audience very often was laughing so hard they missed the next couple of jokes while trying to recover from the last two. One scene in particular had the audience nearly drown out the sound of the audio coming from the movie.The first half was absolutely spectacular and downright comical the second half never had a chance to duplicate the magic of the first hour. This is where Adam Mckay's biggest issues have been in the final third of the flicks. All of McKay's movies lose steam and slow down towards the end preventing them from becoming eternal comedic classics. In the case of The Other Guys he improved a bit by still providing some of the laughs even though you will still feel the momentum slowly die down. The cop clichs while not taken seriously still mildly hindered the moments leading up to the climax. There were some unnecessary scenes a little bit of editing could have really helped this movie. But unlike the other movies the third act stays afloat thanks to the WahlbergFerrell mix as well as the continuing mystery that was slowly unfolding. Then stay tuned for the credits when the commentary rushes at you fullforce.Bottom Line Honestly I never thought that Will Ferrell would be involved with Mark Wahlberg a creative script hidden commentary that unveils itself when you least expect it and a soundtrack consisting of Rage against the Machine. Nonetheless the combination worked like a great mixed drink that has you asking for seconds and thirds. The oneliners are flying all over the place and so are the bullets. The Other Guys is the funniest movie of the year so far and clearly the best surprise we've had this summer. Adam McKay continues to claim the throne as the best comedic director in the business and this movie is more evidence. All McKay needs to do is cut back on the overall running time. This is the first Will Ferrell movie that you must pay close attention to in terms of visual humor and crimesolving and is overall one of his best movies.".

The last mainstream comedy to attempt this was the mildly underrated Fun with Dick and Jane remake with Jim Carrey.While this movie does not have the extensive magical gathering of comedians like Anchorman then again what movie does? the cast still does an excellent job bringing the comedy from the script to the screen. Will Ferrell is a little more toneddown this time but still has his usual moments screaming like a girl random quotes random singing quirky oneliners. Mark Wahlberg however steals the show with his angry lines his bitter delivery and his outbursts. The only thing hindering Wahlberg is the PG13 rating who knows what more classic lines he could have pulled off if he was allowed to go uncut Remember him in The Departed?. Smaller roles fill the bill in the laughs department including Eva Mendez beautiful as always Michael Keaton Steve Coogan Samuel L. Jackson Dwayne Johnson and the cameos.Even though Farrell has been hitandmiss with the public and the critics his best work always has been with Adam McKay. Anchorman Talladega Nights and Step Brothers were their previous collaborations and those three clearly top anything else Farrell has pulled off. The Other Guys in terms of directing and pacing dethrones them all. McKay does more than just handle the camera and let the actors mouth off he stages some great action sequences and does a fantastic job directing a slowmotion bar sequence that displays the coolest slomo effects since Zombieland. The first half was so overloaded with funny scenarios the audience very often was laughing so hard they missed the next couple of jokes while trying to recover from the last two. One scene in particular had the audience nearly drown out the sound of the audio coming from the movie.The first half was absolutely spectacular and downright comical the second half never had a chance to duplicate the magic of the first hour. This is where Adam Mckay's biggest issues have been in the final third of the flicks. All of McKay's movies lose steam and slow down towards the end preventing them from becoming eternal comedic classics. In the case of The Other Guys he improved a bit by still providing some of the laughs even though you will still feel the momentum slowly die down. The cop clichs while not taken seriously still mildly hindered the moments leading up to the climax. There were some unnecessary scenes a little bit of editing could have really helped this movie. But unlike the other movies the third act stays afloat thanks to the WahlbergFerrell mix as well as the continuing mystery that was slowly unfolding. Then stay tuned for the credits when the commentary rushes at you fullforce.Bottom Line Honestly I never thought that Will Ferrell would be involved with Mark Wahlberg a creative script hidden commentary that unveils itself when you least expect it and a soundtrack consisting of Rage against the Machine. Nonetheless the combination worked like a great mixed drink that has you asking for seconds and thirds. The oneliners are flying all over the place and so are the bullets. The Other Guys is the funniest movie of the year so far and clearly the best surprise we've had this summer. Adam McKay continues to claim the throne as the best comedic director in the business and this movie is more evidence. All McKay needs to do is cut back on the overall running time. This is the first Will Ferrell movie that you must pay close attention to in terms of visual humor and crimesolving and is overall one of his best movies.";

So when I saw a 7.1 I was expecting a fairly decent comedy out of two seasoned actors. However the movie fails on a number of counts1. Parts of the script play out like a broken tape recorder i.e. mind numbing repetition of the same lines and similar jokes. It's as if the script writer got permission to put only 10 funny lines in a comedy movie and tried to squeeze every last drop of humor out of them. Constant references to TLC Wahlberg's I'm a peacock line the constant portrayal of Will Ferrell as a paperpushing dork etc. made me feel like my mind was turning to mush as the movie progressed. 2. They weren't kidding when they rated it PG13 for crude ...language. The movie is overwrought with misogynistic comments and jokes. It literally reminded me of being in school watching a bunch of prepubescent guys belt out one liners likeI didn't know they sold tampons on wheels referring to the Red Prius that Will Ferrell drives or I feel like i'm sitting inside a va referring to the Prius again.Orgy loving hobos a grandma passing sexually explicit messages between her daughter and soninlaw etc etc etc. The list is long and I could go on all day. They really overdid it on that count. 3. The plot is weak and devoid of details. It looks like the filmmakers were hoping that no one would care about the story or central theme with the inyourface comedy. Ferrell and Wahlberg are paper pushing cops for feeble reasons that are revealed in the movie and really not worth my time to list who accidentally stumble into a case far larger than either of them imagined. Contrary to what the plot summary says nobody wants a part of this case and the only reason they get into it is because Ershon forgets to file for scaffolding permits for a few buildings he owns. Their investigation ruffles a few feathers and everything goes downhill from there. All of this while these two mismatched cops try to find themselves resolve their differences and fill the shoes of the two knuckle headed redbull high macho cops who randomly jump off a building at the beginning of the movie. Throw in a few car chases bullets flying willynilly and a stupid wooden gun that Will Ferrell totes around which is supposed to be soooooo funny for some reason and that's the summary of this movie for you. Don't waste your time with this one unless.... actually don't waste your time on this movie period.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there's one thing I grow tired of it's people posting a Worst Movie Ever!!!! thread in pretty much every forum on IMDb. No matte whether it's Avatar The Godfather or Transformers it's apparently the worst thing put on celluloid. With statements like that you need to consider some things Amongst others What are your guidelines? For example I absolutely consider the Twilight movies amongst the worst pieces of crap ever made but they are masterpieces compared to the AsylumSyfy movies that are constantly spewn out...Does that make them good movies? No horrible movies but ones that needs to be measured a bit differently.With that said. I hate The Other Guys and it's one if not THE worst mainstream movie I've ever seen. It's misogynistic crude stupid pointless annoying badly written and with acting that would embarrass a Porn Actor. When you have seven good actors in this movieKeaton Wahlberg Jackson Johnson Mendes Coogan and Stevenson and you kill of the two who could have brought some fun into this movie within ten minutesJackson and Johnson you better damn well make sure your replacements are up to it. Guess what? They aren't. Wahlberg can be excellent but here he's whiny and with the emotional range of Seagal. I'm a peacock! Let me fly! Yeah dude...If you're as homophobic as you pretend to be...Lay off that comparison. It's stupid. Ferrell...If there is another comedian as unfunny as him this side of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson then humanity is in deep sht. Nothing he says does or tries to get across is funny. His acting is ISpeakWithAMonotonousVoiceLikeThisHaHa or BLARGHABLBLAAAA!!!!! . Stevenson is surprisingly adept as the violent bad guy in the movie I just wish he'd shot the Other Guys when spotting them. Mendes is...Urgh a supermodel hottie who takes verbal abuse from her husband and smiles...And shows him her tits to motivate him at work. Keaton oh poor Keaton...Why? Why are you in this?The Comedy The only thing I giggled at is the vulgar crudeness of the hobos having an orgy in the car and the dedication they show to do it again. It's stupid and preteen stuff but it is just too idiotic not to chuckle at. Pretty much every other joke doesn't fall flat...It smashes through the ground yodeling while doing so.Action ...It's a stupid silly action comedy. Macguyver had better stuff than this.Story Inept silly stupid. Words that sound familiar by now? They should. The plot isn't really there it's mostly trying to find somewhere to sneak in in between a mix of stupid scenes.Overall I hate the guys who made this movie I hate the actors for being in it and I HATE the pretentious sods who gave this move such high a score. You make even Uwe Boll cry!".

	schema:reviewBody "We went to see The Other Guys following a funeral. We were looking for something funny and uplifting and had very low expectations of The Other Guys. The Other Guys failed to deliver on any positive level. Let's go through the reasons why. 1. When 2 of your 6 best actors are killed off in the first 5 minutes you minimize the number of actors left to carry a movie. 2. When your only funny interaction between actors is between the male lead and the female lead and it lasts for only 5 minutes of the movie you minimize the number of laughs your comedy can have. And finally 3. when you put every single laugh into the trailer and leave absolutely zero remaining laughs for the other 102 of the 107 minutes of the movie the audience will not laugh and will look for a way to leave the theater. I personally saw at least 2 separate groups of people leave and never return. My wife asked me numerous times Is this ever going to get funny. This movie failed on so many levels with what should have been a great cast. Wahlberg was terrible Mendes only was on screen for 5 minutes Michael Keaton was given very little to work with and Ferrell was lost in a pool of Huh? This movie left me with questions though... why didn't they keep Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock alive and have them compete against the other guys? Why didn't they have Mendes on screen more? Why didn't they remember to include any laughs in the movie? Questions all left with no easily found answers. To say this movie is a waste of your money is one thing but to know that it was a waste of almost two hours of your life much worse.".

	schema:headline " HalfBaked Cop Buddy Picture";
	schema:reviewBody "Saturday Night Live comedian Will Ferrell has made a mint out of playing morons. He delivers another hilarious performance as a moronic New York Police Department detective in Talladega Nights director Adam McKay's The Other Guys an ambitious but halfbaked parody of slambang police thrillers. Oscar nominated actor Mark Wahlberg of The Departed costars as Ferrell's pugnacious NYPD partner. Unfortunately Wahlberg displays none of Ferrell's comic genius. Nothing Wahlberg does registers as remotely amusing. He is either screaming at Ferrell out of spite or skewering his partner's masculinity. Wahlberg appears to be channeling Joe Pesci from the Martin Scorsese classics Goodfellas and Casino. Alas Wahlberg is no Pesci. The funniest thing next to Ferrell is the nonstop ridicule reserved for our hero's red Prius. One cop calls it a 'tampon on wheels.' Surprisingly the car is far funnier than Wahlberg. McKay and Land of the Lost scenarist Chris Henchy struggle with little success to combine a formulaic police buddy picture comedy with a complex whitecollar crime conspiracy involving a shady investment banker. Think of The Other Guys as a mediocre Police Academy wannabe with half of the laughs. Primarily the humor grows out of the irony that a couple of pencilpushing desk jockeys replace two loosecannon celebrity crime busters as the top cops in the Big Apple. The stunt work is terrific. The opening gag where a heroic pair of testosteronedriven cops crash their sports car into a doubledecker bus to arrest several shooters for a misdemeanor amount of narcotics is impressive. Alas McKay and Henchy make some poor narrative choices. First they kill off the two most charismatic characters Highsmith and Danson and then struggle to replace them with two boring morons.NYPD Detectives P.K. Highsmith Samuel L. Jackson of Pulp Fiction and Christopher Danson Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson of The Tooth Fairy are a macho pair of Lethal Weapon cops who refuse to let details complicate their roguish antics. Although they make spectacular arrests they also create spectacular property damage. Nevertheless everybody loves them so they can flout the rules. As The Other Guys opens Highsmith and Danson are in hot pursuit of a gang armed with assault rifles. Danson has jumped atop their Escalade but he doesn't stick around long after they perforate the roof. Danson dives back onto Highsmith's car bounds off the hood onto the roof and slings himself back into the front passenger seat. The villains blast Highsmith's car so the hood flies back against the windshield and blinds them. Highsmith shoots off the hood hinge. Too late! He plows into a doubledecker bus as the villains appear to get away. Danson commandeers the doubledecker bus with Highsmith's car still stuck in it. Danson careens after the hoods whips the doubledecker around and the maneuver launches Highsmith's car at the hoods with Highsmith blasting away with two pistols. After Highsmith and Danson receive their medals Precinct Captain Gene Mauch Michael Keaton of Batman solicits somebody to complete their paper work. These two cops have never wasted their time with paperwork. Detective Allen Gamble snaps at the opportunity to polish off the Highsmith and Danson paperwork. Not long afterward Highsmith and Danson leap to their deaths when trying to thwart a team of acrobats who wield a wrecking ball to smash their way into a jewelry store and heist 79thousand in stones. Nobody knows why Highsmith and Danson jumped from 20 stories up and hit the cement hard.A milquetoast forensic accountant who prefers to file paperwork Gamble Will Ferrell of Old School likes to hum the S.W.A.T. theme and stay in the precinct office rather than nab bad guys on the streets. His idea of busting loose is to floor the gas pedal of his Prius and play the Little River Band. Allen's partner Detective Terry Hoitz Mark Wahlberg of Date Night is just the opposite. Terry dreams of making the big bust. He suspects drug deals behind every crime. Sadly Terry has been confined to a desk and stuck with Allen. The skeleton in Terry's closet is he accidentally shot New York Yankees baseball slugger Derek Jeter in the leg during the seventh game of the World Series. Yes the Yankees lost! Everybody in the precinct now calls Terry 'the Yankee Clipper.' Naturally Terry hates Allen but he lives by the venerable partner's code which requires a partner to back up his partner no matter what the circumstance. Ironically Allen's obsession with paper work prompts them to arrest British investment banker Sir David Ershon Steve Coogan of Tropic Thunder who is up to his chin in a grand scheme to steal 32billion from the NYPD Pension Fund to cover the loses of another Wall Street titan.The best scene between Ferrell and Wahlberg is the lionversusthetuna tale. Terry tells Allen that if he were a lion he would rip him to shreds as easily as a lion could a tuna. Terry destroys the lack of logic in Terry's threat with own flawed logic. He claims that the tuna would gang up on the lion. Later they would construct an oxygen apparatus to allow them to live out of water so they could stalk and attack lions on dry land. The running joke throughout The Other Guys is nerdy Allen is a babe magnet. Sexy chicks come on to him and ignore Terry. Terry is floored when he meets Allen's hot chick wife Dr. Shelia Gamble Eva Mendez of Training Day who is crazy about her husband. The Other Guys swerves erratically between scenes of Allen and Terry bonding to the chaos they create after they arrest Ershon. The Grand Theft Auto chases the blazing gunfights and the audacious wrecking ball jewelry heist look cool but these scenes seem out of place in this lackluster buddy comedy. Ultimately The Other Guys runs out of both momentum and laughs long before it runs out of plot.".

The running joke throughout The Other Guys is nerdy Allen is a babe magnet. Sexy chicks come on to him and ignore Terry. Terry is floored when he meets Allen's hot chick wife Dr. Shelia Gamble Eva Mendez of Training Day who is crazy about her husband. The Other Guys swerves erratically between scenes of Allen and Terry bonding to the chaos they create after they arrest Ershon. The Grand Theft Auto chases the blazing gunfights and the audacious wrecking ball jewelry heist look cool but these scenes seem out of place in this lackluster buddy comedy. Ultimately The Other Guys runs out of both momentum and laughs long before it runs out of plot.";

There is never a connection between Ferrell and Wahlberg neither comedically or as partners on the police force nor is there a connection with the supporting cast. The entire movie seems disjointed and boring with a few funny parts thrown in to keep you from walking out on the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "This could have been a real disaster and even though the movie triggered a couple of cringes it wasn't the expected trainwreck. Derrida was not too much of a waste. Thinking is a very difficult subject for a documentary. When filmmakers decide they want to present a great thinker they are presented with a difficult decision should they make a straightforward documentary concerned only with transmitting knowledge or should they use the form to reflect the content of the thinker's work? Is accessiblity the goal of a documentary? And how much can we dilute for accessiblity's sake? I think this is one of the few cases where striking a balance between a dichotomy doesn't work. In Derrida the directors were trying to experiment with form and create a new audience for Derrida's work. They wanted to document Derrida's thinking. They wanted to archive the man's presense and present Derrida to a new audience. However they felt that using the standard documentarybiography format would make Derrida's work superficially accessible. They didn't want to commit such an insult. Yet they were not willing to alienate the audience. Thus Derrida only registers as a lukewarm essay. The directors took an approach that is sold on today's market as Selfreflexivity the dummy's guide to artsy. Derrida is a series of vignettes where Derrida explains his relationship to the camera and the process by which his presence is recorded. It is a total exercise in metadiscourse and unfortunately this theme provides plenty of stupid irritating gimmicks with which Derrida proves not your standard documentary but your undergraduate film school festival The rewarding aspects of this film are not the formal experiments or anything relating to the fact that Derrida is presented as a moving image but rather watching Derrida speak about the camera the archive or the image. There are some excellent shots of Derrida at work. We witness his careful footwork in the field of discourse and the director chooses the very potent passages to outline Derrida's duties as performer for no one and the role of the filmmaker in using Derrida's words to present her story. However the director tells no story. The film offers very little beyond problematizing the roles of the actors in this production of Derrida. And I think what was presented would be best preserved in an essay than the series of vignettes called Derrida.".

Add to this there are three cameras filming at the same time frequently when Derrida is in a small room so that the cameras spend most of the time filming each other. This puts Derrida on the back foot to use a cricketing term. They fill out the rest of the documentary with footage of him walking or spreading butter on his toast. Quotes are read out from his books that mainly relate to autobiography but even this simple task is messed up with poor delivery.".

	schema:reviewBody "A documentary can never be anything other than a director's interpretation of the subject. Making a documentary about a philosopher is a particularly difficult proposition with most other subjects we welcome and enjoy varying interpretations but with philosophy we tend to resist variance because the very aim of philosophy at least until PostStructuralists came along has always been to arrive at the Truth. The challenge of a filmmaker here is that either you properly understand the philosopher or you may potentially embarrass yourself though for the audience either way could be interesting.Derrida a documentary by the established filmmaker Kirby Dick and a former student of Jacques Derrida Amy Ziering Kofman attempts to deconstruct the idea of biography itself but it fails to do so. It takes only the trappings of deconstruction stripped of its objectives and applies it as an editorial gimmick by constantly reminding the audience of the film's own awareness of itself. It frequently steps back in an effort to show its selfawareness but it actually deconstructs nothing. For example we see Derrida watching himself being interviewed and later we see him watching this very footage thereby creating the effect of two facing mirrors with infinite reflections.The objective of deconstruction is to decenter that is to identify the center of the argumentor of the proposed truththat it relies on in order to make its case. You may argue here that I have just made a logocentric statement by defining what deconstruction is that I have just centered the definition of deconstruction note the appearance here of stepping back you are right and I'm leaving it at that because I'm only a hack philosopher.. The film did not succeed in decentering anything not the philosopher the medium the filmmakers themselves nor the film itself.Throughout the film the narrator reads excerpts from his books against the backdrop of abstract footage of Derrida's face and his surroundings. This effectively makes Derrida the chief storyteller of the film. Instead of presenting the filmmakers' interpretations they hide behind the power of his words taking no chances at misinterpretation. Derrida is involuntarily made to be the center that secures and stabilizes the film. Ironically this film that supposedly tries to explore deconstructionism and apply its tools to the medium of filmmaking finds a secure center in Derrida and he is left undeconstructed.We can feel the insecurity of the filmmakers in often not knowing what to ask their subject. Derrida out of his affection for the filmmaker tries hard to turn Kofman's dull questions into something more interesting. The camera in effect takes on the perspective of someone who adores him like a rock star. If the film were aware of its own insecurity it would have been more interesting. Instead it simply hides behind its own reverence and awe of the famous philosopher.One way to achieve this deconstruction would have been to hire multiple filmmaking crews where each goes off in its own direction and presents a 20 minute piece each. The chances are each will draw a very different picture of Derrida. By presenting them in sequence the audience will wonder who Derrida really is and they will inevitably question the process of documentary filmmaking itself thereby deconstructing not only the idea of Derrida but also the idea of documentary.Although I have always been an admirer of Ryuichi Sakamoto his music in this movie was superfluous. The power of his music attached unnecessary and often inappropriate emotional values to the images of Derrida. I can't see any justification for emotionally manipulating the audience in this film unless it was to deconstruct the use of music in film which it did not.Towards the end of the movie Derrida tells Amy Ziering Kofman that this will be a good autobiography for her. It should have been but unfortunately it isn't a biography for either Derrida or Kofman. What this movie is to Derrida's philosophy is analogous to what music video is to a piece of music the imagery is only superficially juxtaposed to his ideas. It is no more than a pretty way to listen to his words.One redeeming quality of this movie was that I got to see and hear him speak for the first time. After all I'm a sucker for fame too. If I made a documentary about him I'm sure I would have been just as nervous and insecure if not more. In that sense I have to praise the filmmakers for attempting.".

I was shocked and appalled that they praised this movie which is nothing short of ludicrous and absurd. Most of the critics lost complete perspective in their zeal to learn more about Derrida a man who they know little about personally and fail to criticize the film which really is a whole group of missed opportunities and is done in very amateurish fashion.There are some golden moments but they are few and far between and could easily have been summarized in a 15 minute documentary rather than a full feature that seems only to try to prove by deconstructing the documentary process that it is virtually impossible to do a documentary because the subject is aware of the camera and then doesn't act completely naturally. Unfortunately the producers ram this point home with inane superfluous shots of life designed to illustrate a phrase that a reader read in new age monotone thus failing to even attempt to capture much of the mystery that the man is shrouded within and focus more on vague abstract clips. Quite frankly I thought the film was somewhat insulting to Derrida. I wasn't sure if many moments were an attempt to provide comedy in the film to keep the audience interested at the expense of the subject.The critics can spout abstract praise and make comments about philosophy and deconstructionism hoping to feel a superior thinker to the audience but what this comes down to unfortunately is a very poor film with little preparation poor questions no follow up no direction at all regardless of the mystery of deconstruction isn't the point of most films to captivate the audience? that will only be interesting for fans of Derrida who want to see a little bit of this man's personality  and even that is limited.

What point does showing this have other than to say yes the 'genius' does actually do normal things inbetween spouting nonsense.The voice over narration was also a load of rubbishtrying to be poetic but highly pretentious and irritating.The only slightly touching moment was when he discarded his nonsense talking to reveal his experiences of anti semitic abuse as a school boy in Algeria.On the whole a pretty dire film Derrida had no humor or wit to him he just seemed to be stuck in a drab world still holding onto the theories of deconstruction that made his name decades ago.Watch some paint dry instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just got back from the Nuart word up LA! where I saw Derrida. For fairness I must disclose that my entire family is french I speak fluently but I have lived here since i was 6 and everybody considers me an american. So onto the review.What a crummy flic. The movie follows the life of Jacques Derrida the father of Deconstructionist philosophy.  Well in good documentaries you get to see all sides of an issue in fact usually you have an issue presented.  In The Trials of Henry Kissinger caught that at Nuart 2 weeks ago they have Al Haig being cut to Chris Hitchens cut to Kissinger cut to the Chilean ambassador.  Now obviously the filmaker is going to try to make you lean one way in your decicion but you still get to make a decision you feel that you've been informed on all sides and get to choose an appropriate belief in some idea that the movie is about.Not so here.  For a movie about a philospher no other philospher is interviewed at all.  Critics? Do they exist?  If you dont know Deconstruction before you go in you wont know a thing about it when you leave.The director wasted Derrida's time and her backer's money.  The footage seems to have been taken over many many years I write this November 8 2002 and Derrida is seen hearing reports of the Rwanda massacres  I believe those were in 1994 is so raw as to be terrible.  I think that the directorproducers thought that they could stick a camera on this guy and edit it to a documentary.  There is no research whatsoever.  There are no critics of deconstruction there are many many out there.  The questions she the director asks are pitful and stupid and what I expect a student would ask when put on the spot.The only interesting question and it put derrida on the spot was asked by some random voice offscreen which philospher would derrida like to have had as his mom.I had many problems with the 'comedy' of this picture.  People laughed a lot at times and things I thought wern't funny at all but the editordirector framed to be. The director's accent is so bad that derrida couldn't understand whether she was asking about l'amour or l'amort. Reading that you can see how he would be confused and would keep asking her which one.  but the english subtitles say love and death over and over so people dont get his confusion. seems trivial but they kept doing this. and people kept laughing whenThe absolute worst parts of the movie are random shots with voiceovers reading from derrida's work.  they are horrendous.  what happened to the director's producers?  How could they let her put these in? example one of them is a zoomed in view on dv of hebrew tombs.  but you can only see a few letters at a time and the camera shifts like crazy up and down tombstone to tombstone.  it is so distracting you have to close your eyes to focus on the vo which are very difficult to understand in the first place  very very very VERY difficult.  This happens over and over with these voice overs.  The director had to fill a lot of time.  I mean there are long shots of a fax machine shot up close.  of derrida's cat no idea why.And I dont want to hear how this was about him and not deconstruction. you learn nothing about the guy. He's secretive? than ask other people. doing some flippin' research.i voted and gave it a 3".

	schema:reviewBody "A friend who was very influenced by Derrida asked me if I wanted to come along and see the film. I didn't know who he was and was very enthusiastic to see this film. I read the 3 preceding reviews here at the IMDB after seeing the film and I'll say that the gross mediocrity of this film is summed up with perfection by those reviewers. It was glaringly obvious that the producers were completely unprepared had absolutely no agenda and I could not figure out what they hoped to accomplish with this film. Was it to praise or mock Derrida? It was a 90 minute attempt to be stylish with no substance at all. I had no idea what the film was trying to accomplish except dropping in a 85 minute take of film with words spoken at certain parts in an attempt to show style and a few other obvious superficial attempts at style.Not once was there a discussion or revelation as to what made Derrida such a legend at least so I'm told little if anything about is family life except at in the last third of the film and the clips that were edited in made him appear like an incorrigible Frenchman with a sense of humor which he may be but I got the picture very early on in the film. There is an attempt to do a chronological bio by taking his books I presume and reading a passage from them in an asympathetic new age monotone and attempting to show some brilliant connection between the quote and the scene in the film. But there really was no order and the scenes shown largely go unexplained. Sometimes they are a superficial illustration in Derrida's life of the simple quote. Nothing worthwhile just style.The questions asked to Derrida were general inane questions with not a single followup. When Derrida answers he's frequently annoyed answering such general stuff there is an obvious follow up question each time that is NEVER asked. The best one is when Derrida rambles about how he'd love to know more about philosopers' personal lives because its so strange that they never speak about them. Funny because this film doesn't really say much at all about Derrida's personal life and Derrida himself admits several times he has a hard time talking about it at all. Refused to actually. Does the interviewer ever ask why he is so intensely secretive about many things like other philosophers? NO!!!! Instead we get several clips of what a sample lecture is like with a student asking a very simple question but making it sound as obtuse complicated and deep as possible. Ugghh.How stylish was this movie? The first 15 minutes are spent with a drive through Paris with constant cuts of different news clips saying that Derrida is a modern genius thinker etc. etc. and father of deconstructionism. Do we ever find out why? No.The camera wobbled throughout the entire film. Things were out of focus at times. I was so surprised that out of all the hours shot Derrida even talks about the camera crew following him for 2 weeks they chose this stuff to put in.Unfortunately I know very little more now about Derrida than I did when I came in. My friend enjoyed the opportunity to actually see the man and what he was like on the screen but felt the same as I did. It was as though there was a camera crew commissioned to shoot some footage and then it was thrown together in a hurry. Disappointing. Missed opportunities. I really went into this film wanting to like it and feel like someone fleeced me of 10 and dropped me off a home film that has never been edited. And I'm an optimist!!!!".

Maybe those ideas are over the film makers' heads?  I guess I'll have to go to the library and check out a few books on the Master in order to see what he is all about.  I certainly didn't get it from this film.";

Granted there are certain questions I might have asked him that the interviewers didn't but I definitely wasn't left unsatisfied. I think anyhow who can get over that egoism should enjoy the film. There are very poignant moments and especially encountering Derrida in a real setting seeing the man at work. The movie itself addresses the notion of biography and how by nature it is incomplete. It is a great way to encounter his ideas I think. There are certain mindsets and expectations that won't be satisfied with this film but I think in general if one sets realistic expectations for this cinema verite they won't be disappointed.

For this reason Derrida makes a clear distinction between L'Amour De Quelqu'un and L'Amour De Quelque chose love for somebody and love for something. He illustrates this notion with a profound question ? Estce qu'on aime quelqu'un ou estce qu'on aime quelque chose en quelqu'un ?

In theory this could be an interesting question to see how he talks about popular culture. Except that Derrida hadn't even heard of Seinfeld and didn't really have anything interesting to say about it. I don't fault Derrida for not having heard of Seinfeld but I do fault the filmmakers for putting such an inconsequential exchange in their movie.As others have noted we also get a lot of fauxdeep scenes of Derrida going about his daily business walking down the street getting a haircut making his breakfast etc.. which don't add up to a whole lot.Still I have to admit I did find a few scenes interesting here and there.

Turan as a reviewer is usually quite perceptive however in this one I think he missed it.  Upon arriving at the theater I was very excited because the two Directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman were to be hosting tonight's viewing at the Nuart Theater in West Los Angeles.  And from then on began the decent into maelstrom.The movie begins with a taste of hope.  Its rough textured video blurring an urban landscape all to the tune of Derrida's ramblings about something. The movie never really takes off from there.  It then cuts to what turns out to be its anthem.  The mundane and impersonal life of Jacques Derrida. And as I write this I would like to make clear that by all means Jacques Derrida's life is not mundane nor does he ramble into oblivion.  And it would have been nice to see a documentary that suits him he deserves one.But what make his life or the portrayal of his life completely soulless are directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman.  It seems that the two went into this documentary with absolutely no agenda.  The film just goes about showing the man move about the house and speak to classes and friends. Which could work in any normal documentary but these are the most impersonal moments they could have shown.  And somehow they maintained this for five years thinking that they were doing something.In speaking with the two afterwards which allowed one to see just how pretentious and disillusioned the two exist as they boasted about how they edited over one hundred hours of footage into an eightfive minute 'piece' as they call it.  What baffles me about this is that with all that material what they showed seemed to be such a disservice.  Perhaps the only relief is went Derrida speaks freely. But even then the film is minced with cutaways of the directors smearing their signature over it.  The most insulting part about the event was that when Dick and Kofman spoke to the audience answering questions they intellectualized this all.  Somehow they all thought there was artistic merit to the lifeless nature of their work rather than an unintentional defacing and humiliation to Mr. Derrida. But what should he care?  Being one of the fathers of Deconstruction his identity does not exist within Dick and Kofman's deranged portrait.".

	schema:reviewBody "right off the bat let me say write that i had expectations of a more clinical examination of the thoughts of derrida rather than a look at his life and thoughts in a personal documentary more like stevie than what you might see on pbs. a lot of the first part of the film is dedicated to examining what heidegger once said about a philosopher's biography  the important things are he was born he thought he died...everything else being anecdotes and details. well this documentary seemed to have more of those anecdotes and details than i think derrida or heidegger would have liked but maybe that was the filmmakers' way of challenging this notion. the point of the quote is that on the one hand you can't get to know someone through incidental stories about their childhood but on the other hand th is is what storytelling and filmmaking especially documentary filmmaking is often about. derrida rightly observes too that the film is more of a signature of the filmmakers than a biography of himself. so i'll go on now to examine the filmmakers...like i mentioned before i wish there had been more focus on the ideas of derrida in a linear or instructive fashion. i expected to gain a better understanding of the main tenets of his philosophy. but as an example differance which i know to be a large motif in his deconstruction was mentioned only once...fifteen minutes before the ending of the film. that main disappointment aside the film was well done. i do feel i know derrida better. his ideas are still murky but in seeing how he answers questions or examines his body parts specifically his eyes and hands i got a good idea of how he thinks which in a lot of ways is more important than WHAT he thinks. the most interesting idea that i picked up in the film wasn't derridean ? at all  it was an ancient greekroman ? story of echo and narcissus. i think i had heard the story many years ago but i didn't remember anything about it until he retold it. echo was doomed to only repeat the last part of what other people said. eventually she used this curse to adopt a language based upon what narcissus said...combining the end of certain words that narcissus used to form her own language. philosophically it's interesting because it speaks to several ideas  we're just repeating that which has already been said everything beyond plato is a footnote nothing new under the sun we are all so intrinsically connected to that which came before us that improvisation as derrida calls it is impossible but should still be sought after. it's a story that's ripe with meaning. i took it as a justification for hiphop as a viable form of music. hiphop artists manipulate musical language the same way that echo did. derrida and other deconstructionalists would likely point out that hiphop artists are just one step closer to echo than other artists who try to hide their references or influences. anyone who understands music knows that if you're going to get on public enemy's case for sampling then it's a slippery slope before you start criticizing elvis the beatles and everyone else. you can argue over the degrees but i don't think you can knock the entire practice. at any rate the film is good precisely because it incites this kind of thought. though i went into it expecting a schooling i came out wiser precisely because it sought not to lecture. an interviewer asks him a question about the philosophy of seinfeld and how it might be seen as deconstructionalist. he had never heard of seinfeld but said that deconstruction isn't about watching sitcoms. people should read and do their homework instead. i give it a solid B.".

	onyx:emotionText "right off the bat let me say write that i had expectations of a more clinical examination of the thoughts of derrida rather than a look at his life and thoughts in a personal documentary more like stevie than what you might see on pbs. a lot of the first part of the film is dedicated to examining what heidegger once said about a philosopher's biography  the important things are he was born he thought he died...everything else being anecdotes and details. well this documentary seemed to have more of those anecdotes and details than i think derrida or heidegger would have liked but maybe that was the filmmakers' way of challenging this notion. the point of the quote is that on the one hand you can't get to know someone through incidental stories about their childhood but on the other hand th is is what storytelling and filmmaking especially documentary filmmaking is often about. derrida rightly observes too that the film is more of a signature of the filmmakers than a biography of himself. so i'll go on now to examine the filmmakers...like i mentioned before i wish there had been more focus on the ideas of derrida in a linear or instructive fashion. i expected to gain a better understanding of the main tenets of his philosophy. but as an example differance which i know to be a large motif in his deconstruction was mentioned only once...fifteen minutes before the ending of the film. that main disappointment aside the film was well done. i do feel i know derrida better. his ideas are still murky but in seeing how he answers questions or examines his body parts specifically his eyes and hands i got a good idea of how he thinks which in a lot of ways is more important than WHAT he thinks. the most interesting idea that i picked up in the film wasn't derridean ? at all  it was an ancient greekroman ? story of echo and narcissus. i think i had heard the story many years ago but i didn't remember anything about it until he retold it. echo was doomed to only repeat the last part of what other people said. eventually she used this curse to adopt a language based upon what narcissus said...combining the end of certain words that narcissus used to form her own language. philosophically it's interesting because it speaks to several ideas  we're just repeating that which has already been said everything beyond plato is a footnote nothing new under the sun we are all so intrinsically connected to that which came before us that improvisation as derrida calls it is impossible but should still be sought after. it's a story that's ripe with meaning. i took it as a justification for hiphop as a viable form of music. hiphop artists manipulate musical language the same way that echo did. derrida and other deconstructionalists would likely point out that hiphop artists are just one step closer to echo than other artists who try to hide their references or influences. anyone who understands music knows that if you're going to get on public enemy's case for sampling then it's a slippery slope before you start criticizing elvis the beatles and everyone else. you can argue over the degrees but i don't think you can knock the entire practice. at any rate the film is good precisely because it incites this kind of thought. though i went into it expecting a schooling i came out wiser precisely because it sought not to lecture. an interviewer asks him a question about the philosophy of seinfeld and how it might be seen as deconstructionalist. he had never heard of seinfeld but said that deconstruction isn't about watching sitcoms. people should read and do their homework instead. i give it a solid B.";

	schema:reviewBody "I loved Ryan Reynold's Van Wilder and I also liked Van Wilder 2 Rise Of Taj as Kal Penn is one of the funniest actors out there. My friend gave this to me to watch as he found it to be very funny and he knew that I liked the first two movies. But Van Wilder 3 is just a cheap spinoff of the franchise to make more money by using the name of Van Wilder. Standing on its own this wouldn't even have made as much money as it did on the name of the franchise.This film is a prequel of the first movie and starts by introducing Van Wilder Jonathan Bennett when he is in freshman year at Coolidge College. The college is run under the strict Dean Charles Reardon Kurt Fuller who is also a military guy. There is not much fun in the college no parties no kissing on campus and Van Wilder wants to liberate his college from sexual oppression and party dysfunction. He also meets a girl Kaitlin Hays Kristin Cavallari who is very sexy beautiful and she wants to be in the military! But he is head over heels in love with her though she already has a boyfriend who is the dean's pet and training for the military. So begins Van Wilder's journey into the as yet unknown for him Coolidge College.The first thing that hits you right in the face is Jonathan Bennett's immense effort to look and act like Ryan Reynolds one of my favourite actors. Because lets face it he probably isn't that good an actor by himself. Also Kristin Cavallari is insanely sexy and hot. Instead of every other girl being naked she should have been naked. It would have worked just fine for me. Kurt Fuller is a guy I have seen in so many movies and TV shows but I never knew the guy's name. He is a pretty good actor just doesn't work for this movie. But I loved his portrayal of Zacharaiah in 'Supernatural'. The plot is the same as in many other college movies of this kind and the first Van Wilder movie also. I have no problem with that but in that movie Van Wilder is actually a compassionate human being rather than an all out party and sex animal. Here we have his two friends one a pothead Jamaican and the other is a Chinese named Yu Dumb Fok Ha ha! so funny not. There is also his dog Collosus's origin story here! There were some pretty hilarious moments though the dildos beneath the bench at church was awesome the dog sucking the Dean was funny too. Other than that this was just another excuse to get girls naked and a cheap ripoff the Van Wilder franchise.410".

Congratulations this is one of the rare movies that I couldn't watch to the end and I watch a lot of horrible movies during my work at the video store.3 guys an ultra cool but subtlety homosexual guy a pothead who thinks he is Jamaican and of course what else the foreigner this time he is Chinese. They are against the evil ones Dean of the army colleague and his dominions army lieutenant's. Sounds familiar? Yeah? Thats because the movie is total ripoff from Police academy and Nationa lampoons Animal house. Remember the scene when officer Mahoney was having a blowjob during his speech? We have that. The strict female instructor? We have that here. The list goes on and on. I would like to say that movie is just one sketch after another but i cannot because sketches should be funny this is just sad. Through all the movie Wilder tries to show how supremely ultra mega cool is. In my college he would probably get murdered the first week. The actor who portrays Van Wilder does really really extremely poor job. He tries to impersonate Ryan Reynolds so desperately every second of the movie that he of course like every really bad actor overdoes it and his thinking poses and eye swishing left to right and back make him look like homosexual schizophrenic. Other actor are not much better but at least not so annoying. The best actor I would say in these movie is the golf cart. Oh yes and the lame scenes vibrators under church singers chairs dog blowing of dean dog feces on faces of soldiers.... Do you see where I am aiming at? Perhaps this movie is meant only for mentally retarded or old under 14 years that should explain a lot.I thought that Road trip 2 was the worst movie in the world and it was until I actually saw this. I had to stop the movie someone in the middle because i was going to puke otherwise. I had bad taste in the mouth so I had to watch Wild Geese and Rio Bravo to regain my manliness and will to live.This movie made me sad because Germany didn't win in ww2.".

This was just a way to use the Van Wilder name to make a ton of money off the DVD because it would do terrible with another name. The original was great and trying to bank of a success is just stupid when it comes to this series. Its not the worst sequel i have ever seen or the worst teen movie but its up with the worst. It would have been a lot better it was another spin off and not a prequel. The prequel method of movies is one of the worst a series can suffer from. My final thoughts are if your a fan of the original just leave this on the shelfs and don't worry about seeing it it will be on TV soon enough anyway.".

While the original used eccentric characters and outlandish situations as springboards for humor this one just goes deep into Bizzaro World a college run by its ROTC director who has posted No Partying and No Kissing signs and can involuntarily enroll students in ROTC?.Bennett decently mimicked Reynolds but he didn't have the same charisma. Cavallari was charismatic though and I liked her as the love interest. Meredith Giangrande was downright sexy as forbidden fruit Eve.If you love being grossed out this film ups the ante from the first one on the disgusting factor although that's not particularly my thing. I do have to say however that the softporn aspects of this film are better than the original. There are scenes involving girls with vibrators and a sexed class that illustrates intriguing positions although with clothes on but still which may almost make you forget you're watching a comedy.".

And I will actually go as far as to say that you should definitely not view this as a prequel to the 2002 movie. Instead view it as a standalone movie that has no ties to the 2002 movie.This movie relies on cheap laughs which are brought about mostly by humor well below the belt. But many times this humor just doesn't really come through properly. So it seems that it is the result of some halfhearted script writing.The storyline in Van Wilder Freshman Years is just not a very interesting or original one. It is all something that essentially has been seen before in similar late teen comedies. So don't count on originality being the key ingredient in this movie.For a comedy of this type then Van Wilder Freshman Years was less than mediocre.

I could not understand what was was so novel about the 2002 movie that people made a big deal out of it. There was hardly any adult humour and it just focused on a love story. 'Freshman year' the third in the series ventures more in slapstick and sex comedy. his I have no issues with but throughout the movie I couldn't help but notice there was a 'police academy' feeling present. Even the first scene was very reminiscent of Mahoney's classic bj scene. If you're expecting a plot you will be disappointed. There is a love story and it enters half the way in to the movie. Prior to that we are entertained by Jonathan 'big eyebrows' Bennett who entertains us with his crude and dirty gimmicks. There isn't much to explain this movie's relevance as a prequel because I don't think anybody would care. Kristin Cavelleri is nice eye candy. She gives good support and I fail to understand why she couldn't bag more film roles because she has clearly displays acting ability apart from good looks. Ken Fuller is again as his usual best. Supporting cast are okay. In general worth seeing if you enjoy mindless comedy gags.".

Kurt Fuller Steve Talley and Nic Nac oh and of course Colossus The dog.This is the typical teen type movie that Hollywood has been putting out it is probably closest to American Pie Beta House with some of the same actors.The script is well written and quite funny the acting is fairly good about as good as you would expect from a movie of this type. It is truly amazing how decent storyline's and decent acting can do to make a very enjoyable movie.Overall worth the watch.8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Freshman Year is the third installment of the very funny and very popular Van Wilder and is directed by Harvey Glazer. It is the prequel to the original series Party Liaison and stars Jonathan Bennet as Wilder Kurt Fuller as Dean Reardon and Kristin Cavallari as Kaitlin Wilder's love interest. The movie revolves around Coolidge College campus.Wilder just having graduated from high school follows the family tradition and attends Coolidge. Upon arrival he discovers that his father's fun loving school is not longer what it used to be. The institution has become militarized by Dean Reardon who seems to hate the Wilder's and makes Van a target.Van's attempt to party seems to go wrong as the institute has become chastised and all manner of earthly pleasures are considered a sin. His first attempt leads him to the Daughters in Christs' Kingdom D.I.C.K having misguided by the acronyms. However Van fights back with a 'God works in mysterious ways' prank.Reardon suspects Van of being behind the prank but cannot prove it. As a result he forces Van to join the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps ROTC he commands and orders his 'dogs' Lieutenant Dirk Arnold Steve Talley and Corporal Benedict Nic Nac to crack Van. Van responds with his own brand of outrageously comedic revenge.For those seeking originality you will be disappointed. This installment follows the first two in quirky detail. The joke and punch lines is basically a carbon copy of its predecessors. And you may also note the use of high tech gadgets that were unavailable in the first installment notably the iPhone.Overall this is great movie to hang out with friends and have a laugh.".

I've watched both movies and in my opinion both movies were good. They're not awesome movies to start with. I don't expect Ryan Reynolds to star in this film anyway because he is too old for the movie. Just like the American Pie movies people usually like the original 'lead actor Steve Stifler' and Van Wilder for this case. The new Wilder hear suits well young and fresh. He's acting was good and so were the other actors.If you have watched most of the American Pie Presents.. movies don't expect this movie to be as crude and sexual as the above mentioned movies. It's just different..which doesn't mean it is a bad thing.As a whole i feel the Van Wilder Freshmen Year is a good movie and i'd give it the same rating as the original Van Wilder movie 610. Just for the record i give AP Band Camp a 610 Naked Mile a 710 Beta House a 710 and Book Of Love a 510.View this movie with an open mind and not as a sequel.".

The only difference between this and the first Van Wilder film is in the first one Van has been in college for 7 years here he hasn't even been in college for 1 year. Bennett manages to pull it off at least that's my opinion but here's the plot. Van's family have all been legends at Coolidge College and now Van is put to the test to do the same. But he has to put up with evil Dean Charles Reardon Kurt Fuller most likely you've already seen him in something but don't know his name by heart and his evil assistant Dirk Steve Talley a poor man's Joey Kern. Van also wants to win the heart of Dirk's beautiful girlfriend Kaitlin Kristin Cavallari if you've never heard of her you're on the same boat as me. The film is essentially a collection of funny pranks and Charles trying to get Van expelled.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Another spinoff of the original 1979 movie the Amityville Horror which has really nothing to do with what made the house in Amityville famous or infamous in the first place! The 1974 murder of the family who resided there by their drugged up and satanically possessed son.In this film the movie has to do with the murder of a local priestJan Rubeswho had his brains blown out during confession by one of his church members! This all happened some 12 years earlier in 1977 in the movie that we see in a long flashback. It's now 1989 and this group of friends looking for a place to live in the country from the big city end up spending the night at the dark and spooky house in Amityville.Warned by one of the local people the oneeyed Ms. Moriarty Helen Hughes that there's a curse on the house the people spending the night there laugh her off feeling that she's just an old eccentric looking for attention. It turns out that Mrs. Moriarty whom we saw in the opening flashback sequence is not as nutty as they think. She not only knows what the reason is for the priest's murder but who was the person who murdered him!The film slowly plays itself out in it going back to the murder of the priest whom we later find out was not as holy as he seemed to make himself out to be. it turned out that his alleged murderer Ted A. Bohus hung himself in police custody before he could make a confession to the priest's murder.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS Another spinoff of the original 1979 movie the Amityville Horror which has really nothing to do with what made the house in Amityville famous or infamous in the first place! The 1974 murder of the family who resided there by their drugged up and satanically possessed son.In this film the movie has to do with the murder of a local priestJan Rubeswho had his brains blown out during confession by one of his church members! This all happened some 12 years earlier in 1977 in the movie that we see in a long flashback. It's now 1989 and this group of friends looking for a place to live in the country from the big city end up spending the night at the dark and spooky house in Amityville.Warned by one of the local people the oneeyed Ms. Moriarty Helen Hughes that there's a curse on the house the people spending the night there laugh her off feeling that she's just an old eccentric looking for attention. It turns out that Mrs. Moriarty whom we saw in the opening flashback sequence is not as nutty as they think. She not only knows what the reason is for the priest's murder but who was the person who murdered him!The film slowly plays itself out in it going back to the murder of the priest whom we later find out was not as holy as he seemed to make himself out to be. it turned out that his alleged murderer Ted A. Bohus hung himself in police custody before he could make a confession to the priest's murder. The people staying in the house at first have no idea what the house with all the books and movies written and released about it represents Death and Horror to those who dare to either buy or spend the night in it. It's only after the truth comes out which takes almost the entire film to what the reasons were behind the priests murder and who in fact murdered him that the proverbial sht really hits the fan!

	schema:reviewBody "I had to track this film down for four years in the UK simply every video store and rental company refused to stock it. But was it worth it?The Amityville Curse is based around Hans Holtzer's impressive book which is a worthy competitor to Jay Ansons original work. Pretty much nothing in this film related to anything in the book which makes you wonder why they even bothered to use the Amityville name at all. I am quite sure this was for profitable reasons since the series has been so popular despite some horrendously awful movies. The Amityville Curse is just another of these.The main focus of this movie centers around a murdered priest in a confessionbooth. After getting blown away with a pistol we are taken to the Amityville house'  which by the way looks nothing like it. A group of people buy it from the market at next to nothing with no electricity which makes for some atmospheric lighting  at least they got this right. Marvin Anthony Dean Rubes is an Uncle Buckstyle goof who has to carry the rest of the incompetent costars throughout ninety minutes of the usual Amityville outing which includes such supernatural events as dogs barking and a wine glass being shattered. So chillingAs is traditional in an Amityville film a psychic just happens to be among the group to make the rest of the cast paranoid. Debbie Dawna Wightman tries way too hard and ends up looking pretentious and embarrassing in the process. I wasn't surprised to hear this was the only film she starred in. The rest of the cast aren't even worth a mention apart from the bum in the bar who looks dead for ten minutes and then spouts You know something Mr you don't know s'. A lot of this time The Amityville Curse tries to be a comedy and has some really confusing characters. Mrs Moriarty the freak with the glass eye is a thirdrate Tangina from the Poltergeist films who thankfully gets demonised before long. One cannot help but cheer on the demons when it's her time. However in comicbook style she miraculously knocked over a video camera moments before so her death is witnessed and the killer is exposed  as one of the members of the house.Later it is uncovered that the confessionbooth along with other holy items have been hidden in the basement. Quite how they got there is something which is never explained. I can only assume the demons come packaged with all the religious items or something  why would they be present in a basement of the supposed Amityville house with crosses holy water and a confession booth? Would this not deter them? This and many other events are never explained to us which gives you an idea of how great the writers are.So another tradition lives as the possessed confessionbooth killer becomes demonised for no other reason but to end the film and then attempts to devour his former friends. Unfortunately the demons seem to be having an offday and are exorcised from the house after a few dainty lovetaps.Not a very impressive film and certainly not worth hunting down. Too much talking and unnecessary camerawork makes the ninety minutes drag. Also I would like to know what the BBFC are playing at giving this an 18 certificate since nothing in this film surpassed anything a 12 movie does today. Still we are waiting for the next sequel and whether it is going to require any intelligence to watch. 25".

The house looks like an old Victorian home and the friends plan to refurbish the house as an investment but soon are haunted by spirits in the house. They then discover that the home belonged to a priest and that the confession booth that he was murdered in is stored in their basement cellar.... I thought this was a good premise and the acting wasn't that bad actually. The movie had some scares good effects for the time era and was just plain good. The movie doesn't really belong in the Amityville series because it doesn't involve the original Amityville house but it stands perfectly on its own independently. I give it a 1010.".

Waiting with them until the furniture arrives they decide to spend the night as a housewarming gesture and immediately start to experience strange events around the house. As the night wears on she becomes even more convinced that something is going on in the house but no one is willing to take her seriously. As the events in the house soon reach more extreme behavior they eventually learn that one of the previous inhabitants of the house had gone mad listening to voices that emanated from the house and had turned him into a murderer believed to have been deceased. Realizing that something is amiss they try to find out the truth about the house before more incidents drive them crazy.The Good News This here is a really hard film to get into even for the series fans as there's so little right with it. One of the only things is that the stalking or haunting scenes in the beginning do get pretty good at times. The several bathtub scenes are pretty good mainly for the nudity but also due to the fact that there's some really nice spook scenes that come from them. There's some fun to be had with these and it's some really great fun with these scenes coming in at the right moments. There's also some really nice stuff to come along from the ending chase which is really nice has a couple creepy scenes and the film's main gore stuff. Included in the chase is a couple of bloody stabbings a circular saw blade to the knee and a pretty nifty manner of disposal. It's pretty nice and remains one of the bright things about the film. The other thing is that the added plot points in here make it feel more than just a usual film entry that copies the formula of the past ad nausea. These here are the only good things about the film that work.The Bad News This here was a really disappointing entry that has a couple substantial flaws in it. The biggest one is easily the lack of the action in here. This one features only a select few scenes of any real action or excitement and that means there's long segments of the film with nothing at all that happens and it feels really dull. That's the other major factor to come from this is that it really feels dull listless and poorly paced out. There's no need for it to be as lifeless as it is with only a couple times with anything that will generate excitement. Otherwise this one here is just punctuated with endless scene after endless scene of the group discussing what's gong on or what they think should be the next course of action. It generates no action no suspense nothing at all of interest and is just a method to eat up time that should've been better spent doing anything else since this one fails at that. It's also hard to take the film as a haunted house film since there's very little here that can actually be attributed to a haunted house. In fact this one abandons that in favor of a murder mystery that is so easy to solve it can be done in five minutes and in using that as the crux for the later scenes it just gets even more dreary dull and boring. With that manner it really makes for even worse viewing when there's just nothing in here that has nothing of interest in the way it pans out. These here are the really crippling flaws in the film and are the ones that are most responsible for it's downfall.The Final Verdict Without a whole lot going for it but a few rather decent moments this one is really hard to make it for fans of the series. They should really be the only ones giving this one a shot as it feels like an entry while those who haven't been into the series at this point should ignore this one completely.Rated R Violence Language and Nudity".

The story is pretty much a murder mystery. Kinda like an episode of Matlock or Murder She wrote except with no watchable qualities to it. The movie drags on and on. The plot is about a priest who was shot to death years ago during a confession. The confessional booth that the priest was killed in is brought to an old house. Twelve years later a group of stuffy middle aged people move in and strange things start to happen. Broken mirrors bad dreams ghost sightings etc.Now the funny thing is the man who killed the priest in the beginning is shown smoking. Out of everyone in the movie one person is a smoker. Gee it doesn't take Perry Mason to put two and two together when it comes to naming the killer. The acting isn't the best either. Kim Coates appears bored with the whole experience. Unknown actress Dawna Wightman did okay portraying the innocent and sweet danger sensing lead character. The rest are practically meaningless to the movie. But the biggest problem with the movie is that it has nothing to do with Amityville.So we have a mixed up plot poor acting and a murder mystery that can be figured out in the opening twenty minutes. Not a very fun watch at all. I will say though the confrontation with the killer in the last fifteen minutes is kind of fun. It's really the only watchable part of the whole thing.310".

This time around it doesn't even have anything to do with the Amityville house if I remember right the only relation is that the house in this film is in the same neighborhood. A group of adult friends decide to buy an old house with the plans of renovating it and selling it or something along those lines. Unbeknowst to them a Catholic priest was murdered in a confession booth that is now stored in the basement and the man who killed him hung himself because of guilt. So the ghosts begin to appear to one of the friends who seems to be a little psychic and it's up to her to put the curse to rest before her friends' lives are at stake.This film is nothing new is fairly boring and really has nothing to do with the rest of the Amityville movies. It's almost like Halloween III was in the Halloween series. The house isn't the same so it's not really the Amityville Horror the film isn't even really linked to the others if you don't count the title. The acting is soso and the effects which are supposed to be substantially shocking look very cheap and unscary. The story itself is weak even more so because of the series it was randomly placed in and the unrelation to the other films. I enjoyed Amityville Dollhouse but this one is completely unrelated and failed to do much for me. Perhaps if it were it's own film and didn't have Amityville branded on it it would've made more sense but of course it isn't.If you like cheesy lowbudget haunted house films which I normally do then you might wanna give this a look. Although it may just be a disappointment. I think I'll give it a four for trying I tend to have a soft spot for films like this.

The group lives in another haunted house in Amityville where a priests confessional was places 12 years previously at a time around the real horror.  NO REAL house equals bomb of a movie.  At least 1992 A New Generation and Dollhouse make some sort of reference to the realhouse like timepieces mirrors and small replicas but this movie feels like a Halloween movie without Michael Myers.    SECOND Get a storyline. they stop by the house because it is the first right not the second huh? The mundane plot they came up with is stupid.  Instead of picking up on the 1978earlier date tie in the plot follows strange behavior in the group where all of them predictably die and I don't remember seeing the ghoul. One of them is supposedly the murderer of the priest 12 years ago.  But is this another flashback or someperson you see who is not really there? Urgh.  Third Stop pretending.  The haunted house is only filmed from one side.  So half the time I cannot tell if it is the real house.".

The backstory for this is weird because it says it was based on a book. I know that the original film was based on a book that was revealed to not be based on true events as the writer claimed. So was this one based on true events? I looked in the credits and it said that everything about this movie was fictional. I can certainly believe it because no people in real life would act this stupid.I believe this takes place in the same house as the previous movies but I haven't seen all of them so I can't be sure. I honestly don't care to go out and watch every one of them. I'm only reviewing those that are somehow important and I saw this because of the extremely low rating here. How silly of me! This movie features a curse but it has no curse in it at all. There's a few supernatural things that go on but it's mostly a mundane story about a serial killer. Was the killer supposed to be possessed or something? As the fifth movie in the series you'd think the townspeople of Amityville would learn their lesson for once.The acting in this film is terrible. Almost all of the characters are obnoxious and serve little purpose at all. There's this weird old woman who keeps popping up and mostly serves no point. This has some of the most clichs I've seen in a movie in a long time. We get the sound of a cat a spider appearing a bathtub of blood and religious imagery. Amityville 3D while still a bad movie at least tried to have something interesting happen at the climax. The woman playing Debra is particularly bad. I did laugh a few times at how pitiful it was.This isn't for horror movie fans Amityville fans movie fans or anyone at all. I'm surprised this didn't kill the franchise off for good. Apart from that most of this movie is just plain boring. It escalates way too slowly and has no sensible characters in it. Oh and I forgot the clich of the ambiguous nightmares. They stopped numbering the sequels with this. They should have stopped altogether. ".

What we have is a very typical horror film in which a group of friends move into a dilapidated old house in order to renovate it but instead find themselves menaced and then possessed by a gang of spooks.By all accounts this was an early straighttovideo film and that shows in its level of ineptitude. Absolutely nothing happens in this production that we haven't seen done better in other horror films and the various scare scenes are a joke. The direction is probably the worst thing about this as he chooses to shoot most of his scenes in the dark so that the viewer is straining to see what's going on. The only familiar member of the cast for me was the lead Kim Coates who's gone on to appear in the likes of BLACK HAWK DOWN but like the rest of the actors he gives an entirely undistinguished performance.".

NOTHING happens for the most part aside from a bit of chaos in the finale and even that was tame. I'm not an Amityville fan at all. There isn't one movie that stands out not even the theatrical releases except for Amityville Part II. This movie is approximately 87 minutes long. It honestly felt like two hours. I was pleading for the running time to move quicker. There isn't much gore and the makeup is terrible. We get a nasty cut on somebody's hand with broken glass people get hit with nail guns. We get deformities on people's faces and a little more. If I wasn't angered enough they even play the start of the Psycho score during a lame Tarantula scene. It doesn't have much going for it so it tries to use classic things. The house used in this one looks nothing like The Amityville house. It wasn't eerie in the slightest. There are far too many scenes of people wandering around the house with nothing happening. It was nothing but Talk talk talk talk and more talk Like most of these movies. I really question the motives. Why do they stay in the house so long knowing very well something isn't right? Get out! it shouldn't take life threatening experiences to discern such a thing. The acting is awful. Kim Coates sleepwalks through most of it before waking up in the finale. He decides to ham it up. I didn't buy it at all. He also smokes way too much in scenes. Dawna Wightman Debbie is one of the most insufferable women I have ever had to endure a movie. Her constant sniveling and OTT hysterics made me wanna slap her silly. She over did it completely. Cassandra Giva is pretty sexy but her character is stupid. I'm guessing Jan Rubes needed to pay some bills pretty badly because it screams Paycheck role. The finale tries for controversy to try to spice things up a bit to no availFinal Thoughts I hated this movie. It is the worst STV sequel in the series. That is saying something believe me. It has no suspense no thrills and you'll be bored to tears. Stay away! don't put yourself through unwarranted torture.DUD".

	schema:reviewBody "Three fourths of these reviews hate the movie and whine about the idiot decisions of the scientists. Well of COURSE they made idiotic decisions! Where's the film if they made perfectly sane decisions? What kind of film is that? I actually thought the film was effing brilliant. I think it took a familiar premise and retooled it. The performances of Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley were exemplary as always. I saw it for Sarah Polley as she is one of my favorite actors and one of the most underrated ones out there today. The actress that played Dren was also strong and had the perfect mix of human alien and innocence. The film addresses many scientific issues but does so with a moral and emotional center.

I thought the complex relationship of the couple and their creation was skillfully rendered and and excellently acted. Was it flawed? Sure.

	onyx:emotionText "Three fourths of these reviews hate the movie and whine about the idiot decisions of the scientists. Well of COURSE they made idiotic decisions! Where's the film if they made perfectly sane decisions? What kind of film is that? I actually thought the film was effing brilliant. I think it took a familiar premise and retooled it. The performances of Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley were exemplary as always. I saw it for Sarah Polley as she is one of my favorite actors and one of the most underrated ones out there today. The actress that played Dren was also strong and had the perfect mix of human alien and innocence. The film addresses many scientific issues but does so with a moral and emotional center.

From a marketing standpoint its scaretactics are clearly the easy sell despite their comprising only a tiny percentage of its thematic intent. 'Hard scifi parenting metaphor' is after all a much tougher pitch.So expecting the tasteless creature feature from the trailer Splice impressed me in its pursuit of a more complex emotional response than fear and is successful in burrowing into your subconscious and picking at your psyche. It's a thinking man's B picture which plays with the idea of morality on both a scientific and personal level. That it remains intellectually stimulating even when the surfacearea film dips into more traditionally hokey horror territory is its greatest strength.What's so interesting about the story in spite of what the trailer suggests is that the creature artificially spawned by genetic engineers Clive and Elsa Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley is not an antagonist for the vast majority of the film. Splice isn't about a monster It's about parenthood and like with Rosemary's Baby or Eraserhead taking the associated fears and filtering them through a horror lens. Besides the tail and the pronounced facial cleft testtube baby Dren 'Nerd' backwards heh is essentially human and a big part of Splice's inherent creepiness is that she's treated in turn as a subject and a childWarmly received but caged and abandoned for significant stretches of time. The realization of this character by French actress Delphine Chanac is another of the film's triumphs. Her general lack of dialogue sometimes forces the performance to rely a little too heavily on pantomime but that we can both feel for and fear Dren simultaneously is a testament to the range of the actress.Perhaps it's because Splice nails the big performances and the big ideas and because the gears turning behind the action are so consistently fluid that it's all the more apparent when it stumbles over little things like stilted motivation issues and superfluous grating secondary characters. Clive's brother Brandon McGibbon and boss David Hewlett for example are flat placeholder roles that transparently progress the plot instead of enriching it. The triangular relationship between Clive Elsa and Dren and its weird morphing emotional permutations is what Splice is at its core. It is a film with very few characters but every moment not spent on that central dynamic feels like time wasted.Still that minor gripe is forgivable because Splice has two hugely important and rare qualities for modern horrorOriginal thought and fearless storytelling. The undercurrent of sexuality in the film the internal dialogue on gender roles is apparently one of the reasons no studio wanted to touch the script last year but Natali's film is a cut above the rest precisely because it isn't afraid to make an audience uncomfortable. And it gets uncomfortable.Splice gets a lot of credit from me in the abstract. The concrete film doesn't quite live up to the incredible promise of the ideas behind it but the very presence of those ideas is reaffirming to a degree and that Splice received a wide domestic release is more encouraging still. Granted it went on to perform below expectations at the box office but was positioned against more breezy summer fare like Shrek and Get Him to the Greek. The other possibility and this suggests more consumer confidence than an ad man may be inclined to grant is that Splice's scaretactics aren't the easy sell. Maybe like me potential moviegoers just saw a trailer for another crappy horror movie instead of the interesting offbeat experiment it is.It's Warner Brother's loss and the audience's.".

This in turn leads to the creation of a new entity they name Dren which they raise and attempt to study as a personal project concealed from their employers and colleagues. The story becomes highly engrossing as we follow the creature's development alongside that of the two scientists who are in a relationship that becomes increasingly strained by a series of ethical and logistical dilemmas. The two central performances are welljudged but the real star is Dren or the CGI responsible for her creation which is always convincing and solid at all stages of the creature's evolution. Vincenzo Natali's visually intense direction is also worth mentioning and he clearly enjoys playing with a generous budget as compared with his previous features like Cube.This is however no modern masterpiece  the plot becomes predictable and contrived in the final third the minor characters are little more than stereotypes lax young brother venal bosses and the comedic elements of the film don't always sit comfortably with the horror aspects there is however a notable exception in a hilarious scene towards the end.

Also about that they break a multimillion dollar piece of equipment smash it and no one even asks what happened to it. They end up moving Dren into the basement where no one goes because yea maintenance and janitorial employees ever go into areas where maintenance and janitorial things are stored. OK but those are minor things. How about we look at how Adrian BrodySarah Polley characters changed so quickly without explanation. Adrian Brody starts out thinking they need to kill Dren then he thinks no we need to take care of it and then near the end he says the experiment's over we no longer have an obligation to the specimen none of those transitions are ever explained they just happen. Sarah Polley's character does the same thing only in reverse. She starts off wanting to take care of Dren then after Dren kills the cat she goes all kinds of crazy and wants to kill Dren and then she goes back to wanting to take care of Dren and then at the very end she wants to kill it again. Now I guess we can say that she turns on Dren because of the abuse her mother did to her although we are never told that not even a damn flashback scene. Also why did Adrian Brody have sex with Dren it was not needed and in the scene right before that we see that she has no vagina so we will call it Comic Book Magic. Next they are supposed to be brilliant scientist but they fail to notice that every single time there is a change in Dren she Dies for a bit. In the fake uterus machine she dies and then comes out she gets drowned and dies and then develops the aqualungs. So they really don't see that come on. Finally there is NO moral I mean I guess the moral is go ahead and screw around with nature and when it kills everything that you love and rapes you don't worry go ahead and screw around with nature some by selling your rape creature. I mean the sex scene was totally unneeded but the rape scene was just sick and then on top of that to find out that she is just money hungry woman at the end. When she said What's the worst thing that can happen I totally wanted the camera to pan outside and see the whole city on fire. This movie was horrible it was horribly written and horribly put together. I am sadden that people actually found this movie to be good.".

Roman Polanski evolved this idea via adaptation of Ira Levin's novel in Rosemary's Baby which took the notion of creating something truly awful the son of Satan and using it as a metaphor for a woman's selfdestruction and paranoia during pregnancy. Larry Cohen's It's Alive took contemporary paranoias of a carcinogenengulfed atmosphere and nuclear proliferation and applied it to his own murderous bloodthirsty infant. And rounding out this prolific bunch is David Lynch's Eraserhead a hauntingly surreal horror film that not only presents parenthood with fearful uncertainty but treats acts of sexuality and procreation with a metaphorically clinical but never explicit disgust.Vincenzo Natali's Splice falls somewhere within this noteworthy pantheon of mad science moralethical conundrums and icky special effects. Many have already drawn comparisons both positive and negative to the early mutationinformed works of Canadian auteur David Cronenberg but Natali is just as interested in exploring the questions under the surface as he is showing an astutely creative visual eye. For a while the film plays like something closer to an arthouse feature especially given the presence of character actors like Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley with intriguing ideas and a solid FX budget. There are missteps along the way but for the most part this is a solid little sleeper.Clive Brody and Elsa Polley are young scientists who have made a breakthrough in artificial life two bloblike creatures one male one female with the ability to manufacture an artificial protein for the purpose of nourishing livestock. In typical businessfirst fashion their corporate overlords marvel at the notion of massmanufacturing it and promptly reject Elsa's proposition of human experimentation to cure genetic disorders. Driven by curiosity the duo wind up creating Dren Delphine Chaneac a creature whose accelerated life cycle prompts the creepily maternal Elsa to keep her as part of a more personal experiment. Splice contains subtle wellplayed allusions to bad childhoods longterm psychoses and the shifting roles of parents in the eyes of children Clive starts off as vehemently oppositional later he becomes a reluctant accomplice who ultimately develops a bizarre affection for the creation not to mention the tension between parents amid the childrearing process watching this trio interact supplies most of the film's compelling hypnotic moments. This deliberate pace and focus on character may prove offputting to horror fans sold on the ADHD weirdness of the trailer but those with open minds will find much to gorge themselves on.Despite all the admirably creative spins on familiar concepts Natali or perhaps the producers action aficionado Joel Silver being one run out of fresh material by the climax which takes chase clichs and overdone monster effects down a road that exists solely to patch up some character arcs and drum up excitement in a blandly conventional way. That being said the first 34 of Splice is such a surprisingly effective slow burn of suspense and dread culled from universal hopes and fears played out by actors who know the fine line between camp and creep that its later machinations are pretty easy to forgive.6.5 out of 10".

Splice is a dramatic scifi horror film with the story of two young unethical scientists that decide to play God. The plot is unoriginal but is attractive and engaging specially because the trio formed by Sarah Polley Adrian Brody and Delphine Chanac. The childhood trauma of Elsa is absolutely out of the context and a diversion to the mainstream. The special effects and makeup are awesome transforming the gorgeous French actress Delphine Chanac in a creature with an exotic beauty. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Splice  A Nova Espcie Splice  The New Specie";

Rather quickly an extraordinary creature is born and the pair must figure out what to do with it.It may be 2010 but Splice owes its entire existence to the pioneering works of David Cronenberg and David Lynch. Yes there are elements of Frankenstein and the work of H.P. Lovecraft scattered throughout the film but the body horror the mutations the sexual depravity the creature itself  all of these elements are cut of the same cloth the two legendary directors gave birth to in the 1970s and 1980s. But it is almost too easy to narrow down the little homages references and ideas cowriter and director Vincenzo Natali has dropped into his otherworldly tale. The whole film has a pulse unlike anything I have seen from the genre in recent years outside of the enigmatic Avatar and its low budget grittiness helps the tones and ideas of the picture go a very long way.It is because of these elements that Splice rises out of the gluttony of modern horror and science fiction films. It has the old school charm and it uses that to its advantage to create a rather unique film for its time. Natali alongside cowriters Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor have crafted an uncompromising view of a potential nightmare of the future. Much like other great science fiction titles Splice makes the audience think very hard about the morals being broken at any given time the consequences of the characters' actions and the very nightmare before them of whether a splicing experiment gone wrong like this one could actually happen in reality.If there is anything wrong with the film it is the final act. Up until that point everything feels very calculated and wildly unpredictable especially one scene that rather easily disgusted the entire audience I was sitting with including myself. But the last chunk of the film and especially in the dying moments of the film the plotting seems very illconceived. It feels as if the writers had squandered all of their good ideas for the first twothirds of the movie and then ran out of ideas as to what to do afterwards. There are some good ideas at play here but they just lack the intensity enthusiasm and uniqueness of what came before. Ironically a lot of these last scenes are in the television spots that make Splice look like any other horror movie while the rest of the film tries its hardest to distance itself from everything else.The various creatures that appear during the film specifically the differing evolutions of the spliced together science project nicknamed Dren are the true marvel of the film. Much like District 9 the filmmakers here have taken a significantly smaller sum of money than the average Hollywood blockbuster and have created effects that appear all the more realistic and genuinely impressive. While some look a whole lot better than others the early renditions of Dren suffer the most all of these nightmarish beings look excellent and for all intents and purposes a lot better than they ever should have looked. Great care and detail went into creating these effects and even more went into some of the makeup used on Delphine Chanac and Abigail Chu to make the look of Dren become increasingly more believable. The work here is truly spectacular and compliments the script wonderfully.The unfortunate thing about having such small casts is that the lead actors end up doing the entirety of the heavy lifting. But this is not a problem for Polley or Brody who appears to have found a new resonance within the Hollywood zeitgeist years after proving himself worthy of the big time in his Oscarwinning turn in The Pianist. Both are more than qualified for keeping the film afloat and bring a passion to the small roles. Neither is terribly well written but both actors breathe depth into their characters and performances. They have just the right conviction to their roles. They never waver or alter their style even when the film veers into disturbing territory or all out insanity. Their chemistry is also quite well developed and despite the initial weirdness they are very believable as a couple.The real marvel of the film however is undoubtedly Chanac. She is simply magnificent in her role as Dren. She has to emote for the entire film the creature does not really learn to talk in various stages of dress and she is more than up to the task. Her quick tonal changes reflect both the character's struggle for identity and the immediacy and honesty of the portrayal. Much like Polley and Brody Chanac has a heightened conviction to the role that never falters. Her depiction of this monster makes it all the more human and she makes genuine horror still look devastating.Despite having seen the film a few weeks back I still cannot get over how well done Splice was. It was cheap and gritty but it had a low budget effects polish that was stronger than some of the best Hollywood blockbusters. The film has a few problems but it is still well done all around and should more than please fans of the genre. I can only hope for more inspired films like this to come from Natali in the future.810.This review also appeared on httpwww.geekspeakmagazine.com.".

	schema:headline " A solid new movie about a tired and almost overdone ethical topic";
	schema:reviewBody "I was privileged enough to catch a screening of Splice last night that headlined the director Vincenzo Natali as a special guest. I've been a moderate fan of his work since his eerie and claustrophobic feature Cube. Like Cube I found that this movie was able to set an atmosphere that was almost palatable throughout the film. The main characters Elsa and Clive played by Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody respectively were both likable and detestable and yet all the time believable throughout the film. I credit Natali's writing with this emotional tugofwar because he was able to explain the motives of the characters without giving too much away and forcing the pacing to lag. The man is whip smart and it showed through his handling of the QA session after the movie. They do some despicable things but Natali oft times tries to explain the character's background to justify certain actions. I appreciate the effort but at the same time I felt the film required some serious suspension of disbelief on the part of its viewers to really swallow some scenes and resulting relationships.After seeing the movie you'll probably realize you've seen this movie and premise before. Without giving too much away this tale reminds me a lot of Jurassic Park. The overarching narrative parallels the sentiments of Dr. Malcom from Jurassic Park but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could they didn't stop to think if they should. . The character's themselves were even named after pivotal actors in Bride of Frankenstein Colin Clive and Elsa Lanchester an homage to one of the great creatures of Science Fiction films and a source of inspiration to the director himself. The hybrid starts off looking quite alien but evolves into looking quite humanlike probably due to budget constraints as well as done to help the viewer identify and empathize with the creature with legs immediately reminding me of the aliens from The Arrival 1996. Throughout the film you could see the evolution of all the characters that contributed to the final climax of the film. Elsa and Clive make a lot of mistakes and poor judgments throughout the film considering how 'brilliant' these scientists were supposed to be. They try to approach the creation of this hybrid being with an objective mind  purely for the sake of science. However in turn they make a lot of 'human' errors along the way where their emotions come into play. As Chaos Theory explains small variations in initial conditions renders longterm predictions impossible. The movie keeps you guessing throughout. It evolves in an uncontrolled way just like the hybrid the scientists created. Like every other creature feature flick before it Frankenstein Jurassic Park and even Species everything culminates into a final climactic scene where the makers are forced to atone for their actions.The creature effects were solid and the actress playing Dren is amazingly beautiful and exotic looking. Her mild androgyny was perfect for the role. Her sharp movements seemed quite alien to me and she took the creature further than what special effects could have done alone. Brody and Polley were both solid actors throughout the film. I particularly enjoyed Brody's wardrobe and styling. The pacing of the film started almost magical like ET then quickly picked up pace paralleling the frenetic tension the scientists themselves must have been feeling.It wasn't a perfect movie by any means and it certainly wasn't one of my favourites in recent years but I enjoyed it. If I had to compare it to his earlier work Cube I would have to say that Cube made a much more lasting impression I own it and recommend it to friends often. This movie is a fun way to spend an evening. You'll come out of the theatre with a positive experience but it probably won't be a movie you'd rush out to see a second time.710".

At some point I'm sure I've seen another movie this bad but I can't think of any at the moment.OK so let's get to the reasons this movie completely sucked.Obviously this is supposed to be a SciFi thriller and Character development isn't usually paramount but The director gives us no reason whatsoever to care about the two main human characters. They're not really good people they're not really bad they're just there conducting the most ridiculous experiments which end up giving us the Creature.OK so the two main characters don't give us anything to care about. No big deal this is a Thriller right? So we can expect some good old fashioned edge of your seat scares right? Wrong. There's nothing remotely scary about this film aside from the fact that the studio greenlighted it.OK so We don't care about the characters... It's not scary.. Maybe it'll have some higher purpose with great social commentary and a message of ethics that makes us think. NOPE.The whole premise of the movie is beyond stupid but by the time Brodie has sex with the Creature it's completely impossible to take this movie seriously.I usually have no problem suspending disbelief at the movies... But c'mon Throw us a bone here you want me to believe that two young successful highly educated scientists working in a medicalgenetics laboratory splice one of their own DNA samples with that of.... some other DNA coctail to create a humanoid creature in the broom closet in the basement of the Med Lab because... Why? who knows. Who Cares.It grows up into a female freakshow that not even the lonliest guy I know would have sex with but Brodie decides to do it anyway. Then the Creature changes it's gender and Rapes the female doctor knocking her up and Killing Brodie in the process.Female doctor is pregnant with Freakshow's child and the movie ends with GREAT possibilities for a FANTASTIC sequel. Somebody slap the Director.If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I wouldn't have believed that in this day and age a movie this bad didn't go straight to DVD.I wasted 2 hours of my life and 1.75 on this steaming heap of crap. Learn from my mistake and don't let it happen to you. Stay home and watch Seinfeld Reruns Change the oil in your car Paint the Garage... anything... just don't waste your time on this movie.".

I assumed of all sites this one would give what this movie truly deserves...a 110.I went into this movie with no expectations. A few friends of mine were going to see it so I tagged along. I hadn't heard anything about it except that it was something about genetic engineering which intrigued me as I am interested in the advancement of genetic engineering.I will start off by saying that this movie is very predictable. As an independent filmmaker myself I could already picture how they were going to open up the movie by just watching the intro credits. It opened with a first person view of something looking up at a group of doctors. What used to be a great first shot is something that is way overdone.Now when I saw that Adrien Brody was in the movie I was pretty excited because I have always respected him as an actor until this film. He played a scientist with what seemed to be his girlfriend maybe his wife they never established whether or not they were married. They worked together in the lab to develop these spliced blobs that could be used for medical miracles in science...artificial proteins created from animal DNA.They then decided to risk it all by splicing animal with human DNA. This created this animalhuman hybrid that grew at a rapid pace had lungs that could breathe underwater and could even fly. It also had a tail with this pointy thing at the end of it. Quite a complex combination of who knows what. This was another drawback...the girl just didn't make sense. She was part human and part like 34 different kinds of animals.The idea was great but it fell way short. The dialogue in many areas was pretty awful with the most generic lines ever seen in a movie. For example as predicted the brother of Brody and their boss shows up and the brother steps out and says something like I had no choice. I saw this scene coming the moment the brother found they had a humananimal.There was even a scene after Brody did something that took him from being a great actor to being a nobody in my book because anyone that would accept a scene like this has got to be out of their mind. I will commend them for this scene because half the audience turned their heads in disgust and the other half burst out laughing about how absurd it was. From then on the movie was nothing but a huge laugh. The whole theater was laughing...it went from a sci fi thriller to a comedy pretty quickly.Probably the best part was the ending...because it was finally over. Overall I would tell everyone to wait for this movie on DVD because it isn't worth your money in the theaters unless you want to watch a comedy. It had a ton of potential but wasn't presented in a believable way.I did however enjoy the opening credits...they were very well done. It' a shame the rest of the movie could not have been the same caliber as the opening credits.".

The film opens with two lovebird scientists delivering a genetically engineered creature that is sufficiently amazing and unrealistic to drive the plot of several movies. In the Parallel Earth of Splice however the scientific community is none too impressed by the birthing of a radical new species Yeah those sentient penises you've grown are neat but we'd like to see synthesis of some random protein or we're shutting you down. The H40 chimeras are quickly forgotten and our heroes move on to the first of several fantastically stupid ideas. For the lulz they opt to secretly grow a humananimal hybrid. Counterintuitive as it may be these two dolts are able to create a freakish humanoid monster with trivial effort and without anyone noticing. The director constantly reminds us that they're are all torn up inside over the attendant ethical dilemmas. As we all know the characters will do whatever the plot requires and there's no real dramatic tension there. Never mind the outrageous intellectual temporal and financial resources needed to achieve such a task Dren the lovable monster is born.The bulk of the movie is occupied by the scientists Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley secretly raising CGI monstrosity Delphine Chanac Dren to adulthood. A recurring problem with the story is the inconsistent scientific acumen exhibited by the two leads. They're able to effect implausibly awesome scientific breakthroughs on a whim. On the other hand they fail to notice things that should be obvious to an undergrad biology major. Is the specimen male or female? Does it have wings? Gills? Maybe they should've given the bitch an XRay or something. At one point the dynamic duo fails to even recognize whether Dren is dead or alive. Some of these oversights would be excusable if they were integral to the plot. Too bad they're mostly thrown in for the sake of cheap thrills. As Dren's biology is revealed to be increasingly farfetched I sense a truly compelling premise being squandered upon a mediocre movie.Yet another unforgivable oversight is the needlessly limited communication with Dren. Brody and Polley are constantly wondering what Dren is thinking. Does she understand her origins? What are her hopes and dreams? What does she know of the outside world? Dren communicates via body language and incomprehensible chirps yet it's established early on that she knows English. Did nobody think to bring a pad and paper? The scientific achievement of the millennium is handled pretty casually by all parties.The director tries to use the scientists' emotional involvement as an excuse for their poor judgment but that only goes so far. The film jumps the shark when Brody elects to have sex with their creation. At this point I decided that the whole exercise was tongue in cheek and that the joke was on me. It seemed like a subtler reenactment of the scene from Spike Jonze's 'Adaptation' where the plot starts to unravel with a nod and a wink. From this point on clichs per minute goes off the chart as the film descends into BGrade horror.I can't decide if this movie is genuinely ridiculous or if it just went over my head. 5stars for making me think.".

The issues of raising a child accepting gender identity and trying to maintain an objective perspective when something you love is the subject of study are all very strongly represented in the story. There are some great rock star science moments that make the film fun and the technology is entertaining if you find it interesting. The main characters Clive and Elsa are pretty much raising a science project through the first two acts. When the experiment becomes self sufficient and gets the intelligent sense to question authority things get tough. The background story of a company working to harvest miracle genes off bioengineered organisms secures a solid foundation for the main characters to build on. The film presents motives that are amoral unethical and rebellious. The story is mostly unflinching and some people in the audience do feel awkward about what they are seeing. DREN is a fantastic character that goes through some drastic evolution. At times it seems like you can side with Elsa and dislike Clive and then you might reconsider that when further events unfold. Every character in this film deals with some seriously brutal events. There are some light and even silly moments to get grounded on and it makes the tough stuff that much more enjoyable when the time comes. If you're willing to take the ride and follow through SPLICE will guarantee a good time or at least some interesting coffee table conversation. I cant recommend watching this film enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "I began to think about this when I saw a picture of a mouse with a human ear growing on its back Vincenzo Natali said at the premiere screening of Splice at the Sundance Film Festival.I knew this film had hit home with me for a reason. Chuck Vacanti who had developed the mouse ear is a friend of the family from my father's years as a pediatrics resident in Vermont. I've tracked his career from a distance and have somewhat followed in his footsteps now as a medical scientist and physician.The truly fascinating aspect of Splice then was that yes it had the creationmonster component which carried a certain novelty and uniqueness. But the real accomplishment of Natali Polley and Brody in this film was to capture the ambition of science without falling too much into the caricatures which often result from these attempts.As I watched the film I thought to my first year in a medical faculty position. A scientist feels a certain pressure to discover and to publish. My experience has certainly not been on the level which these scientists felt but it has had its similarities. This pressure to discover and create may result something of a fight or flight response in the scientist. Most of us choose to fight and that fight means injecting a personal stake into the work one does even to the point of bending the rules perhaps to make things happen. I think it happens to all of us to one degree or another. It may be as small as overlooking the necessary IRB paperwork for all researchers involved in a study. Or it may be as large as injected one's own DNA into a genetic hybrid. We all take risks in science willing to fight against time budgetary constraints and supervisors and inject our own personal stake into our work to see a project come to fruition.In that sense then I found Splice a fascinating film. I don't want to imply an immorality on the part of scientists which even approaches the portrayal in the film. Like the film's characters however all of us work under significant pressure with limited budgets. We want success and our livelihoods and reputations depend on that success. To what degree we are willing to go to achieve that success is a measure which government may attempt to regulate but is in large part a scientist's own moral responsibility. Splice and the characters portrayed by Polley and Brody capture the dilemma which all scientists face and the ensuing attempts to find merit and redeeming qualities in the results when rules are broken to achieve certain ends.".

I'm not sure if you'll love or hate this flick but if you will definitely NOT forget it.As you can guess from the movie posters the story is about an artificiallyengineered humanoid who's pretty hot. Let your imagination take it from there. What makes this story so memorable is that the writers aren't afraid to take it wherever it needs to go. And then some. Like if you thought Species was perverse it looks like The Flying Nun compared to this.Just to throw some words out there incest bestiality rape science incest. And yes I know I said it twice.I found myself in the depths of my twisted mind thinking woah wouldn't it be crazy if such and such happens... and sure enough it does only to be followed by oh but they wouldn't dare let such and such happen... and sure enough it does again. Normally I would say predictability is a flaw but in this case it's thrilling. The whole experience is like a voyeuristic romp testing the limits of how screwedup the writers' and your own imagination can get. The point being I'm sure to show just how morally wrong it is for scientists to engage in vivisection  the creation of life. This is like Frankenstein on steroids.Like seriously my hippie brethren put down your picket signs and just show this movie on street corners... You'll see an end to vivisection overnight.Parts of this story seemed ridiculous  comic booky but just when I'm about to write it off as childish tosh it introduces some incredibly complex themes like a Greek play. You think Oedipus had problems? Hahaha Oedipus never saw SPLICE. It would make him go crying to his momma.The more I think of it I think this film is brilliant. Much like Starship Troopers was a deep sociopolitical satire disguised as a campy action flick I think SPLICE gives us a technomoral satire disguised as a thriller. But like I said I have no clue if this is masterpiece material or just plain cheese. Most likely the filmmakers deliberately used elements of both.If you like scifi satires like Starship Troopers District 9 or scifi morality plays about the creation of new lifeforms as in Solaris Moon Alien Resurrection or the one that started them all Frankenstein 2004 miniseries the best version maybe with a bit of Species eroticism  Rosemary's Baby  The Omen  Mommy Dearest  Flowers in the Attic thrown in then this is for you. I think...By the way y'ever notice how aliens  evolved humanoids always look just like Bjork? Just sayin...".

Right now I am resisting the urge to suppress my violated recollection of this movie so I can warn the viewing public...and I can honestly say you would be better off getting a ticket for ANY OTHER random movie than this one. I do not make that statement lightly. I have been a Sarah Polley fan since Go an Adrien Brody fan since The Pianist AND a Vincenzo Natali fan since Cube but stock in all their future cinematic endeavors will now be called into question because this movie was SO distasteful. Why? you ask? There are so many reason I really don't know where to begin. First of all I'm extremely disappointed because the movie touts itself as a SciFi thriller. There is very little sciencefiction and the movie was hardly scary. All nine people seated in the movie theater which should have been my first hint this movie sucked winced more as a matter of the unpleasant sexual activities on the screen than any cinematic suspense. Seriously. Imagine Jurassic Park where the zookeepers have sex with the dinosaurs and you have an idea of the major plot elements of this movie. And that's just the beginning but I really have to end my testimony there because the movie was just that unpleasant. Save your money and go see anything...or see nothing. Either one is a better choice than wasting your time and money on this movie.".

I had some preconceived notions based on the trailer and I'm glad the trailer did not narrate the entire movie like most trailers do nowadays. This one takes you definitely on a very interesting ride. Considering this was done by a foreign filmmaker maybe studios should take a good look at this film and try playing out of their usual comfort zone. As I was agasp as some of the stuff going on in the film I couldn't quite tell where the film wanted to go and after a while I just decided to sit back and allow it to take me whenever it was headed. It was pleased by the turnout and the ride. What a refreshing film this was. It ALMOST give us confidence that Hollywood may be open to new ideas and may actually take chances than stick to the usual remake rehash sequel crap. Kudos to the folks involved in making this film possible. It was very enjoyable entertaining and kept me at the edge of my seat! Moneys well spent!!! Thanks u for this!".

	schema:reviewBody "After many years I saw Robert Enrico's Les Aventuriers 1967 again. It was like a reunion with an old and dear friend who never changed and only became better with age. Like many years ago the film brought joy and sadness in the same time. This ode to the friendship which is above everything to the tender love to the spirit of freedom and adventure to the unspoken words to the magnificent men and the women beautiful like a dream will never get old or outdated. This film is like fresh air it is a reminder that the adventures will never end as long as there are the adventurers that are always ready to search and to find to struggle and to never give up.I bought a tape with the film dubbed to Russian  that's how I saw it for the first time many years ago actually. Dubbing is good and the quality is decent but I hope that one day I will be able to obtain the DVD with many features documentaries and soundtracks. I also would like to hear the interviews with Alain Delon and Joanna Shimkus  it is sad that she had quit acting I think she was very talented and she was breathtaking as Laetitia. I've cried more than once when I saw the film  the burial scene with the Francois de Roubaix's music playing and the final scene were simply heartbreaking. Fort Boyard where the final sequences of the film took place stands in the water like a dream that never came true for the film's characters but it will always be the inspiration for new generations of dreamers and adventurers from around the world.".

	schema:reviewBody "This unusual genredefying bighearted movie is in the true sense of the word a hidden gem. It's actually amazing that though it's so different to Jacques Rivette's Cline and Julie Vont en Bateau the themes closest to its beating heart are also the celebration of true disinterested friendship and an aching desire to recapture the pure unadulterated joy of embarking on childhood adventures also in adulthood. Humankind most definitely needs to reclaim some of its lost internal childhood. Honest wideeyed and uncynical yet wise movies such as these really remind us of this.Roland Lino Ventura not traditionally handsome but truly captivating and Manu Alain Delon at his most heartmeltingly gorgeous are in a very vague sense the male equivalents of Cline and Julie. Both have a taste for ingenious mechanical feats and inventions they concoct in Roland's wonderful workshop a metal scrapyard which is also a sort of haven from an outside world without imagination. Virginia Woolf once wrote that the problem most women have is the fact they don't have a room of their own meaning a safe haven in which to create let their imagination run free and find themselves  I would extend this to humankind which lacks not just a physical haven but also an internal one. Roland's scrapyard here is a literal materialisation of one such haven and the true mark of friendship is when its owner allows his friends to share it with him.One day the adorable Laetitia Joanna Shimkus Sidney Poitier's wife comes looking for pieces of scrap metal  old cars parts airplane propeller blades etc.  wishing to buy them off Roland to use them for her metal sculptures. He's initially rather dismissive almost offended at the notion that the metal scraps in his personal playground should be for sale. However he very soon warms to her sweetness and genuineness. It's through him that she very soon also meets his best friend Manu a daring pilot and true child at heart a perfect complement to Roland. Good God what delightful eyecandy that young Delon was! Especially in the scenes at sea in Congo when he has his shirt off most of the time and is all toned tanned with tousled floppy hair and long stubble... From that moment on this wonderful trio becomes inseparable. The scenes in which we are shown the growth of their beautiful bond their carefree spirit their unbridled inventiveness and imagination their perfect tenderness especially flowing from the two men to the girl and disinterested concern for one another are simply lifeaffirming.But there are forces at work to try and destroy this beauty. These forces are embodied by the characters who are responsible for having Manu lose his pilot's license when he tries to do a daring stunt with his delightful retro biplane flying through the Arc de Triomphe in Paris the art critics who give Laetitia extremely negative reviews at her exhibition and the men who subsequently pursue our three heroes in ways that I won't give away. These are all grown ups who have lost their grasp of the childlike spirit of friendship and adventure pursuing three who haven't.On the other hand you really get a sense that the crazy treasure hunt that Roland Manu and Laetitia embark on in the ocean off the coast of Congo is done mostly for its own sake and not solely for financial gain. The bond between the three soon inevitably develops a physical and emotional tension with Laetitia not quite exchanging the feeling for the one friend who loves her and instead feeling drawn to the other who doesn't feel attracted to her in equal measure. Unfortunately though these burgeoning feelings between the three never have the time to develop into a proper triangle as disaster soon strikes to heartbreaking effect. SPOILERS WARNING As other reviewers on the IMDb page has also mentioned Laetitia's burial at sea is one of the most poignant moments I remember seeing in a movie for a long time. Yet it is also extraordinarily restrained and never sentimental though deeply moving. I was impressed at how Les Aventuriers manages not to lose steam nor the viewer's interest in the storyline once the angelic Laetitia is no longer there  she is almost the movie's soul so it's no mean feat on Enrico's part that actually we become even more morbidly attached to and concerned for Roland and Manu's wellbeing once she is dead. Seeking out Laetitia's only surviving family members to give them the dead girl's few possessions and her share of the treasure the two friends travel to the French coastal village where she grew up. There's a poignant moment when an old local shepherd and his wife who knew Laetitia as a child reply to Manu and Roland's offer of a reward by saying that they are happy as they are and couldn't wish for anything more in life. A scene that's so simple so beautiful and miraculously lacking in rhetoric.Other favourite scenes and characters include the visit that Roland and Manu pay to the dusty semideserted African museum in Laetitia's village. Curated by a boy no older than eight or nine who guides the two men around the exhibits with genuine passion and a desire to impress them with his eagerness and expertise it was the first scene after Laetitia's death to bring a big smile back to my face. This museum was this child's haven the equivalent of Roland's metal scrapyard. Likewise the fortress in the middle of the sea a place so archetypically symbolic of a psychological state as well as a real physical place would have been Laetitia's haven the one she would have shared with those she loved. Her two true friends go there to honour it and her but unfortunately yet more tragic happenings are not far behind them...".

Lino Ventura is sublime as the older friend who needs the other but at the same time gives him all the freedom in the world because as it happens with true friends he want what's best for the other. The entrance of Joanna Shimkus into their lives is totally intoxicating. She doesn't enter to interfere in Delon and Ventura's friendship but to reinforce it. How beautiful! She's perfect.

Alain Delon is always a pleasure to watch.  He plays the arrogant handsome daredevil with a heart of gold quite convincingly.  His acting is always intense even when he is doing very little.  Lino Ventura is terrific as well and he and Delon are a great pair.  Upon reflection their relationship makes little sense since we are given no history of the two but it hardly matters when one is watching the film.  The relationship between the two men and Laetitia Joanna Shimkusis a bit odd but sweet and believable.  The locations are wide ranging Paris Africa coastal France and this film is full of exciting and droll scenes  The discovery of the sunken airplane is beautiful and scary Roland and Manu walking out of the casino in their suave duds and getting into Roland's towtruck is hilarious. The greatest pleasure of the film is that the narrative does not necessarily go where one would imagine it would.  The version I saw was widescreen and the subtitles were mostly in the lower black of the letterboxing which made them very easy to read.  If you're in the mood for a little bit of action with a lot of good characterization and acting check this one out.PS  The French seem pretty hung up with threesomes no?".

	schema:reviewBody "A cult classic. My personal first of cult movies. I had friends who saw it over 30 times and I clearly remember its last screening in Hungary. Ignoring all fire regulations the manager of the theatre let in everybody who showed up. I was standing in a crowd. Like all cult movies it speaks the angst of its time.

It's been a pleasure to see it again on the European ARTE channel and to realize that it survived well the time.

Delon was at the pick of his sexappeal and Ventura was always interesting enough to catch even the emotional interest of the girl in the film. They look painfully young here but were fully achieved actors already. The action story is quite standard sure we have seen much better and thrilling since but the quality of the film resides in the feeling of adventure it radiates in the exquisite choice of many of the locations and in the sincerity and charm of the relation between the characters. There are a few more French films of the time that have a similar quality and memorable scenes of friendship which push them over the average conventional level of the commercial European cinema of the time. 'Adieu l'ami' also with Delon is another that comes now to my mind. These movies have still something to say to the cinema fans of today.".

	schema:reviewBody "On my last trip to Germany I was amazed to pick up the brand new Bluray release of a favourite film of mine Robert Enrico's 1967 film Les Aventuriers original English release title The Last Adventure. Whenever I'm asked which I think is the most underrated most unjustly forgotten about film my answer is Les Aventuriers. To my knowledge the film has only been available on DVD in France without any subtitles. This is a film I've been desperate to see again since I caught it several times on TV in my childhood. Last night I finally watched the film again and it still lived up to my memories. Before I continue I have to say that like so many German releases this only has optional German subtitles German title Die Abenteurer  so the release is only suitable for French and German speakers. Hopefully as there now is an excellent HD transfer available this means that the film will get released in other countries. Still I want to write a little bit about the film because it was the first film I saw that made a huge impression on me. As the title hints at this is at least in part an adventure film headlining stars Alain Delon and Lino Ventura. Apparently the reason why this film has been forgotten about is because it had nothing to do with the French New Wave which made headlines around the world in the 60s being a classically made genre film. That said its central romantic triangle and shifts of plot tone and genres would have been perfectly at home in a Nouvelle Vague film. At the heart of the Les Aventuriers is the engaging interplay between its three leads Delon Ventura and the beautiful likable Joanna Shimkus who had a promising if all too brief career in the 60s and early 70s since her retirement she's mainly been known as Mrs Sidney Poitier. The films next asset is a plot that constantly turns unexpected corners. There are shifts of tone which the film navigates brilliantly as it moves from lighthearted comedy to globe trotting adventure towards a melancholy last act that pulls the rug from under ones feet. Two thirds into the story what has been a light hearted comedy adventure so far turns unexpectedly dark and serious heading towards a downbeat heartbreaking ending. But then that's exactly the reason why the film has stayed with me and has haunted me ever since. As to the premise Shimkus plays a young sculptress who sets up her studio in Ventura's drag racing garage after meeting him collecting scrap metal for her art pieces. Ventura's best friend is Delon a stunt pilot. Though only subtly hinted at it becomes clear that both men are attracted to the girl but neither makes a move out of respect for the other. The girl also is sensitive to the men's friendship so they have an unspoken agreement for their relationships remain platonic. By not going down the expected romantic route the film becomes a touching portrait of an equal three way friendship. Instead of jealousies that would have ensued had the girl hooked up with one of the guys the three friends look out for care for and support each other. To not become a conventional love story is unexpected for a film that throws France's most handsome male movie star and a beautiful girl into the mix. And that's just the first of many unexpected turns the film has up its sleeve. When each of the friends suffers a major setback in their individual ventures they decide to travel to the Congo where they have found out is a treasure in a sunken plane due to Delon's dealings with shady business people. There the adventure begins and the film becomes increasingly more unpredictable as our three heroes move into dangerous territory. Two more aspects that really enhance the film are the beautiful widescreen cinematography by Jean Boffety as the film moves from a grey suburban Paris to a sun drenched Africa to a bleak Southern France. The use of locations is fantastic with France being far from the glamorous place of Hollywood films but grey and dismal in stark contrast to the sun drenched colourful African scenes. The tremendously stylish score by Franois de Roubaix is another major asset with a memorable whistled theme tune. Hopefully the fact that the film has been released on Blu in one country will mean that it will become available in other territories. A cult film in Germany France and Japan this film is deserving a rediscovery in this country too.".

Wonderful scenes under the sun in the beautiful sea are indeed touching I can hardly think of anyone who does not long with full heart living through such situations of love friendship and natural beauty. Life of course reserves this for a few ones. For those who did not know this film has been at long last released in DVD in France in 2007 as a commemoration for its 40th anniversary. It is spoken and captioned in French only but the quality out stands even that of the actual cinema several decades ago it really surprised me.

Life of course reserves this for a few ones. For those who did not know this film has been at long last released in DVD in France in 2007 as a commemoration for its 40th anniversary. It is spoken and captioned in French only but the quality out stands even that of the actual cinema several decades ago it really surprised me. Even if you do not understand French keep it at hand to lift your mood on a winter rainy day.";

	schema:reviewBody "The winning twomenonewoman formula has been around a long time. Three quarters of a century ago Noel Coward wrote Design For Living as a stage vehicle for himself and the Lunts and it reached the screen soon afterwards albeit greatly rewritten by Ben Hecht and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. MGM got lots of mileage out of the format in such titles as San Francisco Boom Town and Test Pilot all pairing Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy with respectively Jeanette MacDonald Claudette Colbert and Myrna Loy. One of the tricks of course is to put spin on it so that in San Francisco Tracey played a priest therefore not a serious sexual rival for MacDonald about five years ago Patrice Lecomte gave the formula an airing in Une Chance sur deux and his twist was to have the female  in this case the dreaded Vanessa Paradis  trying to decide which of two middle aged men Alain Delon and JeanPaul Belmondo was her biological father and involving both in some heavy duty mayhem with the Russian mafia. Les Aventuriers features a younger Delon this time around teamed with Lino Ventura with Joanna Shimkus forming the third link. I have to confess that this one passed me by until I was alerted to it by a French friend who went one better by supplying a DVD. I've now watched it and read most of the comments here including a perceptive one as lyrical as the movie itself from another friend Galina. I can only endorse everything that's been said here. This is simply a Stunning and Beautiful film celebrating friendship and children playing at being grownups. All three principals are outstanding as is Serge Reggiani who has a supporting role. One of the film's strengths is its refusal to take what is essentially a fairy story to its happyeverafter logical conclusion and illustrate the heavy price tag that comes with being eternally young at heart and refusing to grow up. A wonderful antidote to the New Wavelet and a reminder that movies were conceived to bring joy and pleasure to the masses rather than ego trips for wannabe academics.".

In their own way each is a daredevil. Manu is a pilot who attempts to fly through the Arch of Triumphe and as a result loses his pilot's license. Joanna is a artist who makes pieces out of scrap metal that she finds in Roland's scrapyard  she gives a big art exhibition and gets terrible reviews. Roland is a mechanic and inventor with a workshop where Manu often joins him the two love to invent.A solid platonic friendship is formed between Laetitia and the two men. Learning of a treasure in a plane at the bottom of the sea the three go on a treasure hunt. It's more a way to have fun than to really find anything. During the trip Manu reveals that he has romantic feelings for Laetitia but she privately is more drawn to Roland  I think he seems less threatening to her. I mean to be honest I can't think of any other reason why she would resist Alain Delon. He's more beautiful than the scenery which was lovely. And when he takes his shirt off and his hair grows longer...I digress.Alas the real world is out there and wants to shatter this make believe childlike existence the people who caused Manu to lose his license Laetitia's art critics and the men after the treasure at any price.This is a beautiful and bittersweet story of dreams and what it's like to be young experimenting with life and spreading one's wings.The Last Adventure has a cult following particularly among baby boomers. It's filmed in beautiful settings and filled with lovely poetic moments. The luminous Joanna Simkus became Mrs. Sidney Poitier in 1976 but seemingly retired before that for those who may not be familiar with her. As has been pointed out the director Robert Enrico is not considered an important director  he came along I think at the wrong time when people like Godard were in  but he does a marvelous job here.".

Plot is of course nonexistent as any de Funs movie but here we have abundant song and dance numbers a Babylonian confusion of at least five languages shadows of Tati's Play Time perhaps? a dancing ! Louis de Funs and as I said plenty of 1970 design atrocities if you want in brilliant colors including the girls' costumes which magically change between scenes.910 all in all. Too many plot holes for a perfect 10 and sadly Olivier de Funs's acting talents despite his good looks cannot hold their ground for a lead role against his father. He wisely chose to pursue a different career after one more movie Yet the movie is highly entertaining stylish and Louis de Funs's acting makes this one his finest.".

This wasn't a surprise because in interviews you can see that he was a formidable gentleman even having tremendous success. But there are only a few movies in which he shows his kindness.Here it begins with the relation that he shares with his real son in life Olivier. They are nearly the only men in the movie and they are great together. As a father De Funes is very attentive and caring. And for sure the scenes he had with the babies are moving he is totally sweet! In addition the movie is an explosion of colors and it is an amazing collection of how the 70's the flower power had impacted on France. Except maybe in Dick Tracy I haven't seen so much orange yellow red black blue At last the movie offers a great trip in romantic place Montecarlo Roma For a movie which is a musical comedy with dance songs music ballets I am totally appreciative!

	schema:headline " One of Louis de Funs' best...";
	schema:reviewBody "There's not much of a plot in Serge Korber L'Homme Orchestre or translated literally The Orchestra Man but that takes nothing away from the emotional sweep it provides from one scene to another. Yes the film is all 70's kitsch but it is oh so full of such jovial and retropsychedelic exuberance that you just want to embrace its silliness and share a few steps with the dancers. The whole films is like a fantasy but a fantasy that takes one element seriously music and music is conducted by a real manorchestra a complete artist named Louis De Funs.The comical legend was born in a Spanish family and was a jazz pianist during the war spending days and nights playing in bars and cabarets before getting his first break in show business and becoming an entertainer. So musical rhythm have been running in his blood for the most part of his life in fact one of his earliest successes was the musicalhall themed movie Ah les belles bacchantes. Sixteen years later in 1970 a role like Evan Evans manager of a dancing company in the South of France might have sounded like a departure from his usual portrayals of bourgeois prominent figures or policemen but it's in fact a real comeback to his roots that 'Fufu' accomplishes here stage music and all.And Funes' experience more than his comical talent which is saying a lot is perhaps the best blessing the film could ever have because his performance is believable there's a way he uses his body language to match a musical tempo sometimes he literally grabs the notes with his hand and seem to drive the dancers and musicians to his 'vision' even the way he uses sort of telepathy is the kind of mental gimmick you'd believe a man passionate about his job would use. Much more once the 56year old man sets his foot on the stage you don't believe he hasn't been a dancer De Funs has the moves and it shows in the film. I couldn't think of another actor who could have pulled it better perhaps Yves Montand but imagine him directing a group of young women his charm would operate as smoothly as surely as it would destroy the film's premise.Because De Funs is still De Funs after all a protective fatherly figure a man who means business and insists that his company is more disciplined than a convent. His relationship with the girls sets him up as a man of impeccable morality and that's what backfires at him when a the silly plot about the babies starts. But what I love in his Evan Evans is that he doesn't play his usual selfcentered side except for business reasons his dedication to his art and to the girls establishes one of his most lovable figure and even allows his usual shtick to look fresh and original because this time he doesn't preach the same choir.You see him teaching them selfdefense serving dinner but not after checking their weight and in one of the film's most memorable scene telling them the story about the wolf and the lamb and that scene alone is a showcase of his comedic gifts. These moments are full of irresistible tenderness and even the girls are believable in that role because they don't act as if they were with Evans but with De Funs so even with so many small roles there's never a performance that doesn't ring true. They even manage to outsmart him a few times. And you can tell he knows his girls their habits their manners their languages etc. Not to mention that the film captures a sort of lost coquettish innocence exulting from these little dances one I'd take over all the bareass humping we handle today.De Funs' movies have always been divided in two those that aged well those that didn't and in the late 60's many movies seemed to simply exploit his popularity and give him rather meager scripts where you could throw a few tantrums and mimics and attract one million or two De Funs wasn't fooled by that and admitted he did a few stinkers and it's easy to spot them there's a reliable test to determine if it's a good or bad De Funs when he relies too much on crazy mimics and grimaces it means that the film is desperately begging you to laugh when the film is good enough De Funs doesn't overplay it.Another reason the film works is that it cleverly exploits the presence of his son Olivier and doesn't just play him as an obedient and handsome sidekick or foil to his father uncle in the film. Philippe starts as a naive young man and a pawn of one of his uncle's most cunning scheme you'd see how far he'd get to keep one of his girls but there's an evolution all through the film and his good looks and moderate singing talent contributes to very memorable musical moments the most defining being the little duet with De Funs while they're pampering two babies. The little tone of this sequence the intimacy between the two men redeem all the contrivances of the plot you know this is a film that trusts its material enough it knows it can get away with a little silliness.The music is catchy and memorable the outdoors shot in Italy gives it's a nice international flavor and I wonder if some montage sequences weren't ahead of its time but the bottomline is that it is one of my favorite De Funs' movie and it's not just nostalgia many movies I enjoyed as a kid didn't improve that well over the course of the year.".

A comedy of music and dance L'HOMME ORCHESTRE is an attempt at a sex comedywith Funs in his usual sexless austere persona he performs the head of a dance troop as his choreographic talent allowed him.I think Funs would of made a convincing faun Funs could have been had he consented an ultraFinlay  yet the typecasting or maybe his own ambitions and prejudices and petty bourgeois respectabilitywhich again reverts to typecastingkept him away from this and he promoted an asexual grumpy sexless personalike the irascible EvanEvans in this comedy.L'HOMME ORCHESTRE's sexpot is a mellow blonde Franoise slightly plumper than the other babes in Funs' dance ensemble and shown as conveniently loving an oldster. Another blonde Hendrikea young momseemed on the brink of taking over but no . So to speak my mind this is perhaps not a very good comedy quite deficiently written and one whose presumed and selfstyled originality is not convincing yet it is of course recommended to Funs fans because it features a few genuine Funs bits of 'divertissement. Except for Funs himself nothing else is really very good in L'HOMME ORCHESTRE and the movie looks as I said sadly undecided and murky. Of course such comedyexploitation is not at all unusual in most famous comedy actors' careers. This one has the changing content of a varieties TV show even Funs' character ceaselessly switches between the dances patron prestige and the yellow sportswear of a funny oldster .The French popular comedies gone fancy tend to have somewhat loose structures to look a bit pointless to be rather vaguely paced this one and others like it are not sophisticated comediesin the sense Tati's are but popular comedies gone fancy . L'HOMME ORCHESTRE is indeed a bit murky undecided about its own naturea dance comedy a grumpy asexual Funs comedy Franoise's romance then in the last third a baby comedy with the baby of one of the dancing girls . The movie looks like a series of divagations and it offers only some very vague fun anyway even in terms of fun L'HOMME ORCHESTRE is meaninglesswhat was it about? It might have been about EvanEvans' nephew after all. The girls are nice and the dancing numbers rather average.".

This one has the changing content of a varieties TV show even Funs' character ceaselessly switches between the dances patron prestige and the yellow sportswear of a funny oldster .The French popular comedies gone fancy tend to have somewhat loose structures to look a bit pointless to be rather vaguely paced this one and others like it are not sophisticated comediesin the sense Tati's are but popular comedies gone fancy . L'HOMME ORCHESTRE is indeed a bit murky undecided about its own naturea dance comedy a grumpy asexual Funs comedy Franoise's romance then in the last third a baby comedy with the baby of one of the dancing girls . The movie looks like a series of divagations and it offers only some very vague fun anyway even in terms of fun L'HOMME ORCHESTRE is meaninglesswhat was it about? It might have been about EvanEvans' nephew after all. The girls are nice and the dancing numbers rather average.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of the last of the great film noirs came in 1955 in the shape of THE DESPERATE HOURS. Although it was filmed in Paramount's own widescreen process of Vista Vision it at once established itself and maintained its arresting noir look through its stylish use of black and white cinematography  courtesy of the great Lee Garmes  and masterful direction of William Wyler. Adapted by Joseph Hayes from his novel and play the picture also boasts a terrific cast headed by Humphrey Bogart Fredric March and Arthur Kennedy. With a nod to his Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest 1936 Bogart in his next to last film is superb in the kind of role he knew so well that of the hard boiled criminal.Three escaped and armed convicts led by notorious Glenn Griffin Bogart take over a house in middle class suburbia and hold the Hilliard family at gunpoint until the mail arrives the following day containing their getaway money. In the meantime the terrorized family must carry on with their everyday routine without arousing anyone's suspicions. With the police hotly on the gang's trail and closing in  the family little by little  begin to make attempts to outwit their unwelcome guests gain the upper hand and thwart their plans. After two of the convicts are shot dead by the police the picture ends in a stunning sequence with the husband March confronting and fooling Griffin with an empty gun before the police marksmen under huge arc lights gun him down in a hail of gunfire in Hilliard's own front lawn.Thanks to Wyler's adroit direction his genius for camera angles and setups brilliant crisp cinematography and great performances THE DESPERATE HOURS is more than a neat little thriller. Suspense is maintained throughout at a very high level. Wyler's film proceeds with commendable energy and intensity. Mesmerizing is Bogart as the unshaven dishevelled sneering and dangerous leader of the three fugitives. His Glenn Griffin is one of his great and most underrated performances and should have at least earned him a nomination. Excellent too is the wonderful Fredric March as the beleaguered husband and father Dan Hilliard Spencer Tracy was originally slated to play this part but neither he nor Bogart would accept second billing. Also good is Martha Scott Judah Ben Hur's mother in Wyler's 1959 epic as the wife and mother the likable and illfated Gig Young as the boyfriend of Hilliard's daughter played by pretty Mary Murphy. And there's an extraordinary performance from the rotund Robert Middleton as Kobish the violent unscrupulous and giggling puerile convict.One disappointing aspect of the picture though is the sparse music score by composer Gail Kubik! There is an impressive raw pounding theme over the titles but no more music is heard then until towards the end of the picture. Kubik a noted conductor violinist and teacher was more akin to scoring shorts and documentaries and had scored only one other feature CMan in 1949. It is quite extraordinary that Wyler didn't use a more established movie composer. He had always made great use of music in his films i.e. Max Steiner for Jezebel 1938 Alfred Newman for Wuthering Heights 1939 Hugo Friedhofer for Best Years Of Our Lives 1946 and of course later with Jerome Moross for The Big Country 1958 and Miklos Rozsa for Ben Hur 1959. THE DESPERATE HOURS must be Wyler's shortest and least involving score. However the minimalist score not withstanding his DESPERATE HOURS remains a stunning evocation of the best that ever there was in crime movies. Taking the picture's main premise Michael Comino remade the movie in 1990. It was a valiant effort spoiled by the excessive and over stylized performance by the irritating Mickey Rourke in the Bogart role  diminishing the fine portrayals of Anthony Hopkins as the husband and the excellent characterization by David Morse in the Kobish role. Ultimately though the picture lacking the required tension and atmosphere was little more than a pale imitation of the original.".

A wellacted thriller directed by William Wyler that unfortunately doesn't have as much edge as it should. This doesn't even seem particularly gritty by 1955 standards and it's certainly tame in comparison to the decades of far more brutal home invasion movies. It is interesting and the cast does a good job for the most part but it's lacking that extra something to give it the proper amount of tension it needs. I didn't even find these guys all that menacing. Plus the characters do things that just seem to make no sense other than to keep the plot going in the way the writer needs it to. It's certainly not a bad movie and I would probably watch Bogart and March read the phone book but I just can't help but feel that this doesn't quite click. At least for me. I really think it would have been much better if it had more of a film noir style and edge to it. As it is it has no visual style at all and the only menace comes from threats and tough guy talk.".

Predictable is a very overused adjective that I've certainly been guilty of myself but what exactly is supposed to happen in a hostagetaking domestic thriller like this? Are aliens supposed to land in the Hilliards' back yard and vaporize everyone? Is Bogart's escaped con supposed to dress up in drag at some point and decide he wants to become a chorus girl? Would that satisfy those who find this movie predictable?The Desperate Hours keeps you on the edge of your seat it more than passes the test as a thriller and it most certainly has not mellowed over time. The script is fine intelligently examining how the respectably middle class but somewhat complacent father Frederic March draws strength and courage from the love of his wife and kids in handling the ordeal. Though each family member is formulating their own strategy for how best to resolve the crisis their brains are always going clickityclickityclick as Bogart mockingly keeps reminding them they recognize March as the father and as such the captain of the ship. They look to him for leadership and he responds. It's telling that when the young son disobediently puts his illconceived plan into action it undermines the father's nearly successful tactic. Though he had earlier suspected his dad of being cowardly for not taking a more aggressive stance from this point on he begins to appreciate all the variables he must take into account and looks up to him once more. The idealized but by no means wildly unrealistic domestic situation reflects the mood of the time. Why on earth would it possibly reflect cynically 90's attitudes and sensibilities as some reviewers seem to desire?There are casting decisions pertaining to age differences which raise an eyebrow but do not seriously detract from William Wyler's as masterful and dependable a director as Hollywood has ever cranked out  otherwise polished production. At 42 of course Gig Young seems a tad old for the family's 19 year old daughter beautiful Mary Murphy but he's still youthful enough looking and he puts an interesting spin on what is usually the thankless role of the boyfriend who stumbles into things. One of the beauties of BW photography is that it can always be used to make actors look as many as 515 years younger than they are. This comes into play with Bogart's character as well as he's asked to be the older brother of 32 year old Dewey Martin and it's something that I didn't have too hard a time buying. It's difficult to believe this was one of his last films as he seems quite vigorous and robust in the part.Tense exciting wellacted and directed this is indisputably far superior to Michael Cimino's bloody and botched 1990 Mickey Rourke star vehicle remake.".

	schema:headline " Excellent film from William Wyler";
	schema:reviewBody "Frederic March Martha Scott Humphrey Bogart and Arthur Kennedy are just a few of the people who endure The Desperate Hours a 1955 film based on the stage play and directed by William Wyler. On Broadway the play was directed by Robert Montgomery and starred Karl Malden in the Bogart role and Paul Newman played his brother here played by Dewey Martin. The film also stars Gig Young Mary Murphy Richard Eyer and Robert Middleton.Having just seen Bogart in the 1936 The Petrified Forest it was interesting to see him still taking hostages 19 years later  and in fact looking like he'd spent the last 19 years on the run from the law. He was clearly ill during the making of this film. Though Dewey Martin looked 30 years younger than Bogie he was in fact only 20 making the fact that they were brothers a tiny bit more plausible.I also had recently seen The Star Witness a 1931 Warner Brothers film with a similar plot which won an Oscar for best original screenplay. By 1955 it wasn't original any longer but the execution of the story is compelling. Martha Scott is a housewife Ellie Hilliard alone in her suburban home when three escaped criminals Bogart Martin and Middleton take over the place. Glenn Griffin Bogart wants to murder the Deputy Sheriff Arthur Kennedy who put him in prison and he needs to wait for the delivery of some money to make good his escape. Dan Hilliard March and his daughter Cynthia Murphy walk into the situation followed later by the Hilliard's little boy Eyer. You'll be wondering why the son isn't knocked off  by his parents  given the trouble he causes.The money is delayed and of course the police have no idea where the gang is as Griffin has put his car in the Hilliard garage. So the hours turn into overnight. Although March and Cynthia are allowed to leave the house for work and Cynthia has to keep a date with her boyfriend Young they're too terrified to say anything for fear the mother and boy will be killed. Basically the gang as well and the family become prisoners as the hours drag on.Wyler gives us lots of frightening and suspenseful moments as the tension builds in the house and he never lets the pace drag. Supposedly he made March and Scott do a goodbye scene for take after take because he thought March was acting and wanted to tire him out. An accomplished stage actor of the old school March consistently had a great presence but didn't always emotionally connect with his characters  he does here. March and Bogart make powerful adversaries March hitting just the right note as an angry father afraid for his family but not afraid to talk back to Griffin. Bogart's Griffin is shrewd and admires brains and bravery in others the family impresses him with their guts.Bogart is marvelous in the role  though tired out his character is determined to keep the gang together and free he's resentful of the middle classness of the family and how out of place he and his gang are in a nice home. Unlike his Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest Bogart's Griffin doesn't seem to have a sense of the hopelessness of his situation until the very end also unlike Duke Mantee he has a vulnerability that he demonstrates at the end.Robert Middleton gives a scary performance as a witless member of the gang and Martin as Hal displays Hal's disillusionment with the situation his attraction to Cynthia and the realization that he can never have someone like her if he continues down his brother's road. Gig Young is somewhat wasted as Cythia's boyfriend  it's unnecessary star casting. Martha Scott does a terrific job as the harried wife and mother. The wonderful Arthur Kennedy gives another good performance as the sheriff determined to catch Griffin.Highly recommended for its suspenseful story fine direction and top performances.".

By 1955 it wasn't original any longer but the execution of the story is compelling. Martha Scott is a housewife Ellie Hilliard alone in her suburban home when three escaped criminals Bogart Martin and Middleton take over the place. Glenn Griffin Bogart wants to murder the Deputy Sheriff Arthur Kennedy who put him in prison and he needs to wait for the delivery of some money to make good his escape. Dan Hilliard March and his daughter Cynthia Murphy walk into the situation followed later by the Hilliard's little boy Eyer. You'll be wondering why the son isn't knocked off  by his parents  given the trouble he causes.The money is delayed and of course the police have no idea where the gang is as Griffin has put his car in the Hilliard garage. So the hours turn into overnight. Although March and Cynthia are allowed to leave the house for work and Cynthia has to keep a date with her boyfriend Young they're too terrified to say anything for fear the mother and boy will be killed. Basically the gang as well and the family become prisoners as the hours drag on.Wyler gives us lots of frightening and suspenseful moments as the tension builds in the house and he never lets the pace drag. Supposedly he made March and Scott do a goodbye scene for take after take because he thought March was acting and wanted to tire him out. An accomplished stage actor of the old school March consistently had a great presence but didn't always emotionally connect with his characters  he does here. March and Bogart make powerful adversaries March hitting just the right note as an angry father afraid for his family but not afraid to talk back to Griffin. Bogart's Griffin is shrewd and admires brains and bravery in others the family impresses him with their guts.Bogart is marvelous in the role  though tired out his character is determined to keep the gang together and free he's resentful of the middle classness of the family and how out of place he and his gang are in a nice home. Unlike his Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest Bogart's Griffin doesn't seem to have a sense of the hopelessness of his situation until the very end also unlike Duke Mantee he has a vulnerability that he demonstrates at the end.Robert Middleton gives a scary performance as a witless member of the gang and Martin as Hal displays Hal's disillusionment with the situation his attraction to Cynthia and the realization that he can never have someone like her if he continues down his brother's road. Gig Young is somewhat wasted as Cythia's boyfriend  it's unnecessary star casting. Martha Scott does a terrific job as the harried wife and mother. The wonderful Arthur Kennedy gives another good performance as the sheriff determined to catch Griffin.Highly recommended for its suspenseful story fine direction and top performances.";

Desperate Hours however is different  this time out Bogie as Glen Griffin has a whole suburban family as hostage as he tries to complete his run for freedom from the law. Is this the first such home invasion type movie? Perhaps Suddenly 1954?The story is simply superb. Every good narrative succeeds because of certain literary aspects a believable story line downtoearth dialog that supports it a good measure of irony at appropriate turning points just the right amount of coincidence that can intrude on anybody's daily experience a dogged police officer who just won't give up in the search for what he believes and a family  an ordinary family  that finds within itself the courage imagination and strength to persevere in the face of the real threat of death.I saw this film long ago when just a lad so I didn't recall much of the story at all. But being a Bogie fan I looked forward to seeing it again when I got a hold of a DVD recently. I don't recall what movies were in the running for the Oscars that year but I think this should have been a contender apparently it wasn't.The cast was well chosen. Bogie of course was made for this part having done so many like it in the past  and that's not a sideswipe at typecasting Robert Middleton almost steals the movie with his portrayal of the psychopathic Kobish  a chilling portrayal Dewey Martin as Bogie's brother Hal provides a sense of decency that the other two lack the only jarring note for me why should he? He's on the run and drops all pretense of humanity when he decides to cut and run by himself. And we know what happens to anybody who cuts and runs right? Frederic March as Dan Hilliard ably shows what can happen to your principles and behavior when lives are at stake most of life's niceties go out the window as he tries to save his family. Understandable given the desperate situation. Martha Scott as his wife and Mary Murphy as his daughter Cindy are suitably frightened most of the time but they also summon the courage to oppose the bad guys when possible. The guy who isn't used so much is Arthur Kennedy as deputy sheriff Bard but his role is pivotal in bringing the story to a satisfactory ending. Pity because Kennedy was as fine an actor as Bogie or March. Gig Young as Cindy's suitor rounds out the main cast  he playing the puzzled hopeful who just won't go away when Cindy pleads with him to stay away. It's just as well that he didn't...The setting in small town America is just right the picture perfect home of the Hilliards standing for the American dream that is about to threatened and even destroyed. Which gives rise to one of the best lines in cinema history spoken by March near the end Get out  get out of my house! he nearly screams at Bogie thus cementing forever in film the idea of a man's home as his castle. Bogie visibly wilts before the stern and righteous wrath of March  but not only because of that does Bogie give it all up. You'll have to see the film to understand why.Most of the action is within the confines of the Hilliard house having been a stage play first that makes sense and the cinematography takes full advantage of all those nooks and crannies to enthrall the viewer and keep the suspense running. I liked particularly the reasonably long take of the camera behind the bad guys while they watch the old trash collector do his work and who seems to miss the presence of their stolen car in the garage. It's a priceless piece of work as the escapees faces keep looking at each other and then at the old man  and the viewer stays on edge all the time wondering will he react?The final showdown is simply a tour de force. It's fast and furious ranging all through the ground floor up the stairs and into the bedrooms and then back again as the protagonists fight it out for supremacy I was reminded of Dustin Hoffman's running fight with the bad guys in Straw Dogs 1971. In the hands of an inept director it would have been farcical but Wyler turns on the suspense and the irony as March overcomes his adversary  Bogie  in one of the coolest ways imaginable. No I won't tell you because that would spoil it for you.As the credits rolled by at the end my immediate thought was that this type of story is so believable it could happen to me or you...".

Whilst it is a 'reasonable' film there are some quite severe flaws to this film which are difficult to overlook....The premise for this film suggests that it's going to be a tense affair between some escaped convicts and an unsuspecting family. Whilst this film does offer some tension and some menace I found that it didn't do this consistently enough. It lost points immediately for me when I started to learn that the captors were allowing family members to leave the home for varying reasons. In what world would captors allow their hostages to roam the streets willynilly? OK the father was on errands for Griffin so I could buy him being allowed to venture outside just about but the daughter seemed to disappear off out with her boyfriend and served no real benefit to the captors by being out and about. These are quite severe flaws and Bogey muttering such lines as He won't go to the police he's not that stupid are all well and good at attempting to create tension and menace but make absolutely no logical sense. Sure he always has one member of the family there as an incentive for the family not to go to the police but why take the risk??? Home Invasion films generally have rather thin plots which don't usually necessitate a longrunning time and this shows here. At around the 105 minute mark this film is far too long and the strain starts to show towards the end  it does become repetitive and tedious at times. It's around the 90 minute mark before the police are able to track the gang down and seem to make very little effort to find them at any other time during the feature  the two strands of the film don't seem to mesh well and only really come together in the final few minutes the finale is both silly and exciting resulting in a mixed reaction from this viewer.I also felt that the direction could have done with being a bit tighter a more claustrophobic feel to the film would have certainly made it a little bit more intense.As far as performances go then I'm afraid it's not a great story on that front Bogey fares the best here but many of his costars and rather weak and made very little impression on the picture. His coconspirators fall into the usual clichs a large overbearing clumsy oaf who challenges for leadership and a weakwilled convict who is never sure whose side he wants to be on.As an early example of the genre then this is definitely watchable and is certainly worth watching. However the scripting issues and farfetched plot elements do drag it down somewhat making it an OK film but not the brilliant film that many are suggesting it to be.".

Terrific tension is generated in the hostage taking and the need to cover it up I know it's wrong but I wanted the Griffin boys to succeed. The supporting cast is perfect in depicting a typical American family of the period. Kobish the dimwitted but violent felon was a great character and Dewey Martin as the younger Griffin he was also in another Bogart film Knock on Any Door probably had the most poignant line in the whole movie when he responds to his older brother who said he taught him everything by replying except how to live in a house like this. One thing I can't remember is whether or not we see Griffin's girlfriend onscreen at all. Well anyway terrific movie 910.".

I also have one question....why in my entire 38 year life have I never seen this on TV? No question that Bogart's best films of the 30's  40's are classics as well as 1950'sAfrican Queen. I cannot fathom just how it is this has gone under the radar for so long. Being that its from late in his career his 2nd to last filmI was expecting a dudagainsince I'd never heard of it.Some folks can easily joke that since the exterior is the Cleaver housethe film is then unintentionally funny. Amazinglyit was this very aspect that made it all the more engrossing! I actually think it is an unintentionally brilliant idea! What this does for the film is demonstrate thatwhile in some ways the '50s were the innocent erait also shows that like in any time in historythings are not perfect. There was crime then as there's crime now. There's just unfortunatley more excuses for it today. It really was like watching on of those squeaky clean B  W TV families get shaken up! Againthat really made it more exciting.Why? Becauseinstead of just letting these thugs hold complete sway over their homethey fight back and schemeeven though it could mean the worst! It really disspells what TV shows back then were saying about the American family. I've only seen Fredric March in one other filmThe Best Years Of Our Lives. Which he was also good in but herehe's one of the few actors that gets to defeat Bogratwhen he's playing a bad guy. I knew Bogart and his motley crew would be defeated in the end but the exciting part was sitting through to see how this otherwise gentle but strong family would emerge unharmed except for Bogart hitting March over the head.I don't see how anyone can say Bogart and March's acting was less than great. Humphrey Bogat does what he does best when he's the villain and March is just electric in his role! ..and you rarely hear that about an actor from the old days. Each actor in this filmhowever big or small their roledoes their fair share as well. Someone called this a '50s time capsule. Wellthat's what some folks make time capsules for....to be opened and revisit another era. In the case ofThe Desperate HoursI not only think it's worthy in that wayI think it's original print should grace the Library of Congress!..and noI do not exaggerate.

It was a sort of metaphor for the capacity within us all to stand up to injustice and look for our own inner strength.The plot is VERY simple. An evil gang takes a family hostage while hiding from the police. However what makes the film stand out is the exquisite writing and acting that follows.

	schema:reviewBody "Dan Hilliard and his family are perfect Americans corresponding admirably to the bourgeois ideal.  The two children are bright goodlooking and obedient.  Cindy is about 20 and is going steady with an attorney who owns a sports car.  Ralphy is eight or so all plaid shirts jeans and attitude.  He has a baseball mitt and a bicycle.  Ellie Dan's wife runs their spotless home with quiet efficiency.  Everything is in its place. Trash collectors call at fixed times.  Breakfast is a serene family ritual. The Hilliards' home life is as balanced as regular and as dull as the barometer on the wall.  As for Dan Hillier himself he has attained that mythic status to which all 1950's bourgeois males aspired  he is an executive.  The middle classes don't want adventure in their lives they want predictability.  And this is the perfect dreamlike state in which the Hilliards pass their anodyne existence secure in their suburban womb  until the American Nightmare is unleashed upon them.      What if members of The Underclass with their dirty unshaven physicality and their sagging torn clothes should irrupt into the suburbs? What if by some catastrophic failure the police and the prison service can't keep The Underclass in its designated containers?  How will nice folks like the Hilliards cope if confronted by these alien beings?      There has been a jailbreak.  The citizens of Indianapolis have been warned to watch out for three desperadoes  the two Griffin brothers and their accomplice Kobish.  Little do the Hilliards realise as they go about their tranquil suburban lives but the fugitives are about to choose the Hilliard home as a place to hole up ...       Like Suddenly made a year earlier this is a 'bad guys invaded my home' movie.  The downside of bourgeois affluence is the fear that the disenfranchised masses will come to take away your goodies.       Humphrey Bogart was in his late 50's and clearly ailing when he played the part of Glenn Griffin the leader of the fugitive trio.  He would make only two more films in the short time that was left to him.  Dewey Martin 26 years his junior plays his kid brother Hal.       More than anything The Desperate Hours is a film about social class. You can't play ball with savages like that opines a Madison County detective.  Glenn holds his social superiors in equal contempt calling them smarteyed respectable suckers.  He warns Hal not to expect any favours from the class enemy Guys like Hilliard ever give you a fair shake?  Much play is made of linguistic markers which separate the educated from the rest 'whom' instead of 'who' and contrasts in table manners between the refined Hilliards and their thuggish captors.  Glenn lashes out against the tea tray that emblem of middleclass gentility and the virginal Cindy whom he urges Hal to 'take'.       Dire though the Hilliards' predicament may be they are not alone.  They are exactly the kind of people the forces of law and order exist to protect and serve and it is not long before Madison County's finest and the FBI are closing in on the fugitives.  And the cops have science on their side.  They can tap the phone of Glenn's girlfriend in Pittsburgh and tail her across America as she heads for the rendezvous.  In the police station the humming wires never rest as technology narrows down the bad guys' options.      Middleclass sensibility is allpervasive.  Chuck and Cindy argue near the sports car but break off abruptly when two people pass by.  No matter how deeply the emotions may run it isn't seemly to fight in front of the neighbours.  Dan's secretary can tell from nuances of his behaviour that something is very wrong.  Similarly the trashman senses that things are amiss with Ellie by the quality of her chat.  We see Cindy admiring her curves in front of the hallway mirror because it is important that she be sexually desirable so that the fugitives will regard her as a chattle. Chuck however has to remain sexually thwarted because his behaviour is bound by rigid bourgeois restrictions.  We see him raise the armrest in his sports car in the hope of a grappling session with Cindy then lowering it dejectedly when he realises that his luck is out.  Dan's wave to Chuck to cross the threshold is a symbolic acceptance of him as a soninlaw.  He has made it into The Family.       Light represents goodness.  Cindy comes home after another chaste date with Chuck and is bathed in bright light on the doorstep.  Dan and Ellie declare their love for each other their bodies lit intensely in an otherwise black bedroom.  The searchlights of the police and the bad guys' vain attempts to eradicate them show us figuratively what we yearn to see  that good will always triumph over social disruption.     The overpowering of Ellie the smashing of Ralphy's toy plane and the collapse of Cindy all happen on the same spot and are all filmed from the same low angle.  These dramatic incidents show the Hilliards at bay and the unusual vantagepoint stresses the 'wrongness' of what is happening.    Implausibilities abound throughout the movie.  How likely is it that the front door would be left unlocked that Chuck would reach the house ahead of the cops or that Dan would insist on carrying a gun then empty its clip? Why would he hesitate to call the police in once he got the upper hand? Why would everyone leave the family unattended moments after the conclusion of a violent and dramatic siege?      And yet it works.  Glenn's love of his brother breaks through his toughguy facade and after he gives his guns away he undergoes a tragic 'King Lear' moment of selfrealisation.  These are powerful moments in a powerful film.".

	schema:headline " Methodical Drama with Stilted 50's Sensibilities";
	schema:reviewBody "6 out of 10     Bogart and pals escape from prison and hide out in a suburban home. There they hold the parents and two children hostage.  The father March quietly plots a plan and slowly takes control of the situation.     The film certainly does have it's minuses.  The plot is too general in nature and too sanitized.  The crooks don't seem too smart or sophisticated. They never seem very menacing and seem completely out of control not only with the family but even amongst themselves.  Things seem to unravel for them at almost predictable intervals making the suspense rather minimal. They also make some glaring tactical errors.  Having the family move around freely and talk amongst themselves upstairs while the bad guys 'stand guard' downstairs seems stupid.  It's almost like asking them to come up with an escape plan.     Bogie is one terrific actor who can be very adept at creating dark characters just catch his performance in TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE.  Yet here despite his best efforts he comes across as being bland. This is mainly due to all the problems mentioned above.     On the plus side is the fact that the film is very methodically paced and builds to a good climax.  The interior of the house is well designed. The staging is excellent and allows for some good dramatic shots.  The neighborhood exterior is also very detailed.  March gives a powerhouse performance and his confrontations with Bogart are excellent.     If you can get past the stilted 50's lingo and sensibilities then you may find that this film still has some impact.  Little Ralphie is one the most endearing child characters you'll see.  He is cute but very feisty and daring especially with the bad guys.  If you look quickly you can also see Joe Flynn in a very early role as a driver of a hijacked car.".

The father March quietly plots a plan and slowly takes control of the situation.     The film certainly does have it's minuses.  The plot is too general in nature and too sanitized.  The crooks don't seem too smart or sophisticated. They never seem very menacing and seem completely out of control not only with the family but even amongst themselves.  Things seem to unravel for them at almost predictable intervals making the suspense rather minimal. They also make some glaring tactical errors.  Having the family move around freely and talk amongst themselves upstairs while the bad guys 'stand guard' downstairs seems stupid.  It's almost like asking them to come up with an escape plan.     Bogie is one terrific actor who can be very adept at creating dark characters just catch his performance in TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE.  Yet here despite his best efforts he comes across as being bland. This is mainly due to all the problems mentioned above.     On the plus side is the fact that the film is very methodically paced and builds to a good climax.  The interior of the house is well designed. The staging is excellent and allows for some good dramatic shots.  The neighborhood exterior is also very detailed.  March gives a powerhouse performance and his confrontations with Bogart are excellent.     If you can get past the stilted 50's lingo and sensibilities then you may find that this film still has some impact.  Little Ralphie is one the most endearing child characters you'll see.  He is cute but very feisty and daring especially with the bad guys.  If you look quickly you can also see Joe Flynn in a very early role as a driver of a hijacked car.";

There's not much actually WRONG with it but when you see a name like Wyler on the credits you expect a little something extra. For me Freddie March has always been mannered a graduate of the Paul Muni School Of Mannered Acting so I didn't expect too much from him and he didn't let me down. Bogie was excellent but then when wasn't he but even so he's just reprising his Duke Mantee Mad Dog Earle etc and offering nothing new andor original to his portrayal of a hardened criminal with nothing to lose. There's a nice roster of Hollywood character actors embracing Ray Teal Ray Collins Whit Bissell etc who turn up say their lines and don't bump into the furniture. Despite a few 'outdoor' scenes this is very much an adaptation of a stage play where the intention  I didn't see the play so I can only speculate  would have been to highlight the claustrophobia and the 'opening out' has the adverse effect of diluting and neutralising the 'tension' of a family trapped in their own home by three ruthless convicts. Watchable sure but not more than once.".

Their predicament and the desperation that they feel is immediately understood by audiences everywhere and this is what gives the movie so much power and potency. The family understandably feel indignant violated and quite helpless but also recognise that they need to be resourceful and cooperative if they are to have any hope of survival.Joseph Hayes' well written screenplay was adapted from his own novel which was in turn inspired by a reallife incident that received a great deal of press coverage in 1952. The knowledge that this type of hostage situation actually took place gives The Desperate Hours added credibility and despite the strict censorship standards that applied at the time this movie undeniably still packs a powerful punch.When a group of three escaped convicts travel through a respectable suburban estate in their stolen car their leader Glenn Griffin Humphrey Bogart notices one home with a child's bicycle outside its front door and decides that this is the ideal type of residence for the men to hide out in because if the residents have children they will obviously be easier to control. The gang members break into the house in which housewife Eleanor Hilliard Martha Scott is busy at work and park their car in the Hilliards' garage.Glenn who's accompanied by his younger brother Hal Dewey Martin and Sam Kobish Robert Middleton is armed and orders Eleanor to disclose where her husband keeps his gun. Hal then takes charge of the husband's gun and Glenn forces Eleanor to make a telephone call to his girlfriend Helen Miller to arrange for her to deliver some money to the house later that night. When Dan Hilliard Fredric March and his grown up daughter Cindy Mary Murphy return from work and tenyearold Ralphie Richard Eyer returns from school they walk into a horrific situation and all immediately become hostages.Glenn and local Deputy Sheriff Jesse Bard Arthur Kennedy had crossed swords in the past and because of this Jesse is put in charge of the manhunt. Glenn tells Dan that the gang will leave as soon as his girlfriend arrives with the money. Police checks identify where Helen is and Jesse arranges for her to be followed so that she can lead them to the convicts. These arrangements go wrong when Helen gets stopped for committing a traffic violation and the Hilliards' plight from that point on gets progressively worse.Humphrey Bogart and Fredric March both give strong performances as two men who are polar opposites and regard each other with nothing but contempt. Bogart as the vicious criminal shows the level of strain he's under as he tries to evade the attentions of the police whilst also having to control not only his hostages but also his other gang members who both become unpredictable and dangerous at times. March is very believable as the conventional department store executive who's frightened by the predicament he's in and determined to protect his family at all costs. The quality of the acting by the supporting cast is also extremely good and contributes greatly to the success of this very intense and claustrophobic thriller.".

A rare opportunity for an actor to show his gathered experience and professionalism so vividly and a treat for viewers. Some doubts have always been made about him to be maybe too old for the role but I don't think so. All I see is great acting and a believable bad guy. He is smart and ruthless in his wheeling and dealing. He provokes and observes loves to control the situations and the family. While trying to fix himself money to resume the escape his time of hiding starts to seem like a twisted analysis of what makes an ordinary family tick. A kind of family he has obviously never had and feels betrayed and angered about it. He does have a younger brother and a halfwitted partner with him but they do not connect except on the means of escaping the law. In the end I got a feeling that during the time spent in the house in his own way he has already got a small portion of the sort of freedom he always wished for. With that point of view the final fast close shot of his face is thought provoking. A flashing example on effects of Bogart's expressive face and little gestures of his that were able to make grand suggestions to the scenes.March is almost equally impressive in his ways as a man running his family gently but firmly a total opposite to Bogart's Griffin. He can also be equally menacing in defending his home specially in the last scenes. But his urge to use violence and brutality are strictly controlled by his care for his family. That love becomes his power as well as his weakness at handling the desperate incident. During the growing tension his role becomes something like a family man version of Jekyll and Hyde of him being forced to adapt himself some aspects of his worst enemy to overcome the situation. Just watch March's and Bogart's expressions changing to and fro as they exchange threats. One can sense signs that in other circumstances the places could in fact change rather easily in their battle of wills. Although it's the acting that most impresses me in this movie the director's work must also be very much appreciated. Wyler has used the house and its two floors with setups camera angles and lighting effectively to stage and express the power play and threat. The tension keeps growing up by building situation upon situation and it never lets go even when we're elsewhere out of the house or seeing what the law enforcement is up to at the same time.An excellent crime and hostage drama that hasn't lost none of its power in 52 years. A family unit as a representative of normal society colliding with outside terror is after all still a very active and contemporary subject.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know how movie goers in the Fifties reacted to this film but viewing it today makes the events in the story seem pretty preposterous. Not that it didn't have it's moments of psychological drama and tense confrontation but it seems to me that Dan Hilliard Fredric March and daughter Cindy Mary Murphy had way too much freedom to go about their normal routines without attempting to reach out for help. Granted there was the element of danger to the remaining family members but the do nothing approach of playing along with gangster Glenn Griffin Humphrey Bogart and his cohorts wore thin on me as the story unfolded. Back that up with all of the unsupervised time that Ellie Martha Scott and son Ralph seemed to have it just left me wondering why they didn't take advantage of all the windows and doors in their large suburban home.As an experienced con Griffin didn't seem to have that much control over brother Hal Dewey Martin and the big lug Kobish Robert Middleton. That was most evident in the back to back scenarios where each refused to give up his gun to the boss. Allowing Hal to leave was another tactical mistake at least he could have left his weapon. For all his macho bravado Griffin wasn't thinking very clearly.Even boyfriend Chuck managed to bother me why take the hard line stance with the Feds when they're about to break the case? Getting to the Hilliard home before even one police car arrived also seemed to defy credibility.Credit Fredric March for rising above the source material to provide a reasonably compelling performance as the put upon Ward Cleaver stand in. Now there's a thought  with the film shot using the same exterior set as the one used in Leave It To Beaver wouldn't it have been great to see the Beav put one over on the Griffin's and Kobish? OK I seem to be getting unduly harsh on The Desperate Hours. I guess the best way to view the film is to tuck away the criticism and get caught up in the flow of the story. In his last gangster turn Bogey's still credible as a movie tough guy and wired about as hair trigger as Duke Mantee Baby Face Martin and Mad Dog Earle. This was the only time he and March appeared in a film with each other and their scenes together are stand out.".

Granted there was the element of danger to the remaining family members but the do nothing approach of playing along with gangster Glenn Griffin Humphrey Bogart and his cohorts wore thin on me as the story unfolded. Back that up with all of the unsupervised time that Ellie Martha Scott and son Ralph seemed to have it just left me wondering why they didn't take advantage of all the windows and doors in their large suburban home.As an experienced con Griffin didn't seem to have that much control over brother Hal Dewey Martin and the big lug Kobish Robert Middleton. That was most evident in the back to back scenarios where each refused to give up his gun to the boss. Allowing Hal to leave was another tactical mistake at least he could have left his weapon. For all his macho bravado Griffin wasn't thinking very clearly.Even boyfriend Chuck managed to bother me why take the hard line stance with the Feds when they're about to break the case? Getting to the Hilliard home before even one police car arrived also seemed to defy credibility.Credit Fredric March for rising above the source material to provide a reasonably compelling performance as the put upon Ward Cleaver stand in. Now there's a thought  with the film shot using the same exterior set as the one used in Leave It To Beaver wouldn't it have been great to see the Beav put one over on the Griffin's and Kobish? OK I seem to be getting unduly harsh on The Desperate Hours. I guess the best way to view the film is to tuck away the criticism and get caught up in the flow of the story. In his last gangster turn Bogey's still credible as a movie tough guy and wired about as hair trigger as Duke Mantee Baby Face Martin and Mad Dog Earle. This was the only time he and March appeared in a film with each other and their scenes together are stand out.";

Perhaps the reason this film works so well is that instead of dealing with the usual tropes De Villa restricts his story to three individuals who are suffering isolation in the noise and autonomy of New York City and are thus 'adrift' in a life that seems flat and without a beacon of hope. The story De Villa weaves is one of interaction of these characters by almost serendipitous incidents moments that change their lives  at least for a while.Teenager Simon Colon Victor Rasuk lives with his overbearing mother Marta Marlene Forte and gets through his life almost without speaking working in a camera shop spending his idle hours photographing people in the park. Tommaso Pensara Dominic Chianese is an elderly painter and music lover who lives alone and supports himself by being the 'mail boy' in a large firm his loneliness is heightened when he discovers he has macular degeneration and will go blind. The physician who makes his diagnosis is Dr. Rose Phipps Heather Graham who is grieving from the recent death of her 2year old child and is unable to continue her marriage to literature professor Mark Phipps William Baldwin.The threads of coincidence begin to tie these people together when Simon begins to photograph Rose in a manner that resembles stalking when Tommaso notices and desires and older lady at his workplace Isabel Parades Elizabeth Pea and is encouraged by Dr Rose to share his potential blindness with this friend and when Rose explores the attention Simon bestows on her filling an emotional need for both parties. Naturally the development of these intersections is more complex but at the same time the manner in which they develop is very tender and gentle.Some viewers may find the film meandering a bit too much this is not linear storytelling but rather shifts in incidents and moods and gradual changes that occur among these simple but needy people much like the coincidences and random kindnesses occur to the sensitive eye. The cast is very fine and the cinematography and musical score sustain the mood of the piece. This film requires involvement on the part of the viewer and that involvement has its rewards.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a pleasant surprise that returns faith in American movie the faith that has been suffering for a long while recovering just rarely by Tim Burton's work or movies like Eternal Sunshine... We  especially us who live outside USA  have been exposed to so much Hollywood vain shallow plastic movies in range from superhero action violence and funless teen comedies to the worst movie blasphemies  remakes that we use to forget that there are small movies untouched by Hollywood lethal sauce. Even masterpieces like Big Fish Edward Scissorhand Chocolate Green Mile or already mentioned Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind have a clear Hollywood sign and after all those Rambos and American Pies comics based blockbusters and remakes of French movies what is additionally ironic because average American movie consumer would rather see a rattlesnake on the floor than French movie on the screen this touch of Hollywood became odious what is a tragic decline for this old temple of movies... just few decades ago the touch of Hollywood style was the best praise a movie could be given.Adrift in Manhattan is more European style than any American movie I've seen for a long while even more it is more European style than many European movies made in last two decades. Too many European movie makers make movies to fit into Hollywood standards hoping it will sell better now American authors teach Europe a lesson how good a movie can exist without Hollywood sugar false glamour and forced tears.The basic thing that connects main characters in the movie is loneliness. Though set on Manhattan we don't get the feeling that the big city is the prime suspect for their loneliness they would probably be lonely everywhere on Earth. Not only that but somehow New York eases their pain and helps them find each other find them the way to tomorrow. And this is one of those things that are so often in Europe a kind of love stories between director and his city an ode and praise to it something that American authors so rarely give us.The second feeling mutual to the characters besides loneliness is guilt. They all carry a burden of old mistakes on their conscience  even if they aren't really guilty from our point of view. And their loneliness grows not only because this burden presses them too hard not only because they are ashamed but mostly because they are afraid to share it with anybody. And only learning to open their souls to another person  whoever it may be the more unknown stranger the easier it can be done  can give them hope a chance for redemption and leaving this guilt behind them. Sharing a burden reduces the pressure. And as we follow these people we will see how some relations terminate because of total loss of communication while others appear and develop once the shell softens.There are no breathtaking performances in the movie but all the actors made a good job. Personally I find Dominic Chianese a bit above the others but it was a most interesting character so the role offered more chances more challenges. The unobtrusive music was well aligned to beautiful photography camera loved both the actors and the city.This movie gave us a picture of some other New York than we usually see and a completely different picture of American movies than we are used to watch.".

Though set on Manhattan we don't get the feeling that the big city is the prime suspect for their loneliness they would probably be lonely everywhere on Earth. Not only that but somehow New York eases their pain and helps them find each other find them the way to tomorrow. And this is one of those things that are so often in Europe a kind of love stories between director and his city an ode and praise to it something that American authors so rarely give us.The second feeling mutual to the characters besides loneliness is guilt. They all carry a burden of old mistakes on their conscience  even if they aren't really guilty from our point of view. And their loneliness grows not only because this burden presses them too hard not only because they are ashamed but mostly because they are afraid to share it with anybody. And only learning to open their souls to another person  whoever it may be the more unknown stranger the easier it can be done  can give them hope a chance for redemption and leaving this guilt behind them. Sharing a burden reduces the pressure. And as we follow these people we will see how some relations terminate because of total loss of communication while others appear and develop once the shell softens.There are no breathtaking performances in the movie but all the actors made a good job. Personally I find Dominic Chianese a bit above the others but it was a most interesting character so the role offered more chances more challenges. The unobtrusive music was well aligned to beautiful photography camera loved both the actors and the city.This movie gave us a picture of some other New York than we usually see and a completely different picture of American movies than we are used to watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "Adrift in Manhattan tells three intertwining tales of life along Manhattan's 1 subway line. The film was originally called 19 but was probably changed due to the 9 recently being discontinued. The first concerns an optometrist Heather Graham haunted by the death of her child and no longer able to make a connection to anyone including her estranged husband William Baldwin. The second deals with a teenager Victor Rasuk with a disturbing home life who can only relate to the world through a camera lens. The third deals with an elderly painter Dominic Chianese best known for playing Uncle Junior on The Sopranos rapidly losing his eyesight as he discovers love with a younger woman Elizabeth Pena.I don't give this film a 10 rating lightly...I don't gratuitously hand out the highest ratings to films. But I loved this movie and I love movies like this characterdriven dramas with solid plots in which the featured players take interesting unexpected paths. Adrift in Manhattan is filled with great characters who could each be the single focus of a film. It's to the credit of director Alfredo de Villa that he manages to fit them all within the confines of this roughly 90 minute movie in such a satisfying manner.The acting is excellent. Heather Graham gives a carefully nuanced performance that should serve to remind people she can be a great actress when working with solid material and a skilled director. William Baldwin is a revelation. Here you realize the magnitude of his potential and how he is not just one of the Baldwin brothers. Victor Rasuk manages to be both creepy and sympathetic and it's a credit to his talent that you wind up rooting for him more than anyone else. Dominic Chianese gives a heartbreaking performance and proves to be an actor of great depth. Anyone expecting to see traces of Uncle Junior will be surprised. It makes one hope he stays with us a long long time so that we can see the full realization of his talents now that the spotlight is on him and he's better able to get good roles like this. I could go on and on about the standout performance by Elizabeth Pena but time is limited.There's a raw leavenothingtotheimagination sex scene between Graham and a certain character trying not to divulge any serious spoilers here that is not only surprising given how when Graham shot it there were very high hopes for her ABC sitcom and for her becoming a network prime time queen but cathartic and wholly satisfying in terms of character arc. It is shocking and unexpected when it comes but makes perfect sense when you realize the film has been building up to it.Best of all about Adrift in Manhattan de Villa effortlessly presents a New York City vibrant in all of its diverse glory not only in terms of race but age class mental stability aspirations and broken dreams...the way the city truly is. This isn't the fake lifeless Midwest fantasy New York you find in Friends Sex and the City The Devil Wears Prada and most sitcoms and movies of the last several years. This is the real New York as presented through the gaze of narrative film.Travel along the 1 train in Manhattan and you'll find a million stories with each one leading to a million others. A real life nonvirtual MySpace network. De Villa and cowriter Nat Moss take three interconnecting ones and the result is an amazing film that not only provides an ideal showcase for the actors involved but also serves notice to the filmmaking community that a talented director has arrived. Let's hope some studio or minimajor pays attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "I often get annoyed at movies like this where you get too many character threads interweaving. These types of films tend to spend too little time on the characters and thus have to rely on superficial plot twists and clichd conflicts. I put Crash and Babel in these categories. Both enjoyable enough films but they fail at their core because they focus too much on the events that the characters face rather than their response to them. Enter Adrift in Manhattan. The ambition here is less than a Crash or Babel  it's not trying to explain the modern angst of society or draw global interconnectedness links  but rather to simply explore the lives of a small group of characters in a one city whose lives happen to intersect. As a result we get to really know them see what's driving them shockingly through their acting and the filming and not uninteresting plot twists  most of the intense events that drive them all took place prior to the film and then watch how it unfolds. There are no neat plot resolutions. Rather the characters are left with their lives but hopefully with a more evolved sense of where they fit in it and how to take control of it. For me this is great storytelling and a perfect kind of characterbased film. In addition nearly all of the performances are exceptional. Heather Graham seems to have pushed herself in a completely different direction from her typical fare. Anyone who thought she was just fit for lighthearted role and I include myself in that group is in for a remarkable surprise. Her character is grieving heavily but Graham never overdoes it. Instead she lets the grief speak for itself and the result is undeniably moving. Ditto for a handful of moments that are truly hysterical. It's a revelation to see her play a comedic moment in a drama without laying it on. Similarly Victor Rasuk is exceptional particularly given the dearth of actual lines he has. His eyes his posture and his hesitancy give his character the depth that it needs. He's a completely different character from the one we saw in Raising Victor Vargas. Withdrawn shy insecure... and yet his camera convincingly and effectively draws him out of that. And perhaps the sweetest storyline is that of Dominic Chianese and Elizabeth Pena whose tentative romance is one of the most tender I've ever seen on film.This movie is an honest 10. Everything in it is earned. The script is very strong and not overpowering or contrived at any point. The cinematography is beautiful and really catches the flavor of a real and gritty Manhattan. And finally the direction is superb. Given the tightness of the script the movie has to rely on shooting to really show us the characters and what they are feeling. And it does so exceptionally. I recommend it unequivocally to anyone who enjoys a very well crafted characterbased drama.".

Character One Simon a severely sociallymaladapted 20yearold living in an apartment with his mentally ill mother who uses him for her emotional gratification. Character Two Tommaso an elderly mail clerk who has lived alone his whole life so as not to have to share his time or attention with others and who learns at the outset that he's going blind. Character Three Rose Phipps a young professional who when we see her we sense a mute sadness. Character Four Mark Phipps her estranged husband who has only two notes  anger and frustration. And Isabel a family matriarch in Tommaso's office who lives vicariously through her grandchildren. With the exception of Rose who is the emotional center of this movie these really aren't people I'd want to spend much time with.Rose an optometrist gives the diagnosis to Tommaso and suggests that he tell his family and his friends of his condition so as to help his transition into longterm disability. She later becomes a defacto therapist for him as he works through his denial and anger over the predicament and later as he tentatively pursues a romance with Isabel in his office. Isabel for her part develops an attachment to him but it really seems unmotivated there's no real chemistry between them and their interaction up until the time he asks her on a date is full of uncharming awkwardness. Nor does he doesn't do much to endear himself to her or her family as the romance such as it is progresses. He just seems like a grumpy old man who can only talk about himself. I could understand her motivation if it were mere sympathy but the script wanted it to be more and it just wasn't earned.Simon works in a camera shop and as such has access to longrange lenses since he doesn't have any social outlets skills or interests he already lives rather voyeuristically so walking around photographing strangers comes quite naturally to him. But he has a problem he's attracted to pretty women. OK that might not be a problem in itself but what he decides to do as a result seems questionable. He stalks them. He follows them to their residences. He sits in the dark across from their building and lurks and shoots photos through open windows. He follows them when they go with their exspouses to public events and sits nearby watching them. These scenes are interspersed with scenes of his home life with his crackpot mother in which there's an unhealthy lack of intimacy boundaries and this is all meant to show him as pathetic and helpless but I wasn't buying it. He seemed simply creepy. And that's what makes the next thing so implausible when Rose catches him out she doesn't have a restraining order put in place on him which anyone in her position in real life would do. Instead she eventually starts to encourage his behavior.Rose is afflicted by grief and I do have to say that Graham hits this noteperfect. She has the stricken aura that anyone who has lost someone near can identify. Her emotional world has been slammed sideways only her work continues which she continues joylessly if competently. Of course it's telegraphed from the first scenes what her affliction is which makes the explication later more or less gratuitous. Her estranged husband attempts to maintain contact with her but he's oblivious to all but his own needs and this makes him oafish and repellent.Tommaso eventually treasures his isolation more than any intimacy Isabel hoped for and was willing to offer and he asks her to meet him at the park and then stands her up. We saw this coming didn't we? He watches from a distance in order to cradle his loneliness. Rose lures her stalker into her brownstone and seduces him. Within the confines of her story this is believable  she wants to feel anything different that what she's been feeling for the last 8 months  but then the movie itself takes you out of that believability by reminding us just what damaged goods Simon is so that even while her motivations make sense the scene is implausible. Not even the sight of Heather Graham's finelyshaped rear is enough to take this scene seriously. And then with even greater implausibility the movie wraps up these dangling threads with succinct neatness Simon stands up to his abusive mother leaves her to her own twisted devices and suddenly walks with confidence soon bumping into and befriending Tommaso who's finally accepted the need of the help of others. Rose returns as a surprise to her estranged husband.I guess the takeaway is all a young guy needs is to get laid by an older woman. And all she needs to return to her husband is to get laid by someone who's violated her privacy. Eh what? 410 only because the acting is mostly good especially by Graham and Pena.".

And all she needs to return to her husband is to get laid by someone who's violated her privacy. Eh what? 410 only because the acting is mostly good especially by Graham and Pena.";

The Oeudipal relationship the son has wih his mother was totally believable as well.It is a NY movie and thank god for it. That kind of intersecting of lives with a voyeurisitc view. In the Big City that never stops. To love to die to suffer to think to live. I am now totally obsessed with this Mexican American director Alfredo de Villa and look forward to this next movie.

	schema:headline " A meandering film which is ultimately going nowhere";
	schema:reviewBody "Ah look at all the lonely people. Adrift in Manhattan focuses on three very lonely New Yorkers whose lives are destined to intersect. Heather Graham has the role which is meant to tie the plot together. She plays optometrist Rose Phipps a woman who has suffered a great loss and who now lives alone while trying to piece her life back together. Dominic Chianese plays our second main character Tommaso an elderly painter classical music enthusiast and mailroom worker. As we meet him he is being informed by Rose that he is going blind. And then there is young photo shop worker Simon played by Victor Rasuk. One day Simon sees Rose sitting on a bench in the park and decides to more or less become a stalker following her around the city taking her picture. He even follows her all the way home taking pictures of her through the windows. Creepy? You bet.As the film progresses we learn more about each of these characters. We learn why it is that Rose is seemingly alone in the world. We learn that Simon is extremely shy and withdrawn apparently having very little idea of how to relate to people. This may have something to do with his mother with whom he has one of the most uncomfortably bizarrely affectionate parentchild relationships ever seen. The focus of the story really is Rose and Simon. Which is a shame because Tommaso is far and away the most interesting character in the film. We see his frustrations as he deals with his failing sight blindness akin to a death sentence for this simple but proud man who so loves to paint. And we see him fall in love with a much younger woman from his office Isabel played by Elizabeth Pea. Their relationship tugs at the heartstrings their interactions always compelling. And Chianese and Pea easily give the best performances in the film. Rather unfortunately it seems the movie is always rushing through Tommaso's scenes so the focus can get back to Rose.The film meanders about cutting back and forth between our three main protagonists. But the story never really pays itself off. Tommaso is compelling Rose somewhat less so and Simon barely even communicative hard to identify with. Eventually Rose does something which makes absolutely no sense something you would never believe anyone in her position would even conceive of doing and from there the movie really falls apart. For a film which seemed to have some genuine promise especially in Tommaso's story in the end it just kind of limply fizzles out. Chianese did excellent work and created a great character and he and Pea work together wonderfully. But the story which surrounds them ultimately falls flat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Enjoyed the film very much. The three main characters each have issues to deal with and are a bit trapped in themselves. The young man is so inhibited you can practically feel the pressure in him about to explode. The old man is facing new horizons and is afraid of what that will bring. And the doctor is consumed with grief. The way the movie threads the lives of these 3 ordinary characters is done beautifully. Without knowing each characters intentions we see how our actions great or small affect others. My only complaint is it took a while to figure out what problem the Doctor was having and there was not much information provided as to how the child died. As to the old man the scene where he is drawing is incredible. His story unfolds quickly and the woman he works with does a great job in reaching out to him. The young man is a more complicated story. There is little to go on in trying to figure him out. His mother is overbearing and a little too close to him. Yet that is about all we can tell except that he likes to take pictures. His inability to communicate clearly with anyone creates an enormous amount of tension and the sex scene with him and the Doctor finally breaks down his wall. Beautifully produced. Would recommend. On a purely technical note I occasionally found the sound track not consistent and would have to raise and lower the volume on the remote.  This could be due to my TV or the actual copy that Hulu is transmitting.".

I really don't need to have everything layed out for me but some clue as to what is happening would be nice.Spoiler I only read here that their lives seem to connect cause of some subway line or it is supposed to revolve around that. I never would have guessed that so there is something pretty wrong with the movie. Actually i was wondering if some of them were living in the same building or if it was all just concidental. Characters don't have a lot of lines so you get no information from there no interesting dialogues. The acting is OK. Camerawork is OK its all pretty OK and i didn't fall asleep but I'm pretty sure a few weeks from now i won't remember what this movie was about at all. I don't even think i know what it's about now. ?! If the object was to show concidence on peoples lives Magnolia is by far superior to this one. If the object was to depict people dealing with huge personal problems i know a lot of movies that pass this one left and right. So i guess i don't get what this is about what the object was or they messed up.Something's adrift in Manhatten for sure but what that is remains the question.".

That's nothing to what Zoltan Korda had to just even getting Canada Lee and young Sidney Poitier into South Africa in the guise of houseboys.

The rest of the story is not a pleasant one but strangely uplifting as Lee father of the murderer and the father of the victim who was a liberal South African fighting the apartheid regime pledge mutually out of their grief to work for a just society. It took a long time and it's not all together there yet but South Africa is one of the great success stories of the past century about people of good will righting terrible wrongs.Alan Paton the author was a prophet with no honor in his own country. His book a world best seller was banned in the Union of South Africa and Paton himself ostracized. Paton was a committed Christian who really did believe that all people were indeed equal and fought for that ideal all his life. He died in the mid eighties and sadly did not live to see the fall of apartheid.Though a big budget film of Cry the Beloved Country came out in the nineties this time with the cooperation of the Mandela government this film still sets a high standard just for courage in the making.".

	schema:reviewBody "There seems little point in remaking proved masterpieces of cinema. Generally they are given short shrift by critics and moviegoers with examples such as a new Stagecoach and Psycho quickly assigned to oblivion while their originals continue to give endless pleasure either as DVDs or TV reshowings. The 1995 version of Cry the Beloved Country deserved a similar fate and was only saved I would imagine because the original version of Alan Paton's South African novel directed by Vincent Korda in 1951 is so little known today. I regard this neglect and the fact that it was felt that a new version was needed as one of cinema's greatest tragedies for the original was beyond doubt in my opinion one of the half dozen greatest films ever to have emerged from a British studio. I ran the two versions again recently. By the end of the exercise I vowed never again to see the new version as in every sense it is the inferior of the two. I would cite the treatments of one small scene to make the point the incredibly moving moment in the novel when the news is broken to the white landowner on his farm of the murder of his only son by a group of black youth during the course of a burglary of his home in Johannesburg. Korda's treatment of the scene takes approximately a third of the time of the equivalent in the new Darrell Roodt version. It is impressively understated with the father quietly having to sit down to take in the dreadful news he has been brought. Richard Harris in the same part cannot match Charles Carson's tremendous dignity exteriorising his grief in a far more theatrical way. It is the difference between tragedy and melodrama. Korda's monochrome Cry the Beloved Country is almost documentary in style. The voiceover reading of Paton's opening paragraph is set against shots of the landscape it describes. The black Minister's train journey to the big city to find his fallen sister is punctuated by landscapes becoming more and more blighted by the rape of industry. Once there he embarks on a sad pilgrimage of shantytowns photographed with all the mastery of the postwar Italian neorealists. That Korda's version of Paton's bleak tale is on the same level of artistic integrity and achievement as works such as Bicycle Thieves and Germany Year Zero is a measure of how highly I rate it. The use of music is masterly indigenous a cappella choruses for the credits then nothing for the first third of the film. Then almost imperceptibly Raymond GalloisMontbrun's orchestral score creeps in to meditate on some of the quieter scenes reaching a sort of apotheosis reminiscent of the conclusion of Berg's Violin Concerto by adopting the form of a chorale prelude for the final scene where the Minister climbs a hilltop to witness the dawn of a new day at the time his son is being executed. Shortly before he has passed the doubly bereaved white farmer to whom he has sent flowers on learning of his wife's death. The moment of reconcilliation between the two men is marked by the farmer's simple acknowledgement Your flowers were of great beauty. There are few moments in cinema as moving as this.".

While Apartheid is dealt with I loved and respected how the evil that the film centers upon was a black man senselessly killing an innocent white person. It really took guts to attack this evil institution AND yet admit the senselessness of this murder.However the movie does not dwell on this murderer but on his very decent father the reverend. You can really tell that the old man is completely torn and racked with pain over his son's deeds. And no matter what he says or does to the victim's decent father a man who himself is against Apartheid he can't undo the act. Amazingly the victim's father understands and appreciates this. So in the end you are left with two fundamentally decent men who are struggling to come to terms with senseless violence but maintain their humanity and dignity.

	schema:reviewBody "A sincere but also very somber glimpse of segregated South Africa circa 1950. Reverend Kumalo Lee travels from rural home to Johannesburg to search for missing son. What he finds instead is degradation both economic and moral plus immense heartache.That train trip through an industrial belt is riveting as we glimpse the harsh conditions along the way. Ditto the shantytown slums of the city that Kumalo and Msimangu Poitier must search through. To me these are the film's highlights since they're a long way from any movie lot. Then too I don't recall seeing documentary footage from SA like this before. Note also that the real thing is photographed not only on the streets but inside the shanties as well. No constructed sets here. In my book the Korda's should be saluted for their efforts to overcome what must have been difficult conditions to work under.It's a very grim storyline heavy on the notion of redemption both personal Kumalo's son and societal apartheid. Fortunately the screenplay weaves these two threads together very effectively. It's also worth noting that hints at racial reconciliation revolve around religious themes instead of the more controversial political kind. The latter would probably have been impossible to do. Nonetheless Kumalo's climb up the hill at movie's end is powerfully symbolic of the promise of a new day.Definitely a mustsee for serious movie fans.".

	schema:headline " The Message is Powerful This Film is Not";
	schema:reviewBody "I only watched this film because Sidney Poitier is in it. I've seen most of his films and he is or was since he hasn't really acted in anything since 2001 1997 in film an exceptional actor. Most of his films were quite good some others...not so much. Sadly this is one of the lesser films. The title is a powerful title for a film and I am sure the novel it was based on was powerful itself. The subject matter of apartheid is a powerful subject and for 1951 I'm sure this film wasn't easy to make especially since it was a new application in South Africa which started in 1948 and didn't end until 1991 I was 14 years old in 1991. An old man named Stephen Kumalo Canada Lee travels to Johannesburg looking for some of his family members sister brother son etc. with the help of Reverend Msimangu Sidney Poitier. He finds his sister who's a prostitute his brother basically a braggart the poorer version of one. Johannesburg in the view of Kumalo seems to be equivalent to Sodom a den of constant sin basically hell. The novel as I have read incorporates much of the Bible into it using characters from it as characters in the novel. Also tries to paint a neutral view of the struggles of not only white people in South Africa but also of black people in South Africa. This film leans more one way than the other there's really no semblance of neutrality here for better or worse. And that's fine I guess.The acting is below average to average by all including Sidney Poitier but I feel it rests more on the script and direction rather than their inability to act well. Even with the obvious nonactors throughout. The composition is sparse and in being so moves the film at a snail's pace. That's what I always found composition to be used for mainly as a way to move quieter perhaps more dramatic scenes along. Here there's rarely any of it throughout the film especially in the dramatic scenes such as when a father hears about the death of his son then his wife finds out and it's talked about by many others afterward absolutely no composition to help move the scenes along or give context to the emotional impact it is supposed to have. Now I know silence can be deafening but it doesn't really work in this film in my opinion. If it had a stronger script maybe...and where there is composition it just didn't work for me. Like when the mother and father lost their son and the wife is reading something and there's composition and you can barely hear her speaking. Not a good place for composition in my opinion. Then after that scene they have vibrant and loud composition with the police trying to find the culprits and I felt it didn't work there either because the totality of the film up to that point is actually pretty solemn and then they throw this unexpected excitement. It felt like the element of the story was being changed. And it was but changed back to being solemn and the composition is gone. When Kumalo finds out his son the one he's been looking for is the one who killed the son of the white couple in a supposed robbery gone bad he's excited in an agitated way but there's no emotion to be felt because in my opinion it's too solemn. If that makes sense to anyone other than myself.The 1995 version with James Earl Jones and Richard Harris I felt is better than this film but the contrast of this one being filmed during apartheid and that one after it is not lost on me. Both films have powerful statements about an unjust happenstance to a people undeserving of such cruelty by an invader who sees them less based on the color of their skin. That perception isn't lost on me but doesn't make the film any better.Nam".

	schema:reviewBody "Made at the same time as the ghost film Legend in the Mountain Raining in the Mountain is in some ways a more traditional film for King Hu. His aesthetic is old fashioned in some ways and more akin to the New Wave of Mainland China. Regardless he tries to experiment and that's what makes a King Hu film fascinating to watch.An ailing temple Abbot has summoned his best laymen friends to assist in the choosing of a new Abbot from among the monks. One a businessman brings along a woman and a servant. Another who is a general and district governor brings along a shady lieutenant. Both friends seem to have ulterior motives in their visit and that turns out to be the theft of a rare scroll kept in a storeroom. In addition another friend of the Abbot arrives. He is an elderly man who despite being a layperson has a deeper understanding of Buddhism then most monks. Oddly he is accompanied by dozens of women who carry his palanquin. Finally by coincidence a convict is delivered to the temple to be reformed into a monk. The cast of characters is assembled.First off for all fans of King Hu martial art extravaganzas there are only three fight scenes in the whole film the first being at 50 minutes in a second short fight about fifteen minutes later and the third extended fight about 1 hour and 40 minutes in. They are all well done in King Hu's abstract but lively style. There is more going on in this film than an excuse for action. It takes about ten minutes before we have any idea about the story of the film. Up until then it's a series of attractive shots of mountains fall foliage and eventually the temple while the businessman and his entourage travel. The photography in this film is great from beginning to end. The Chinese traditional inspired music is very good as well. The story is good despite some plot holes and some predictable twists. The Buddhist philosophy and the dialog were very interesting to me.Overlong at 2 hours and missing dramatic tension at the climax it's still an above average film from Taiwan. I am not sure what the raining in the title refers to since it's bone dry for the entire film except for one shot at the beginning.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometime during the Ming Dynasty in China the elderly abbot of a remote Buddhist monastery is aware of his impending death and trying to decide which one of his monk disciples would be the most suitable to become his successor. To help him decide the abbot has invited three guests to the monastery a wealthy merchant Wen Yueh Sun a powerful General Wang Feng Tien and a wise scholar Wu Wai Chiahsiang Wu. The first two have more on their minds though as both are after a priceless scroll of wisdom that is hidden in the monastery's library. Wen is assisted by two master thieves the female White Fox Feng Hsu and a quiet man called Gold Lock Mingtsai Wu while Wang has the local police chief Chang Cheng as his sidekick. The monks of the monastery also have their own ideas regarding the abbot's decision and many schemes and clashes follow when everybody pursuits their own personal goals.Director King Hu's calm beautiful style becomes evident immediately during the first scenes of the film where Wen and his assistants are walking towards the monastery the gorgeous scenery grandiose music and flowing long costumes all set the mood for the whole story. The large monastery itself looks wonderful too and provides an excellent backdrop for the plot that is about to start. Among the best scenes is White Fox and Gold Lock's long run through the yards and hallways to the library all the while avoiding the monks by quickly jumping out of sight and hiding in whatever place is available when anybody passes them. As all this is presented with little dialogue and only accompanied by highly atmospheric percussion and zitherdriven music the whole sequence ranks among the most suspenseful I've seen in a long time.Even though the film may have been advertised as a martial arts tale the fighting is rather sparse the first clash only occurs 50 minutes into the story and the action properly gets going only at the very end. The stylized ending battles in the autumny forest are excellent though and more than enough to satisfy any wuxia fan. Besides the fights and the sneaking sequences the huge group scenes with hundreds of monks at the front yard look marvelous too. The film's dynamic direction camera work miseenscne and cinematography are so consistently jawdropping that it is really difficult to find anything to criticize in the film everything is in perfect balance. The comedic scheming of Wen and Wang the complaints of the disgruntled monks the wirework during the fights the bright colours everywhere... just magnificent.The underlying theme of Raining in the Mountain is the importance of giving up any feelings of greed in the spirit of Buddhism. Wen and Wang's obsession about the supposedly priceless scroll doesn't help them to achieve happiness while the abbot repeatedly mentions that the scroll's power lies in its written message not in the object itself. With so many thoroughly enjoyable details in one movie the two hours of its runtime practically fly by when watching the film. In brief Raining in the Mountain is heartily recommended to anyone with even a faintest interest in Asian cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Raining on the Mountain is a sorely neglected little gem of a Chinese flick. I would say kung fu flick but that's almost wholly untrue. There are several fight scenes most notably near the climax but the film seems much more interested in the fluidity and the composition of these scenes than the actual viscera of the bloody mouths and body blows. There's a sort of extravagant economy of motion here everything is done for the effect but nothing feels gratuitous or superfluous it's simply done so well that you breeze through without giving it a thought. A good portion of this film consists of people running ducking and hiding behind things but Hu being behind the pen behind the camera and apparently behind the editing equipment as well presents the entire film like a dance no matter what they're doing.The plot concerns a number of characters scheming towards two major aims inside a Buddhist monastery an esquire and a general both looking to obtain a priceless handwritten scroll from their library using various means including a fauxconcubine and her bandanaclad partnerincrime to obtain it. Additionally the abbot of the monastery is looking for a successor and several of the monks are attempting to get a good word for their names through less than legitimate means namely getting the esquire or the general to put in a good word by assisting them in getting the scroll. The other major plot point involves a former thief convicted but claims falsely accused being hounded by the lieutenant that put him behind bars and the two of them getting into various scraps and coming off like wounded children.The film I was more reminded of at least in a superficial way was Miyazaki's The 47 Ronin. Both films have action but aren't overly concerned with the action so much as with how the action is executed. Neither film is particularly substantial plotwise but both exert special attention to the minutiae of politicking and their power comes with how that plot is carried out. Just as Raining on the Mountain is mostly people dodging enough and slinking away The 47 Ronin is a film that consists mostly of people running into rooms and informing the occupants of exciting things happening outside and yet both are captivating because of how they present their wares. While it occasionally grinds to a bit of a halt when it focuses on the abbot appointing Raining on the Mountain is an evocative sensual breathtaking and above all enjoyable film and with a surprisingly light fun storyline a memorable cast of characters and a thrilling conclusion it's a film I'd gladly recommend to anybody that can obtain it.Grade 8.510 B  10 of 24 of 1979".

Like Mr. Morgan one of the dogs seems to have appeared in The Wizard of Oz  yes I think Toto is in Tortilla Flat. Not surprising since both films were directed by Victor Fleming.But the most extraordinary scene is that in which Frank Morgan has gathered his five dogs in the midst of the majestic Redwood Forest and relates to the dogs the story of St. Francis. As he is telling the story the dogs actually have a vision! As the vision hovers and the dogs react Morgan averts his eyes. When the vision passes Morgan shouts to the dogs Did you see him? Did you see him? It was St. Francis! What good boys you must be to see St. Francis!I know of few other films that depict pure religious experience so effectively.

Heres a film from a major producer with a respected Director and top flight cast that just ambles along without doing any of the characters full justice.Noone seems able to convince the viewer they are whom they play. Tracys accent is near laughable and Garfield tends to drop in and out of his as if he feels silly putting it on. Nearly every major character is unlikeable with greed and drunkenness almost their only motivation. It seems the only one that succeeds is Frank Morgan as the towns humble hermit and friend to all lost dogs.Static studio backgrounds give the film a cheapened look. The best thing about this one is Franz Waxmans melodic Music score.Some will enjoy but I feel most will be left wanting better. KenR............".

Heres a film from a major producer with a respected Director and top flight cast that just ambles along without doing any of the characters full justice.Noone seems able to convince the viewer they are whom they play. Tracys accent is near laughable and Garfield tends to drop in and out of his as if he feels silly putting it on. Nearly every major character is unlikeable with greed and drunkenness almost their only motivation. It seems the only one that succeeds is Frank Morgan as the towns humble hermit and friend to all lost dogs.Static studio backgrounds give the film a cheapened look. The best thing about this one is Franz Waxmans melodic Music score.Some will enjoy but I feel most will be left wanting better. KenR............";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure of the appeal of this story either in the book or in the film. The group of paisanos that John Steinbeck created is as shiftless and lazy a group as you will find anywhere. Their leader Pilon played by Spencer Tracy works this whole bunch as ruthlessly as Abbott regularly did to Costello. And the Costello of this story is of all people John Garfield.Garfield inherits a couple of houses courtesy of his late grandfather and Tracy and his friends move in to free load. Garfield also has his eye on Hedy Lamarr who works in a cannery and for a husband much as she likes Garfield doesn't want a shiftless loafer for a life partner. Garfield has to mend his ways before he's got any chance with her. Of course the prospect of kanoodling with Hedy Lamarr is enough to make any man straighten out even get a haircut.Tracy has no intention of changing his ways. He even tries to bilk simple hermit Frank Morgan out of his savings. Morgan who's called the Pirate in this film got an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor and he's the best one in the film. Close to him is the always dependable Henry O'Neill as the local parish priest.Tortilla Flat is about as opposite a story from The Grapes of Wrath that it's hard to believe they come from the same author John Steinbeck. The Grapes of Wrath is about hard working Anglo farmers from Oklahoma who've lost everything and just want the chance to earn a living from the soil again. Tortilla Flat's paisanos have an attitude about work that is on the level of Maynard G. Krebs. They're a harbinger of hippies to come.Tracy in his portrayal of Pilon dusts off some of the accent he used in Captains Courageous. But as good an actor as he is he just can't make this viewer have any degree of empathy for his character. About as opposite as you can get from the simple hardworking Manuel Fidelio of Captains Courageous.A lot of Latinos today find this film offensive and looking at it I can't really blame them.".

Definitely a Victor Fleming film that hasn't dated well and many will find offensive in its racial stereotypes. It's a wonder J. CARROL NAISH didn't find his way into the suppporting cast.

	schema:reviewBody "There is no denying that the man who gave us THE GRAPES OF WRATH OF MICE AND MEN and EAST OF EDEN is a major literary figure  one of the handful of American literary figures to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. But John Steinbeck was also a man of his time and some of his time is hard to swallow. This is particularly when dealing with his novels and stories dealing with LatinAmericans in California. A man raised in the early 20th Century his views of Latinos is rather heavily into stereotypes. That he could develop character despite the stereotypes was a sign of his abilities as a fine writer...but those stereotypes remain as a stigma today.In TORTILLA FLAT Steinbeck looks at life among a set of Latinos in Salinas California. The central figure is Pilon Spencer Tracy who is a happy  go  lucky type without any interest in life but what pleasure food partying girls booze he can get out of it. But he does not like to work. Nor do his pals Pablo Akim Tamiroff Tito Sheldon Leonard Jose John Qualen and Daniel John Garfield. But then Daniel learns his uncle died and left him two houses. He suddenly changes a little he is a property owner but that is soon dented when Pilon reminds him they are pals and he owes them a share of his good fortune. Somewhat unsettled by this he does agree to letting the four freeloaders use the other house. The wisdom of this action is shown when they gradually let the nice little house go to ruin ending with them accidentally burning it down Pilon just smiles and shrugs his shoulders at this.Meanwhile Daniel meets Dolores Ramirez Hedy Lamarr a young woman who works in the local fish cannery. Daniel starts changing his whole views on life by his desire to woo Dolores  she feels her husband has to be a hard working man to win her respect. But Pilon and the others resent this hold Dolores has on Daniel. Pilon in particular tries to break up the love affair but only manages to make his friendship with Daniel get strained. Daniel now has a job too at the cannery but the others are still gainfully unemployed. Pilon decides that he and the others can rob the Pirate Frank Morgan a lonely eccentric. The best scenes in the film deal with Morgan who turns out to be a touching old man who loves his pets and is saving his money for a religious offering for them. I won't go into the rest of the plot which shows that Pilon can be a real friend too when he wants to be. Again it is well acted although Tracy is reusing his Spanish accent that he used as Manuel in CAPTAIN'S COURAGEOUS and would use again in THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA. Lamarr and Garfield actually display some chemistry together to heat up their scenes. Garfield too is slightly reusing a previous accent  his Porfirio Diaz voice in JUAREZ toned down a little. Actually if it wasn't for the performances particularly Morgan's the film would only have the character development shown by Tracy and Garfield. But the weakness of the stereotypes makes this film a difficult one to swallow. So I can only give it a 7 out of 10.".

It wrestles with no big problems like The Grapes of Wrath or The Moon Is Down or Of Mice and Men. For though Steinbeck writes like a realist he thinks like a sentimentalist. And in the frankly sentimental Tortilla Flat he writes about his lazy simplehearted Mexicans with a warming glow and an indulgent sympathy.It is the outstanding virtue of MetroGoldwynMayer's movie that  due mainly to Fleming's masterful control of atmosphere and acting  it preserves Steinbeck's sympathies.For the first time in her Hollywood career Hedy Lamarr depends on no glamorous clothes or background to enhance her charms. She wears no fake eyelashes no makeup except a tencent lipstick and grease to darken her skin. Her costume cost less than four dollars and took less than four minutes to slip into.

As for the dogs their vision strikes a somewhat jarring note and the scene would be better deleted if only in the interests of good taste.Fleming's great achievement in Tortilla Flat was that he created a leisurely atmosphere without causing us to lose interest in the proceedings. It is true that he was helped considerably by Karl Freund's photographic expertise and the John Lee MahinBenjamin Glazer script itself.

	schema:headline " Florid Dreams";
	schema:reviewBody "A product of the Eisenhower fifties Some Came Running adapted from a James Jones novel stars Frank Sinatra as a footloose writer returning to his Midwestern home town right after World War II. Directed by Vincente Minnelli in a grand florid manner it is essentially a smart soap opera with some very deep emotions shot in garish color that can at its best bear comparison with the films of Douglas Sirk and is in some ways better more imaginative. The story matters less than the characters which aside from Sinatra's artistinuniform include an alcoholic Southern gambler played by Dean Martin who's also his best friend a pathetic floozie from Chicago who followed Sinatra home Shirley MacLaine Sinatra's brother a frustrated if successful businessman Arthur Kennedy and a prim somewhat stuffy schoolteacher Martha Hyer who admires Sinatra as a writer but cares little for him as a man. Sinatra is torn between bad girl MacLaine and good girl Hyer and though the former is easy to be with if not much of a conversationalist the latter is an ice princess and proud of it. Understandably Sinatra reverts to gambling drinking and carousing with friend Dean Martin but is clearly not happy with it. He would like to find a place in society but how? Where?This one could have been a classic and the cast is for the most part excellent. MacLaine's Methodish performance is the only jarring note but it's a loud one. A number of things keep the film down or at any rate in second gear. First of all Minnelli was as man and director such an aesthete that he spends much of his time painting with his camera. Aided in no small measure by the excellent photography of William Daniels his compositions and color create an often surreal effect almost hallucinogenic ultimately antirealistic though fascinating to watch and this in the end detracts from the story. On the other hand Minnelli was good with people and his more intimate scenes between people who really know each otherSinatra and Martin Sinatra and MacLaineshow a genuine understanding of human behavior. Back and forth the movie goes. That its setting is Indiana make both the movie and the characters seem out of place in this most conservative of midwestern states. There is none of the wholeness here that one gets from for instance Kazan's On the Waterfront where everything comes together beautifully and nothing is out of place. Here everyone seems to belong either elsewhere or nowhere to be thinking or dreaming of other things to not really care much for their surroundings. There is also a strong undercurrent of Tennessee Williams and William Ingeinspired textbook Freud with the characters either sexually obsessed sexually frustrated or sexually avoidant. I doubt the word sex is ever actually used in the movie but it's everywhere.

	onyx:emotionText "A product of the Eisenhower fifties Some Came Running adapted from a James Jones novel stars Frank Sinatra as a footloose writer returning to his Midwestern home town right after World War II. Directed by Vincente Minnelli in a grand florid manner it is essentially a smart soap opera with some very deep emotions shot in garish color that can at its best bear comparison with the films of Douglas Sirk and is in some ways better more imaginative. The story matters less than the characters which aside from Sinatra's artistinuniform include an alcoholic Southern gambler played by Dean Martin who's also his best friend a pathetic floozie from Chicago who followed Sinatra home Shirley MacLaine Sinatra's brother a frustrated if successful businessman Arthur Kennedy and a prim somewhat stuffy schoolteacher Martha Hyer who admires Sinatra as a writer but cares little for him as a man. Sinatra is torn between bad girl MacLaine and good girl Hyer and though the former is easy to be with if not much of a conversationalist the latter is an ice princess and proud of it. Understandably Sinatra reverts to gambling drinking and carousing with friend Dean Martin but is clearly not happy with it. He would like to find a place in society but how? Where?This one could have been a classic and the cast is for the most part excellent. MacLaine's Methodish performance is the only jarring note but it's a loud one. A number of things keep the film down or at any rate in second gear. First of all Minnelli was as man and director such an aesthete that he spends much of his time painting with his camera. Aided in no small measure by the excellent photography of William Daniels his compositions and color create an often surreal effect almost hallucinogenic ultimately antirealistic though fascinating to watch and this in the end detracts from the story. On the other hand Minnelli was good with people and his more intimate scenes between people who really know each otherSinatra and Martin Sinatra and MacLaineshow a genuine understanding of human behavior. Back and forth the movie goes. That its setting is Indiana make both the movie and the characters seem out of place in this most conservative of midwestern states. There is none of the wholeness here that one gets from for instance Kazan's On the Waterfront where everything comes together beautifully and nothing is out of place. Here everyone seems to belong either elsewhere or nowhere to be thinking or dreaming of other things to not really care much for their surroundings. There is also a strong undercurrent of Tennessee Williams and William Ingeinspired textbook Freud with the characters either sexually obsessed sexually frustrated or sexually avoidant. I doubt the word sex is ever actually used in the movie but it's everywhere. The Elmer Bernstein score jazzy and doubtless influenced by Alex North's music for Streetcar Named Desire tends to telegraph often hilariously how one ought to feel about what's going on especially the raunchy downdirty greasy horns he deploys whenever the story moves to the wrong side of the tracks or to a card game as if to say Okay Middle America this is NOT the way to be.For all its flaws the movie has many grace notes some of them even musical as Bernstein occasionally redeems himself especially in his lovely main theme.

He thinks he can find love in someone who can fill his creative needs and the void in his heart created by the war.Here is the tragedy  Dave does not realize that real love can only come from a sense of self worth from finding someone whom he not only needs but just as important who needs him.  Ginny is an angel an angel in the form of a wrongsideofthetracks bimbo but of all those in Dave's world Ginny is the purest of heart and the purest in love and her love is for Dave.

	schema:reviewBody "We become Second Hand Men. That's what I like to call it. Second Hand to everything. Second Hand to our jobs to our country's military strategy to the money we make or hope to make and then can't spend to taxes to our children Second Hand even to the cause of world peace. Three hundred years ago at our age we'd be about ready to die. If we weren't dead already. But now we can go on living for a long time yet if we want to in a Second Hand sort of way.  James Jones After the success of From Here To Eternity a James Jones adaptation which starred Frank Sinatra and which won several Academy Awards MetroGoldwynMayer set about adapting Jones' Some Came Running. The director for the task? Vincente Minnelli hot property in the era but now sadly a director somewhat forgotten.MGM's From Here To Eternity missed the point of Jones' wonderful novel. Minnelli though identifies with his material. The film works as a prequel to his The Sandpiper continues the director's fondness for artists and tortured outcasts and features another Minnelli hero who's self destructive a cynic maintains a certain selfimposed isolation and who rejects a staid conformist conservative and deeply hypocritical world.Our hero's name? US army officer Dave Hirsch a malcontent middle ager who finds himself thrust into the heart of small town America. The place offends him but Hirsch manages to cope by latching onto a series of outcasts gamblers and drunks. A romantic relationship with a school teacher points toward possible rehabilitation  she promises to lift Hirsch out of his slump  but their relationship quickly goes sour she's attracted in him only insofar as he epitomizes your typical romanticised suffering artist.The film becomes increasingly bitter. Hirsch we realise has no drive no motivation and prefers to dive into alcohol and the dark recesses of local bars. At rock bottom he then makes a bizarre gesture he marries a lost dull witted simple girl. Everyone's shocked but the act makes sense to Hirsch. He can't function in the world it has turned its back on him and so he embraces the dregs. But is this only a gesture of defeat? Does Hirsch perhaps also see something genuinely wonderful about his new bride? The rest of the film watches as Hirsch attempts to integrate three perhaps incompatible worlds the sophisticate world of big money the sleazy dives he frequents and the isolated sensitive life of a writer.Aesthetically Some Came Running is typical of Minnelli big melodramatic and lush. Perhaps because he's accustomed to filming musical numbers the film trades mostly in middle wide and long shots with close ups being rare. Director Jacques Rivette would say that the film neglects its actors and that Minnelli left his three great actors working in a void with no one watching them or listening to them from behind the camera but that's not quite true. You sense that Minnelli identifies with Hirsch. James Jones certainly did. The character was very loosely based on Jones' own fears and inclinations as a young writer.Some Came Running occupies an odd space in cinema history. Like the works of Nicholas Ray Douglas Sirk etc it broadened the possibilities of the melodrama. It would influence Five Easy Pieces Contempt and would be praised heavily by the likes of Richard Linklater Godard Scorsese and the Cashier du Cinema crew. The film also reverses Minnelli's Meet Me In St Louis which waxed nostalgic about small town virtues by being preoccupied with small town vices.

Second Hand to our jobs to our country's military strategy to the money we make or hope to make and then can't spend to taxes to our children Second Hand even to the cause of world peace. Three hundred years ago at our age we'd be about ready to die. If we weren't dead already. But now we can go on living for a long time yet if we want to in a Second Hand sort of way.  James Jones After the success of From Here To Eternity a James Jones adaptation which starred Frank Sinatra and which won several Academy Awards MetroGoldwynMayer set about adapting Jones' Some Came Running. The director for the task? Vincente Minnelli hot property in the era but now sadly a director somewhat forgotten.MGM's From Here To Eternity missed the point of Jones' wonderful novel. Minnelli though identifies with his material. The film works as a prequel to his The Sandpiper continues the director's fondness for artists and tortured outcasts and features another Minnelli hero who's self destructive a cynic maintains a certain selfimposed isolation and who rejects a staid conformist conservative and deeply hypocritical world.Our hero's name? US army officer Dave Hirsch a malcontent middle ager who finds himself thrust into the heart of small town America. The place offends him but Hirsch manages to cope by latching onto a series of outcasts gamblers and drunks. A romantic relationship with a school teacher points toward possible rehabilitation  she promises to lift Hirsch out of his slump  but their relationship quickly goes sour she's attracted in him only insofar as he epitomizes your typical romanticised suffering artist.The film becomes increasingly bitter. Hirsch we realise has no drive no motivation and prefers to dive into alcohol and the dark recesses of local bars. At rock bottom he then makes a bizarre gesture he marries a lost dull witted simple girl. Everyone's shocked but the act makes sense to Hirsch. He can't function in the world it has turned its back on him and so he embraces the dregs. But is this only a gesture of defeat? Does Hirsch perhaps also see something genuinely wonderful about his new bride? The rest of the film watches as Hirsch attempts to integrate three perhaps incompatible worlds the sophisticate world of big money the sleazy dives he frequents and the isolated sensitive life of a writer.Aesthetically Some Came Running is typical of Minnelli big melodramatic and lush. Perhaps because he's accustomed to filming musical numbers the film trades mostly in middle wide and long shots with close ups being rare. Director Jacques Rivette would say that the film neglects its actors and that Minnelli left his three great actors working in a void with no one watching them or listening to them from behind the camera but that's not quite true. You sense that Minnelli identifies with Hirsch. James Jones certainly did. The character was very loosely based on Jones' own fears and inclinations as a young writer.Some Came Running occupies an odd space in cinema history. Like the works of Nicholas Ray Douglas Sirk etc it broadened the possibilities of the melodrama. It would influence Five Easy Pieces Contempt and would be praised heavily by the likes of Richard Linklater Godard Scorsese and the Cashier du Cinema crew. The film also reverses Minnelli's Meet Me In St Louis which waxed nostalgic about small town virtues by being preoccupied with small town vices. In this way the film was also part of a wave of lets look behind the suburban facade 1950s melodramas which expanded upon postwar noir cynicism and delved behind the moral and sexual hypocrisies of angelic suburban communities.

	schema:reviewBody "At 1200 pages the James Jones novel Some Came Running deals with family divisions drinking gambling sexual repression adultery and other small town USA vices. All this is embedded in a general theme about the hypocrisy so pervasive in 1948 Middle America. Jones was most famous for his explorations of WWII and its aftermath. Some Came Running is somewhat autobiographical as Jones was one of those returning soldiers from WWII whose long absence gave them a new perspective on details in the social fabric that they had not really noticed before. He was from a small town in Illinois and served in the 25th Infantry Division. He was present during the attack on Pearl Harbor and the battle of Guadalcanal. Basing From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line on his experiences. The film adaptation of Some Came Running is long but entertaining especially if you like seeing a lot of bigname stars. Despite its setting in a small town it was filmed in Madison Indiana this was a big budget epic picture. The Jones character is named Dave Hirsch and played by Frank Sinatra. He is a successful writer but has not written anything for several years. The film begins inside a bus on its way to Dave's hometown of Parkman Indiana. He has just been discharged from the army and is wearing his uniform no rank insignia is visible. His brother Frank Arthur Kennedy has become a big shot in the town and introduces him to Gwen French Martha Hyer a college literature teacher who is impressed with his writing but put off by his wild life style. Dave has been followed to Parkton by Ginny Shirley MacLaine an airhead he met in a Chicago bar. This sets up the film's love triangle. Dave becomes friends with a local gambler named Bama Dillert Dean Martin moves into his house and pairs up with him on the regional poker circuit where they are very successful. While Dave tries to come to terms with his roots and with his future his brother Frank begins an affair with his secretary. Generally speaking adopting a 1200 page book to the screen is ill advised and Some Came Running is no exception if only because the screenwriter incorporated too much of the story for a feature length film to handle effectively. But the producers compounded this problem with the hiring Vincente Minnelli as director and by casting for box office draw instead of acting talent. This resulted in a film with slick production values an extremely thin plot lots of characters but none with any depth and a too long running time. Can you say flat lifeless prosaic and unconvincing? Minnelli was a freak about visual details. He was more interested in whether an actress' dress coordinated well with the wallpaper in the set than how the actress handled her character. The inexperienced MacLaine has commented on how the only guidance she received during filming was from her male costars. In fact it was Sinatra who insisted the film end differently than the book as a way to make MacLaine's character more memorable. Minnelli's lack of interest in acting for the camera made him an especially poor choice for an overloaded film that needed subtle and nuanced elements in each scene to flesh out the characterization. For the same reason a nonactor like onetake Sinatra was completely overmatched by the demands of playing his character. Sinatra was comfortable playing himself in front of the camera and in most of his roles this was more than satisfactory as it is during the early stages of Some Came Running. But things start to crash and burn with the start of his scenes with Hyer and the film essentially collapses the first time he reveals that he loves her. Because of time constraints this romance had to be compressed requiring a really skilled performance to set up things for the declaration of love if it is to be at all convincing. Even if Sinatra took direction well he didn't and even if Minnelli was a master of acting for the camera few were worse the sudden transformation from Sinatra to lovesick puppy would have been a difficult sell. A very interesting element of this film is Minnelli's obsession with the sets and the moving camera. There are no closeups and relatively few medium shots. Almost everything is a wide shot or the master shot itself. This could reflect Minnelli's overriding interest in showcasing his sets or indicate that Sinatra's work habits made changing camera setups difficult or that the editor found that many of the performances could not withstand close scrutiny. Whatever the cause it makes it much more difficult to identify and connect with characters who are always so distant from the camera. This is a detail you may want to watch for the next time you see the film. This was Dean Martin's signature performance and he is truly excellent. Arthur Kennedy won an Oscar for his portrayal of Frank Hirsh but I think the best performance of all was by Leora Dane as his wife Agnes. Their scenes together have real energy and almost creepy believability. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

What a major disappointment.The cast is superb and the production values are firstrate but the characters are without depth the plot is thin and the whole thing goes on too long. For a movie that deals with alcoholism family divisions unfaithfulness gambling and sexual repression the movie is curiously flat prosaic lifeless and clicheridden. One example is the portrayal of Frank Hirsch's unfaithfuness his rather heavyhanded request to his wife to go upstairs and relax a bit followed by her predictable pleading of a headache leads  even more predictably  to his evening liaison with his secretary hey Nancy I've got the blues tonight. Let's go for a drive all according to wellworn formula. We don't feel these are real people but cardboard cutouts acting in a marionette play. Also the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained. Dave's infatuation with the onagainoffagain Gwen is inexplicable in light of her fatuous inability to defecate or get off the pot. His subsequent marriage of desperation to the Shirley MaclaineGinny character is from the moment of its being presented to this viewer anyway obviously doomed to fail and it was clear  by the conventions of this type of soap opera  that it could only be resolved by someone being killed. The moment the jealous lover started running around with the gun I started a bet with myself as to who  Dave or Ginny  would get killed. The whole thing was phony with a capital 'P'. Having said that Maclaine's performance and that of Dean Martin are the standouts here. But on the whole I find the movie's interest to be purely that of a period piece of Hollywood history.".

	schema:headline " Shirley MacLaine's fantastic performance";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is based upon a novel by James Jones of the same title. He was the author of FROM HERE TO ETERNITY filmed five years before this by Fred Zinnemann. Vincente Minelli's attempt here to make a James Jones blockbuster did not have quite the impact of the former film but Shirley MacLaine's performance is such a masterpiece of pathos that from one end of America to another at the time of this film's release no one could easily wipe away the tears after seeing her portray Ginnie Moorehead with her small struggling brain but her heart the size of the world. This was the film that revealed Shirley MacLaine as one of the most brilliant young actresses in American cinema a view amply confirmed a few years later when she appeared in THE APARTMENT 1960. MacLaine's spontaneity vividness warmth and intuitive understanding of her character make this film a classic whatever else it may have or lack. Martha Hyer also gives a splendid performance of great complexity as a woman who prefers the dreamworld of literature to real life and when faced with a marriage proposal from an author whose works she adores obstinately refuses to leave the dream for the reality. Frank Sinatra is the unexpected choice to play Dave Hirsh a novelist of great talent not only with the pen but with the bottle lacerated by selfloathing and equally keen to remain in his dream of being a bum and a selfdestructive drunk. When Fred Zinnemann rescued Sinatra from the scrap heap and cast him in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY it electrified everyone because the washedup crooner from Hoboken suddenly showed everybody he could act. Nobody had ever expected that of him as he was thought to be merely a singer who excited the 'bobbysoxers' as teenage girls were then known of the 1940s and who had passed his singby date. And so his second career as a superstar unexpectedly began hence his casting in this second James Jones film. He does a very good job of acting here too but at the cost of some subtlety to the story. I have not read the novel but I doubt that Jones's antihero was meant to be quite as coarse as Sinatra naturally was. At the beginning of the film Sinatra returns to his small town home in Indiana beside the Ohio River which is seen in great panoramic location shots from hilltops after four years in the Army checks into a hotel and is seen unpacking novels by John Steinbeck William Faulkner and Thomas Wolfe. No matter how hard one stretches one's imagination one cannot visualize Frank Sinatra reading any of those! In other words more subtle casting of the main character would have made for a much better film. The character as portrayed by Sinatra arouses not the slightest hint of sympathy in the viewer and he is merely a rather disgusting and selfpitying lush and womanizer with the coarse manners of a street urchin. Hence this could never be great cinema despite all the efforts of MacLaine and Hyer to raise it to the higher level of a genuine tragedy. There is no doubt that Sinatra is watchable but then Bob Hope playing Hamlet would also be watchable wouldn't he? If Sinatra had betrayed the slightest hint of human compassion in his role and it would seem would it not that that must be a prerequisite for someone who is supposed to be such a marvellous novelist himself? then this film could have coalesced into the vision its author must have intended. Oh well flawed projects litter the highway of the cinema like wrecked cars. Some of themes of this story became overfamiliar through the years. I am referring to the talented writer who 'can't come home again' as Thomas Wolfe put it. They returned to their small towns in the American hinterland and found that they were alienated from those surroundings because their horizons had become too expanded and they came up against an insuperable barrier what is often called 'the small town mentality'. Of course these days there is no such resonance since American small towns have largely ceased to exist in the sense that they once did. They are no longer selfcontained their Main Streets are deserted and all their former shops once filled with throngs of locals buying the necessities of life are now charity shops all the shopping has moved to the malls all the townspeople have become obese mountains of wobbling human flesh who cannot get out of their cars to walk down a street because of junk food and outsiders dash in and out on the interstate highway system heedless of local traditions and caring nothing for where they are other than as a temporary convenience before they move to the next town. The small towns are gone except as skeletons like those of the dinosaurs in the natural history museums and stories like this are thus historical tales dating from a vanished age when they really mattered. All of the angst suffered by the James Joneses and Thomas Wolfes trying unsuccessfully to return home to their small town origins are as far from contemporary reality as the voyages of Odysseus Ulysses as he struggled to return home to Ithaca. It is thus that a lot of the 'zing' has gone out of this film because younger people cannot 'get it'. They no longer know and if they did they would no longer care what the attempt to 'come home again' to the small town once meant for sensitive souls who had outgrown the chrysalis. Now there is no Home anymore there is only Facebook. And there is never any trouble returning to Facebook for your 1000 best friends are there waiting to ignore you and will not bite back. In fact people like Frank Sinatra are welcome since on the internet you cannot smell whisky on people's breath.".

You have to be made of stone not to be moved by her pleas to Martha Hyer and Hyer's reactions in this scene probably got her her nomination.If you can get past a miscast Frank Sinatra then this film is a gem.";

	schema:reviewBody "In the postwar the alcoholic and bitter veteran military and former writer Dave Hirsch Frank Sinatra returns from Chicago to his hometown Parkman Indiana. He is followed by Ginnie Moorehead Shirley MacLaine a vulgar and easy woman with whom he spent his last night in Chicago that has fallen in love with him. The resentful Dave meets his older brother Frank Hirsh Arthur Kennedy who owns a jewelry store and is a prominent citizen of Parkman that invites him to have dinner with his family. Dave meets his sisterinlaw Agnes Leora Dana that hates him since one character of his novel had been visibly inspired on her and his teenage niece Dawn Betty Lou Keim. Frank introduces the school teacher Gwen French Martha Hyer to him and Dave feels attracted by the beautiful woman that is daughter of his former Professor Robert Haven French Larry Gates and idolizes his work as writer. However his unrequited love with Gwen drives Dave back to the local bar where he befriends the professional gambler Bama Dillert Dean Martin and meets Ginnie again with the Chicago's mobster Raymond Lanchak Steven Peck that was her former lover and has followed her from Chicago. The unconditional love of Ginnie for Dave leads to a tragedy in the calm Parkman.Some Came Running is a melodramatic soap opera about hypocrisy and love in a small American town by Vincente Minnelli. Every character in the story is flawed bitter hypocrite insecure gossiper false and the unconditional love of Ginnie with Dave is probably the most beautiful and pure feeling in this romance despite the reputation of Ginnie. This character is magnificently performed by the lovely and sweet Shirley MacLaine and the dialogs are witty and harsh. This story recalls Peyton Place that also shows the stereotypical lifestyle of a small town in America in the late 40's. The false morality and intolerance rules the relationships among the dwellers with gossips sexual repression and snobbery are very similar. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Deus Sabe o Quanto Amei!

Sinatra could be a wonderful actor when he wanted to be and he's very fine in his typical beatdown naturalistic way here. Even better is Martin who inhabits this role like it was written for him. Maclaine is good but is very actorly in a showy James Dean kind of way. I think that kind of avantegardeism dates as badly as Minnelli's.

In the same vein as the masterpieces CATCH22 STARSHIP TROOPERS and THIS IS SPINAL TAP the director bombards us with some of the most extreme  unbelievable characters in an effort to expose their foolishness. Events happen which would never happen in real life such as a guy falling in love with a woman and proposing marriage after 3 dates and if the audience is not patient they may feel it's too unbelievable. But that's the point! I won't ruin it but it all comes together in the last act if you're paying attention. The film which spends the first hour mercilessly showing us the hypocrisy and twofacedness of middle class America finally unravels to reveal its potent message underneath. At this point if you've been astute the payoff is riveting. However if you didn't latch on to the theme early on you might find yourself bored or annoyed.That said I hope you realize the joke early on. That way you can enjoy the excellent acting artistic cinematography  witty dialogue without throwing your popcorn at the screen and walking out. This is not a romance it's an antiromance just like Catch22 is an antiwar movie and Spinal Tap is an antirocker. All of these movies are masterpieces.I won't delve into the particulars of the film leaving you to enjoy discovering all that yourself. But I have to say Shirley MacClaine gives the best performance of her career and possibly the best performance of any leading lady in the 50s. Her character is endearing  annoying clueless  wise flawed  perfect all at the same time. And the delivery couldn't be better.Really the power trio Sinatra Martin MacClaine were in perfect rhythm and the director Minnelli knew exactly how to capitalize on their natural rapport. Rather than cutting to a lot of closeups while they're talking he leaves a lot of wide shots so that we can see the expressions  body language of the people not speaking. One of the first films in Cinemascope widescreen Some Came Running is a fine example of how a director can make excellent artistic use of the entire picture.A last word this is based on a book so big you could use it as a doorstop at Buckingham Palace so be ready for an epic. That means this ain't your Saturday morning eye candy. But I think if you watch it knowing what to expect you won't be disappointed. It's hard to find on DVD but it's available in the Frank Sinatra Golden Collection and the digital transfer is really nice especially with the bold colours the director played with. At times it's almost cartoonish with silhouettes against solid backdrops. And of course the cartoonishness figures in to the tongueincheek satire I mentioned earlier. Truly a carefully designed film.".

	schema:headline " Yet another overrated Minnelli film.";
	schema:reviewBody "But I doubt many were running to see this movie. Or Some Came Running Out Of The Cinema. Okay that's a bit harsh.The film starts in an unintentionally comical way Frankieboy comes back to his hometown after many years this already smells of clichs and the whole town is shaken by his arrival he is talked about everyone wants to talk to him and every woman he meets flirts with him like there's no tomorrow  even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with Frankieboy a little longer! Even his pretty niece wants a piece of him! Sounds like one of those laughable Mike Hammer episodes where EVERY single female wants Stacey Keach. And like Stacey Keach Frankieboy is anything but a goodlooking woman's wet dream. In real life someone like Sinatra without the fame wouldn't get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as MacLaine. But in this Hollywood movie it's the other way around MacLaine is absolutely nuts about Frankieboy but HE couldn't care less! Sinatra plays his cool shtick much too often in his movies and it is rarely credible. Dean Martin is kind of miscast he isn't miscast as a cardplayer but rather because of the accent which simply doesn't suit him. MacLaine is charming as ever but she plays a caricature  and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film. The main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seenitallbefore movies and cheap novels Frankie is the cool cat who comes back to town to get all the women and he couldn't care less about his writing which predictably eventually garners recognition Martin is a sleazy but friendly cardplayer MacLaine is the dumb but very likable bimbo Frankie's blond loveinterest is a snotty literary expert Frankie's brother is the successful guy who married into his wife's business and has a lousy marriage and so on. Clichs.The story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too farfetched for my taste Frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the FIRST time and then there is the awful stupid ending.In it a drunk guy bent on killing Frankieboy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places! The place is utterly crowded with the typical noise and chaos  plus it's happening in the evening  and yet the guy somehow finds Frankie in spite of being drunk as a doorknob and shoots at him. But guess who he kills? MacLaine. She jumps in front of the bullet to save Frankie a clich which comicbook writers might cringe at. This utterly pathetic overdramatic and annoying ending certainly cannot please any even semiintelligent viewer. And this happens on the same day that MacLaine and Sinatra got married! The writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life  how else is the writing of this movie to be explained? There is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with Frankie  Martin vs. some clich caricatures out of the writer's vivid imagination. It was like a damn Western suddenly. Another dumb thing is the way Sinatra was crazy about the boring snottynosed bimbo and pretty much ignored MacLaine. As the movie progresses we find out that Sinatra finds MacLaine to be too dumb for him just as the blond bimbo finds Sinatra to be too lowclass for her. There is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding MacLaine. MacLaine is treated as worthless by everyone while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual the ironic truth is that the latter's character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual her behaviour comments and opinions are mostly clichd silly confused pretentious and primitive. At least MacLaine's character KNOWS that she MacLaine is dumb. There is another irony that I didn't fail to notice Sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story  much like the writer of this movie and that's why he came up with the corny crappy finale.The film basically has a solid cast and the photography is nice but the script though sometimes okay relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on realitybased characters and events.If you're interested in reading my biographies of Shirley MacLaine and other Hollywood intellectuals contact me by email.".

The main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seenitallbefore movies and cheap novels Frankie is the cool cat who comes back to town to get all the women and he couldn't care less about his writing which predictably eventually garners recognition Martin is a sleazy but friendly cardplayer MacLaine is the dumb but very likable bimbo Frankie's blond loveinterest is a snotty literary expert Frankie's brother is the successful guy who married into his wife's business and has a lousy marriage and so on. Clichs.The story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too farfetched for my taste Frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the FIRST time and then there is the awful stupid ending.In it a drunk guy bent on killing Frankieboy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places! The place is utterly crowded with the typical noise and chaos  plus it's happening in the evening  and yet the guy somehow finds Frankie in spite of being drunk as a doorknob and shoots at him. But guess who he kills? MacLaine. She jumps in front of the bullet to save Frankie a clich which comicbook writers might cringe at. This utterly pathetic overdramatic and annoying ending certainly cannot please any even semiintelligent viewer. And this happens on the same day that MacLaine and Sinatra got married! The writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life  how else is the writing of this movie to be explained? There is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with Frankie  Martin vs. some clich caricatures out of the writer's vivid imagination. It was like a damn Western suddenly. Another dumb thing is the way Sinatra was crazy about the boring snottynosed bimbo and pretty much ignored MacLaine. As the movie progresses we find out that Sinatra finds MacLaine to be too dumb for him just as the blond bimbo finds Sinatra to be too lowclass for her. There is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding MacLaine. MacLaine is treated as worthless by everyone while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual the ironic truth is that the latter's character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual her behaviour comments and opinions are mostly clichd silly confused pretentious and primitive. At least MacLaine's character KNOWS that she MacLaine is dumb. There is another irony that I didn't fail to notice Sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story  much like the writer of this movie and that's why he came up with the corny crappy finale.The film basically has a solid cast and the photography is nice but the script though sometimes okay relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on realitybased characters and events.If you're interested in reading my biographies of Shirley MacLaine and other Hollywood intellectuals contact me by email.";

However although it is literally the first time a bunch of Rat Pack members ever starred together this is a far cry from the series of easygoing comedies that would later be made to capitalise on the group's reputation. Some Came Running is instead a brooding and occasionally poignant dramatic thriller.The director is Vincente Minnelli a man who is betterknown for his lavish musicals and one often lauded or dismissed as a dreamer and a lover of beauty. Some Came Running however proves his abilities with serious and convoluted story lines. What is fascinating here is the way Minnelli uses his elaborate visual style to bring clarity to the picture's web of subplots. Noone really used the widescreen format quite like him and noone really has since. It's amazing that he can use so few closeups and put so much detail into a shot and yet still make us focus totally on what is important. A good example is the scene where Arthur Kennedy hears about his brother's return over the phone. Kennedy's secretary enters the room and comes into the foreground. The young men in the background of the shot of the man on the other end of the phone even encourage our eyes to that side of the screen. Secretaries are usually functional but forgettable bit parts but her placement in this scene makes us remember her even though she doesn't speak and this pays off when she later has an important part to play in the story. Minnelli doesn't force us to pay too much attention to minutiae of dialogue but every scene seems arranged to convey some important plot detail like an key character introduction or someone's reaction to a situation and the distinctive look to each shot helps to seal these ideas in our heads.This picture also happens to be blessed with a perfect cast whose members shine through their sheer credibility. Take Frank Sinatra and Arthur Kennedy. Neither of them gets any big powerhouse scenes but their performances are captivating because one could really believe they are a pair of chalkandcheese brothers and they subtly bring all the past resentments of their characters to the screen. The real standout though is Shirley MacLaine. She really understands her character's lack of sophistication and goes all out to show it off but without ever becoming so overthetop you don't believe it. More importantly she does it in such a way as to elicit sympathy from the audience rather than scorn. And really it is this strand to her story which gives the picture its strongest emotional edge.There were quite a few pictures about smalltown morality or lack thereof floating about Hollywood around this time Peyton Place being another prominent example and in many ways they can be seen a more highbrow counterpoint to Film Noir. Some Came Running is probably the best and certainly seems the most insightful and the most affecting. To my mind this quality comes mainly from the believability and strength with which its characters are drawn as they take their places in this overwhelmingly human tragedy.".

The duo now on the run rob a foreigner who turns out to be a Turkish eunuch sent by the government to the house of Don Pasquale Carlo Campanini a wealthy and jealous Sorrento merchant to guard his attractive wife Giulietta Isa Barzizza and his daughter Listetta Primarosa Battistella in exchange for the votes of his local constituents.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a perfect example of the great comedy art of Tot. As always the story offers opportunities for the brilliant improvisations of the great comedian. As always it is very difficult for those who don't speak the language to seize all the nuances and subtleties in the dialogues. The story however is quite original in itself it is all about a couple of unwary thieves who go on from one theft to another until one of them finds within the swag a letter of appointment from a local politician to one of his countryman that recommends the Turk himself the victim of their theft for a job at a wealthy trader's shop. The story unfolds between misunderstandings of all kinds and is based on the unawareness of Toto's character that the letter assignment tacitly assumes that the bearer is supposed to be an eunuch ... Dialogues at this point become kind of pyrotechnic and the comedian is triggered in a series of puns and jokes that can bring down the ceiling. In the end the deceit will come to light but the devilish petty thief will find once again the way of breaking the rules by turning the situation to his advantage and of solving all the intrigues that threatened the happiness of the other characters. Among the pretty actresses in this movie we can admire the late wife of Tot's Franca Faldini there're also the righthand men Carlo Campanini the unfailing Mario Castellani and as a real treat a very young Aldo Giuffr who will be later on impersonating the famous Alcoholic Union Captain of the unforgettable The Good the Bad and the Ugly. Altogether one of my favorite films of the period of Tot's artistic maturity though still soaked in a fair dose of naivety which leaves a pleasing aftertaste of old times in your mouth. In one of the scenes when the eunuch is attending the women on the forbiddentomen side of the beach and he's telling his adventures in exotic lands the women ask him how many wives do they have over there. He answers of course they have many ... up to 50 and more! ... Wow go the ladies ... But you have to reckon  he continues  that it implies also 49 mothersinlaw ... Why only 49? ... asks one of them a young woman ... Well you see ... averaging you certainly will find at least one orphan among 50 ladies ... These were the kind of unearthly things Tot could conjure up out of his magician's hat 1953! Can you recall what other comedians around the world were proposing in those days? ... Bye Pino.".

The main problem of this movie is that actors aren't capable of holding this movie on their back. Why? Because of bad script. Although Dillon Lane and Jones try very hard to take this movie on another level there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary. So for Matt Dillon fans this is watchable movie just like for admirers of beautiful Diane Lane. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great but this is not movie for him far below his level. So if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but don't expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing that you'll remember about this flick is Diane Lane scenes rest of it is very forgettable.".

	schema:headline " Splendid Engaging Romantic Drama From The Thirties Endures.";
	schema:reviewBody "Alongside Gone With The Wind MGM's SAN FRANCISCO 1936 is without doubt the finest romantic drama to emanate from Hollywood in the thirties. A movie that had everything going for it  a splendid story and script a superb star in Clark Gable a beautiful actress with an arresting singing voice in Jeanette MacDonald wonderful songs and an earthquake sequence that will not only knock your socks off but can stand up proudly beside anything that computer graphics can conjure up today. The picture also was the most sensational profit making movie of 1936 speeding past The Great Ziegfeld from the same year. Produced for the studio by John Emerson and Bernard Hyman it was directed with great punch and attention to detail by W.S.Van Duke. The Perfectly handled screenplay was written by Anita Loos from a story by Robert Hopkins and the crisp monochrome cinematography was by Oliver T. Marsh.It is 1905 in San Fransico and Blackie Norton Clark Gable runs The Paradise a not too respectable night club on the rowdy Barbary Coast. A girl Mary Blake Jeanette MacDonald arrives in the city from the country looking for a job singing. She approaches Norton who interviews her and is very taken by both her beauty and her prowess as a singer. He hires her and in the following weeks they fall in love but Blackie comes up against some competition from Jack Burly Jack Holt the wealthy owner of the Tivoli opera house. Burly falls for Mary too and wants to buy out her contract from Norton to have her sing in the opera. But Norton refuses and is not for turning. However after an altercation with Blackie she walks out on him and goes to the Tivoli where she becomes a singing sensation. Still in love with Blackie she however sees no future with him and just as she becomes engaged to Burly a tremendous earthquake wreaks havoc on the great city. The picture ends with the death of thousands of citizens including Jack Burly and an injured Blackie searching through every bit of rubble for Mary before eventually finding her alive and well and leading the survivors singing the hymn Nearer My God To Thee in a makeshift camp outside the destroyed city.Performances are top notch throughout the movie. Gable is terrific as the flamboyant Blackie Norton. His role looking every bit like a dry run for his Rhett Butler three years later. Excellent too is the inviting and quite lovely Jeanette MacDonald. The vivacious lady is simply electric! She just lights up the screen and delights us with her mellifluous singing voice in renditions of arias from Gounod's FAUST Verdi's LA TRAVIATA Nacio Herb Brown's lovely WOULD YOU and the rousing title song SAN FRANCISCO written by Polish composer Bronislau Kaper who was just starting out on his illustrious film music career at MGM. The song would become a hit and remains to this day the city's favoured anthem. Of course the real star of the picture is the special effects with the climactic earthquake sequence. Designed and implemented by Russian montage expert Slavko Vorkapach it remains an amazing achievement for thirties cinema which can still manage to excite and frighten today with just as much impact as anything in modern film.It is almost inconceivable that a seventy five year old movie can remain such a firm favourite which it steadfastly has maintained over the years. The film was nominated for four Acadamy Awards winning one for sound recording has a beautiful screenplay is wonderfully directed and besides the lovely songs from the attractive Miss MacDonald contains some moments of real charm especially the scenes with the two principles. SAN FRANCISCO is a great and fascinating film from vintage Hollywood and looks like it will continue to be one of the most fondly remembered movies of all time.".

Produced for the studio by John Emerson and Bernard Hyman it was directed with great punch and attention to detail by W.S.Van Duke. The Perfectly handled screenplay was written by Anita Loos from a story by Robert Hopkins and the crisp monochrome cinematography was by Oliver T. Marsh.It is 1905 in San Fransico and Blackie Norton Clark Gable runs The Paradise a not too respectable night club on the rowdy Barbary Coast. A girl Mary Blake Jeanette MacDonald arrives in the city from the country looking for a job singing. She approaches Norton who interviews her and is very taken by both her beauty and her prowess as a singer. He hires her and in the following weeks they fall in love but Blackie comes up against some competition from Jack Burly Jack Holt the wealthy owner of the Tivoli opera house. Burly falls for Mary too and wants to buy out her contract from Norton to have her sing in the opera. But Norton refuses and is not for turning. However after an altercation with Blackie she walks out on him and goes to the Tivoli where she becomes a singing sensation. Still in love with Blackie she however sees no future with him and just as she becomes engaged to Burly a tremendous earthquake wreaks havoc on the great city. The picture ends with the death of thousands of citizens including Jack Burly and an injured Blackie searching through every bit of rubble for Mary before eventually finding her alive and well and leading the survivors singing the hymn Nearer My God To Thee in a makeshift camp outside the destroyed city.Performances are top notch throughout the movie. Gable is terrific as the flamboyant Blackie Norton. His role looking every bit like a dry run for his Rhett Butler three years later. Excellent too is the inviting and quite lovely Jeanette MacDonald. The vivacious lady is simply electric! She just lights up the screen and delights us with her mellifluous singing voice in renditions of arias from Gounod's FAUST Verdi's LA TRAVIATA Nacio Herb Brown's lovely WOULD YOU and the rousing title song SAN FRANCISCO written by Polish composer Bronislau Kaper who was just starting out on his illustrious film music career at MGM. The song would become a hit and remains to this day the city's favoured anthem. Of course the real star of the picture is the special effects with the climactic earthquake sequence. Designed and implemented by Russian montage expert Slavko Vorkapach it remains an amazing achievement for thirties cinema which can still manage to excite and frighten today with just as much impact as anything in modern film.It is almost inconceivable that a seventy five year old movie can remain such a firm favourite which it steadfastly has maintained over the years. The film was nominated for four Acadamy Awards winning one for sound recording has a beautiful screenplay is wonderfully directed and besides the lovely songs from the attractive Miss MacDonald contains some moments of real charm especially the scenes with the two principles. SAN FRANCISCO is a great and fascinating film from vintage Hollywood and looks like it will continue to be one of the most fondly remembered movies of all time.";

When she sings on demand Love Me and the World is Mine the audience just like Blackie Norton can't help but be stunned by her voice seeing that this woman has a set of PIPES!  Whether it's opera hymns or the title song her singing is the thread that ties all the parts of this film together and considering sound recording in 1936 it's stunning.  Next time you visit this film make a note to yourself  focus on her singing.  She had an amazing talent that no one in film has matched before or since.

	schema:reviewBody "SAN FRANCISCO MetroGoldwynMayer 1936 directed by W.S. Van Dyke is a predecessor of all those disaster movies Hollywood made famous in the 1970s but in spite of many including EARTHQUAKE 1974 nothing comes close to this production a well written script by Anita Loos fine character development and superb cast headed by Clark Gable Jeanette MacDonald Spencer Tracy and Jack Holt. However it's not the first major motion picture to feature earthquake sequence on film. One would have to go back to the silent Warner Brothers production of OLD SAN FRANCISCO 1927 starring Dolores Costello. SAN FRANCISCO is not a remake simply a story of fictional characters pitted against an actual occurrence set at the turn of the century. The story begins in San Francisco after New Year's Day 1906 Mary Blake Jeanette MacDonald an ambitious singer whose specialty is opera has just lost her apartment due to a fire and comes to the Barbary Coast looking for work. She obtains a job singing at the Paradise a caf managed by Blackie Norton Clark Gable a ruthless proprietor who oversees that his guests get whatever they need dinner drinks entertainment and gambling. Mary later becomes acquainted with Father Tim Mullin Spencer Tracy Blackie's best friend since boyhood and finds comfort in him that she doesn't find in Blackie. In time she learns to love and accept Blackie for what he is an antireligious man with a rough exterior who is known only to Father Tim for doing good deeds in secret. Problems arise when the aristocratic Jack Burley Jack Holt hears Mary sing and arranges an audition leading to success at the Tivoli Opera House. Blackie decides to run for city council and tries to abolish the Barbary Coast's firetrap buildings. Since Jack happens to be a major Coast landlord and very much in love with Mary he and Blackie soon become rivals. This is soon followed by an onagain offagain relationship with Mary Blackie and Jack before the rumbling and tumbling climax of the San Francisco earthquake on the early morning of April 18th 1906.In spite of some faults in SAN FRANCISCO the movie itself is groundbreaking entertainment and a big boost for its major lead actors and anyone else responsible for it's production. While Gable and MacDonald dominate the story in its tight 116 minutes it's Spencer Tracy in a minor but important supporting role who was honored an Academy Award as Best Actor. This seems odd considering Tracy not being in every scene. There are times he's just there watching and smiling such as in the opera segments and other times he comes off with some good sentimental dialog then disappears during long stretches before reappearing again. His performance doesn't go without merit in fact it never does but a performance such as this is worthy of a supporting actor category. Gable is also excellent. He succeeds in making his unpleasant character likable. This could very well had been a nomination for Gable however he received none. There's good male bonding chemistry between Gable and Tracy good enough to pair them again in TEST PILOT 1938 and BOOM TOWN 1940. One of their most notable scenes in SAN FRANCISCO occurs when Gable as Blackie has a heated argument and socking Tim a priest. This then controversial segment was kept in the final print by adding a boxing scene earlier in the story as Father Tim and Blackie boxing in the gym together with Tim giving his best pal the final punch. On the plus side are the costume designs and authentic hair styles that capture the era the movie is set. The true highlight however happens to be the 20 minute earthquake sequence that's so realistic that it's hard to believe it wasn't done by modernday computer technology. While SAN FRANCISCO is virtually a drama songs and opera segments are plenty consisting of Old Acquaintance Happy New Year Hot Town in the Old Town Tonight Love Me and the World is Mine San Francisco A Heart That's Free Hosannah San Francisco reprise Would You? The Philippine Dance San Francisco Nearer as God to Thee and The Battle Hymn of the Republic. MacDonald's opera performance includes segments of Air Des Bijoux CARRE from Faust Marguerita and Sempre Libera by Guiseppi Verdi from LA TRAVIATA. The new songs of San Francisco and Would You? were written by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed. The supporting players consist of Jessie Ralph Maizie Burley Jack's mother Shirley Ross Trixie Margaret Irving Della Bailey with Ted Healy Harold Huber William Riccardi Edgar Kennedy and Warren Hymer.One final note For years when San Francisco was presented on local television annually on April 18th the day of the 1906 earthquake the conclusion consisted of the city's destruction superimposed by the rebuilt city from different angles and the landmark of the Golden Gate Bridge. By 1982 television prints future home video copies and presentations on Turner Classic Movies consisted of a slightly different conclusion lifted from the 1948 reissue showing the destroyed city superimposed by new buildings and nothing else. The original finish was finally restored as part of the alternate ending when transferred to DVD making this the one most highly recommended as the movie itself. ".

I play some of the scenes over and over again as I have a great interest in Victorian architecture etc. Pay attention to background sets furniture etc these folks really did their home work! I read that the specialeffects were so remarkable considering the film was made in the late 1930's. You have to really focus on the conversations and the message the film was relaying to the audience. The city had garnered such notoriety for being a rough wild and sinful city. The religious overtones were being emphasized as if to imply the city deserved what it got. This was being circulated all over the world of course. There is the scene where Jeneatte McDonald is having a 1 on 1 conversation with her future mother in law. Mrs Bailey tells her that the aristocracy of San Francisco is not what people think. They are a wild and crazy bunch living a sinful life with party's that last for days! She says. So you see the film wanted us to feel how society viewed others in those days. Wonderful film I never tire of seeing it!".

	schema:headline " Gable MacDonald and Tracy as San Francisco topples around them";
	schema:reviewBody "As in the '70s disaster films were all the rage in the '30s with Hurricane The Rains Came In Old Chicago and of course 1936's San Francisco which certainly sent the other studios running to destroy anything they could. The film stars Clark Gable Jeannette MacDonald and Spencer Tracy as three citizens of that beautiful city on April 18 1906 when the big earthquake struck.Gable plays Blackie Norton a quintessential role for him  a tough charming rogue who runs The Paradise Club. MacDonald is the lovely and talented Mary Black who arrives there looking for work and Spencer Tracy is Father Tim who is Blackie's conscience so he ignores him and Mary's moral compass. Mary is torn between two loves  her love for Blackie and her love for opera. Burley Jack Holt wants her contract from Blackie so he can star her at the Tivoli Opera but in all things she suppresses her own desires so that she can stay with Blackie. She finally does leave but returns...only to leave again after an ugly confrontation between Blackie and Father Tim. Things get a lot uglier at an annual contest  and that's when the chandelier starts moving back and forth.It's amazing what the films in the precomputer age were able to do with special effects because the earthquake in San Francisco is dazzling spectacular and downright scary. Given the horrors of 911 and Katrina one is drawn into the devastation and suffering as people search for loved ones watch their houses fall go crazy and see their beloved city dynamited because there's no water to stop the raging fires. 70 years later it's all way too close to home.As good as he always was with Gable Spencer Tracy did not have much of a role as the good father but he's excellent. MacDonald poses a problem. Normally she plays a diva or spitfire and she did those roles beautifully. But Mary Blake is a modest and religious woman who speaks softly and sublimates her own desires for the man she loves. It doesn't ring true and it doesn't work opposite the volatile Blackie of Gable's. If Mary had been more like other roles she played MacDonald probably would have had good chemistry with him. As it is they don't make much of a couple. Her singing is pretty until she hits the opera stage  with the combination of the tinny sound system in those days and the way women were trained on high notes then the end result isn't good. She sings The Jewel Song which she often did in concert the finale of Faust and Sempre Libera. MacDonald was a lyric coloratura and suited to the demands of the opera stage in the '30s but today she sounds dated as standards have changed.This is a great film to see to appreciate the artistry of the early technicians. The effects in San Francisco hold up against anything that came 40 years later. The ending is pure Hollywood hokum but very stirring. It gave this viewer goosebumps. Don't miss Hollywood at its very best.".

	schema:reviewBody "MGM's blockbuster was conceived originally as a vehicle for Jeanette MacDonald to costar with some nonsinging players while her normal screen partner Nelson Eddy was on a concert tour. Mr. Eddy always considered his screen roles secondary to his concert singing which was the reverse of how Jeanette felt.According to a recent book about both Eddy and MacDonald Clark Gable had been gotten out of romantic dalliance with some hush money MGM paid some woman off with. He didn't really want to do the film but Louis B. Mayer kind of hammerlocked him into it. MacDonald however chose Spencer Tracy for the part of Father Tim Mullin Gable's best friend and conscience of the movie.Nevertheless the part of Blackie Norton impresario of the Barbary Coast in 1906 San Francisco fits Gable perfectly. The man takes his pleasures where he finds them but has a concern for the folks in his area who are getting the raw end of things from the upper crust on Nob Hill as personified by Gable's rival Jack Holt.Gable and Holt are rivals for Jeanette MacDonald as well. She's fresh from the country a parson's daughter with a great set of soprano pipes. Both like what they see but Holt appreciates her voice quite a bit more than Gable at first.Besides Ms. MacDonald Gable and Holt have their differences over some of the rottenly constructed houses on the Barbary Coast and Gable wants a lot of new construction there. Of course the Earthquake of April 18 1906 settles the whole issue of urban renewal.If the special effects Oscar was around at that time San Francisco would have won it for sure. Even over 60 years after the film came out and with the more modern techniques of special effects available the sight of the earthquake is still visually stunning.Gable and MacDonald did not get along on the set Gable was more used to down to earth leading ladies like Crawford and Harlow. MacDonald and Tracy got along just fine. Her intercession with Louis B. Mayer changed the course of Tracy's career forever. Previous to San Francisco Tracy played a whole slew of roughneck heroes in B films at Fox and his first few at MGM were in the same mold. As Father Tim Mullin Tracy became the wise father figure no pun intended that the public came to know so well. He received his first Academy Award nomination for this part.Jeanette has some operatic selections and three hymns to sing during the film The Holy City Battle Hymn of the Republic and Nearer My God to Thee. She also got two original songs Would You and the title tune of the film.The song San Francisco was adopted by the city fathers of San Francisco as the city's official song. That is until Tony Bennett lost his heart there. Controversy still rages on the bay as to which should be the official song of San Francisco.San Francisco made a whole lot of money for Leo the Lion that year. It in fact inspired Darryl F. Zanuck to burn down Chicago the following year so he could get in on that disaster epic box office.San Francisco still holds up well today the action the music and Spencer Tracy's groundbreaking performance. Something for everyone.".

The owner Blackie Norton Clark Gable is a ruthless but good man and hires Mary after asking her to show her legs. Blackie is also invited to run to the position of Supervisor of the Coast by his friends and acquaintances to protect the neighborhood.When Blackie's competitor from Nob Hill Jack Burley Jack Holt and his friend Maestro Baldini William Ricciardi hear Mary singing Jack invites her to sing at his fancy Tivoli Opera House. However Mary has a twoyear contract signed with Blackie and is in love with him. But when the other artists from Paradise see her with Blackie and make malicious comments about her she quits and goes to Tivoli. On her debut at the Tivoli Blackie goes there with an authority to call off the concert. Blackie has an injunction against Jack Burley since Mary is still under contract with him. However when he hears Mary singing the opera he changes his mind and proposes her to get married with him. Mary returns to the Paradise but when Blackie's friend Father Tim Mullin Spencer Tracy sees Mary exposing her legs he does not allow her to go to the stage. Mary works at Tivoli and is proposed by Jack Burley to marry him. Meanwhile the powerful Jack Burley uses his influence with the Powers that Be to close the Paradise and arrest the performers. During a musical competition between the clubs Mary Blake learns the truth and decides to help the Paradise with her presentation. However it is 1906 the year of the major earthquake that struck San Francisco. San Francisco is a wonderful film of love and earthquake in the sin city. I had no idea that this film was so good and this is the first time that I watch San Francisco. The story is excellent with charismatic and ambiguous characters enjoyable songs sang by Jeanette MacDonald and stunning special effects with a realistic and convincing earthquake. The very last scene is fantastic.Clark Gable and Jeanette MacDonald show a magnificent chemistry and it is impressive the resemblance of the face of Madonna in the 80's with Jeanette MacDonald. I only regret that I had not seen this film before. My vote is eight.Title Brazil San Francisco  A Cidade do Pecado San Francisco  The Sin City".

	schema:reviewBody "You can't go wrong with the pairing of two of the great stars of Hollywood Gable and Tracy......and the great star of the west coast San Francisco. The role of Blackie Norton may be one of Gable's best so cynicalso devilmaycare and just a little bit dangerous. Tracy play the understanding priest with his usual aplomb. As he told someone once Don't ever let them catch you acting.Gable's attraction to Jeanette McDonald is a little bit unbelievable. She really did belong with Jack Holt in this film......or better yet Nelson Eddy should have showed up at the last minute and swept her away with a song. Gable and McDonald don't mesh at all and there was not much chemistry between them although I must admit she is lovely. Be that as it may the film is one of the best of Hollywood's mid30's offerings. There is something for everyone music drama comedy and the finale of the earthquake which is what we are waiting for. And what a spectacle it is!! It is very well done in those days before sophisticated special effects with tumbling buildings crashing walls and the inevitable fire. There are a couple of poignant scenes when the firefighters must blow up buildings and homes to control the fire thus destroying lifetimes of work and memories.The ending is a little bit over the top as those who have lost their families and all that they own joyously sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic and march up the hill to view the destruction I'm not sure I would be that upbeat......but it is still effective. The fade to the modern day 1936 San Francisco is just the right ending note. I highly recommend this film not only for the GableTracy pairing but also for the general excellence of the production.".

	schema:headline " The Best Remembered Earthquake?";
	schema:reviewBody "The San Francisco Earthquake happened 99 years ago next week. Ironically it's anniversary is a few days after the anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic as well as the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Forgotten is also the anniversary on April 27 of the explosion and burning of the steamboat Sultana in 1865 which killed more people than the Titanic did!. Truly T.S. Eliot's comment April is the cruelest month has some substantial facts to back it.There are not many movies dealing with famous earthquakes although they do appear in films like PENNY SERENADE where Irene Dunne and Cary Grant survive the great Tokyo earthquake of 1923. The San Francisco Earthquake has popped up in other films besides SAN FRANCISCO. Within two years of this film Warner Brothers produced THE SISTERS starring Bette Davis and Errol Flynn in which Davis survives the earthquake. There was at least on silent film dealing with the earthquake too. But SAN FRANCISCO is the best known.I find it good as an entertaining film and mediocre as a study of the actual events of April 18  25 1906. The performances of Gable MacDonald Tracy Ralph and Jack Holt are all good. Al Shean gives a nice cameo as a musician who champions MacDonald. Even Ted Healy is less obnoxious here  he has a good dying scene.The most interesting thing about the film is the way the focus of villainy keeps shifting between Gable and Holt. We know that Clark Gable's Blackie is the hero of the film but he frequently acts like an antihero in pushing aside MacDonald's operatic ambitions. We know that Holt is Gable's ruthless business rival and the leader of the money people who refuse to consider fireproofing the buildings of the Barbary Coast area it's not economical. But he does love MacDonald and can't believe Gable's totally selfish intention to keep her working in his saloon rather than putting her in her proper spot on the stage of the San Francisco opera home. This seesaw effect is usually not noted by critics of the film. It is actually a plus in keeping one's interest in the actual plot.My carping criticism is of a typically historical nature. The best study of the earthquake is Gordon Thomas and Max Gordon Witt's THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE which points out the huge amount of official corruption in the background of the earthquake. The city was run by Boss Abe Ruef and his mayorstoogepartner Eugene Schmitz a former bassoon player in an orchestra. They ignored improving the fire department's equipment and as a result the earthquake would touch off a fire that was impossible to control. The fire was only stopped when federal troops under General Frederick Funston took over the city set up martial law possibly going too far  there were too many reports of killings done to prevent looting but that killed innocent people and using dynamite to blast holes into the paths of the flames. Some aspects of this are shown in the earthquake sequences but Schmitz and Ruef were not mentioned nor was Funston a war hero  he helped end the Phillippine Insurrection of 1899  1902 by capturing Emilio Aguinaldo it's leader by a trick. Also more recent studies show the extent of the damage of the earthquake was greater than admitted in 1906. For years the casualty rate was estimated as only 500 roughly the same as the Chicago Fire in 1871 and one third of the Titanic. About a decade ago a more careful study of census information etc. showed the death toll was between 3500 to 6000 making it one of the deadliest events in American history.The city of San Francisco did resurrect and rebuild itself quickly after the quake and fire. Ruef was sent to jail and Schmitz sent packing. San Francisco held World Fairs in 1915 and 193940. It is a most beloved city for tourists on our west coast to this day. But they know with their San Andreas Fault nearby to remind them that it will inevitably happen again one day. They are better prepared but it will happen and it will be a bad day once more when it does.".

Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy are two of the thousands of people living in the city that was tragically rocked by the massive earthquake of 1906.

Unfortunately the film is tries to fit in a musical side too and it does not work out with the song and opera scenes being a bit of a distraction from the plot. The story itself is rather convoluted too with unions elections rivalry and a whole array of different things fitted in without being explored properly.

And Jeanette MacDonald's rousing stage performance of it near the film's end is one of the great musical productions in cinema history.This film is a spectacular big budget extravaganza with big name stars a huge cast of extras lush period piece costumes and terrific special and visual effects toward the end as the city heaves and moans from the great earthquake of 1906. Back in the 1930s San Francisco must have made quite a splash with the public.Clark Gable plays Blackie Norton a charming freewheeling blustery rogue with a heart who runs a nightclub called The Paradise on the famed Barbary Coast. Enter Mary Blake Jeanette MacDonald an upright almost uptight religious singer who comes to The Paradise looking for a singing job. Blackie hires her. But her real love is opera. And when the owner of the Tivoli Opera House hears Mary sing at The Paradise he offers her a job singing opera at the Tivoli.Most of the plot has Mary flipflopping between her loyalty to Blackie and her natural inclination to sing at the Tivoli. Mary thus comes across as ambivalent and easily manipulated but also loyal and virtuous.The main storyline is fine. But it's the film's music and the knowledge of the ominous event that awaits the characters at the end that make the film really worth watching. In this sense San Francisco is rather similar to Titanic 1953.The BW cinematography in San Francisco is quite good making allowances for rear screen projection and other antiquated devices common in the 1930s. I did not care for the subplot that had Spencer Tracy as a priest. And the onstage operatic aria at the midpoint stops the main storyline dead in its track. Jeanette MacDonald sings a lot of songs which is great. But I would have preferred less opera and more pop songs from that era. The film's ending with its emotionally moralistic tone was annoying.Despite some minor irritations San Francisco is a terrific movie. It has a viable story with believable characters a sense of destiny terrific visual effects and Jeanette MacDonald singing the title song. What a voice ... what a song!".

	schema:headline " Great acting great action and a rather sappy ending";
	schema:reviewBody "You get the feeling that what director Woodie Van Dyke REALLY wanted to do was reenact the great San Francisco earthquake scene of destruction on the 30th anniversary of its occurrence. Of course MGM studio head Louis B. Meyer is not going to fork over money for that so a story is constructed that merely contains the scene he really wanted to do as the climax of the film. The whole thing is a well acted but rather maudlin morality tale in the production code era tradition. You've got the personification of the Barbary Coast entrepreneur in Blackie the atheist saloon owner perfectly cast with Clark Gable in the role. You have the voice of virtue in the person of priest Father Tim Mullin again perfect casting with Spencer Tracy in the role and you've got your virtuous songbird of a lady in Jeanette McDonald as Mary Blake looking for work as a singer. Did anybody on the MGM lot in 1936 have a better voice than hers? Square jawed Jack Holt comes over from Columbia to play society scion Jack Burley who in the end is no better maybe worse than Blackie. He claims he is respectable but when he and Blackie are fighting over the affections of Mary there is no blow that is too low for him to land. In the middle of all of this conflict  scion versus rascal man of God versus atheist a woman who is torn between the man society tells her that she is supposed to love and the man she really does love comes the great quake. When you watch it think about the work that went into this given the technology that did not exist at that time and it becomes even more wondrous. Unfortunately at least for me the movie gets rather hokie at that point. I'll let you watch and get the details.In the final analysis Jeanette McDonald is probably given more to do in this movie than she should have because Louis B. Mayer thought she was hawt!. Meanwhile the production code was the best thing that ever happened to Spencer Tracy. No doubt he was a great actor even greater when you realize that off camera he was a heavy drinker and bedding every MGM and before that Fox starlet he could get his hands on and yet he plays a priest quite believably!. And Blackie suddenly believes in God because the person he loved is not dead in the rubble? What about all of the other dead people? Should by the same logic the people who loved them have become atheists? Not as long as head censor Joe Breen was on the job and he would be for another 16 years.Highly recommended in spite of the hokie ending. It is just a shame that they couldn't have made it in 1933 when things were allowed to be a bit saucier and more realistic.".

As Mary Blake she wanders into the saloonnight club The Paradise which is owned by Blackie Norton Clark Gable. While singing in the club she is approached by Norton's uptown rival Jack Burley Jack Holt who promises her a chance to sing in an opera. The two men compete for Mary's favor and she is forced to choose between them. Meanwhile Norton's life long friend Father Mullin Spencer Tracy tries to get him to mend his ways while at the same time befriending Mary. Blackie has Mary under contract but Burley can offer more.Before the matter can be settled the infamous 1906 San Francisco earthquake takes place. The special effects in the sequence are breath taking. Remember there were no computers in 1936. Through the skillful use of miniatures rear projection and other tricks the illusion of a tragic chapter in the city's history becomes almost real.As to the performances Clark Gable is well Clark Gable playing the cynical wise cracking fast talking character he usually played in those days. And yes he is out to make money is not committed and has several girls Shirley Ross Margaret Irving in waiting. Jeanette MacDonald seems a little out of her depth in this setting although she is in fine voice as always. Spencer Tracy does the best he can in a limited role. And oh yes there is another of MGM's sweet crusty old ladies in the person of Jesse Ralph as Burley's wise old mother.Superb production values great direction W.S. Van Dyke and jaw dropping special effects make this a better film than it ought to be. Watch out for a typical hokey Hollywood ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "I migliari directed by Francesco Rosi showed up unexpectedly on a cable channel not long ago. It's not a film that is seen often so we decided to watch it because anything by its director Francesco Rosi is worth a look. This 1959 Italian feature takes us to the Germany that was way ahead of the rest of some European countries in recovering from the ravages of the the second world war.We are taken to the underworld where most of the characters live. At the center of it is Totonno who is a somewhat successful scam artist. He sells inferior merchandise pretending it has a quality that is not there. Around Totonno there we find a group of Italian immigrants eking a life in Germany relying on their wits to survive in a more secure environment. After all their own country was still recovering sending a lot of the population to other European countries where work was plentiful.The second plot deals with the illicit relationship between Mario a handsome young man and Paula Mayer the wife of a wealthy German man that is behind the schemes of the immigrants. Mario who falls head over heels with Paula wants to take her away from that world but she wants no part in his world of poverty. After all she has seen it all. She comes clean to Mario as she reveals her past.The atmosphere of the film gives the viewer a bird's eye view of the Germany of that time. Shot mainly in Hannover and Hamburg this movie reflects the tastes of a lot of Italian film makers of the post war ere in shooting in the streets and a frank depiction of the lives of these small time criminals. Best of all Alberto Sordi probably the most versatile of the Italian actors of his generation. Also appealing is Renato Salvatori a handsome actor that gives an excellent portrait of the complex Mario. Belinda Lee appears as the beautiful Paula Mayer.Giovanni DiVenanzo's black and white cinematography serves well the story as well as the score by Piero Piccioni. Francesco Rosi delivered with this enjoyable film that should be seen by fans of the director and its stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1959 I Magliari is one of the numerous politicallyengaged and sociallycommitted films Italian director Francesco Rosi has made throughout the 1950s and 1960s. A story of itinerant sellers in Germany the film features Alberto Sordi and Renato Salvatori as the two male stars and British actress Belinda Lee who died only a couple of years after the making of this movie. The film was shot entirely in Germany Hannover and Hamburg where a group of Italian emigrants try to make their fortune by engaging in a series of organized scams that appear to revolve around the sale of poor quality textiles as genuine quality fabric to Germans at inflated prices. Although the latter part of the film develops into a love story between the rather goodhearted young Tuscan expatriate Mario Renato Salvatori a moving Brad Pitt lookalike on his way to international fame  see Rocco and his Brothers directed by Visconti in 1960 and the pretty and somewhat mysterious Paula Mayer Belinda Lee the wife of the German boss much of the film focuses on male groups exercising challenging and negotiating power in a desperate effort to secure spoils and territory. Hence the rather unusual blend of several styles Italian comedy romance and documentarylike scenes about the living conditions of Italian emigrants in postwar Western Germany. Alberto Sordi is extraordinary as a pitiful crook bigmouthed and cynical. One of the scenes shows Sordi at his best when he tries to sell a whole batch of carpets to a nice and gullible German housewife. The scene is the comical peak of the film which is on the other hand not so funny. The story deals mainly with the theme of emigration and is still worth watching today as the NorthSouth problem is still increasing. This flashback into the '50s is a salutary one and is certainly no small work from F. Rosi. For those who like music of the '50s the score features several hits of that time.".

It's a classic story but told from a timeless perspectivethe movie first ran in 1987 yet there's extremely little in it that would make it seem dated.Mary Stuart Masterson is as always superb in her performance. While this is one of her early films it shows her enormous ability and potential. She plays a playful feisty streetsmart character that also has a sensitive shy and deeply loving side. Mary Stuart's kissing scene is one of the most wonderfully romantic and intense kissing scenes on film that I've seen yet it has an innocent quality that makes it all the more special.Eric Stoltz and Lea Thompson give excellent performances as well with good acting and both are able to highlight dialogue with subtle nuances. However I feel that Mary Stuart's character is the most interesting and emotionally sensitive enough that she'll bring tears to your eyes. This is an excellent film.

	schema:reviewBody "Some Kind Of Wonderful tanked at the box office when it came out but the truth is this sleeper hit was actually good. And I will even go far saying that this reverse Pretty In Pink is better than Pretty In Pink itself. Why? Good honest performaces. Hughes decides to leave his Brat Packers behind and went with great choices in Eric Stoltz who could've gave John Cusack a run for his money in the Teen Angst movie department Lea Thompson and Mary Stewart Masterson who steals the show as Watts. Sure the story is run of the mill but it is the acting that pulls it through. Another good thing is that Thompson's character of Amanda Jones doesn't come off as being a snooty brat for use of a better word. She is from the same part of town like Keith and tries to fit in with the 'cool' clique. Another good supporting performance is Duncan the headbanger who is a regular in detention. I love how they forge a friendship through their art. And who can forget how Duncan and the lifers help Keith make his date with Amanda a success? One other thing I like is the soundtrack. It doesn't sound commerical like in other Hughes films. The music really suits every scenes it shows up in especially the end credits that feature Lick The Tins take on 'Can't Help Falling In Love'. Molly Ringwald reportedly turned down a role in this film but it's good that she did because I couldn't picture her in this classic. Great film.".

A great mix of comedy and teen melodrama this film perfectly combined all the best elements of a John Hughes film. By switching the sexes Eric Stoltz as Molly Ringwald and Mary Stuart Masterson as Jon Cryer of Pretty in Pink the film delves deeper than The Breakfast Club almost accidentally. The chemistry between Stolz and Masterson is powerful and real something missing in almost all John Hughes films and it pays off. This one has stayed with me since it came out and I've watched it since and it holds up really well. Great supporting actors like John Ashton and Elias Koteaus provide fun comedy breaks and little Candace Cameron as the little sister is terrific too she went on to great TV fame. But the strength of the film is the fine acting. Stoltz has the harder more thankless role and gives it a depth and charm that are a relief to see and Masterson all but steals the movie. Together they are John Hughes best couple even though he didn't direct this film.".

I fell in love along side her and to this day harbor a special place in my heart for Eric Stoltz begged my parents to let me learn the drums and knew every line by heart.  She was tough witty and according to my older brother incredibly sexy.  Eric Stoltz is dreamy in a working class kind of way and puts in a performance of true depth and character.  This movie has heart without being sickly sweet.  It delves into family relationships friendships and romance.  Most notably it tackles something that the current teen fair seems to lack social consciousness.  It's not afraid to break stereotypes or point out social injustice.  Not to mention it has one of the best soundtracks of the '80s.  I give it an A!!!".

Written by John Hughs the storyline is far from original greatly resembling Pretty in Pink but it still has an endearing charm that makes it a classic. The story line follows as such the lead male a sensitive loner named KeithEric Stolz is considered an outsider because he would rather focus on his art work than to be a jock a nerd or a trouble maker. He doesn't fit into any preexisting group. His only friend is a tomboyish drummer named WattsMary Stuart Masterson who is in love with him but he doesn't know. Keith wants to date the popular Amanda JonesLea Thompson but she is dating a possessive controlling overtly rich Hardy JennsCraig Sheffer. Amanda breaks up with him and to make it final she agrees to go out on a date with Keith. To Keith this is dream come true. He uses his newly formed connections with the out crowd to orchestrate an amazing date. Even going so far as spend all his college savings on a pair of diamond earrings for Amanda. Watts ever faithful to Keith volunteers to be their chauffeur for the evening. Hardy has invited both Keith and Amanda to a party he is throwing that night but the real reason is so that he and his friends can jump Keith and beat him up. Keith hears about this and makes sure that his newfound friends keep the fight even. Just Keith and Hardy but Hardy chickens out and is exposed as the spineless sleazeball we all knew he was. Amanda gives Keith back the diamond earrings and opts instead to be alone and learn who she is when she isn't defining herself by the boy she is dating. Watts has left the party and is walking away when Keith begins to run after her he kisses her and gives her the earrings. Love wins out in the end and Keith utters the paramount quote You look good wearing my future.This movie has my respect because it accurately portrays the social themes of the 80's without making them look cheesy themes such as trying to figure out who you were who your real friends were the joy and pain of falling in love and rebelling against your parents. Durring the 80's people felt liberated by the release of tensions with the ending of the Cold War. Stolz gave a great performance as a misunderstood out of place teen trying to find his way. And Thompson was very believable as the poor girl from the working class neighborhood who tried to fit into the popular crowd surprisingly enough she didn't come off as pretentious quite the opposite in fact appearing deep and amiable. In America during the 80's social status was much more defined people began to focus more on the individual and the individual's accomplishments.But Mary Stuart Masterson stole the show with her amazing portrayal of Watts. Not only was she witty but she carried you along her emotional journey. Even when Keith had chosen Amanda Watts still stood by him as long as she could. Her tough facade clearly hid an emotionally vulnerable woman who's lifelike predicament spoke to so many.Though this movie was not an initial box office smash it is a perfect example of the 80's genre. Once you have seen this film it will inevitably become one of your all time favorites.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some Kind of Wonderful is by far the best movie I have ever seen in my whole life! John Hughes has written yet another excellent story about a classical tale of teen romance. The first time I saw this movie was on t.v. at 200 in the morning. And I stayed up for every last minute of it. First of all the cast is great. Howard Deutch pulled together some really remarkable actors and actresses for the roles of this movie.Lets start with Lea Thompson playing the popular girl Amanda Jones. She did a fine job playing the poor girl who hangs out with all the rich kids. This role must of been really hard for her because she didn't look like a poor girl at all. I mean its Lea Thompson for christ sake! And in my opinion we have to give her alot of credit for having the guts to do this role. She came through with it and that is all that matters!Next is Craig Sheffer acting as the antagonist Hardy Jenns. This guy did a pretty good job of acting as the rich handsome popular school boy who went out with Amanda Jones. In fact he did such a good job at acting his part that I wanted to punch the t.v. when I saw his face pop up on the screen. Hardy was a real ahole!The shy kid Keith Nelson acted by Eric Stolz definintley reminds me of myself. That is one of the reasons why this movie really inflicted a lot of trauma on me from the beginning. We are both shy independent nice guys. I also look alot like him too! Except I have green eyes! Kinda scary if you dont mind me saying. Anyway Eric does a marvelous performance as the protagonist of this film. Good job man!Last but not least we have the beautifullbreathtakingastonishing Mary Stuart Masterson! This movie was the first time I saw her. And she took my breathe away!!!!! Playing the short blonde haired tomboy Watts she has got some real talent. After I saw her in this movieI knew I must see the rest of her movies she has been in. And I must say she looks the best in this movie without a dout. Its just the fact that you can see that face of her's and see her smile. She definitley has the best smile I have ever seen in my entire life! And that is saying a lot for someone I don't even really know that well. Maybe sometime later in life I can meet her in person. I think we would do well together. No offense Damon. LOL!But in all the movies I have seen Some Kind of Wonderful touches me from the heart and reminds me about life and all the hard times that come with it. This is a landmark movie that will never leave my shelf.Rating1010 stars".

They interview the cast briefly Eric Stoltz and Mary Stuart Masterson are insightful and kind and interesting. So is the girl who plays the little sister. Mostly it's fun to see everyone older. Some have aged very well Eric Stoltz and the girl who played his sister. Others have not.Then they have the 'commentary' and I use that word lightly as you watch the movie. They foolishly only had the director and Leah Thompson commenting and it's the most shallow silly commentary I've ever heard. That shot is lovely Howie Thanks dear. Look how pretty you are in this scene! I'm not kidding. I could have tolerated this nonsense if they hadn't gone further.Eric was tough in this scene. He had his own way of working that made me uncomfortable. I know he wanted to be called by his character name. Mary Stuart had a tough day that day look at her. I know she took it so seriously THEY WERE THE BEST THINGS IN THE MOVIE YOU DOPES!!! And I only wish they'd been allowed to comment on the movie because their interviews were the only insightful and articulate and smart interviews on the whole DVD.And we true SKOW fans know what happened on this movie they fired the first director Martha Coolidge and half the cast does this DVD talk about that? Of course not. They allude to the tension on the set but must'Nat allow any true emotions on a DVD extra. It's obvious they cut out a LOT of interesting stuff tried to make it a puff piece. They include an interview with John Hughes from about 30 years ago not even about this movie. Paramount really let us down with this one.On the whole rent it don't buy it.

	schema:headline " Wonderful Love";
	schema:reviewBody "The funny think about love is that it's never entirely a matter of our choice but that it chooses us.This is an under the radar gem that wasn't entirely overlooked but it's been kinda forgotten. This was the last teen film John Hughes wrote and believe it or not this is my second favorite in that sub category from John Hughes and it's one of my favorite romance stories. The story isn't really anything new but it's really more in it's execution in which I personally feel they got everything right. The dialog as with most of Hughes films is great there are a lot of memorable lines but most importantly it doesn't feel melodramatic like in most bad TV teen dramas that make me gag but really feels like the kind of things a regular teen might say. Soundtrack is great I love the song Always I want to be with you.Supporting character Amanda Jones played well by Lea Thompson this is probably my favorite role from her. I like that she doesn't play some stereotypical popular rich girl in fact the interesting thing about her is that she's really in the same working class boat as Keith Watts and Duncan she just dresses up and makes herself seem like a upper class person just to get in with the in crowd.What I like is that you really feel for her character deep down she's really a lost person we see her become disillusioned with the lifestyle from how her rich ex boyfriend Hardy mistreats her whom is a character I just want to punch. As well as how some others in that upper class treat others. These things I feel just show how just because your in the upper class doesn't mean everything is going to be wonderful or that your going to get everything.One moment that really sticks out for me was when she sees the portrait of herself that Keith painted and she then has a slight look of guilt because this portrait represents how he perceives her as a really beautiful wonderful person but she knows that she's not that person the Keith sees.Another supporting character Duccan played by Elias Koteas his character along with his group of friends are awesome. I love the fact that he's a metal head I myself am into Heavy Metal music a rebel tough rough around the edges but has a good heart all the same. Both Keith and him have a good back and forth. One scene for me that was a highlight was seeing Duncan and his friends save Keith in the party which is something real friends do.But of course the film is really driven by both the characters Keith Eric Stolz and Watts Mary Stuart Matherson. Keith is great because his character is in a way kinda like myself in real life. He's a person that speaks softly I'm not the talkative type myself and when we talk it's because we have something significant to say. He's a artist he loves to paint just as I love to write.Watts is just awesome and I'll admit kinda hot. She's feisty and fiery which are total turn ons for me. She a person that just likes to do her own thing and doesn't care about what other people think from what she wears which is sort of a rockerrebel outfit and how she acts is her way of saying this is who I am whether you like it or not. She's also an artist as she plays the drums and likes to make her own music.I like that both really are the same in different ways both of them are rebels. With Keith he's a silent rebel on the passive aggressive side he doesn't look to fight he really tries to solve conflict though reason but he will resort to physical resistance if he has to. Even like the moment in the party despite the situation getting bad where Hardy and his scum friends gang up on Keith about to give a beat down he doesn't bend. Watts is an aggressive rebel that puts it out there. I love that she's not afraid to admit to what she is. From how she dresses and the way she acts. I also love that she doesn't take crap from anyone or let Keith take crap. The chemistry between them is great the thing about this story is that you already know the answer the question is when. It makes perfect sense as both have more history together and are kinda the same.Watts you really feel pathos for because most of what she goes though is some of the stuff I've been though. See how she's aware that her feelings for Keith are more that just friendship alone which is perfectly natural because sometimes as times goes on if our feelings grow we begin to see our friend a lot differently. And how she's having trouble risking it all despite being a risk taker they do say that the greatest risk is expressing your feelings. This just all the more makes us want her to do what she has to do and possibly win because it's the only way not saying anything is even more painful.I really like how Keith is slowly discovering it in his mind he thinks that Amanda could be the one but we see slowly he's changing his mind a little and is starting to look at Watts differently.It has some great themes which are common in most of Hughes films like the importance of opening up to someone about how you feel becoming more our perception on people and how their not always what they seem and believing in yourself.Sometimes the one we truly love is closer then we think.Rating 4 stars".

	schema:headline " Has charm and is fun but the speed and depth of the material is more than the film can really bear  still like it a lot but am not blind to the problems SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "It was an unfortunate coincidence but I had actually lined up this film to watch for quite a few days whenever I heard that John Hughes had died at age 59. Anyway I had already planned to watch this film because recent trips to the films of the 80's had reminded me of this film and how much I used to love it. I was curious to watch it again and indeed when I did nostalgia did play a part in my enjoyment as I realised that I used to have the soundtrack on tape watched several scenes again and again on VHS and genuinely loved the tomboy Watts. This all helped but I am not able to be blind to the fact that as a film it is quite good but has one or two pretty big problems that sadly do take away from the total film.The most obvious is in the material. In terms of the basics all the Hughes standards are in place here and we know where we are going with this from the start. That is not an issue what is an issue is the intensity and the depth that the film tries to operate on. The relationship between Watts and Keith goes too quickly from appearing to be nothing but friends to being tense with his own realisation happening too quickly even if it does make for a nice ending. Likewise things move too quickly with Amanda and Keith  the promise of a first date being the same as dating and the emotional events that follow being far too intense the love professed too deep and the lessons learnt too important and big to be sustained by the rather basic development that underpins them. At one point my girlfriend said have I missed lots of this or something because the shift in the character dynamics did not seem to come from anywhere other than a rush to get there by the film itself. This same problem manifests itself in the final third as well as it does feel like Keith has gone all in in a way that makes no sense whereas the same could have been done with lower stakes and feel more convincing for it.Of course I did still go along with it despite this and there is a lot that still works within the context of this being a genre movie. It is hard not to feel for Watts while other characters add much needed comedy to take the edge off the rather overly done angst. The basic relationship did feel right as well although perhaps that is more down to one's experience and feelings  certainly the awkward friendship thing works for me since I do have a lot more female than male friends and always have. It also helps that I love the cast or at least loved Mary Stuart Masterson as Watts. OK so her material rushes her but she does really well at letting her awkwardness show and also still being attractive in those clothes. Unfortunately Stoltz does not manage it so easily. He overplays his weirdness to the point where he is hard to stay with as a viewer  practically creepy at some points. He isn't helped by the places his material forces him to go in his feelings but he does lack the charm and easy charisma that Masterson manages. Thompson has similar problems with her material giving her character massive jumps but she is pretty good as Amanda Jones. Sheffer easily nails the rich bullycreep character while Koteas is great fun as Duncan. Ashton maybe has to feed the angst more than he gets to just be a character but he is solid while Bure and Corman are very funny as Keith's sisters.Some Kind of Wonderful is not as great as many say and it is not the brilliant film that I remember it has who'd have thunk it? however it does still have plenty of charm and much to enjoy. Such a shame that it is damaged quite badly by how fast and deep the material has it moving  making it less engaging and convincing as it goes along although some nice performances and good comedy help it hold together despite this.".

An ultimately dark story of true companionship. Love definitely plays an essential part but I think Love story gives the wrong impression. It is the adventure of two children traveling through America and their childhood alike dealing with an unfair handful or hurdles and hardships. The direction is impeccable and allows the gifted young actors to excel to their full potential. Everything in this film is meticulously brilliant and so refreshingly intelligent. It's unusual these days to find a film that doesn't patronize its audience. It is almost poetic in the way it gives as few words as possible. Some people may find this slow and boring but these are people who fail to see between the lines where the true story lies.A film both heartwarming and heartwrenching that will sharpen your braincells moisten your cheeks and really make you think about yourself and the life you lead.".

I have just watched this sweet and touching road movie and I really loved the story the screenplay the performances and the direction. I do not know whether it is intentional or not but there are many scenes of the camera against the light creating dark images that I did not like. AnnaSophia Robb is amazing with another awesome performance in a complex role. Cayden Boyd is also fantastic in the difficult role of Ben. Val Kilmer has a minor participation but I believe this is his best interpretation and role in the last years. The secret of Cassie is a heartbreaking moment in the plot and the conclusion is very beautiful. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Em Busca da Felicidade Searching Happiness".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about a boy named Ben who is repeatedly neglected by his hapless parents who are clearly unfit to raise a child since they are infused with their own lives.Then one night a car wreck happens right near their diner. There is one survivor a girl about Ben's age named Cassie. As Ben narrates this changes his life forever. And it does. Cassie after a brief stretch of time wakes Ben in the middle of the night. This is where Cassie suggests that they leave Ben's home and live with her aunt and uncle who are evidently supposed to be hip. So the whole journey starts. Ben agrees and they head to Baltimore. As the movie progresses Cassie suggests they get married. It's a major part of the plan. She says. Ben seems not to believe it but when they have a small ceremony in a farm Cassie is all smiles and Ben gets extremely nervous when asked to kiss her. This shows that some sort of bond has formed between them.But all the while you notice Cassie continues to lose sleep because her dreams keep leading her back to the horrible night that she lost both her parents in the car wreck. Soon after one of her first nightmares Cassie questions Ben about what kind of plan he has for his life. When he tells her he wants to play baseball she seems to use this to try and distract herself from her nightmares. Ben starts to notice something's going on but when he questions her about it she refuses to tell him anything.In Baltimore it becomes clear that something is deeply troubling Cassie. She becomes depressed snappy and she starts to seclude herself from her aunt and uncle and even Ben. Cassie also clings to Ben's dream of being a pitcher more tightly and becomes angry with Ben when he reminds her that he's only thirteen and can't get signed right away. Ben by now is extremely worried about her and it leads to their first fight. Afterward Cassie apologizes because she knows that it's not Ben's fault that she's having a hard time. And when Cassie has yet another nightmare that has her lying on the other end of the bed moaning Ben quietly and desperately pleads her for an explanation. But all Cassie does is start to cry.The next night is when it happens. Cassie's refusal to get her problem off her chest has rendered her mind extremely unstable and she loses her mind that night by collapsing onto the floor sobbing in a very frightened and upset way. It is as if she herself does not know what has happened to her. Ben kneels by her side no matter how frightening it is for the both of them at that moment.Basically this story is trying to make a few points. Point one experiencing other people's deaths especially the deaths of your parents can effect a person in ways people may not have believed possible. As we find out later Cassie's father tried to sexually harass her while he was driving and drunk and Cassie's mother did nothing. Cassie then dived onto her father screaming causing the wreck. Because of these reasons Cassie has irrepressible guilt about her parent's deaths.Point two a single moment can change your life forever. And it was that single stroke of the moment that Ben met Cassie. It was also in the single stroke of the moment that Cassie's parents died. Had these events not taken place Ben and Cassie never would have met.Point three you can take friends for granted but true loyalty is tested when your friend needs you the most. Cassie is admitted to a psych ward and is upset confused and very scared. And Ben ever faithful sticks with her to the end which is somewhat happy for the both of them. Point four if you don't make your dreams happen chances are they won't happen. Cassie got Ben out of his boring mightaswellnotevenexist life and awoke him to the world around him. When he goes to visit her Ben decides that since Cassie helped him to break out of the dull life he once led he is going to break Cassie out of the psych ward. At first she refuses telling Ben Ben I'm sick. When you kill two people it makes you sick. Ben takes her out anyway and they continue their lives together. In the end the film has an epilogue where Ben ends up becoming what he wants to be a pitcher. Cassie is shown cheering in the stands at one of Ben's games. They also have two children unnamed.I believe the reason this film got bad reviews is because when people see a movie they want one of those movies where you can predict what might happen. They don't want an unpredictable movie. That's the reason I enjoyed it so much. I myself have seen too many movies and they are almost too predictable. This movie was not predictable at all and I took pleasure in that.All in all a movie with good messages. Good enough for DVD however. The reason for this is plot holes lighting issues and the director. Either he was a firsttime director or he just didn't try as hard as he could have. Luckily the acting was good. Cayden Boyd and AnnaSophia Robb were both wonderful and proved themselves to act. AnnaSophia is proving herself over and over to be a brilliant actress and Cayden shows his potential to act here as well.See this film. You may learn something.".

	schema:reviewBody "Have Dreams Will Travel is a quirky sort of movie full of little eccentricities and minor faults that make up its personality. Writerdirector Brad Isaacs is not overly ambitious probably quite aware of his limitations as a firsttime director. He has structured what amounts to the filmed equivalent of a short story very economical and specific.The star of this film is Cayden Boyd who plays Ben  a kid who tends to disappear into the shadows. His lack of identity seems to be polar opposite to Cassie AnnaSophia Robb. Ben lives at a diner with his boatobsessed father and his movieobsessed mom. One rainy night there is a terrible car wreck outside the diner and the only survivor is young Cassie. After she is nursed back to health Cassie decides that she and Ben would be best off to hit the road and head east.That's the basic setup for the film which is largely a road trip. They meet many interesting characters on the way to Baltimore one of the most so who is played by Val Kilmer. His role in this film is only slightly more significant than his appearance in The Missing but he is quite excellent as a depressed pig farmer. Stephen Root is very good as an interfering sheriff character.Although somewhat lightweight at the beginning Have Dreams Will Travel proves itself to be a far deeper and darker film than it first appears to be. In fact it turns out to be not quite the kids you might assume it is. Perhaps that makes it a little schizophrenic but it works quite well in this case. Overall this film is individual and original enough to be more than worth the watch. It has a certain quality that feels strange yet heartwarming. Robb and Boyd give their very best performances in two quite difficult roles and more than make the film what it is.RATING 7.5 out of 10".

There is also quite a lot of humor to be found in the slightly bizarre portrayal of the two precocious kids. What makes the movie into a true piece of art is the balance between tragedy joy and friendship and the fact that the ending is happy. Annasophia Robb and Cayden Boyd do some wonderful acting which really makes you sympathize with the characters. There is a very special unique feeling throughout the movie one I can't explain but certainly makes it worth watching.

It is amazing how Cassie at such a young age manages to drive her life with Ben along to a great plan  and see it to its fulfillment. Equally amazing is how Ben complies with it all along and gives strength to Cas at her lowest point. Overall this is an adult fairy tale with the most realistic and bittersweet happilyeverafter ending anyone can hope to have. Grownups like me will be lead to reexamine their lives while teens and young adults will take away many important points  like the importance of having a plan they can hold on to for life and of having someone with whom they can share their strengths to see it through. This movie also sums up what I've long held to be true a strong woman can make a man's life soar and a man must recognize and respect this gift of her presence if he is lucky enough to find her.I feel lucky to have stumbled into this movie  after nearly 5 years since it was shown! I hope more people will get to see it and spread its worth.".

Grownups like me will be lead to reexamine their lives while teens and young adults will take away many important points  like the importance of having a plan they can hold on to for life and of having someone with whom they can share their strengths to see it through. This movie also sums up what I've long held to be true a strong woman can make a man's life soar and a man must recognize and respect this gift of her presence if he is lucky enough to find her.I feel lucky to have stumbled into this movie  after nearly 5 years since it was shown! I hope more people will get to see it and spread its worth.";

Of course I guess I don't needs to tell if some character in some movie casted by AnnaSophia Robb it is a brilliant movie. Even the movie has a worst plot she gives life to it. I currently owns every movie of her and this is one of the best.There are several scenes I really liked very much but I don't want to giveaway spoilers about them right now. It is heartbreaking story and such a great creation not to mention the music. Just brilliant. The main cover theme and 'It's Time to Go' tracks of the soundtrack just like my national anthems!. I am listening to it everyday and it never gets old.Finally my rating for this great great creation is 1010. If I could rate it more than 10 I would do that. Nice work! Expecting more movies from these directors. Best regards!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard that the movie was unable to get a US DVD release due to insufficient funds that pretty much set the tone for what to expect lacking. However after being impressed by Robb's performance in Teribithia this movie got me curious. The delivery of dialogue felt weak and scripted a usual flaw w many child actors. This did however lend the young characters a broken feel to them which is reflected by their upbringings so it felt justified. I did enjoy the poor charm of the characters. Sleeping in a pig sty the engagement ring being a piece of wire the same clothes used throughout the entire duration of the film. It sets the stage quite nicely for the upcoming drama that is about to unfold upon our beloved young actors. When we finally learn the reason for Cass's trauma I must admit I wasn't as surprised as I had hoped to be. I knew that she had something to do with the accident and I even knew that it had to be some form of sexual abuse.What got me the most out of the entire film was the scene where Ben finally reaches Cass after evading several psychiatric wards. At this point I didn't know what Cass was going to be like. When he approaches her I was expecting and somewhat hoping for a violent encounter. But what what got instead was a mellowedout severely depressed Cass. I had goosebumps when Cass looked up to Ben with her dark gloomy eyes.On the whole the movie finishes what it starts with nothing left hanging. It's a humble film with nothing to show off for. It delivers a heartwarming tale of lost innocence family issues the pursuit of happiness all that good stuff you would expect from this sort of film. It is pretty hard to come by in the states which I find utterly ironic and somewhat disappointing. The latter being due to the fact that I saw some potential acting ability from these rising young actors. If you happen to come across it check it out. Definitely an underrated film that deserved more than just a film festival spot and Brazilianonly DVD release.".

But that together with the dramatic darkness at the end is what makes the special feeling.In the end the film would have little good without the starring couple. While adult roles are wellperformed they are not challenging and it's the talent of the young Caydon Bayd as Ben and AnnaSophia Robb as Cassie that shine and give deepness to the film.

Both kids set out to Baltimore to live with Cassie's aunt and uncle Cassie and Ben are not related. They meet a lot of interesting characters and learn a lot about life. They even have a romance part in the story they get married to each other very early in the movie. Ben wants to be a major league pitcher so you will see him throwing a baseball several times in the movie.The film is also funny at certain points not like funny as hysterically hilarious but funny as in Heh Heh. Like a serious funny. Its hard to explain but it has some pretty good humor. The film has a lot of romance between Cassie and Ben but not too much. Annasophia performs outstandingly but sometimes it seems like she is not doing well. Cayden Boyd does a great job too.The movie while great has some flaws. One flaw is that the lighting in the dark rooms is horrendous. I can rarely see Ben and Cassie. In the trailer for this movie it seems like the lighting issue is not there but it is. I hope the edit this for its US release. Another problem is the movie feels a bit short to me. I watched it on Youtube. It was separated into 8 parts. 7 parts are 10 minutes while the 8th part is 3 minutes. In fact two parts of the movie on Youtube at the end have at least the last quarter of it taken out or blocked most likely these parts are on the DVD Brazil only.Overall a great movie that deserves a release in the US. I hope they release it here and if they don't we should make a petition or I could import the DVD from Brazil. It gets a 9 out of 10.".

The camera quality is not very good and the whole picture feels tinged with some sepia ? colouring. It feels almost as if it were made unprofessionally though the appearance of notable actors like Val Kilmer Heather Graham and AnnaSophia Robb suggests otherwise. In short it looks like it was filmed by the same camera that did Birdemic. But perhaps the most endearing quality to this film is it's slightly amateurish look.It seems like it should be either a complete sentimental schlockfest  or a no budget trashy direct to video.But it isn't.

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Jackson has done it.  He has created an allencompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books and after coming away from the final chapter how does this rate not only as a film on its own but as a part of the whole?Perfect.I've never seen a series like this.  A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible?  I have always loved the original Star Wars and Indiana Jones series for their epic storytelling and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be will be remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come.  They do not make films like these anymore.As a stand alone film it picks up immediately where Two Towers ends so brush up before seeing it.  I've read the books and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective.  I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done right.  And when it happened it was.  I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.The cast comes through once more.  The musical score retains its beauty elegance and power.  The special effects notably Gollum again are nothing less than breathtaking and simply move the story along.  The battles are monumentally huge and exciting.  There are some liberties taken with the story especially during the end with the homecoming and yet everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. After the greatest moment of the series resolves itself the story provided a breather.  And gives a goodbye to friends seen on screen for the last three years.  It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no Rings movie in 2004.  I will miss this talented group of actors.As with the first two the film is very long but goes by without you ever truly realizing it.  This film is so much more than a simple fantasy epic. It's a story about strength of character friendship loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory.  Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic.

	onyx:emotionText "Peter Jackson has done it.  He has created an allencompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books and after coming away from the final chapter how does this rate not only as a film on its own but as a part of the whole?Perfect.I've never seen a series like this.  A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible?  I have always loved the original Star Wars and Indiana Jones series for their epic storytelling and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be will be remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come.  They do not make films like these anymore.As a stand alone film it picks up immediately where Two Towers ends so brush up before seeing it.  I've read the books and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective.  I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done right.  And when it happened it was.  I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.The cast comes through once more.  The musical score retains its beauty elegance and power.  The special effects notably Gollum again are nothing less than breathtaking and simply move the story along.  The battles are monumentally huge and exciting.  There are some liberties taken with the story especially during the end with the homecoming and yet everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. After the greatest moment of the series resolves itself the story provided a breather.  And gives a goodbye to friends seen on screen for the last three years.  It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no Rings movie in 2004.  I will miss this talented group of actors.As with the first two the film is very long but goes by without you ever truly realizing it.  This film is so much more than a simple fantasy epic. It's a story about strength of character friendship loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory.  Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic.  As as far as the ending goes they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been.I will miss looking forward to a new Rings movie but these movies provide hope that highquality films can still be made without special effects taking over a story bathroom humor or a Top 40 soundtrack.  George Lucas could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the fanbase.Each film has earned a 10 from me for the last two years which for me to give is a rarity.

	schema:reviewBody "Obviously I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie but since it was released in parts that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes one of my favourites including the part with the giant spiderthat made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.This is the longest of the series mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He and us the audience have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over and the celebrations have ended there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years there have been the extended cuts of course but after that it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best in my opinion. As whole the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film and that's a bit depressing.My rating 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Saying that this film starts where Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol Andy Serkis obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of Two Towers' at that's the ring. The first installment The Fellowship of the Ring' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence and in Return of the King' we see it pay off big time.After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden Bernard Hill the king of Rohan and the elves the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor the last free kingdom of men and the wizard Gandalf Ian McKellan must warn Denethor John Noble Steward of Gondor of the impending attack while Aragorn Viggo Mortenson heir to the throne of Gondor and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth and two hobbits Frodo Elijah Wood the ringbearer and Sam Sean Astin must continue their journey directed by Gollum to Mount Doom the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not you need to bone up on your Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow this film.Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture  except for this one. The Return of the King' is just too big the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films he puts them to use.All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits Merry Dominic Monaghan and Pippin Billy Boyd are no longer the tree ornaments they were from Two Towers' but are splitup and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum Serkis' provided not only the voice of Gollum but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computergenerated character with his fellow actors.However the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring's power to corrupt which needless to say is absolute.The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With Return of the King' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With hands down the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy Jackson makes Return of the King' a gorgeous feast for the eyes while never resorting to McG level overthetopness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters not letting the effects tell the story but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of Return' as a mix of Fellowship' and Two Towers' with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.The bottom line fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers however it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a movie watcher I tend to become bored with the constant overdone overdrawn underplayed overdramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.We all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise.That all being said I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most aweinspiring collection of films ever created.The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. Check out Legolas in the BIG battle It's all just too much for words.If one were to gripe and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made true to the source material and completely engrossing but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours including ads and previews that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such this will be all the better at least for me when it's release on DVD can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out.As a film though this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson.".

I  have never read the books having I thought been put off them for  life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at  school. One classmate then aged about sixteen told me with great  pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least  fifty times. I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and  sorcery' school of fantasy writing or filmmaking indeed some of this  genre mostly those starring the current governor of California struck  me as being among the worst films ever made.  I was however persuaded to see the first in the trilogy 'The  Fellowship of the Ring' by its overwhelmingly positive reception from  the critics and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's  vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves gnomes and  fairies what I experienced was a genuine epic in the true sense of  that overused word. Ever since December 2001 I have been waiting for  parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has  disappointed me.  The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a  review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic  ring which will give its possessor immense power. The powerhungry Dark  Lord Sauron a figure who is never actually seen on screen desires to  obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies led by  the wizard Gandalf are seeking to destroy the ring which can only be  used for evil purposes not for good. At the beginning of the final  part of the trilogy Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the  kingdom of Gondor.  The film relates the story of the conflict which follows and this  leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen  even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably the  film makes much use of computergenerated effects but unlike many  films dominated by special effects plot and character are not  neglected. The acting is uniformly good and in some cases outstanding.  Special mentions must also go to the camerawork which made the best  possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery and to Howard  Shore's memorable musical score.  So looking forward to the Oscar ceremony I have no doubt that this  should be the best film and that Peter Jackson who has amply fulfilled  the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures' should be best  director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the  competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen who brings wisdom kindliness and  the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf and of Elijah  Wood who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls  the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting  Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin as Frodo's loyal  companion Sam but several others might have claims notably Viggo  Mortensen or Bernard Hill.  Is this the best movie ever made as some of its admirers have claimed?  Possibly not that is after all a very large claim to make. I have no  doubt however that the trilogy as a whole is the first great  cinematic masterpiece of the twentyfirst century. It has certainly  inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 1010.".

	schema:headline " A monumental film";
	schema:reviewBody "Feeling weary and battleworn I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them  probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising evocative inspiring and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed beauty and wonderment fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes touches of humour wellpaced dramatic tension and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.The storytelling is much more professional that the first one  which maybe laboured to introduce so much information  or the second one  which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King there is an emotional sting at the start as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm funloving guy to murderous mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story  the sadness of the lovely softfocus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended the comradeship of Sam and Frodo Sean Astin  Elijah Wood that is tested to the limits the strong commanding presence of Gandalf Ian McKellen who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscarworthy performance the ingenious and very varied battle scenes and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.This is a fairy story of human endeavour the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future.

	onyx:emotionText "Feeling weary and battleworn I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them  probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising evocative inspiring and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed beauty and wonderment fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes touches of humour wellpaced dramatic tension and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.The storytelling is much more professional that the first one  which maybe laboured to introduce so much information  or the second one  which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King there is an emotional sting at the start as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm funloving guy to murderous mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story  the sadness of the lovely softfocus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended the comradeship of Sam and Frodo Sean Astin  Elijah Wood that is tested to the limits the strong commanding presence of Gandalf Ian McKellen who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscarworthy performance the ingenious and very varied battle scenes and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.This is a fairy story of human endeavour the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you the physical attractions are not airbrushed and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit if not archival detailed accuracy of the original and makes you want to read the book or read the book again!The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long  but not that you'd notice . . .";

	schema:reviewBody "I admit it I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.My only slight disappointment is the ending it does feel overlong and bloated for me almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.Despite this minor discrepancy Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mindblowing the scenery is superb the costumes and makeup are well tailored the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal rousing haunting and charming themes whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm darkness etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship strength and loyalty the screenplay is wellwritten and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.The acting is very good. Orlando Bloomwho I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland and John RhysDavies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.All in all an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and certainly doesn't disappoint like some other trilogies coughMatrixcough. The three films had their principal shooting all done at the same time which lowers their overall costs and keeps a good sense of continuity for the films.The special effects first of all are excellent. While there's a few little things a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and occasional lighting that's a bit off by and large they're excellent. The most impressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or simple scene it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with filmed actors and action sweeping landscapes and dozens of things happening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres even on DVD there's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive screen.The filming is good although there are a few evidences of digital smoothing and cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky moviegoer. There are a few interesting shots but most are fairly plain and straight on getting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes provide a great backdrop for everything going on and there really are some beautiful places especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are quite good what with the orcs warring and everything so you may want to look into real estate purchases now.Sound has been said to make 75 of the emotional impact of any production. This is a loud 75. All the sound effects are very well pulled off sound appropriate and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering on painful but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound and it's rare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles the roof of the theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well and Howard Shore has done an excellent job as with the last two films in the series.Performances all around were good but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles perfectly and came away giving a good picture of the characters. Elijah Wood seemed to be stuck with the same terrified expression on his face through most of the movie almost Max Paynestyle and it grew old quickly. Ian McKellen the everwise white wizard had a fair bit of dialogue which he delivered well my only complaint is he had too much in the way of wistful sayings leading to scene changes. Orlando Bloom favorite of young teenage girls everywhere had a few more action sequences which got cheers from the aforementioned girls which were quite well pulled off but his acting wasn't much tested by this film. John RhysDavies continued with Gimli's joking performance he's really too amusing to take seriously but does a good job at it.For the old Tolkien fans this movie stays quite close to the book although they did have to omit some portions most notably the taking and retaking of the Shire and the time spent in the Halls of Healing in Minas Tirith. Hopefully some of this will show up in the Extended Edition on DVD. Shelob's attack was left until this film and much of the time spent in Mordor was shortened for the sake of pacing and it was a good decision.My favorite scene would have to be the battle at Minas Tirith. The incredible scope of the battle with the special effects sounds and many closeups of pieces of the action make for an exciting scene. The visual effects especially are stunning the 'oliphaunts' play a big part in the action and they're entirely created by computer. There's also some wide shots with tens of thousands of digital characters marching on the field of battle and even the individual actions have the masses warring as a backdrop. It's worth your moviegoing dollar simply to watch this on a large screen. It was also intermingled with some smaller events inside Minas Tirith so it's not pure battle for the whole of the scene and it keeps it from being dreary or heavyhanded.Overall this is a movie well worth watching and even paying to see in a theatre. I'd recommend against bringing small children as there are some scary images and they'd also be a distraction during the final movie in what will probably remain the series of the decade. Not a particularly great date movie either...this is a real bringyourfriends big movie. Five out of five decapitated orcs and trust me there were a lot more than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large threepart cinematic piece I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single multipart essay. Click on my screenname and hit Chronological to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting cinematography art and direction simply can not be beat.Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense evocative and thoughtful I go for the Two Towers.Frodo Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies nerves and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.The heroism and romance are incredibly moving  when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking  even moreso than in the previous two films.The casting and acting are superb.The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's wellearned crown.Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy however you may be able to predict some of what will occur but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK however is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly it all comes through in the films.Even more than the previous two films Jackson and his writers took liberties with the storyline. Like the others however this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations the filmmakers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced reordered and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.".

Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orcs.If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan of the first two films  I loved them but was not blind to their faults. However let me just lay my cards out here I was totally blown away by this film.  For the vast majority and more of that later the narrative flowed really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep consistent.  Here the various strands work well together and while characters have only brief times to tell stories on the whole it manages it well.  I got the feeling that the film really let rip  it knew this was the ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a trilogy rather than just a stand alone film.The one area where the film really stutters and actually caused people to leave the cinema in annoying numbers is ironically the place where Jackson is true to the book and that's the final 20 minutes.  There is a clear scene where the film ends however it then runs for another 20 minutes  which is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end.  To Joe Public ie me! I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends tied up in the way the book does it  the film should have ended on a high with the King being crowned etc but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a way that is not in line with the momentum of the film if not the whole trilogy!  This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things but I would rather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder when's this ending? Is this the end now? Oh maybe this is it now?'  but I do understand why it was done this way.The cast as they have been all the way are excellent.  Wood's Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship.  Bloom and RhysDavis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes  adding both action and the odd comic touch that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension.  Mortensen is the title character and serves it well with McKellen also continuing his strong role.  I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things.  Firstly both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy.  His Gollum is so much more than an effect  he is tragic fearsome hateful and funny.  Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character as opposed the look is foolish.  He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way.  It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.The special effects do not stand out  and that's a compliment.  Even in state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be watching a video game.  Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects even though the majority of the film was!  This is how they SHOULD be used  not as a draw in their own right but as part of the film.  Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or the animated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an effect I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that is this film.I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do that without me joining them but it is hard to really fault this film.  It is the strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well it is an emotional event more than a film and if Jackson needs 20 minutes of slow closure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in return for all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given me.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS SPOILERSOver the years I've read Lord of the Rings four times. During the holiday season of 20034 I watched Return of the King four times. While I embraced ROTK as the third part of a dream come true I was not totally happy left wondering why so many things vital were missing. The 4hour extended DVD version explains a lot.My biggest beef was on so much missing about Aragon and I found most of them in the DVD. One of the vital elements in the Fellowship's strategy is to draw Sauron's eye away from Frodo and here Aragon's role is crucial. The last debate in the movie is totally inadequate in explaining the suicidal march to the Black gate but the DVD makes it very clear with the additional scene of Aragon revealing himself to Sauron though the Palantir. He is the bait that Sauron cannot resist.Another important aspect is that Aragon comes into the city of Minas Tirith first and foremost as a HEALER not as a king. The kingship comes afterwards. This is again brought out in the additional scenes in the DVD although still missing a lot of details from the book.Still disappointing even for the DVD is that so little is given to the story of Eowyn and Faramir. The dialogue through which they come to accept each other could very well be the most beautiful in the entire book. The few shots in the DVD that trace the development of their relationship are far from adequate although that's a least a slight improvement from the film version.Another disappointment is Aragon's arrival at the Pelennor Fields which is hopelessly lame compared with the original treatment in the book amidst the despair of the Rohan and Gondor soldiers in witnessing the approaching black ships Aragon's standard suddenly unfurls at the main mast There flowered a White Tree and that was for Gondor but seven stars were about it and a high crown above it the signs of Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count. And the stars flamed in the sunlight for they were wrought of gems by Arwen daughter of Elrond and the crown was bright in the morning for it was wrought of mithril gold. The treatment of Gandalf's confrontation of the Witch King in the DVD departs from the book in which the two are locked in a face off then Rohan's horns are heard and the Witch King swings around and leaves. What in heaven's name is in Peter Jackson's mind when he had Gandalf's staff broken by the Witch King. But this did explain a mystery that has been bugging me for a year  why Gandalf had to snatch a spear from the guard when he saved Faramir from the pyre of Denethor.Enough on the DVD.I shall be remiss if I do not pay tribute to Peter Jackson for the wonderful film he and his dedicated crew have created.Most inspired is the lighting of the beacons to summon help from Rohan. In the book this is observed by Pippin in the ride to Minas Tirith. To satisfy Pippin's curiosity Gandalf explains the background to him in a somewhat factual manner. Jackson turns this into one of the most exciting moments in the film with aesthetically superb shots of the 13 beacons yes I counted them being lit up in succession accompanied by beautifully rousing music score culminating in Theoden's heroic utterance of Rohan will answer. Watching this has to be among the most uplifting moments one can experience in a cinema.Most poignant is the Faramir's suicidal attempt to retake Osgilaith under the orders of an unloving father. Starting from the soldiers of Gondor filing out of Minas Tirith in what looks almost like a funeral march to the letting loose of the swarm of arrows by the orcs in Osgilaith every image of this scene is so hauntingly heartrending. It reminds me of John Woo's favourite scenes although here the music is Pipppin's actual singing rather than adapted background music rendering the tragic mood even more devastating.Directly opposite in mood is Rohan's charge in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. Even if this mission is in a way equally suicidal the spirit is sky high radiating dauntless heroism and lust for battle. This scene also reminds me of the legendary battle scene in Spartacus 1960 which is universally recognised as the model in depiction of battle strategies. Rohan's charge in Pelennor Field no the other hand exemplifies heroism unsurpassed.Although ROTK is first and foremost the King's story we should not forget in the overall scheme of things the ring bearers no typo here because Frodo did acknowledge Sam as a fellow ring bearer in the end of the book. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin particularly Astin have played their roles to perfection. Towards the end of the quest when Frodo's strength was almost fully spent to hear Sam say I cannot carry it the ring for you Mr. Frodo but I can carry you and not be moved one will have to be a hopelessly and irreversibly hardened cynic. The background music incidentally is Into the west.It is certainly a good sign that the general audience worldwide has reacted favourably to the long aftermath following the destruction of the ring indicated that their capacity to appreciate has not been impaired by the proliferation of Hollywood style slambang endings. Viggo Mortensen's line to the Hobbits My friends you bow to no one is delivered with sincerity and conviction. The final scene at the Grey Havens is graceful touching stylish. However there is one shot that I must mention Galadriel's final enigmatic alluring halfsmiling glance at Frodo before she disappears into the ship. Cate Blanchett is among the most versatile actresses around today and in LOTR she is Galadriel incarnate.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lord of the Rings  The Return of the King is by far the most moving inspirational and epic of the three parts in Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece. After proving that this trilogy can carry the weight of a truly enormous body of text with The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers Jackson has shown that nothing is impossible anymore when being brought to film and that fantasy can be surreal but grounded to reality.I saw this film at 800 PM and missed school the following day  exactly similar to The Two Towers when it was released. After seeing The Return of the King I was speechless. Never before had a film made such an impact on me as this conclusion did and now with it completed The Lord of the Rings is truly the best of the best.Jackson has treated this trilogy as one film following to Tolkien's linear timeline and not the way the books were written which makes this a film that flows and never loses track of pacing. The dialogue is emotional be it the speech between Gandalf and Pippin before the gates of Minas Tirith or inspirational such as the rousing deliveries by Theoden and Aragorn. The vast emotion makes this a film for the ages. Following our heroes adventure since film one we have grown compassion for each and everyone of them. Sam's devotion to Frodo is something that can inspire and the eucatastrophe is fully used here once again because just as it seems that all hope has been lost it shines through the void and victory is achieved. If one were to fear that the ending would feel like there was no closure then have none because The Return of the King has a 20minute denouement that goes as far as fouryears into the future and the ending on the shores of the Grey Havens brought me to tears.The special effects are nothing short of amazing. The blend of miniaturesbigatures and CGI is believable beyond comprehension and the addition of New Zealand locales adds something beyond some peoples' wildest dreams. The level of detail on Minas Tirith is something no one has ever seen before the massive armies sunder speakers as war erupts and we see the Mumakil and the Fell Beasts in full fruition as hinted in The Two Towers. What could've seem fatal as cinematic history has shown before is the introduction of Shelob the spider. The special effects team has created the most memorable spider in film history. She terrifies and drops jaws at the realism of such a beast.The tension for the siege on Minas Tirith is so highly anticipated that the filmmakers have completely satisfied every expectation to how epic it could've been. The scope is just extraordinary. The battle of the Pelennor Fields is so huge in the book yet it has been fully realized in Jackson's film. The final stand at the Black Gate is so emotional involving it's hard to think that any action could top what was previously seen but it is done so with vision beyond imagination.Howard Shore's music is also some of the most impressive and beautiful orchestration ever done for film. Besting its predecessors The Return of the King's score is pure genius. From the new theme for Gondor to the moving Into the West Shore's composition sweeps and soars. Now that each of the three films' complete recordings have been released I strongly urge a fan of the music to buy them because they really are the best of the best.The acting even surpasses the first two having the evolution of each character add to the dramatic effect be it the loss of a life or the triumph over evil. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is like a Godsend. Sean Astin steals nearly every scene he is in as Sam making us hope he helps Frodo get rid of the Ring of Power. Once again Andy Serkis provides a stirring and great performance as SmeagolGollum. The full weight of the Ring is realized in this film and Elijah Wood makes us see his struggle like the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers only hinted upon.Overall The Lord of the Rings  The Return of the King is remarkable. The battles are amazing never making the film drag and always heightening the tension. From the acting to the sound editing this film delivers in what it promises and that is the supreme motion picture of our lifetime and many more years to come.".

	schema:headline " The greatest epic ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King is hands down among the most spectacular and magnificent films of all time.A short rundown of the plot After the battle of Helm's Deep and Saruman's imprisonment in his tower Orthanc Aragorn Legolas Gimli and Gandalf regroup with Merry and Pippin in Isengard. There they learn that the army of Sauron is planning a fullscale attack on the largest city of men  Minas Tirith in Gondor. Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to warn Denethor the steward of Gondor of the threat from Mordor. Defenses are built up as the army of Sauron marches across the Pelennor Fields towards Minas Tirith. A distress call is sent to Rohan still recovering from Helm's Deep. Rohan manage to muster a large army and set out for Minas Tirith but the battle has already begun. In the meantime we continue with Sam and Frodo on their quest to destroy the One Ring.A major achievement of this epic film is the character development. Gollum becomes more cunning and sneaky than ever and manages to turn Frodo against Sam who is desperately trying his best to get his old Frodo back. Merry and Pippin are no longer just a source of comic relief both of them prove themselves worthy as they are split up for the final battle. We learn about the true bravery and potential of hobbits as Merry helps cut down the Witch King. Eowyn also proves herself in the film as she defies her uncle and sets out to Pelennor fields with the other Rohirrim and eventually destroys the Witch King and makes a very feminist remark while doing so. We learn to loathe Denethor because of his hatred of his last remaining son Faramir who really hasn't done anything wrong. The peak of our hatred for Denethor is reached in the scene where he tells Faramir that he would have preferred it if he had died instead of Boromir his brother. And then right after that Denethor sends Faramir into certain suicide and Faramir immediately accepts the mission he is appointed to in a final attempt to please his father. And of course Aragorn learns to accept his fate as the true king of men.In fact the character development is so powerful that we actually participate in the character's feelings. We FEEL Frodo's exhaustion and agony as he literally drags himself across Mordor. We feel Sam's pain as Frodo is turned against him. And just briefly we participate in Gollum's triumph as he finally gets the One Ring. We are actually happy for Gollum and just for a brief moment Frodo becomes the bad guy as he tries to take the ring back. All in all Return of the King contains the most moving emotional and touching scenes in the entire trilogy and some of the best acting especially from Sean Astin Sam Elijah Wood Frodo Ian McKellen Gandalf John Noble Denethor he is very successful in adding depth to his character Miranda Otto Eowyn and of course Andy Serkis Smeagol and topnotch at it just like in The Two Towers.The battle of Pelennor fields may be THE most spectacular and epic sequence in film history. Unlike Helm's Deep Pelennor Fields shows the true cleverness of Sauron's army. Orcs are not the only participants trolls are heavily used in the battle as warriors and as beasts of burden. The nazgul are very significant in the battle and while the Witch King didn't actually lead the battle as he did in the book the nine ringwraiths and their fell beasts still play a key part and do lots of damage in the battle. We see just how powerful the nazgul really are. And of course the men from the south and their massive oliphaunts play a significant part. While in Helm's Deep we felt triumphant in Pelennor fields we only feel the triumph briefly as the Rohirrim make their charge into the horde of orcs and trolls. The triumph in Pelennor Fields almost immediately dissolves as the Rohirrim are trampled down by the oliphaunts. The battle is won but we're not happy we're grieved for all the destruction all the losses. It's a totally different feeling than Helm's Deep and makes this battle all the more superior.Return of the King features the most magnificent visuals in the entire trilogy. Whether they are of Minas Tirith Pelennor Fields and Osgiliath Mordor and the slopes of Mt. Doom or the climb to Shelob's cave near Minas Morgul Peter Jackson really shows us the true impact of these landscapes and images.Many people may complain about the changes in the movie especially the significant cut of Saruman from the end but you must realize that if they would have featured the whole part with Saruman the movie would have continued another hour and a half. Don't fret Peter Jackson said the scenes will all appear in the extended version of the film. The ending is long enough as it is and the film continues at least another half an hour after the Ring is no more. The hobbits return to the shire and Sam marries Rosie. Aragorn meets his fate and is crowned king and is finally reunited with Arwen. And of course one of the most moving scenes in the movie in which Frodo gets on the last ship to the Undying lands with Bilbo Gandalf and the last of the elves Galadriel and Elrond to name a few and must part with his three hobbit friends for good.All in all The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King is one the most finetuned cinematically perfect films ever made it's absolutely flawless in every aspect. The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole is a spectacular achievement in film making history and all three movies are together without a doubt the greatest epic ever made.".

We learn to loathe Denethor because of his hatred of his last remaining son Faramir who really hasn't done anything wrong. The peak of our hatred for Denethor is reached in the scene where he tells Faramir that he would have preferred it if he had died instead of Boromir his brother. And then right after that Denethor sends Faramir into certain suicide and Faramir immediately accepts the mission he is appointed to in a final attempt to please his father. And of course Aragorn learns to accept his fate as the true king of men.In fact the character development is so powerful that we actually participate in the character's feelings. We FEEL Frodo's exhaustion and agony as he literally drags himself across Mordor. We feel Sam's pain as Frodo is turned against him. And just briefly we participate in Gollum's triumph as he finally gets the One Ring. We are actually happy for Gollum and just for a brief moment Frodo becomes the bad guy as he tries to take the ring back. All in all Return of the King contains the most moving emotional and touching scenes in the entire trilogy and some of the best acting especially from Sean Astin Sam Elijah Wood Frodo Ian McKellen Gandalf John Noble Denethor he is very successful in adding depth to his character Miranda Otto Eowyn and of course Andy Serkis Smeagol and topnotch at it just like in The Two Towers.The battle of Pelennor fields may be THE most spectacular and epic sequence in film history. Unlike Helm's Deep Pelennor Fields shows the true cleverness of Sauron's army. Orcs are not the only participants trolls are heavily used in the battle as warriors and as beasts of burden. The nazgul are very significant in the battle and while the Witch King didn't actually lead the battle as he did in the book the nine ringwraiths and their fell beasts still play a key part and do lots of damage in the battle. We see just how powerful the nazgul really are. And of course the men from the south and their massive oliphaunts play a significant part. While in Helm's Deep we felt triumphant in Pelennor fields we only feel the triumph briefly as the Rohirrim make their charge into the horde of orcs and trolls. The triumph in Pelennor Fields almost immediately dissolves as the Rohirrim are trampled down by the oliphaunts. The battle is won but we're not happy we're grieved for all the destruction all the losses. It's a totally different feeling than Helm's Deep and makes this battle all the more superior.Return of the King features the most magnificent visuals in the entire trilogy. Whether they are of Minas Tirith Pelennor Fields and Osgiliath Mordor and the slopes of Mt. Doom or the climb to Shelob's cave near Minas Morgul Peter Jackson really shows us the true impact of these landscapes and images.Many people may complain about the changes in the movie especially the significant cut of Saruman from the end but you must realize that if they would have featured the whole part with Saruman the movie would have continued another hour and a half. Don't fret Peter Jackson said the scenes will all appear in the extended version of the film. The ending is long enough as it is and the film continues at least another half an hour after the Ring is no more. The hobbits return to the shire and Sam marries Rosie. Aragorn meets his fate and is crowned king and is finally reunited with Arwen. And of course one of the most moving scenes in the movie in which Frodo gets on the last ship to the Undying lands with Bilbo Gandalf and the last of the elves Galadriel and Elrond to name a few and must part with his three hobbit friends for good.All in all The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King is one the most finetuned cinematically perfect films ever made it's absolutely flawless in every aspect. The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole is a spectacular achievement in film making history and all three movies are together without a doubt the greatest epic ever made.";

	schema:reviewBody "Overall I am disappointed though not surprised by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien Jackson and movie fans alike in order to espouse the true value of Peter Jackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien Jackson and all good storytellers  to create to engender and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures.The problem with imagination is that it is an individual event a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art Fiction Fantasy and any degree of Storytelling agree willingly or no to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice selfconfidence and faith spiritual one could argue to thrust the contents of one's subjective reality into to borrow from Douglas Adams the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. From Homer to Bill O'Reilly this concept of personal creation what Tolkien called SubCreation is the essence of modern human existence and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us.Therefore in defense of both Tolkien whom some on this website have maligned and Jackson whom many have maligned I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for mediocre writing or atrocious filmmaking should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunninglyworded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities so authoritative in exposition match up with the rest of our perceptions.Tolkien was an enormously talented intelligent and imaginative man one whose stories though unpolished by experience still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. Jackson's movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkien's stories and placed it in a visual medium a place where fans of LOTR could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course Tolkien's story is imperfect of course Jackson's movies aren't as full as we wish them to be. Their great successes are that they still manage to capture our imagination to move us to take genuine truth and isolate it in a world outside our ken a place where we see ourselves better against a foreign backdrop. Both have created and done so masterfully with the intuitive grasp that is termed genius. Tolkien would have had much at issue with Jackson's movies where plot incongruities lapsed character development and visual splendor overshadow the philological and melancholic overtones of his book. Jackson admits he finds much at issue with Tolkien's book including a lack of clear character motivation extended and largely extraneous dialog and heightened language not suited for Hollywood. But Tolkien despite his perfectionist griping and loathing for any film version of his book would respect Jackson for continuing the act of creation for taking his modernday mythology and spreading it to as many people as possible. Jackson has taken the beauty the scope the complexity the richness and the loss that permeate MiddleEarth and shared those leitmotifs with the world. Tolkien's characteristic niggling would have prevented any such attempt even Jackson's but in the end his heritage lives on in beautifully conceived and executed films.I do not ask others to stifle their opinions of this movie or any other. Indeed continue to express the direst and bleakest of your frustrations with the creative power of others as it may lead you to actually do some creation yourself. Remember though that the great evils of history from Satan to Hitler to Sauron are never capable of creation  only twisting mutilating mocking deforming and misapplying. Be open to the vision of others and what they have to offer especially when that offering comes in the virtuosic shape of Tolkien's writing or Jackon's movies. Look for the True in the Secondary and how it manifests itself everywhere once you recognize it.This movie receives a 10 from me because it not only maintains incredible faithfulness to Tolkien's themes and yes events may deviate in completely separate and dissimilar media but it asks intelligent viewers to look deeper into the circumstances of its own creation and beauty. From the loyalty of Sam and the weight of epic history to the sacrifice of Arwen and the nevercompletelywon nature of war Jackson's movies capture the essence and heart of Tolkien's tale with the benefit of the director's own imaginative fruit as well. The world owes Mr. Jackson its gratitude as he has created another world and another reality that so many can do and will cherish.One final word There are few who would not rather be wandering in a far green country rather than dwelling in their own Circles of the World.".

	schema:reviewBody "It takes a miracle for me to go the cinema since smoking is banned in cinema chains but Peter Jackson is a miracle worker . How else would he be able to make me forget my filthy and disgusting nicotine addiction ? He made me forget all about cigarettes for three hours with THE TWO TOWERS and I knew that with RETURN OF THE KING he could make me forget all about ciggies for a record breaking three and a half hours . I booked my ticket for Rothesay winter gardens cinema and sat down to be enthralled!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!I do conclude there are some people in the world who cant see what the fuss is about with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy . My parents seem slightly puzzled that their cynical critical son loves LOTR . Its simply explained  these epic movies arent a childish fantasy  theyre like David Lean filming a Shakespeare play  but I do take onboard the criticism that the story structure of the movies can be irritating . FELLOWSHIP is very stopstart while the action intercutting in TTT can be annoying but ROTK has probably the best pace and structure of the three . ROTK starts with a sequence showing Smeagol murdering his friend in order to get the ring . This gives some needed backstory to Gollum . It also sets up its stall that its not a family film never mind a  childish fantasy  . In fact I predict that many of the children in Rothesay cinema will be having nightmares tonight due to the scenes with that horrible big spider  it made my skin crawl and the woman sitting next to me was gasping out loud as it prepared to cocoon poor Frodo  you should have seen the Q for the toilet after that scene which tells you how convincing the FX are in this movie  nothing appears CGI  Gollum isnt computer generated hes a living being and Peter Jackson doesnt use camera trickery for fight scenes he uses million upon millions of extras . He is David Lean reincarnated . No he is David Lean AND Will Shakespeare reincarnated  look at the way the cast act their parts  its like theyre appearing in the greatest play of the bard . Their performances are superlativeThere are some flaws . I did mention the script gives background to Smeagol but the script  Like the other films in the trilogy  is somewhat uneven . John Nobles character Denethor seems somewhat underwritten and I wasnt sure what his motivation was . Also as everyone else has mentioned the false endings are very irritating . When Aragorn is crowned king and the screen faded to black the audience reached for their Jackets and bags then were shown another scene lasting several minutes which faded to a blaze of music. Everyone reached for their bags and jackets  then another scene which... It would have been better to have seen Aragorn crowned King and then seen Frodo sailing into the distance but I guess after the screenwriters have irritated us with the abrupt endings of the first two movies its somewhat traditional to irritate with the end of the trilogy . These faults I can forgive but there is an unforgivable cop out of having an army of the undead charging to save the race of men from the Orc army at the end . It didnt ruin the movie for me but it just seems so lazy and contrived which stopped me from thinking it was the best movie in the trilogy  its not  FELLOWSHIP is . But still this is a masterpiece of cinema which like cigarettes left me breathless and satisfied and hopefully well see it sweep the Oscar ceremony at lastAs for the Oscars themselves Im puzzled about a couple of things . Howard Shores score is beautiful and haunting but its far from original with much of the music in ROTK reused from FELLOWSHIP  The Gondor theme  and TTT  The Celtic music  while the omissions are even more surprising . No nominations for any of the actors ! I know that all the great performances would cancel each other out but its shameful Andy Serkis wasnt nominated as best supporting actor . Can anyone name a more unlikable baddie than Gollum in recent cinema ? Me neither and no nomination for cinematography ! Ive no idea how John Lesnies camera was able to keep up with the action and he deserved at least a nomination so maybe well see the third instalment robbed on Oscar night like FELLOWSHIP was . Even if it is that doesnt stop me and millions of other film fans from recognising the genuis of Peter Jackson . I bow to you Sir".

	schema:headline " Jackson maintains the quality right to the very end.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Return of the King was possibly the mostanticipated film ever the previous two installments of The Lord of the Rings having instantly ingrained themselves on the movie going public's consciousness. Personally I held little fear that the film would fall victim to the dreaded cinematic condition of sequelitis and fail to live up to expectation. But only the actual release of the movie an agonising year after The Two Towers would remove this uncertainty and fulfill my desire to see on the big screen the end of one of the great stories. As with The Fellowship of the Ring I need not have concerned myself. As a spectacle The Return of the King is by far the most impressive of Peter Jackson's landmark trilogy. Unfortunately like TTT it has flaws but fortunately these are not fatal.Jackson's great triumph is that even with all its CGI wonders his film does not neglect its characters in particular the relationships between Gandalf and Pippin Eowyn and Theoden and of course Frodo and Sam. Each resonates in the memory. Even in the midst of battle Jackson focuses on the people into which he has invested so much time and care. It's a shame Hollywood in general is blind to the possibility of overwhelming spectacle coexisting with the human element of cinema. The intercutting between the battle in front of the Black Gate and the desperate struggles at the Crack of Doom is just stunning with the expressions on the faces of the each of the Fellowship members underlining what a tourdeforce of storytelling this movie is. The relationship of Frodo and Sam becomes the centrepiece of the movie more and more as it goes on. This is the way it should be because their parting at the Grey Havens is the last act of the story. Jackson shows that his sensitivity to Tolkien is still there in spite of the harsh verdicts of many who disapprove of the changes from book to film. Ironically the clamour of too many endings by those who hadn't read the book demonstrates why the earlier changes had to be made.A lot of story had to go into this movie but this is necessary for the following reasons. In TTT there is a convenient pause in the story between Helm's Deep and the Isengard reunion. After Pippin looks into the Palantir the momentum is unbroken in the FotR movie until the end of the great battle inside and outside Minas Tirith. Thus a great deal of TTT book narrative was still to be shown because the movie of TTT left out many of the last chapters. There was no place for the Voice of Saruman chapter at the end of TTT because in cinematic terms it would have been too anticlimactic but more about that later. Also Jackson really has no option but to put Frodo's and Sam's fights with Shelob and the battles for Gondor at the same stage of the movie. This makes so much more sense than separating them and having to handle a buildup in tension then the Shelob fight then another tension buildup before the great battle for Gondor. The structure of the movie would have been too cumbersome. Anyway when Tolkien's chronology in the appendices is read you realise both events happen at nearly the same time.The worst consequence of the packing of so much narrative into this movie is the underwritten character of Denethor. He is totally unsympathetic which is a mistake because in the book he is much more interesting. Jackson should have found a way to include Denethor's struggle with Sauron through the Palantir because this is the real reason for Denethor's madness. In this film the cause is his grief over Boromir's death which also partly explains his treatment of Faramir but this sells the character of Denethor short. Not only that but also the death of Denethor is perhaps Jackson's worst error of judgement. The fiery 100 yard dash and plunge over the edge is just ridiculous.There is nothing wrong with the arrival of the Army of the Dead to win the battle but its just not as stirring as the end of Helm's Deep battle. The high point of RotK's battles is the charge of the Rohirrim and their fight against the Mumakil ie giant elephants which tends to make the actual of end of the battle a let down. Wisely Jackson does not focus on the green tide washing over Sauron's hordes instead he cuts back to Miranda Otto's wonderfully passionate portrayal of Eowyn killing the WitchKing then throws in the nowfamous singlehanded bringing down of a mumakil by who else? Legolas of course.No discussion of this movie should neglect the Extended Edition DVD. Possibly the greatest flaw in the theatrical version of RotK is the omission of the Voice of Saruman scene and insertion of a silly misleading line of Gandalf that Saruman had lost his power. But unfortunately as with the omission of the sons of Denethor scene at Osgiliath in TTT the scene breaks the flow of the movie too much and given the three hour plus running time this decision was understandable. As with TTT Jackson is given a get out of jail card by the EE on which Saruman's demise can be seen for the first time. I am sorry to say that I was not as generally impressed by the RotK EE as I was by the EEs of FotR and TTT. Jackson is too selfindulgent with Gimli's character. In the theatrical version of RotK I didn't mind these gags but in the Paths of the Dead scene in particular I found that Gimli's antics spoiled the mood of horror and dread that should have been maintained. All of that being said the EE still deserves the highest recommendation. It adds many important details such as Eowyn and Faramir falling in love. The LotR movie experience is incomplete without it.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Return of the King was possibly the mostanticipated film ever the previous two installments of The Lord of the Rings having instantly ingrained themselves on the movie going public's consciousness. Personally I held little fear that the film would fall victim to the dreaded cinematic condition of sequelitis and fail to live up to expectation. But only the actual release of the movie an agonising year after The Two Towers would remove this uncertainty and fulfill my desire to see on the big screen the end of one of the great stories. As with The Fellowship of the Ring I need not have concerned myself. As a spectacle The Return of the King is by far the most impressive of Peter Jackson's landmark trilogy. Unfortunately like TTT it has flaws but fortunately these are not fatal.Jackson's great triumph is that even with all its CGI wonders his film does not neglect its characters in particular the relationships between Gandalf and Pippin Eowyn and Theoden and of course Frodo and Sam. Each resonates in the memory. Even in the midst of battle Jackson focuses on the people into which he has invested so much time and care. It's a shame Hollywood in general is blind to the possibility of overwhelming spectacle coexisting with the human element of cinema. The intercutting between the battle in front of the Black Gate and the desperate struggles at the Crack of Doom is just stunning with the expressions on the faces of the each of the Fellowship members underlining what a tourdeforce of storytelling this movie is. The relationship of Frodo and Sam becomes the centrepiece of the movie more and more as it goes on. This is the way it should be because their parting at the Grey Havens is the last act of the story. Jackson shows that his sensitivity to Tolkien is still there in spite of the harsh verdicts of many who disapprove of the changes from book to film. Ironically the clamour of too many endings by those who hadn't read the book demonstrates why the earlier changes had to be made.A lot of story had to go into this movie but this is necessary for the following reasons. In TTT there is a convenient pause in the story between Helm's Deep and the Isengard reunion. After Pippin looks into the Palantir the momentum is unbroken in the FotR movie until the end of the great battle inside and outside Minas Tirith. Thus a great deal of TTT book narrative was still to be shown because the movie of TTT left out many of the last chapters. There was no place for the Voice of Saruman chapter at the end of TTT because in cinematic terms it would have been too anticlimactic but more about that later. Also Jackson really has no option but to put Frodo's and Sam's fights with Shelob and the battles for Gondor at the same stage of the movie. This makes so much more sense than separating them and having to handle a buildup in tension then the Shelob fight then another tension buildup before the great battle for Gondor. The structure of the movie would have been too cumbersome. Anyway when Tolkien's chronology in the appendices is read you realise both events happen at nearly the same time.The worst consequence of the packing of so much narrative into this movie is the underwritten character of Denethor. He is totally unsympathetic which is a mistake because in the book he is much more interesting. Jackson should have found a way to include Denethor's struggle with Sauron through the Palantir because this is the real reason for Denethor's madness. In this film the cause is his grief over Boromir's death which also partly explains his treatment of Faramir but this sells the character of Denethor short. Not only that but also the death of Denethor is perhaps Jackson's worst error of judgement. The fiery 100 yard dash and plunge over the edge is just ridiculous.There is nothing wrong with the arrival of the Army of the Dead to win the battle but its just not as stirring as the end of Helm's Deep battle.

There the race of men must make a last stand before the growing might of an unseen enemy while those visible are more of a threat than ever. The Return of the King in it's way is as much Aragorn's story as it is Frodo's a reluctant noble struggling to find his destiny who comes to accept and eventually embrace it under the tutelage of the White Wizard Gandalf. The subtle subtext of Aragorn's relationship with Lady Arwen of the Elven realm leads to his triumph with no illusions for Eowyn establishing a noble grace and dignity for the new King.Upon my second viewing of the entire trilogy I was surprised at how my attention was continually drawn to the character of Samwise Gamgee Frodo's faithful companion. This in large part to the excellent portrayal by Sean Astin showing a range of emotions throughout the film that proffered him as the most well developed character of the story. He's a loyal friend through thick and thin understanding clearly that by the journey's near end Frodo's mind may no longer be his own.Gimli is another character to keep a close eye on for the understated humor John RhysDavies brings to the story. The personal competition he began with Legolas Orlando Bloom in The Two Towers finds comic resonance here as Legolas brings down a rampaging olyphant on the Pelennor Fields Gimli tempers his congratulations with That still only counts as one  marvelous! With the One Ring destroyed so is Sauron's awesome power and a quest resolved for the fortunes of mankind. The film's multiple endings encapsulate just as many feelings in the viewer those of loyalty honor love sacrifice and friendship. As a unit the Lord of the Rings Trilogy stand as probably the ultimate in cinematic adventure to this point in time. Truly I can only make one suggestion to make the series even more poignant that for a film that reveals the discovery of the One Ring by Bilbo Baggins the basis for the adventure that begins in The Hobbit.".

	schema:reviewBody "The journey comes to an end. For me the final installment ensures that the Lord of the Rings replaces Star Wars as my favourite fantasy movie franchise. In time the film will look dated but the story and characterisation far surpass that of Star Wars. The Empire Strikes Back is the only one of the Star Wars films that is in the same league as LOR.As with Two Towers the Return of the King doesn't recap the story so far so don't even think of seeing this film if you're unfamiliar with the story. It starts with a flashback to Smeagol and means Andy Serkis gets to appear on the finished print. Frodo Sam and Smeagol then continue on their quest whilst the remaining members of the fellowship are briefly reunited at Isengard before taking different paths to Minas Tirith.The action is unrelenting and most people will not notice the running time is over 3 hours. As with the previous films the combination of sets models and cgi brings middle earth to life.I suspect quite a few of the performers will be in with a chance of Oscar recognition. Miranda Otto is the stand out performer and is outstanding as Eowyn and surely deserves the Best Supporting Actress honour. I'm sure that Viggo Mortensen Ian McKellen Elijah Wood Sean Astin and Orlando Bloom will all have their supporters for acting honours and rightly so as they all put in fine performances. I'm not sure whether Andy Serkis is elligable but I suspect the success of SmeagolGollum owes as much to him as the animators. Bernhard Hill should also be in with a shout for recognition for his performance as King Theoden. My guess is that it'll miss out on the acting awards with the exception of Miranda Otto. It's absolutely certain to take Best Director Best Picture and a string of technical awards though. My guess is that it will be nominated for about 12 categories and take 8 gongs.Return of the King isn't flawless however. Saruman was cut entirely from the theatrical release of the film. We therefore missed out on the final face off between Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard. This was certainly filmed and will no doubt be on the extended edition. When the Hobbits return to the Shire it looks remarkably like when they left. No sign that Saruman has arrived back before them and taken over. In the book Merry Pippin Sam and Frodo help rally the rest of the Hobbits to retake the Shire but at some cost to both the hobbits and the environment. Merry Pippin and Sam become heros to the rest of the hobbits who are largely unaware of Frodo's adventure and exploits. I'm not sure if any of this was shot but it would be a welcome addition to the extended addition. Personally I would have followed Tolkien and got rid of 7 minutes of Arwen footage and kept Saruman in. Bearing in mind Christopher Lee's passion for the trilogy it is also sad to see him removed from the final episode. I'm quite sure Peter Jackson must have had a few sleepless nights over that decision.If Saruman's exclusion was the biggest blunder of the film Gimli's consignment to comic interlude was also a bit disappointing. I'm not against a bit of light hearted relief every so often especially in such a long film but it seemed that every time Gimli appeared on screen it was for light entertainment. The That still only counts as one line to Legolas was very funny though.Despite these gripes Peter Jackson can certainly be very proud of the Lord of the Rings. Very few people thought it possible to do justice to the book. He has crafted a film that many people will enjoy for many years.".

Such as aragon's character Viggo Mortensen matchs that style and his emotions were amazing. his fighting style and knowledge makes him a great character and Viggo Mortensen should of good a dozen awards. before this film i never heard of Viggo Mortensen and now after his role i regard him as a brilliant actor.another character who was amazing was gandalf and without him this film would feel empty. sir ian meleken sorry for the spelling mistake his acting was so believable and amazing. but his secret to this as revealed in a episode of extras his that he thought of what it would be like to be a wizard and well that give us the great gandalf we know today! i think this film is the best film i have seen in years and it deserved every award. out of ten i would give this a MASSIVE TEN! thank you!".

Such as aragon's character Viggo Mortensen matchs that style and his emotions were amazing. his fighting style and knowledge makes him a great character and Viggo Mortensen should of good a dozen awards. before this film i never heard of Viggo Mortensen and now after his role i regard him as a brilliant actor.another character who was amazing was gandalf and without him this film would feel empty. sir ian meleken sorry for the spelling mistake his acting was so believable and amazing. but his secret to this as revealed in a episode of extras his that he thought of what it would be like to be a wizard and well that give us the great gandalf we know today! i think this film is the best film i have seen in years and it deserved every award. out of ten i would give this a MASSIVE TEN! thank you!";

It seems oddly paced lacking a rhythm and more importantly lacking the patina of magic that colored the first two. In fact everything seems brighter this time out.Unlike the battle of the second they have decided to not have any movie jokes like the surferwarrior who winks at the camera. But there is still a variety in tone from place to place as if different directors were involved. I suppose that's true.I remarked on the earlier films that they innovated primarily in how they use the vertical dimension. This third film is even more competent and extreme in that regard. They knew it was a discriminator and exploited it. Unfortunately the towers and cities and mountain gates all have an unnatural sameness to them they are photographed with huge vertical sweeps. Even the first ending where everyone bows to the hobbits and there is the obligatory helicopter' shot it goes shockingly far beyond what one expects. The way it pulls back fast and swoops reminds that we are used to an eye that is constrained by the aerodynamics of light helicopters.Not so here. When this is considered in hindsight I'm pretty sure that the high production values won't be noticed that all the effects and conventions here  especially the battle scenes  will be seen as borrowed all except for the exhilarating use of height. That's worth watching. Magic of its own.That magic is enough to carry this project for me. It is clearly Jackson's intent to move his camera in great vertical arcs usually in ways that no physical camera could. That gives us a fantastic eye. Just a few hours later I saw The Lion King' again and noticed that although they were never constrained by physics they always moved the camera' in ways we have seen in ordinary real' films. That's because Lion' wanted to look real while Return' wanted to seem ultrareal.Ian McKellen has always puzzled me he's sort of a working man's John Gielgud an engineer of the spoken word. Here he stoops to Alec Guiness' role. A sad way to cap a career.Ted's Evaluation 3 of 3  Worth watching".

Vastly outnumbered the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes led a Army of well over 100000 Persian king Xerxes before war has about 170000 army men to Greece and was confronted by 300 Spartans 700 Thespians and 400 Thebans. Xerxes waited for 10 days for King Leonidas to surrender or withdraw but left with no options he pushed forward. After 3 days of battle all the Greeks were killed. The Spartan defeat was not the one expected as a local shepherd named Ephialtes defected to the Persians and informed Xerxes that the separate path through Thermopylae which the Persians could use to outflank the Greeks was not as heavily guarded as they thought.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film isn't for all people. That's to say about a lot of movies in general of course but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs?First lets analyze what exactly this film is made of. Basically the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colors the characters the costumes the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of time slowdowns throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air decapitated heads traveling in slowmotion across the screen... it's all there. The story on the other hand isn't very complicated in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. If you would look at the script it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly clich phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it's tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgment about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail every background every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogs are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. I fight for freedom! I'd rather die in honor then live in shame! Sounds familiar? Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it's still lacking in this department so it should be noted.Now that's fine and all but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn't let go. Every battle every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the warshouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.So here's the deal.If you are easily impressed by beautiful landscapes wonderful camerawork and editing and powerful acting then go see this. Right. Now. You'll be missing out if you don't. There is so much to see so much power in the way this comic is translated to the big screen... It'll leave you in awe.However you are looking for a good story clever plot twists some innovating to the world of the movies then skip this. 300 contains nothing of this nor does it wants to give you this. I enjoyed this movie so much but I know there will be people that will pass of as rubbish and that's understandable. Just be sure to make up your mind about what you want to see when you go to the theater yourself instead of being drawn into bias by the tons of reviews this site has to offer.".

	schema:reviewBody "3002007 Review 300 has been given lots of criticism. People like to view in the political way. That is not the way. Here's my take.300 is an entertaining movie. This is all about the action and it's Spartans. The movie takes about the first 30 minutes to give us plot development before the Spartans take it to the battlefield.The action is the key. The slow motion action is what really delivers. This is like a ballet of blood done so nicely. The action needless to say is satisfying. We are given lots of campy dialog and some good humor here and there that works. Gerard Butler is wonderful. He embodies the great king. Becomes him.Now on to the politics 300 has it's own politics but it was also based on a comic book written back in 1998. How can this be a proBush statement? This is just like another Frank Miller picture Sin City. The point is to make the comic book come to life. 300 was written by Frank Miller almost a decade ago and you think this is rightwing propaganda? Listen to me. Take a deep breath and lighten up. Okay? One last thing this movie is NOT a history lesson. This is based on a graphic novel similar to a movie made back in 1962 and is inspired by the battle in 480 B.C. This is not racist either.The Last Word 300 delivers what is was sent out to do. Action. Entertainment. Skin. Ignore the naysayers and enjoy. Excellent popcorn fun.".

The point is to make the comic book come to life. 300 was written by Frank Miller almost a decade ago and you think this is rightwing propaganda? Listen to me. Take a deep breath and lighten up. Okay? One last thing this movie is NOT a history lesson. This is based on a graphic novel similar to a movie made back in 1962 and is inspired by the battle in 480 B.C. This is not racist either.The Last Word 300 delivers what is was sent out to do. Action. Entertainment. Skin. Ignore the naysayers and enjoy. Excellent popcorn fun.";

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that everyone who hated this movie must have written a review so I thought I'd throw in my two cents to even things up a bit. First if you assume every movie is made simply to uppercut some sort of ideology into the audience's chest then yes it does seem very racist xenophobic and the like. However this film is based on a freakin' comic book! The Spartans were some of the most skilled nastiest nationalistic fighters out there and certainly had reason to be more driven and nationalistic than Persia's which was not an army of individuals fighting for their land and families. Should they have been portrayed differently simply to satisfy the current political climate? Are you mad? The cheesy oneliners are also evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. The exaggerated characters is further evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. This is not a historical movie it is a movie which seeks to put a rockstar noholdsbarred spin on a particular historical event. It isn't attempting to be accurate or balanced or anything of the sort and it SHOULDN'T because that isn't it's purpose. It shouldn't be obligated to do anything of the sort. It's ENTERTAINMENT. Nothing more. And it's damn good entertainment in my opinion.Every scene is beautifully crafted. I found the slowdown to be stylistic and much of the dialogue which is apparently cheesy and fascist to everyone else to be at least somewhat inspiring and certainly engaging. These Spartans were trained their entire lives to be warriors their entire culture is built around success in battle and you don't expect them to be quite skilled much more so than a slave army and quite patriotic? Also this movie was from the point of view of the Spartans. How would this army have appeared to the Spartans? Wouldn't their stories now be overexaggerated oversimplified almost legendary? There isn't a great amount of character development because this movie is about a battle ONE battle THE battle for the continuance of the Western world and yes IF the Spartans had been simply overwhelmed from the start and if their Athenian allies hadn't completely CRUSHED the much larger Persian navy at sea the West simply could not have existed in any similar manner as it has. And yes the Western world is guilty of arrogance overextending it's boundaries to the point of imperialism however it has given our world a plethora of alltooimportant philosophical ideals that are simply irreplaceable if we want to live in a free society.I realize I spent a great deal of my time being critical of other reviews so I would like to take the time to apologize for perhaps wasting the time of someone who was simply searching for a detailed point of view on the film. I can assure you that the film is actionpacked. The scenes are absolutely beautiful every one of them. The film is gory but artistically gory if that makes any sense. You'll know what I mean. The story is simple direct and inspiring. The acting is excellent. The movie overall was a tremendous experience. I give it a 9.".

All the people are exactly the same and you could notice a lack of preparation on the scenes. I was expecting something like troy or braveheart which are too damn good to compare with this. This is why Hollywood is in the ruin. Another expensive and terrible movie. I watched 23 with jim carrey and thought I could not watch a worse movie than that.

	schema:headline " Shallow characters. Ignorant representations. A stupid movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll be looking at three specific areas of the film historical inaccuracy representational issues and a general critique based on filmmaking.Once established that a film is fictional in other words not historically accurate it shouldn't matter whether it is accurate or not. However the way the filmmakers deal with that abstracting of reality can disturb those who are knowledgeable about the subject or who are simple keen on common sense. In other words certain choices don't make sense don't seem valid within the context of the fiction or perhaps gear themselves more towards lowculture languagesymbolism ie Hollywood clichs. When information is taken from in this case the historically realistic it still must be reassembled in valid manner. If you add a talking dragon to a King Arthur movie there should be some explanation as to why it is there and if it breathes flying sheep instead of fire then it contradicts the common conception of a dragon. Ultimately it comes down to an intelligent use of elements that are abstracted from reality.One of my problems with 300 is that I think it did a poor job of doing this. The fact that there's monsters and fictional creatures in the story is fine. What isn't fine are things like dull blades that can cut a man's leg clean off in one swing men who fight with a cross between WWE and matrixstyle fighting a dude eating a random red apple after a fight other random choices that don't make sense Japanese masks on the Persian soldiers etc. In Kill Bill the Hansu sword didn't bother me when it cut off limb after limb because there was a valid explanationpremise behind it. In 300 you get this huge abstraction of the phalanx running barechested through a bluescreened field throwing spears and magically killing thousands of men. In the large picture of 300 the fighting wasn't that bad the Spartan soldiers would get hurt and there weren't many Chuck Norrislike BS moments. But I was not moved by any of it. There was no technique behind it.As for the representational issues I've heard many points and counter points that it is a huge insult to Iran and Persian culture that the film is only based on a comic book so this doesn't matter that white people are the good guys and blacks and Arabs are the bad guys etc. It all comes down to this this is a Hollywood specifically Warner Bros picture. One good thing about modern Hollywood is that they cater to the mass audience and thus are usually considerate about race issues and whatnot. It is their responsibility. This film was extremely extremely ignorant in its defamation of PersianIranian culturehistory and its use of race in good vs evil. It does not matter what was in the comic book. Frank Miller can write whatever he wants in a comic book because it is a very abstract medium that is taken for granted as cartoonish. When Warner Bros. decides to ADAPT this comic into a live film it is an entirely different deal. They had to realize all these hidden and obvious implications and how ignorant and insulting it is. This film singlehandedly mocks millions millions of people. WB could have adapted any comic book into a film any of Miller's other works. It was just a bad move to make this film and that's all there is to it. No one could argue that an alternative script selection could have turned out worse. Nevertheless 300 was made.As for Iranians I've heardseen some reasonable negative reactions and some unreasonable uneducated reactions. I honestly don't think that most Iranians have the knowledge required of the film industry in order to properly assess a film such as in this situation. Most Americans don't even. But ultimately there was no reason for them to receive this stupid insult of 300 and I feel ashamed to be in any way associated with it.Getting to the more technical critique of the film there was WAY too much post production the writing and actor direction were HORRIBLE there was zero character development onedimensional everything everything was a caricature with no followable emotional track or realism and so forth. The speeding up and slowing down of the film tried to emphasize certain actions and imbue it with drama or power but instead was distracting and amateurish. EVERY single shot was overcolorcorrected and looked like crap it was so obvious to tell. The acting consisted of a few extremely clich hypermasculine dramatic speeches stealing from every epic film ranging from Braveheart to Last Samurai. The actors ONLY yelled. There was a scene where one soldier cried but this added nothing. No one cared when people died because no one grew to know any of the characters. They only showed one side of themselves they were caricatures. The actual content of their lines was disgraceful and rested at a 5th grade reading level. The director's choice to make the characters like football players or wrestlers instead of increasing the power of the characters made them incredibly fake and ineffective whereas giving them moments of desperation doubt or any other realistic emotion could have lended to making them more powerful. Imagine one of the last scenes in Braveheart where Mel Gibson is being tortured in public. Now imagine him having been a total emotionless Ahole the whole film and instead of yelling freedom in a last cry he yells it like a football player who doesn't give a crap. That was what 300 was like.Anyway I felt obligated to write against this film though I never usually write reviews. I originally gave it a 6 because it didn't seem that bad but am lowering it to a 4 because of the actual HARM it is doing to other people.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film last week and I couldn't put into words what I saw. This film was so mortifyingly awful that I needed time to find words to really describe it. The words I came up with are insane racist homophobic misogynistic gratuitously violent and not at all entertaining. I thought to myself that this will be the film viewed by a disturbed teenager who plans on doing the next Columbine type of murder. Not only is the story bad but I also hated the fact that I felt like I was looking at a Playstation video game for two hours. Every scene was filled with this flat boring drearylooking coppercolor. The music is so clich that I could have hummed it in my sleep. I rolled my eyes every moment the operalike singing started. The viewer is suppose to be rooting for the Spartans but because they come across as bloodthirsty psychopaths who were only put on earth for battle I found myself rooting against them. Yes war and violence are apart of life but the realistic human emotions that are a result of war makes movies about the subject matter fascinating i.e. Braveheart and Gladiator two great films. This film cares nothing about story and human emotions. All this film cares about is showing spears go inside and then back out of a human body with blood splattered about and clich dialogue in between. Even beheadings are played out as if the only result the filmmaker is going for are the three words that was cool! I didn't understand why the leader of the Persian side the mascara and piercing faced Xerxes had to come off as a mix between Rupaul and Bam Bam Bigelow. The reverberated voice that they used for the character was distracting and unnecessary. Also I kept wondering why Xerxes kept using the words kneel in front of me to the leader of the Spartans and in one scene Xerxes places his hands on the leader of the Spartans in a way that seemed sexual. It was just plain weird and unnecessary!From the casting the viewer thinks that the enemy Persians are nothing more than effeminate Asians and other dark people of the earth that are trying to bring down the tough and ripped bodied white male Spartans that are outnumbered.The one woman in the film came across as a fool that is so easily deceived and deceived into having sex! that her only salvation is to stab her enemy with a sword. Of course her enemy conveniently carried around Persian coins that fell all over the place when he was stabbed this conveniently showed us in a spoonfed way that this guy is a trader. No thinking allowed in this movie!! The only other use for the female character in this film is a ridiculous soft core sex scene. Instead of this movie just coming off as a fantasy it takes itself way too seriously and as a result I kept shaking my head at the blatant stupidity. In Kill Bill Quentin Tarantino plays out a scene with Uma Thurman defeating a bunch of ninjas in a way where the viewer is disconnected from reality but is in awe of the cinematic technique of the film. In 300 when the 300 Spartans are defeating a gazillion enemies you could almost hear the director saying These guys are so tough that this could REALLY happen.... until the end of the movie that is.Actors are not necessary for this film. It is as if the casting director went to Gold's Gym for the casting. Pectoral muscles get the screen time that isn't taken by spears and blood. Even the stale jokes told by the Spartans seem like the brainless banter of a stereotypical gym rat. 300 is an experiment in digital popart cinema gone wrong! Unlike popart cinema like A Scanner Darkly that advances visual aesthetic by saying something about the human condition through its story 300 is a let down via story and visually. The entire outcome of the film leaves the viewer asking in a confused tone What was the point of that?".

Of course her enemy conveniently carried around Persian coins that fell all over the place when he was stabbed this conveniently showed us in a spoonfed way that this guy is a trader. No thinking allowed in this movie!! The only other use for the female character in this film is a ridiculous soft core sex scene. Instead of this movie just coming off as a fantasy it takes itself way too seriously and as a result I kept shaking my head at the blatant stupidity. In Kill Bill Quentin Tarantino plays out a scene with Uma Thurman defeating a bunch of ninjas in a way where the viewer is disconnected from reality but is in awe of the cinematic technique of the film. In 300 when the 300 Spartans are defeating a gazillion enemies you could almost hear the director saying These guys are so tough that this could REALLY happen.... until the end of the movie that is.Actors are not necessary for this film. It is as if the casting director went to Gold's Gym for the casting. Pectoral muscles get the screen time that isn't taken by spears and blood. Even the stale jokes told by the Spartans seem like the brainless banter of a stereotypical gym rat. 300 is an experiment in digital popart cinema gone wrong! Unlike popart cinema like A Scanner Darkly that advances visual aesthetic by saying something about the human condition through its story 300 is a let down via story and visually. The entire outcome of the film leaves the viewer asking in a confused tone What was the point of that?";

Obviously it is easier and convenient to imply that Greece won against Persia at the naval battle of Artemisium. But guess what historically the Greeks lost that naval battle as well. Obviously it is easier to define bravery as 300 Spartans warriors fighting against a million Persians. But guess what they were more like 10000 Spartans Athenians Thebans Thespians and Phoceans against 200000 Persians. Obviously it is easier to represent Xerxs the first as a giant homosexual piercing adept. But guess what he was more like a sophisticated Persian and also a great military strategist. Obviously it is easier to make War and Killing the glorious thing a nation could ever accomplish. But guess what there is no Glory in War and Killing. Only Death Obviously it is easier to make a baseless action movie rather than a real epic peplum. An action movie staged in an imaginary Time and Place with imaginary heroes and villains.

Some of us cheer at the slick fighting scenes and rejoice when Zack Snyder's camera abuses slow motions in order for the audience to enjoy the slaughtering. But for me that was the paroxysm of emptiness and the moment I felt lectured by a mediocre director as to why violence racism sadism are surprisingly virtues to be cherished. Some of us raise their arms in the air and wave at the ripped muscled Spartan men. But for me those leather pants Greek Warriors fighting thousands of ninjas almost died of ridicule. Some of us enjoy metal music mixed with Gladiatoresque chants. But for me it was noise and a sign that the film triggers 15 year old disturbed American boys who think Leonidas is a brand of chocolate and Xerxs an upcoming video game. It's fine to make movies out of comics. It's fine to make violent films. It's also fine to use CGI in order to display thing you could not without. Eventually it is fine to fantasy an historical period. But make no mistake there is nothing groundbreaking or breathtaking in 300. As there is no soul in this film only fleshAs there are no story only eventsAs there is no cinematography only computerized backgroundAs there is no feeling only fading impressionThis is virtual at its worst. What's best to erase a virtual film? I suggest we all make a virtual fire in our mind in which we'll burn 300. And maybe the flames will be so big it will enlighten Hollywood once and for all...".

	schema:reviewBody "In a word disappointment.I was one of the fanboys who loved the graphic novel and watched the trailer on repeat for months. I'm half Greek and love action and comics so I was superbly amped. Sadly the movie fell so short of the mark that I was immediately reminded of how I felt after watching Star Wars Episode I for the first time. I left it thinking I liked it? It was good? Right? But I knew that it wasn't. Here are some of the ups and downs.Let's start with what's good in the feature. The battle scenes are spectacular. The choreography didn't hinge on speed as much as it relied on visually stunning artistic brutality it sounds like an oxymoron but it applies in this context. The timing during these scenes was unique too. The motion sped up and slowed down in a way that really complimented the film. Of course the entire movie is a mindblowing visual experience The art direction and cinematography were stunning. This is especially true of the costuming and creature effects. My favorite aspect of the art direction was this profound grittiness manifested in the dirt bloodshed contrast and other details that were brought forth because of the filming technique that almost became a character in itself contributing to the harshness of the plot. All these things were simply standout.Now for the reasons I gave this film 3 out of 10 stars. The plot aspect of this film was practically nonexistent. In terms of character development not only was it predictable but almost tragic that they didn't pursue other avenues. I especially mean this when referring to the Queen Gorgo subplot that wasn't bound by Miller's original concept. There were a variety of plot holes including but not limited to the end of Gorgo's subplot in which it's revealed that a traitor was carrying evidence of his crimes on him for what we can assume was the entire movie when there's no plausible reason as to why he'd be carrying the evidence. Given the precious little plot in the film it's sad to say that any plot holes exist. The acting was pretty terrible spare the less demanding guttural shouting of the Spartan warriors but I can't really fault the actors given that the writing was so so painfully bland. Even when there was a rallying morale boosting speech as is a staple for these films it was so upsettingly clich' that I found it agitating to watch. What was most troubling was that the entire movie was seasoned in an alltoblatant hypernationalism. It was hard to enjoy this film without examining it from a modern context because of the frequent use of the word freedom. It was being thrown around like it was conservative talk radio. At one point one of the characters even said freedom isn't free. I have no problem if filmmakers wish to make patriotism a theme in their film indeed the historic events lend nicely to such a theme. However they did it so straightforwardly that it dumbed the movie down a great deal. And yes the Spartans founded the term laconic but they were at least witty. Had it been more subtle or brought about in a more refined way as opposed to the hero simply spouting about freedom and its virtues repeatedly throughout the film then it probably would've contributed a great deal to the movie.All in all this has a lot to offer in terms of eyecandy. But it has so little substance that it's aggravating to watch. Something didn't click and it's apparent. It feels like they could've done more with it. That's why it's aggravating. That's why it's a disappointment.".

For hypothesis' sake let's take a journey into Gerard Butler's mind after reading the script Hmm okay sounds pretty much like a gory battle film to me. There isn't much of a story but the public these days really seems to be into epic war movies probably with the war in Iraq and 911 and all. Now some of the scenes especially those at the beginning remind me of something I learned in history class I think it had something to do with Hitler and survival of the fittest. I don't really endorse these values but the film seems to. Well I'm only a second rate actor and I haven't had my big success yet so maybe taking on the role of Leonidas might be a good idea and an excellent career move since the film is provocative to say the least and even if it turns out to be a bad movie with fascist tendencies people will still talk about me. And all these months at the gym will finally pay off because I get to show my sexy body throughout the entire movie. I won't be wearing much accept for some briefs made of leather and a red cape around my neck. The text isn't too hard either I don't have to act much all they want me to do is shout and shout in a belligerent way like the warmonger I see on TV all the time. Yeah I think I'll give my agent a call. There's nothing good on TV so what the heck let's do this flick. To the film itself After twenty minutes into the movie I got bored. A juxtaposition of battle scenes monsters that looked like prototypes from the LORD OF THE RINGS and a more than stupid side story with King Leonidas wife and some gossamer thin malice spun by a third rate playwright. Whether this film endorses fascism or not doesn't really matter because this film boils down to one simple adjective stupid!".

	schema:reviewBody "In the year 480 BC King Xerxes of Persia set in motion his enormous slave empire to crush the small group of independent Greek states  the only stronghold of freedom still remaining in the then known world. As the countless armies of Xerxes approaches King Leonidas petitions the ruling council to meet the army with whatever men can be found. With the council unwilling to release soldiers until after the religious festival Leonidas sets out with his 300 strong personal army to meet Xerxes' men at a narrow pass knowing they must hold off the approach for as long as they can until the army arrives even if it means their deaths.Although I am surprised to see this film so highly rated on IMDb I can understand why it is so because it does deliver a powerful experience almost powerful enough to carry it through its lack of real depth or substance. You can see the selling point on the DVD cover or the poster because it is in these places where any film visually has to sell itself. With 300 though this selling continues across the entire film because holding close to the graphic novel roots the visual design is the all here. The plot is simple and although there is a little bit of politicing back home the film is all about the stand of the 300 against countless others. In this regard it is visceral violent and visually stunning. The mix of effects with live action brings the action to live and is as suitably overblown as the legend.Snyder's direction matches the effects and he wallows in every macho swing of the sword doing really well to capture the action in a way that is engaging and clear. The lack of substance was a bit of a problem but to be honest the film does sweep you along in the moment of the battle and mostly this is all you care about. The cast don't really have characters so much as presence and mostly they deliver in this area. Butler is strong in the lead and he convinces in the role of Leonidas. Headley and West have the harder job back home to provide some interest in the politics behind the battle  they do well enough particularly The Wire's West but I'm biased but the script does rather leave them to their own devices. The rest of the cast are appropriately muscular and heroic and fit in with what the script is trying to do.Overall this is an effective but superficial film. The design and the look is the all but fortunately it delivers in this regard really well. The performances the script and everything else falls into line in supporting the graphic novel feel of the film and although I would like to say I favour substance over style it is hard not to like when the style is this well done.".

But how can you make a new moviefor the audience to likewithout recycling old material? AnswerYou improve what old filmmakers couldn'tGraphics. Ben HurBraveheartGladiatorSpartacus and perhaps even Troy are only some of the epic movies that gave the audience so big thrills that they cannot be repeated. Almost every epic movie that will be made todayno matter how good the story will be or how faithful will be to realityis bound to repeat itself.We got examples from Alexander and Kingdom of Heaven. 300 doesn't apply to this category.Besides it takes the epic to the next level.And more are like to follow. Just like in the Lord of the Ringsmuch CGI was used here. The result? This movie was a pleasure for the eye. All the camera work and graphics exceeded my expectations. I thought they were comparableif not betterto the LOTRgo see for yourselves.I could write something about the plot or the actors's outstanding performancesespecially Gerard Butler's..you seebeing GreekItalianI wanted the best from the actors..Butler gave it. The anger in his eyesthe fury in his voice and the violence in his actions really reminded an ancient Greek kingbut I won't ruin it for you. You must see it to understand how great this movie is.But always remember that this is a movie that is based on a graphic novel and is by no means a faithful depiction of what really happened in Thermopylae in 480 B.C. All those who will pay the ticket to see this moviemust be prepared not for a historic moviebut for a stylish battle movie. This movietogether with the LOTRis the entrance to the 21st century's new epic movies. Kudos to Zack Snyderwho came from nowhere and hasalready from Dawn of the Deadproved that he is a brilliant and capable director. We will surely see more of him in the upcoming years.Soyou read my Comment?Aren't you curious? What are you waiting for?Run to the nearest cinemasee this piece of art and when you are finished don't forget to come to IMDb to vote. This movie is destined to be at least in the top 100.C'mon people!Hail for 300the Evolution of Epic Battles!".

I thought they were comparableif not betterto the LOTRgo see for yourselves.I could write something about the plot or the actors's outstanding performancesespecially Gerard Butler's..you seebeing GreekItalianI wanted the best from the actors..Butler gave it. The anger in his eyesthe fury in his voice and the violence in his actions really reminded an ancient Greek kingbut I won't ruin it for you. You must see it to understand how great this movie is.But always remember that this is a movie that is based on a graphic novel and is by no means a faithful depiction of what really happened in Thermopylae in 480 B.C. All those who will pay the ticket to see this moviemust be prepared not for a historic moviebut for a stylish battle movie. This movietogether with the LOTRis the entrance to the 21st century's new epic movies. Kudos to Zack Snyderwho came from nowhere and hasalready from Dawn of the Deadproved that he is a brilliant and capable director. We will surely see more of him in the upcoming years.Soyou read my Comment?Aren't you curious? What are you waiting for?Run to the nearest cinemasee this piece of art and when you are finished don't forget to come to IMDb to vote. This movie is destined to be at least in the top 100.C'mon people!Hail for 300the Evolution of Epic Battles!";

	schema:headline " That comic book movie like Sin City with Greeks";
	schema:reviewBody "From a visual perspective 300 is something of a masterpiece. But movies aren't supposed to be visual masterpiecesthey're supposed to have decent dialogue story and substance to back it up. That is what separates good movies from bad ones that look good.I've had my months leading up to the movie and afterwards of trashing this movie for not only its historical inaccuracies but it's ridiculous treatment of basic logic. Nowhere else can you see 300 naked men bellow at two massive elephants and send them toppling off a cliff or a single naked man kill a charging rhino with little more than a flimsy wooden spear.Everything in 300 save for a scene with horses was filmed in a warehouse against green or bluescreen and while it makes for some visual spectacles it removes a certain grittiness from it that fails to capture the audience and thrust them right in the midst of the action.Another major failing is the Spartans themselves. The key to any superhero comic movie because these Spartans can't be human is for the hero to be endearing to the audience. The director appears to have completely fumbled this by making the main characters incredibly arrogant intolerant and smug while giving them anachronistic ideals of freedom and liberty like a Roman Emperor preaching equality for all men which rather than preach they bellow at one another.Rarely does Leonidas say anything that isn't shrieked in the most bellicose manner possible. His lines range in depth and complexity from SPARTAAAAANS! PUSH! SPARTAAAAAANS!! PREPARE FOR GLOOOORY!! SPARTAAAANS! WE WILL STAND AND FIGHT!!! By failing to endear and arrogance I refer to several scenes including when Leonidas first meets Ephialtes. In history Ephialtes was a normal goat herder or farmer who betrayed the Greeks by revealing to Xerxes a goat path leading around the pass out of greed. In the movie he's a horribly deformed monster akin to a mix of Gollum from LOTR and Joe Merrick the Elephant Man with a heart of gold seeking to prove himself in battle. His effort to hoist a shield and thrust a spear is almost heartwarming in its attempts yet Leonidas haughtily says that since he can't raise his shield high enough for long enough he can't fight in a phalanx which is particularly ironic since the Spartans never fight in a phalanx in the entire movie save for the first battlethe director Zack Snyder even admitted doing away with the phalanx because it wasn't cool enough for his movie thrusting Ephialtes into a griefridden rage which causes him to betray the Spartans rather than help them.Leonidas also very arrogantly mocks his Phokian allies for not being born to kill like the Spartans are.A lot of movie crossover appears to happen as Ephialtes very much resembles Gollum in Lord of the Rings so too the Persian Immortals must have been dug up in Isengard like the Urukhai in LOTRthey are not human and look very much like Orcs. And the Uber Immortal as it was so brilliantly labeled was little more than a thinner more muscular cave troll.Whatever humanity is left in the film is squandered for the more machismo audience. Queen Gorgo's role is little more than to look like a frumpy 50 year old housewife muttering about some incomprehensible thing or other while another Spartan attempts to court her. Before Leonidas leaves he treats the audience to a sex scene so dull and lifeless that it amounts to little more than a CG dry humping with Gorgo. The end of this subplot culminates in the Spartan who has been flirting with her getting stabbed in the public forum while gold coins fly in the air and everyone bellows TRAITOR TRAITOR TRAITOR TRAITOR!!!!!To the battle scenes As mentioned above Zack Snyder admitted to doing away with the phalanx because it wasn't cool. So rather than attempt to give the audience something new innovative and unbelievably bloody and violent he gives us the same old glorified onemanarmy crap we've seen in a dozen action movies. CG or not there's little innovation or anything to impress with the action scenes. Many times you're left laughing or shaking your head in disbelief as the fighters go out of their way to look cool rather than deadly. One case in particular is when a Persian Immortal has a clear shot at a Spartan and chooses rather than to stab his naked chest to drop his weapon and DROPKICK him.At some point you get overwhelmed with the Spartans sticking Persians with their spears like hot knives through margarine and giant waves of bodies keeling onto a wave of Immortals and quite literally random slowmotion sequences showing off how close a hurled axe cuts Leonidas' helmet plume or how many rope fibers are at the end of a Persian's whip or how many beads of sweat drip down the bronzed and chiseled chest of a Spartan. Okay we get it! You have a 100 million dollar budget to spend on CG and you don't know how to show it off! There's little else going for the movie other than nonstop and often senseless action violence which gets excessive broken only by the lonely and useless subplot with Gorgo looking frumpy and Spartan 2 forcibly kissing her. Even if you were to look past the unbearably significant historical inaccuracies and the gaping holes in logic like how 300 Spartans march off to battle without any supplies no food or water or baggage train with nothing but their capes shortshorts spears helmets and shields it amounts to little more than an action yarn and a visual mess of action and sunsetcolored landscape little else from dialogue and script acting even sound make it distinct in any sort of way. I doubt many people in years to come would remember this as any more than That comic book movie like Sin City with Greeks".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is awful and it had NOTHING to do with the violence like for many. I am a movie fanatic and I am most specifically a history fanatic. My fav. movies are time pieces. My fav. show on television is easily Rome. I can't tell you how excited I was about this movie. Unfortunately it was utterly awful.1. I DON'T CARE HOW VIOLENT IT WAS that is not my gripe.2. I DON'T care how historic it was. Most movies fall far short of what really happened...I get that. That is also not my gripe.3. The dialogue was bar none pathetic. The worst i have seen in ages. People were laughing at the lines that many here have already made fun of. I rolled my eyes at least 10 times. tonight we dine in hell takes the cake.4. How many times must we see the king shout to get his point across. It's supposed to be a Braveheart moment with the whole Freeeeeeeeeeedom but never once is it effective. It's not effective because he does it a dozen times and he does it in moments where it's not needed. We also don't care about him or his gang of suicidal warriors like we did William Wallace and his men. Why? Simple. the character development is terribly hollow. They force it on you that Spartans can't afford to be emotional. Okay...and because of that just realize every time you try to have your over the top powerhouse inspirational moments they're not going to affe4ct us the same way as say in a Braveheart...because William Wallace WAS emotional...and we related to him...and cared about him and we felt for him when he suffered loss...but in this movie...you don't allow us to gravitate to these characters. Bantering back and forth in play while they chop peoples heads off is simply not going to warm us to these people so that the inspirational moments have ANY affect. Like when the Captain's son is beheaded. In most movies your heart would be torn out in sorrow for the guy...but in this movie...it's just another head hitting the ground. They want to pull on your emotional strings but they never pull it off anywhere and it's all in the setup and how much of a testosterone induced farce they set this up to be. It needed to have the dramatic pull of a Braveheart...a Gladiator...it had the storyline potential to give us that but they butcher it from moment one and it's impossible to take ANYTHING serious.5. The Persian king was pathetic. everything about him. he wasn't scary he wasn't to be taken serious...he was a farce who liked to wear women's makeup. AWFUL. And how they did his voice so that he was to seem godlike...AWFUL. he seemed like a fruitcake...nothing more. i am nice. I will show them I am nice. that is when I said that's it...Im out of here.There was nothing to like about this movie...not a thing. I went in expecting it to be my fav. movie of the year bar none...and i actually walked out with 20 or so minutes to go. What a joke. I'll now go give it a 110 and the 1 is for the fact it was just under 2 hrs. if you're going to make an awful movie make sure it is under 2 hrs please. They did so they get 1 star instead of zero. Oh wait...there is no zero. My decision is even easier now.".

His movie here tells us the story of Sparta and King Leonidas who worked as a role model in terms of bravery for many later conquerors. The cast includes many big names you can check these in the list but today almost 10 years later Michael Fassbender appears probably as the most prominent name. My favorite character however was certainly Rodrigo Santoro's Xerxes who is pretty memorable here thanks to his size and wickedness.Unfortunately in terms of the story I was not convinced particularly. There were some scenes I liked such as the beginning everything with Xerxes the disfigured Gollum lookalike and also Headey's speech and final scene. I may be a bit biased as historic films except 20th century are not exactly my preferred choice especially if they include mostly action and battle scenes like this one. Visually it's a fine film but there were several occasions during which it dragged in terms of the story. I may have been more generous with my rating if Snyder had kept it more essential maybe at 85 minutes. Yes it would have been pretty short but that's a price I am willing to pay if it turns into a much better film. At almost 2 hours it lacks focus several times and I cannot recommend it.".

	schema:headline " Talk to Pin";
	schema:reviewBody "Pin is a quiet unsettling movie a horror of the mind.  Strongly resembling Psycho Pin still manages to stand on it's own as a deeply disturbing psychodrama.  Leon and Ursula are the children of ice cold parents mother is a frigid neat freak father is a distant man who cannot even tell his own children about the facts of life.  Instead he has Pin do it for him.Pin is a lifesized medical mannequin covered like the furniture in their home with a sheath of seethrough plastic.  Father brings Pin to life with ventriloquy.  Ursula knows it's a dummy but Leon believes Pin is real. Leon is a 1980s version of Norman Bates. He hates his parents but yet he grows to be very much like them distant cold always neat and clean and dressed like a department store mannequin. The irony here is brilliant. He has no friends but for his sister and Pin.  When their parents die in a freak car accident Leon shows some signs of rebellion ripping the plastic off the furniture and not cleaning the kitchen after a messy dinner.  But the rebellion is short lived when Leon brings Pin into the house to live with them.  David Hewlett as Leon is excellent so sad and lost one moment that you simply want to hug him so vicious and psychotically frightening the next that you want to run the hell away from him as far and as fast as you can. Cyndy Preston as Ursula is one of the most likable characters I've seen in a long time.  She is a genuinely sweet person compassionate and kind and she loves her brother dearly even though she realizes that he is a paranoid schizophrenic.  She is the only one who manages to escape from the cold prison her parents have made for them both.  Leon hopelessly lost to Pin is ultimately consumed by the dominant personality.  This film never got much attention lost as it was in the wash of 1980s splatter films.  This is indeed a shame because Pin is everything that a good horror movie should be quiet tense nervewracking and emotionally involving.  You care about the characters unlike the teens in slasher films whom you never get to know as a living breathing human beings.  These people are not just meat for the grinder.  You like them you want them to survive and conquer and overcome the past.  All of these elements make this film that much harder to watch and that much more horrific in its final chilling moments.  The ending is indeed a classic bittersweet one. Highly recommended for people who enjoy a good dark descent into the warped mind.".

He has no friends but for his sister and Pin.  When their parents die in a freak car accident Leon shows some signs of rebellion ripping the plastic off the furniture and not cleaning the kitchen after a messy dinner.  But the rebellion is short lived when Leon brings Pin into the house to live with them.  David Hewlett as Leon is excellent so sad and lost one moment that you simply want to hug him so vicious and psychotically frightening the next that you want to run the hell away from him as far and as fast as you can. Cyndy Preston as Ursula is one of the most likable characters I've seen in a long time.  She is a genuinely sweet person compassionate and kind and she loves her brother dearly even though she realizes that he is a paranoid schizophrenic.  She is the only one who manages to escape from the cold prison her parents have made for them both.  Leon hopelessly lost to Pin is ultimately consumed by the dominant personality.  This film never got much attention lost as it was in the wash of 1980s splatter films.  This is indeed a shame because Pin is everything that a good horror movie should be quiet tense nervewracking and emotionally involving.  You care about the characters unlike the teens in slasher films whom you never get to know as a living breathing human beings.  These people are not just meat for the grinder.  You like them you want them to survive and conquer and overcome the past.  All of these elements make this film that much harder to watch and that much more horrific in its final chilling moments.  The ending is indeed a classic bittersweet one. Highly recommended for people who enjoy a good dark descent into the warped mind.";

The children's world is enclosed and corruption of some kind is inevitable. In this Pin is a lifesize medical mannequin who is used as a parental surrogate for two children whose parents are too screwed up and occupied with their own affairs to see the folly of their decisions. The film is dark and moody sexually loaded and awfully grim in parts. The voice of Pin is disturbing in the extreme and his mere presence in each scene is fascinating but unnerving.

	schema:reviewBody "Leon and Ursula's parents aren't very affectionate. Their mother cares more about a spotless perfect household and their doctor father is always at work. He often brings them along and uses ventriloquism to make it seem like his medical anatomy dummy is speaking to them. The kids are quite fond of the dummy Pin and believe he is really alive. As teens after various upsetting events they find themselves living in their home alone. Ursula is trying to become a welladjusted adult but Leon finds that his only true friend is Pin and still thinks he is actually alive. Is he? Or is Leon going crazy? This is a very bizarre movie and one of the better horror films I've seen from the 80s. The first half hour or so is sort of awkward to watch due to some of the children's experiences. The latter half of the film doesn't focus on Leon's psychology as much as one would expect though it is clear that the kid has a warped idea of sexuality based on his twisted parental guidance and a freaky...incident he witnessed involving his beloved Pin. The acting is above average for an 80s horror film and most genre fans will recognize David Hewlitt from Cube. He does a good job playing the potentiallypsycho teenager and Cynthia Preston is marvelous as the sister trying to bring some stability to the family. Overall this is an interesting mildly creepy and refreshingly toneddown offering from the decade of excess.My Rating 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie expecting some kind of a horrorthriller from most of the comments here. Of course the basic story has quite some resemblances of the famous Psycho but I think that this movie is far more into the psychological level and less into thrills and chills. Thats why I now get some of the negative remarks because if you want to get a psycho axe wielding maniac and his rotten mom you sure will be disappointed by nice guy Leon and his pretty boring doll.If you just watch Pin for what it is and that to me is a kind of apsychological drama then it makes much more sense and has some interesting insights. The story revolves around two kids Leon and his Sister Ursula who grow up in a very conservative upbringing. Their mother a 60s clich of a cleaning obsessed house woman and their father a doctor whom his kids call Sir and who teaches them several things through an anatomical doll using ventriloquism. The doll named Pin becomes a part of their lives and especially Leon becomes attached to it also talking to him in his fathers absence. Years later their parents die in a car crash and Leon and his sister start living on their own. From here on Pin becomes Leons Alter Ego and kind of a family member ... the downward spiral picks up pace and troubled Leon who desperately tries to keep his family together by keeping Ursula from other peoples influences starts going over the edge.Ursula know about Leons mental state and plays along with his schizophrenic role play and the Pin doll which Leon gives his voice just like his father did. She doesn't want her brother to end in a sanitarium realizing too late that her playing along just makes things worse.The movie is very slow and the deterioration of Leons mental state is not thrilling everything is shown in kind of a normal way because thats what it is for Leon. People die in this movie but its not for thrills and especially the ending shows that Pin is rather a drama than anything else. If you are interested in a psychological study in a Psycholike set watch this movie if you want corpses thrills and scary horror dolls this sure is the wrong movie for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "The eighties produced a lot of horror films that were clearly made just for people to rent on Friday nights to ignore while they had a few beers and a laugh with their mates. While most of these films were instantly forgettable some were actually quite good and unfortunately have been forgotten along with the forgettable ones. Pin is one such film. While the movie isn't a horror classic and it takes essential elements from a range of sources most notably Psycho it still represents a good success in the psychological horror subgenre. So if you like your films to be dark and moody you can go wrong here! Based on a best seller by Andrew Neiderman Pin blends the story of a young boy growing up with murderous schizophrenia to horrifying effect. The plot follows a brother and sister Leon and Ursula whose father uses ventriloquism and an anatomical dummy as a learning tool for his children. What he doesn't count on however is Leon taking this act too seriously and believing that the dummy really is alive. A childish idea that leads to a very dark future for Leon.While the film lacks any real potent bite it blends it's elements together with a good plot pace well enough to ensure that the film always offers compelling viewing and although the action gets a little predictable at times we always want to carry on watching to see what happens. The dummy itself is the centrepiece of the film and director Sandor Stern has managed to create a malevolent atmosphere around it. The thing looks creepy anyway but when combined with it's puton voice I can imagine it giving some more easily scared viewers nightmares. Ventriloquism is a hobby that has always lent itself well to horror movies from the dummy tale in 'Dead of Night' to this film and more you can always count on a creepy movie if one of it's core subjects is the act of someone lending their voice to a plastic doll. The acting in the film is typically eighties but it's not all that bad considering the type of movie that this is. On the whole Pin is a nice atmospheric chiller that deserves more attention so if you get the chance to see it I highly recommend that you do!".

The problem is that dad is overprotective and creepy so the kids talk to Pin so much that soon the brother thinks he's real even more so as he grows older.

What you DO get however is an overall decent movie with a few twists and turns to make it worth while and compelling.Filmed in the 80s and it looks it.  But don't let this hinder you.  Basic plot  2 kids grow up with a doctor for a dad and a neatnik NUT for a mother opening to the kids  we see them having cookies  milk before going to bed  mom VACUUMS THE KITCHEN FLOOR FOR CRUMBS AFTER THEY'RE DONE!.  Dad has a plastic medical model life size in his office  called Pin.  They give you the way that his name comes around.  Papa uses Pin in his practice to help kids feel at ease during the visit  and throws his voice to Pin  ventriloquism for dummies.Fast forward to the 'present'  kids are grown Leon  Ursula and in their teens.  I won't spoil the movie and give you the whole thing.  Just suffice it to say that this is where the psychological aspect comes in.  Suffice it to say that murder  mayhem and some general craziness come to play in this flick...Parts of this movie are out of place  the nurse's sex party for example and parts are right in place  the eventual end of the story the love interest that grows etc.Overall a good flick with enough in it to keep your interest.  Go for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pin is a shamelessly ignored 80's chiller that urgently deserves more attention. Without exaggerating you can safely say that this is one of the most mesmerizing and emotionprovoking films of a decade where genre fanatics were only out to get cheap thrills and see bloody violence. Psychologically speaking this is a quite a demanding film handling about serious issues such as schizophrenia and incestuous tendencies. Normally this is far too ambitious for an independent horror film but Sandor Stern cowriter and director of Pin efficiently blends it all into one seriously compelling and quite disturbing thriller. Leon and Ursula are the kids of a successful doctor brilliant Bactor Terry O'Quinn who brings an anatomically correct office dummy to live with his ventriloquismskills. Leon is obsessed with this dummy  Pin  and keeps it in his parents' house after they got killed in a road accident. Leon descents further and further into madness while 'protecting' his younger sister and nursing the dummy.Pinis a very unsettling film storydriven and very well elaborated. It all looks extra eerie because of the natural acting. This film introduces us to intriguing characters and they're played by neutral but very devoted performers. David Hewlett 'Cube' is truly chilling as Leon and he often stands the comparison with Norman Bates. The cherubic Cynthia Preston looks wonderful and she's very convincing as the emotional Ursula. The climax is rather predictable but yet you still feel a little uncomfortable when it is actually shown. This film should be saved from total oblivion! Flawless horror that sticks to you! Favorite 'Rewind'moment HUGE SPOILER!!!!!! In a subtle and wellphotographed sequence we see how the young Leon witnesses how a nurse uses the anatomically correct Pin to satisfy her own lusts. A traumatic experience that unquestionably had a giant impact on the further development of the boy's introvert personality.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pin is an anatomically correct seethrough mannequin. His interests include tutoring chocolates and terrorizing young ladies. Pin speaks with a slow thin whispery voice. His educational expertise includes math and sex. He also enjoys listening to incestuous poetry and creeping quietly in the dark. Pin's story is destined to become a cult classic. The strength of this movie lies not in direction nor necessarily in acting but in story. Pin is one of the strangest movies you'll watch. Scenes include a skinless mannequin giving a private sex lecture to a young brother and sister a man giving his daughter an abortion and a nurse who uses Pin as a sex doll when she thinks no one else is watching.This neglected gem is an example of 1980's horror at its most creative. Its not a gory film by any means but it will chill you to the bone as its a superbly crafted psychological study into the mental disintegration of a fragile mind. The most disquieting scenes of course involve Pin whether its involving Leon or just when another character is alone in the room with the mannequin. It seems to exude a threat even when Leon is not around to carry out Pin's 'bidding'. At the heart of this film is a superb performance by David Hewlett as the adult Leon. He gives a very sympathetic performance of someone whose mind has been unbalanced by the maladjusted childhood he has gone through. Cynthia Preston is also very good as the grown up Ursula who tries to get her life back together whilst also coping with the increasing demands of LeonPin. Don't expect anything too exploitative or overly sensational as 'Pin' builds up the tension and the scares by telling a good story and providing proper character development. A fascinating film!!Overall rating 9 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A nice surprise";
	schema:reviewBody "I wouldn't call this movie a horror but more a psychological thriller. 'Pin' is a story about two kids growing up with parents who are hardly there for them in their childhood. Their mother is a clean freak their father is a doctor and a ventriloquist who uses a dummy called Pin to 'help him out' in his practice. As children both Ursula and Pin believe Pin to be real and though he doesn't speak to them when father is not around Pin does give birthday presents and is a really helpful chap. When both parents die in a car crash Leon takes Pin home as a family member.The acting of David Hewlett as Leon is impressive. This on itself makes the movie worth to see. Leon is a clean cut boy who has more in common with both his parents than he would want to. His loneliness jealousy and the subtlety of his slowly growing madness is very well done. The bad is that even though there is some focus on the why Leon gets mad personally I think this could have been done better. I would have liked to see more of his inner world going down hill. But what the script lacks the acting of Hewlett makes up for. There is an important sexual undertone in this movie which also could have been worked out better. Ursula going to her own father for an abortion Leon's dark poetry yes they gave an unsettling feeling but all a bit too subtle. Maybe it was done this way to please the mainstream watchers and it would have been too shocking otherwise. Anyway it gave me the feeling that only the surface of all the underlying problems and feelings was scratched. 'Pin' was different then I expected it to be. When reading about it before I saw it I thought it would end up much more like a horror clich of the dummy coming to life. And constantly I was hoping that the end would not be that cheesy. When the movie was finished it did leave me satisfied. Today which is the day after I watched it I feel that this movie is still with me in a positive way. And I always consider that a good sign. Even with all it's flaws it impressed me more than I thought it would do. I give it an 8 because I can not give it a 75.".

It's quite a strange psychological thriller that is very creepy throughout the movie. I wouldn't call this a horror film even though it does have some qualities of the genre.DON'T READ BELOW THIS LINE IF YOU DON'T WISH TO KNOW THE BASIC STORY.The plot is basically about a medical mannequin. It has a clear skin covering so that we see the tendons and muscles underneath. This is actually quite unnerving when it is shown on screen. Where the mannequin named PIN comes into the story is from a father who just so happens to be a doctor. The father has seemingly a selfmastered ventriloquist projecting his voice into PIN which talks to his patients and his own son and daughter.The son Leon grows up so close to PIN that he truly believes it is a real person. He learns to be a ventriloquist on his own as the years go by to the final shock of his father. What was really weird is the voice of PIN sounded exactly the same when the son took over. His father seeing this realizes his mistake and takes PIN away to a speech he is to give. But he is running very late and his speeding and PIN?! causes a fatal car wreck. The son retrieves PIN and brings him back to his home believing more than ever that PIN is his only real friend. He even finishes PIN's clear skin to look more like a real human which only adds to the bizarre creepiness.In the second half of the film we find an Aunt moving in to look after the kids. She becomes a problem and is thus abruptly extinguished from the house which looks like natural causes to the doctors and police.Next we find the daughter Ursula maturing and moving forward with her life. She begins to realize the severity of her brother's mental health and her duty to stay by his side and care for him. Ursula now has a job she enjoys and a man she is quickly falling in love with. Leon and PIN do not approve of this...I won't reveal the end of the story except to say that there are several well executed plot twists. I really enjoy this film it has a really unique feel about it. Even though we think PIN is not real sometimes you actually forget that this is the case....which may or not be?!? The music also has some creepy moments and is well done. Some great performances are in this film well worth mentioning. Terry O'Quinn THE STEPFATHER does a masterful job as the father. David Hewlett CUBE is also great as Leon as well as Cynthia Preston playing Ursula.".

It's slow haunting unnerving and very well acted by all actors involved mostly unknowns except for Terry O'Quinn as the father and for David Hewlett as the son who acted also in Scanners II The New Order 1991 and Cube 1997. It's directed with skill by Sandor Stern who was also responsible for the screenplay based on a novel by Andrew Neiderman who also wrote the novel The Devil's Advocate. The story a young lonely fragileminded boy in need for parental love and guidance get's closetonone from his too selfconsumed parents and projects his needs into a medical display dummy which his father a doctor use as a handyman to help teaching his children. The only love and care the boy get's come from his kidsister. The parents die in a horrible caraccident leaving the children financially independent. They grow up to be teenagers and when the kidsister starts to date her brother's obsessive overprotectiveness results into chaos and murder.

Well keep watchingPin.The doctor and his wife constantly feel like they could kill one another at any moment. And Leon may not ever want to think about sex but his sister can't stop thinking about it. Jump cut ahead in time and she's literally having sex with most of the football team while her brother is scrubbing graffiti about her off a locker.

	schema:reviewBody "Stunning performances by Kate Nelligan and most of the cast in this powerful story based on truth help make this a mustsee film.I wonder if some of the reviewers such as onceuponatime500 really saw the movie or if they just wrote from some vicious and preconceived bias.The communists come to the village to conscript  kidnap  children to become guerrilla fighters. The mother Eleni takes a drastic step mutilating her oldest child to spare her from being shanghaied into the communist forces.Being communists they will not be thwarted not by any such reactionary notions as selfownership or freedom or parental rights or any of that silly stuff They take the next oldest girl instead.Eleni loves her children and believes foolishly according to onceuponatime500 but in line with what Charlie Anderson James Stewart in Shenandoah said They're my children not the state's not some murderous movement's.For years after seeing this powerful and haunting story I could recall Nelligan's last scene and be moved to tears.The agony Eleni went through was duplicated millions of times in the bloody 20th Century as some government or another or some tyrannical movement or another kidnapped young people to force them to risk their lives for some cause most of them didn't understand much less support.Think Viet Cong think Hitler's armies think Stalin's and Mao's imperialist and aggressive armies and yes think of the poor draftees from the United States.Think contrastingly of parents parents who spent years loving and caring for their children hoping those children would be able to live to a better adulthood than their parents. Think of those parents seeing their children sometimes literally torn from their grasp thrown into lines to be cannon fodder for cruel warlords  communists Nazis imperialists of one kind or another even when disguised as crusaders.Eleni works at almost every level except for the incredibly horrible performance by John Malkovich. If it hadn't been seen as anticommunist even Hollywood would have honored Eleni. But its being anticommunist made Eleni an outcast in that artistically and morally corrupted town. However Eleni is powerful drama.Added 25 November 2017 Watching Eleni on YouTube I am wondering if my dislike of John Malkovich's performance is at least as much for how unpleasant he makes Nick Gage. As portrayed by Malkovich Gage is rude cold aloof he has no personality doesn't respond to people not even to his wife who asks questions. As performed by Malkovich Gage's personality is enough to chase away a viewer.We are now exactly 100 years after the Bolshevik revolution in Russia an event that led to hundreds of millions of deaths and destruction of entire nations of entire peoples. There is an irony in Nick Gage's working for The New York Times which has been frequently procommunist and nearly always antianti communist with its Moscow correspondent Walter Duranty infamously painting a rosy picture of the Soviet Union during the time of the murderous monster Josef Stalin.This century anniversary makes Eleni even more poignant and even more important.".

The mother Eleni takes a drastic step mutilating her oldest child to spare her from being shanghaied into the communist forces.Being communists they will not be thwarted not by any such reactionary notions as selfownership or freedom or parental rights or any of that silly stuff They take the next oldest girl instead.Eleni loves her children and believes foolishly according to onceuponatime500 but in line with what Charlie Anderson James Stewart in Shenandoah said They're my children not the state's not some murderous movement's.For years after seeing this powerful and haunting story I could recall Nelligan's last scene and be moved to tears.The agony Eleni went through was duplicated millions of times in the bloody 20th Century as some government or another or some tyrannical movement or another kidnapped young people to force them to risk their lives for some cause most of them didn't understand much less support.Think Viet Cong think Hitler's armies think Stalin's and Mao's imperialist and aggressive armies and yes think of the poor draftees from the United States.Think contrastingly of parents parents who spent years loving and caring for their children hoping those children would be able to live to a better adulthood than their parents. Think of those parents seeing their children sometimes literally torn from their grasp thrown into lines to be cannon fodder for cruel warlords  communists Nazis imperialists of one kind or another even when disguised as crusaders.Eleni works at almost every level except for the incredibly horrible performance by John Malkovich. If it hadn't been seen as anticommunist even Hollywood would have honored Eleni. But its being anticommunist made Eleni an outcast in that artistically and morally corrupted town. However Eleni is powerful drama.Added 25 November 2017 Watching Eleni on YouTube I am wondering if my dislike of John Malkovich's performance is at least as much for how unpleasant he makes Nick Gage. As portrayed by Malkovich Gage is rude cold aloof he has no personality doesn't respond to people not even to his wife who asks questions. As performed by Malkovich Gage's personality is enough to chase away a viewer.We are now exactly 100 years after the Bolshevik revolution in Russia an event that led to hundreds of millions of deaths and destruction of entire nations of entire peoples. There is an irony in Nick Gage's working for The New York Times which has been frequently procommunist and nearly always antianti communist with its Moscow correspondent Walter Duranty infamously painting a rosy picture of the Soviet Union during the time of the murderous monster Josef Stalin.This century anniversary makes Eleni even more poignant and even more important.";

	schema:headline " A lot of the comments miss the point";
	schema:reviewBody "This film seems to have unjustly attracted a lot of nonsensical comments mostly from left of center commentators and it's sadly revealing how the facts cited by other viewers are not even addressed but simply ignored by the leftist commentators. Those who accuse the film of being anticommunist propaganda mostly use ad hominem arguments and insult and invective. But ask yourself what good is a political view which assumes itself because it is selfdescribed as revolutionary to be above ordinary moral or political criticism? If that were true then there could never be any way to judge the value of the actions performed in its name. In short this is a reasonably good film with a fine performance by Kate Nelligan and much less good work by other members of the cast. The direction is not inspired and the flashback structure of the film seeks to maximize the emotional effects without stopping to consider just how powerful those effects are all by themselves that is the use of that structure betrays the fear of the filmmakers that the story might not have the impact they wanted it to have. The original book is stronger but it too is flawed by Nicholas Gage's failure to ask himself about how it was that the communists picked on his mother even though he presents some of the evidence that answers the question. It's clear from the book that some members of his family  I think his grandfather but it's been a long time since I read the book  had serious disputes with other people in the village in the 20s and 30s and perhaps even earlier and that there may even have been a murder involved naturally Gage is not all that clear on the point. The communists men most of them couldn't go after the grandfather so brave souls that they were went after the most vulnerable the Gage womenfolk. Despicable but that is often the tenor of village and peasant life. And to me this was the message of the book that the politics of revolution were in many cases simply another weapon in the neverending village war between its own members. The problem with the film is that it never really clarifies this central aspect of the drama and so the power of Nelligan's performance is marooned. It affects but it's almost in a vacuum and Malkovich's portrayal of Gage which I thought quite good is similarly detached but the flaw lay in the original book which ducks important questions because Gage North American that he is simply doesn't understand the deeper currents of village life. Worth a look no matter its flaws. No work of art is ever perfect and this one gets high marks for trying.".

As the son as an adult John Malkovich is curiously detached.Again although the movie was first rate I question the decision to alternate time periods with a parallel narratives throughout. I think it lessens the impact. I see no reason the story couldn't be told chronologically to greater effect.  Those two reviewers from Argentina and Greece who wrote that the movie was propaganda are being silly. Neither this movie nor anyone denies that the Communists and those democrats defending the former king and government who had returned to power after the war  the king wishing to reign but not rule fought the Nazis during the Second World War. This movie does not take place during that war  and doesn't refer to it.Further when the Second World War ended there WERE no native Greek fascists fighting in the Civil War  when a reviewer writes that this was a fascist war it's crazy. In the movie you hear the Communists using the term fascist in the same loose propagandistic way that say Prime Minister Tony Blair is referred to as a fascist  falsely.As the Soviet Union's proxies looked to be gaining in the Civil War Britain asked the United States to participate in an effort to aid the Greek government with financial aid and weapons. over this and the Communist insurgency in turkey was the Truman doctrine of containment of Communist totalitarianism born. These are simply facts. Moreover the fact that the Greek Communists took tens of thousands of children from their parents and shipped them off to Communists countries such as Albania and Czechoslovakia is obviously welldocumented in the book and movie. However as I wrote above the movie simply looks at a human story of a mother and her love for her children. Kate Nelligan makes the movie heartfelt moving powerful. She should have won the Oscar for this performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not a comment to the movie itself. The bits I have seen show at least an accurate portrayal of rural Greece in the late 40's along with the political turmoil of the time. Acting was above average in general although some members of the cast notably Malkovich could have done a slightly better job.So is this propaganda? Of course it is BUT with more grains of truth than your average propaganda film especially an American made. Yes Mr Gatzoyannis unless he is ashamed to use his real family name and resorts to Gage had lost his mother during the civil war. He is supposed to be onesided who wouldn't? He wrote a book about it good for him. Someone made a film based on it good for them. And now many of us are bickering about what it is propaganda or not who are the good and who are the bad ones and so on...A commentator before said that war is the end of civilization. True! A civil war though makes an ordinary war look quite civilized and noble. Americans surely have their experience they have gone through a terrible civil war. We Greeks have our experience which sadly is more fresh  lots of people that lived through it are still around to talk about it. Kids being taken from their mothers' arms to be transported..where? Brother killing brother literally! and generally bringing down whatever was once dear. Who's the bad guy? Which brother gets moral high ground? The one who took to mountains kidnapped young ones to put them through a grim life behind the Iron Curtain laid waste to his land and his home? Or the other who after suffering all that imprisoned those left behind the majority of which were not part of the armed struggle and suffered along too exiled them to desolate barren islands there are more than we need of those in the Aegean made them dance with cats in a sack interesting how democracy or democracy can be as horrendous as communism or any other totalitarian regime and generally held them at the border of society until 1974. Who gets praise and who gets blame? You don't know? I think you do! History was always written by victors this is no exception. What is an exception in this case is that this particular victor Gage abstained his country's drama until it suited him to be a part of it. Having lost a loved one a parent in war is no unique to him millions of people did! Did he live the ongoing plague that the civil war was? From the comfort of his house half a world away. It is almost as if I who have never been to the US write a book about the drama of the Indians. Whatever moral high ground he possessed he lessened being that distanced from the whole scenery of it and its consequences. In short this book and film portray HIS side not his ideology's side but his personal side. It is easy to place blame very hard to do so for one side only! I will not go into the politics of that period that is for another place and another time. Decent film worth a viewing if not for anything else for an accurate portrayal of the scenery. No stars awarded as I have not seen it all just bits and pieces.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps the biggest problem with most of the reviews is that they take a partisan view of the Greek Civil War of the late '40s. The view presented sympathetically in the movie is that of the loyalists. But to call them the Freedom Fighters since they wanted the reestablishment of the monarchy seems peculiar for Americans. As for the book and movie documenting what happened it presented one side and who could blame Gage for promoting his vision of the truth when the Communists killed his mother. But war is war the complete breakdown of civilization. Quite often both sides do horrific things just as happened in Iraq recently where we are certainly far from being blameless. but don't wantonly kill as many as the insurgents. Or another Civil War Viet Nam where incidents such as Mi Lai were sign that we were not saviors. The facts of the Greek Civil War are presented below regarding the forced population of children In 1948 the two conflicting sides evacuated children and young persons from the territories they had conquered in the northwestern part of the country. The royalists transferred up to 30000 children to the south of the country and the communists sent about 25000 children across the border to Yugoslavia where they were primarily accommodated in shelters in several Yugoslav republics. In the period afterwards they were most frequently sent to the socalled countries with popular democracies  Poland Czechoslovakia Hungary Romania and Bulgaria as well as in the Democratic Republic of Germany. Each of the conflicting parties accused the other that it deported these children against both their will and that of their parents i.e. relatives. The two sides were also accusing each other that the other side was doing this in order to perform an ethnonational transformation  i.e. to turn the Macedonians into Greeks and vice versa. httpwww.newbalkanpolitics.org.mknapis.asp?id19langEnglish So take the movie for what it is. A presentation of one side...not necessary propaganda for right wingers or the tale of freedom fighters. Rather the sad tale of a boy who lost his mother in a Civil War. Not a bad movie but not brilliant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Folks please ignore the silly leftwingers who have decided to post their hateful remarks about this great film.Speaking as a GreekAmerican who's father was a partisan in WWII the story as shown in the film was exactly as it happened. Yes there was a terrible civil war following WWII but it was an attempt by the Soviet Union to extend its' power into the southern Balkans. The Soviets backed communists in Greece and the Allies backed noncommunists. After a long and bloody conflict that also resulted in thousands of Greek children being stolen from their parents and shipped to Eastern Bloc countries the war ended with the noncommunists as victors.Now be sure that like in every bloody civil war there were atrocities committed on both sides. But fighting against the communists was the right course of action since they did not favor free elections would have instituted a tyrannical govt. and would have dragged Greece into the Eastern Bloc for 50 years.As for the kidnapping of the children the blow to Greece's manpower was tragic. It would be the equivalent if millions of children were taken from American parents. Truly a nightmare. But a nightmare that could have been averted if the filthy communist scumbags had been stopped early on. It was Churchill that wanted to land troops in Greece for just such a reason during WWII but the Soviet dominated alliance nixed such an idea leaving Greece wide open for chaos and an atmosphere for civil war.Anyway the film was truly accurate in its' portrayal of the political climate of the time the brutality of the communists and the end result of this horrendous period. I highly recommend it as a lesson in what many countries of that and later periods encountered with communist insurrections. I also highly recommend it as a powerful testament of a mothers' love to protect her children from the ensuing chaos of war and tragedy.".

The village life shown caused me to recall stories that my mother told me and the closeness of the family in Greek culture shown by the protagonist's relentless search for his mother's killers is another accurate portrayal. The starvation and suffering of poor Greeks during WWII made them easy prey for communist ideology which thank God did not succeed in 19451949 and thanks to works like this film will never succeed.".

It's one of the most perfectly realized films you'll come across. The acting direction and photography are superb. It's worth owning just for Bruce Smeaton's brilliantly unique musical score. I've tried without success to find Greek music in a similar vein. Much of the opposition to the film in 1985 came from critics who insinuated an antiMarxist political bias. They missed the point. The film depicts the story of a mother removed from the political machinations that are grinding around her. Eleni wasn't a reactionary she was a loving mother. Unless film buffs rediscover Eleni the Hollywood Left will have buried a beautiful gem which conflicts with their accepted version of history. Goodnight and good luck.".

Greeks wanted to govern themselves and this is not what Great Britain  they wanted King and dictator back and guess who won . The King came back until the late 50's and 60's were Greek people won their independence.

Ihave read the comments on this movie and to be honest I am a bit annoyed by some of these which happen to be a part of my countrys history. It is never easy to view things in a civil war it is very clear though that in the Greek civil war19451949there were two sides there was the former government which during the triple occupationGerman Italian and Bulgarianwas absent in Cairo just to note that the former government handed over those communists who were then in exile to the Nazis and there was the peoplewho were starving to death who were tortured who were sent to concentration camps or to factories in Germany to work. The two sides are very distinct and so were the interests each side served. When Greece was liberated by the Germans the former government came back to claim the power. the people fought against them not just the communists for they wanted a free country where the people would be the one to decide for its fate and not some socalled allied forces!if it hadn't been for the English and the American Greece would have been a totally different country. Let me just say that thanks to the American and English intervention the first Napalm bombs were first tested here in Greece against the Communists and those who fought for dignity and for an independent nation. Now concerning the film when these allied forces are described as liberators and when the communists are described as the biggest threat in human history I am sorry to disappoint some of you but this is a clear political view!!And I am also sorry to disappoint some of you but since we live in capitalismdon't be afraid to use the word! which is an economical and political system we shouldn't believe that art culture our everyday habits are not a reflection of this particular system. Besides every system tries to protect itself! Finally I would like to add that I do like films and I do like art but I don't like to be manipulated in a way that my personal judgment is put aside. PS one last observation concerning history facts and propaganda in La vita e Bella starring Roberto Benini the last scene shows American troops liberating the prisoners of the concentration camp in Poland!well I guess 20.000.000 Russian killed in the second world war would be quite surprised if not anything else.".

Very few people criticize Kate Nelligan's fine performance but they overlook the performances of Linda Hunt and the actor who played the local Communist leader who was ultimately spared by Nicholas Gage I don't know his name but I thought the casting was quite deft. For the most part though it was John Malkovich's performance that has been so grossly misunderstood. People hadn't seen enough of his work in 1985 when the movie came out. But now after Places in the Heart The Killing Fields and numerous other films we should be able to appreciate what he can do with a part.Another distressing aspect of the critical comments is the fact that the political left prefers to focus on political background as the major point in their evaluation. To toss out any political reference to the actual situation in Greece in the late 1940's is nothing more than turning the very valid allegations of Communist mischief in that time into an argument for their sidesomething that the radical left has always been able to do quite adroitly for some time. In the early '80's many of those kidnapped children had grown up and returned to Greeceas agents provocateurs. They were so successful that their efforts had a potent effect on Greek politics for years. It is a fact that in that time the Soviets shot down a Korean airliner that had drifted off course over the Sea of Japan. Everyone aboard was killed. And the Premier of Greece with no evidence to support his conclusion whatsoever said publicly that the plane was probably on a spy mission for the CIA. He of course was playing to the powerful leftist political sentiment in his own country at the time. A page of history is truly worth a volume of logic sometimes.".

	schema:reviewBody "This lovely Hammer Horror blending of the traditional vampire tale with martial arts stars Peter Cushing as Professor Van Helsing. The plot follows Van Helsing who is drawn into a plot involving a legendary seven golden vampires the prince of darkness Dracula himself the undead and a load of martial artists. Our hero must along with his son and an escort of kung fu fighters travel to a cursed village somewhere in China to rid it of the vampire curse that holds it. One of the reasons why Hammer horror is so brilliant is that it isn't afraid to make a film that most other film studios would regard as stupid and then make it work. The main reason why Hammer horror does work is that the films despite showing many macabre images are always good natured and made with a lot of heart so they're easy to like and this one is no different. The Eastern style makes for a very different vampire film to what we're used to and Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires seems keen to capitalise on that as it changes many of the traditional vampire rules to suit the east for example the traditional cross to ward off vampires is replaced by the image of Budha. As usual with Hammer the effects are hokey to say the least the production values are low and everyone except Peter Cushing leaves a lot to be desired actingwise...but without these traits this film wouldn't be Hammer so these things are not only forgivable but welcome. Peter Cushing's performance in this movie isn't his best but fans of his will still relish it. There's something about Cushing's persona that makes him very watchable and every film with him in it is worth watching if only for that reason. He also gets involved in some of the martial arts fights which is nice to see. The fights themselves are very well staged much better than I was expecting with this being a horror film with kung fu elements rather than a full blown fightfest.This is the fifth film I've seen by Hammer director Roy Ward Baker and although it's not the best it's still a very solid offering from the man who was probably Hammer's finest director. This film is a lot of fun and I don't doubt that it will delight anyone who sees it and therefore it comes with the highest recommendations from me.".

Ironically Hammer and Shaw studios were just like each other in many ways beautiful sets a staff of great directors and actors.

	schema:reviewBody "In 19th century China Count Dracula takes the form of a Chinese tyrant who has control of a cult that contains six sword wielding vampires and hordes of zombies. The legend is said that they mount a bloody reign of terror on a cursed remote village by taking young woman from the village to feed on them. Professor Van Helsing Peter Cushing leads an expedition with some martial art experts his son and a wealthy widow to the village to prove the legend is true and to rid the undead from this earth.Hammer production gives us something a bit different in this film by making a far journey to the east Honk Kong. Hammer horror meets Kung Fu for this outing with a lot of exorbitance and flair to show. It might be a bizarre mix and ridiculously overthetop hokum but you can't deny the shocks and fun factor it achieves. It's rather silly stuff and that makes it enjoyable viewing. What's a Hammer film without Peter Cushing as Van Helsing but Christopher Lee didn't return to play Dracula and John ForbesRobertson took his place. He just lacked the charisma and gave a rather odd if dour performance. Cushing on the other hand gave a solid performance and some valueadded class to the film. Julie Ege is fine as the elegant Vanessa Buren the wealthy lady who funded the expedition. This film gives us what we expect a lot of horror flesh and blood.The premise is a rather engrossing adventure even though it has a very formulaic narrative. The plot might be flawed make not much sense and come across as disjointed. But it totally makes up for it with some unpredictable sequences of suspense and an intriguing mythology involving vampires of the East. Showing how their customs are far different to those of the traditional vampires. The colourfully taut action sequences are well set up and are terrifically paced. When these rather hectic martial art battles start they really do go on but still don't overshadow the horror element of the film. The battles involving the golden vampires are dazzling and the zombies coming out of the ground was well established and a sight to see. The final setup for the grand battle scene reminded me very much of The Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven especially in protecting them from an onslaught. The difference is that they weren't asked or paid to protect them. One thing it lacked was a seductive female vampire there was one for 10 seconds or so. The plot's thin love story felt out of place in the overall context and so did Helsing's son Leyland who came across as nothing more then a annoying bystander. So was Dracula as he didn't do that much and only had a small amount of screen time. The climax between Dracula and Helsing isn't much of a tussle. It was that brisk it felt like they wanted to get the film over pretty quickly.The film was very atmospheric especially at night with the howling wind blankets of mist and menacing shadows. On the journey to the village the scenery provided by the countryside is fairly graceful. Ranging from the grassland rocky terrain and the woodlands. The heart pounding score goes in hand to hand with the scenes. The production valves weren't great but not bad. The set designs of Dracula's domain and the village are somewhat vivid. The effects were rather shoddy rubber bats on strings and props looked ludicrous the weapons. The makeup and costumes on the vampires and zombies were rather fair. You get some close ups of rotting vampire's faces after dying. This is when you get some oozing bubbling and steaming skin decay. Also there are cheesy sound effects and a glorious amount of blood splattering.Rather entertaining if unconventional horror by Hammer productions.".

Kah's temple has fallen out and he asks for Dracula's help John ForbesRobertson was furious when he discovered that he had been dubbed by another actor . Chung King 1904  while lecturing in the Far East Professor Van Helsing Peter Cushing tells his students of a doomed village in China that becomes cursed every year at the time of the 7th moon . Van Helsing is persuaded by Hsi Ching David Chiang and his brothers  all of them Kung Fu experts  to rid the village of the 7 vampires that torment its citizens . Then  Van Helsing  his son Robin Stewart  a gorgeous wealthy woman Julie Ege and the Chinese brothers set out in pursuit Dracula and the seven golden vampires . As the motley group fighting a vampire cult located on a cursed village in China . This classic flick was well produced by the famous British production company along with Run Shaw Brothers  as Hammer Films meets ChopSocky Hong Kong . It displays creepy scenes  lots of violence  nudity  action filled  zooms  thrills and fierce combats . It is an exciting as well as original attempt to revive the Dracula long series  mainly played by Peter Cushing and Christophel Lee . This luxurious Kung Fuhorror film was wonderfully filmed with good production design  glimmer cinematography by John Wilcox  impressive combats and breathtaking scenes . This is a colourful  HongKong set  mostly filmed in outdoors and quite budget movie  leave no clich untouched  though the fighting are magnificently staged . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with terror scenes  frenetic action  surprises  climatic combats and groundbreaking struggles . Overwhelming and rousing fights with deadly use of fists  feet and palms  along with such weapons as swords sticks  and lances . Highlights of the film are the notorious struggle between Kung Fu brothers and the seven golden vampires and and of course  the breathtaking final confrontation between Dracula and Van Helsing . Some critics have panned this film explaining that unless you are Kung Fu aficionado this outing will seem all too silly . This is the first of two Hammer productions shot backtoback in Hong Kong and the fifth and last time Peter Cushing would play Van Helsing. Although Christopher Lee was offered the role of Dracula he declined after reading the script and he is is sorely lost . This is the first Dracula film from Hammer Film Productions to feature an actor other than Christopher Lee playing Dracula although Lee was also absent for The brides of Dracula  which did not feature the character . The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires also titled Dracula and the Seven Golden Vampires or The 7 Brothers Meet Dracula is a fine horror movie but isn't as good as the precedent films . It's the sixth part of Dracula series  the first is Horror of Dracula  the second is Dracula  prince of darkness the third Brides of Dracula and is followed by Taste the blood of Dracula and Dracula has risen from the grave continuing with two low budgeted  TV sequels directed by Alan Gibson  The satanic rites of Dracula and Dracula A.D. 72  most of them starred by the great Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing . The cinematography by John Wilcox and Roy Ford is excellent and brilliant . James Bernard musical score is rousing as well as eerie and spooky . This Hammer film was rightly directed by Roy Ward Baker . Roy was a good professional  his first opportunity to direct a film The October Man 1947. He then went to Hollywood in 1952 and stayed for seven years returning to Britain in 1958 when he directed one of his best films A night to remember 1958. During the 1960s and 1970s Baker directed a number of horror films for Hammer and Amicus. He also directed in British television especially during the latter part of his career.".

Looking back from the vantage point of 2011after seeing Batman Hellboy Iron Man The Mummy franchise et. al. go to ChinaCarerras's crosscultural gambit looks like genius and 40 years ahead of its time...perhaps literally so since the revived Hammer company is now talking about doing a remake.If you fear this movie will be a Kung Fu actioner with lots of bonecrunching sound effects and nuggets of inscrutable wisdom think again. It's pure Hammer from start to finish with a reliable anchoring performance by Peter Cushing as Van Helsing. It seems the venerable doctor is doing some anthropological field work in China when he lectures at a university his unwelcome discussion of vampires draws catcalls but finds one receptive listener who knows the truth of the Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires. Add a traveling European heiress with a taste for adventure and a fortune to fund an expedition into the hinterland and the plot is off and running.This is a work of high fantasy that draws not just on Bram Stoker but on a long tradition of English literature. The narrative brio reminds me of the adventure stories of H. Rider Haggard here set in China instead of Africa. There's also a bit of Tolkien in the storytelling with the 7 Golden Vampires reminiscent of the Nazgul Dracula of Sauron and Van Helsing of Gandalf leading a motley fellowship on a journey to destroy evil. As the travelers draw ever nearer to their goal they engage in repeated battles that take a terrible toll right up to the final confrontation with the Evil One himself. Lest you think the Tolkien parallel is a stretch consider that the character of Van Helsing was one of Tolkien's inspirations for Gandalf the keeper of secret knowledge who advises and motivates those who would rid the world of its greatest evil.The action scenes look quite dated but only because we've grown used to seeing aerial martial arts performed with guywires against a bluescreen in the oldfashioned Kung Fu films acrobats were still subject to the laws of gravity.".

Lest you think the Tolkien parallel is a stretch consider that the character of Van Helsing was one of Tolkien's inspirations for Gandalf the keeper of secret knowledge who advises and motivates those who would rid the world of its greatest evil.The action scenes look quite dated but only because we've grown used to seeing aerial martial arts performed with guywires against a bluescreen in the oldfashioned Kung Fu films acrobats were still subject to the laws of gravity.";

However I too profess to having been unsold on the charms of LEGEND OF THE 7 GOLDEN VAMPIRES for ages. But now after finally having seen a restored widescreen presentation courtesy of Anchor Bay I am convinced that one of the reasons why the effort left me cold the first few times through was due to the miserable scrappy fullscreen home video versions available previously which excluded as much as 12 minutes of footage.I came of age during the home video years and heading out every week to the various rental shops in our area to see what Hammer or Hammer related flicks we could find became a regular past time. Certain movies were relatively easy to locate but we'd always heard about this legendary kungfuDracula hybrid by Hammer that was made significant by Peter Cushing's final appearance as Professor Van Helsing the world expert on the Undead. Rumor had it that the movie involved Van Helsing tracing the elusive Count Dracula to colonial era China where he'd set up shop and acquired a taste for the local food. Hijinx awaited in the form of supernatural kungfu battles with a band of seven specialist martial arts masters who were of course brothers fighting off legions of vampiric barbarians. Somehow the combination sounded like trying to mix oil with water and when I finally managed to find the meager VHS release of the film my apprehension was proved well founded by a muddled mix of Gothic horror chills with difficult to follow chopsocky interludes. The panandscan compression of the widescreen shots was dizzying the vampire interludes were anything but the dreamy foggy castle on a hill variety that Hammer had become specialists in with lots of insert shots of Peter Cushing standing around looking concerned while Julie Ege's bosoms heaved cruelly encased in her cleavage baring tops.It turns out however that much of this muddling and cockamamie mishmashing was due to the confinement of Roy Ward Baker directing the talking scenes and Cheh Chang's directing the martial arts scenes marvelous widescreen 2351 Techniscope photography into a claustrophobic nappy lookin' fullscreen image. Fading of color and reduction print distortions didn't help much and my opinion now after seeing the widescreen print is that much of the disdain aimed at the film is in fact aimed at the miserable presentations that have been available until now.Sure it's still a bit cobbled together. Hammer's grip on the marketplace was tenuous at best by 1974 THE EXORCIST and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD had happened and they were still banking on Gothic shenanigans to sell movie tickets. One result was the creation of these genre crossing hybrids like LEGEND OF THE 7 GOLDEN VAMPIRES mixing martial arts mayhem with Gothic chills and CAPTAIN KRONOS  VAMPIRE HUNTER which effectively blended the Spaghetti Western swashbuckling highadventure and the Gothic nightgowns blowing in the wind. The public didn't seem to care but the result were two very charming movies that had the gall to be different even if horror fans had moved on. Hammer was hoping to extend their life by coming up with some new series and their collaboration with Shaw Brothers productions was perhaps both ahead of its times while a year or three too late to save the company. It was a glorious failure that deserves to be seen again now that present day technology can give viewers a better estimation of the movie's intended form. It is surprisingly entertaining and compulsively watchable.What I would recommend is that anybody who may have heard of LEGEND OF THE 7 GOLDEN VAMPIRES should give it a try and anyone who had dismissed it before as a crummy home video oddity to try it again now that the original fulllength widescreen version is readily available. It's still somewhat confusing if you are looking for a discreet beginningmiddle end story progression. But when taken as it's individual moments strung together into a greater whole some of it is actually quite compelling Slowmotion legions of the Undead riding horseback whilst slaughtering the populace  making off with all the hot chicks the Blind Dead anyone? torture chambers with topless girls strapped down to a bizarre rack designed to drain their blood the reinsertion of some amusingly clever gore shots James Bernard's at times utterly surreal  way underappreciated musical score recalling some of his Dracula themes while experimenting with more Eastern inspired sounds traditional nonwire guided kung fu fights with all the bravado and forced sentiment of a classic martial arts film and rest assured plenty of insert shots of Peter Cushing standing there looking concerned. Just by turning his head slightly to the side and raising an eyebrow Peter Cushing is a treat nobody can look concerned or impart a sense of dire urgency into an audience like Peter Cushing It may be an odd movie but it does feature some of his best work at appearing concerned and some of the urgencies that he imparts within viewers are the most dire of his career. Yeah he was getting old and tired and probably looked upon the movie as an expense paid trip to China to help him forget the sorrow of his wife's passing. But by golly he made the movie and if he means anything to you it simply must be seen because it is his last screen turn as one of his classic Gothic horror characters. Try it again make sure it's a widescreen version pop plenty of popcorn perhaps an adult beverage or two and put down the lights. Turns out it's not a bad movie after all.710".

	schema:headline " Interesting Mix of Horror and Martial Arts";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie on television several years ago and remember it as being a confusing mess of chopsuey. After viewing the Anchor Bay version on DVD last night I realize that first time round I must have been watching the bowdlerized version known as Seven Brothers Meet Dracula. While not the best Hammer movie ever made Golden Vampires is a coherent and entertaining movie that kept my interest throughout. I am not a martial arts fan but this is basically a horror movie with some martial arts thrown in and I enjoyed it as such. Peter Cushing is in fine form as Prof. Van Helsing but John ForbesRobertson's Dracula is a pale imitation of Christoper Lee's iconic vampire. Perhaps I would have felt differently if Dracula had been given more to do. As it is he makes only a cameo appearance at the beginning and very end of the movie.For the most part the movie chronicles the adventures of the seven brothers and one sister as they travel with Van Helsing to their ancestral village to rid it of a vampire curse. The siblings are all skilled in the martial arts which partially compensates for their lack of distinctive personalities. They overcome numerous obstacles along the way before finally reaching the village and encountering the vampires and their zombie allies in one final battle. The movie ends with the obligatory encounter between Van Helsing and Dracula which is brief and somewhat unsatisfying.Again this is not the best Hammer movie I've ever seen but I have to give the studio credit for trying. The later Christopher Lee Dracula movies were getting awfully repetitive and formulaic and the decision to move the locale to China after an opening sequence in Dracula's castle offered interesting possibilities for a new approach to the old vampire legend. Indeed the sight of Oriental vampires riding horses and wielding swords and aided by legions of zombies did make for some interesting viewing.This movie is definitely a must see for all aficionados of Hammer horror and well worth a look for other horror fans. I wonder whether the clowns who hacked up Golden Vampires and turned it into Seven Brothers are the same talentless morons who ruined Kiss of the Vampire and Evil of Frankenstein for television. Their names should be posted on a wall of shame so all will know who they are!".

While not the best Hammer movie ever made Golden Vampires is a coherent and entertaining movie that kept my interest throughout. I am not a martial arts fan but this is basically a horror movie with some martial arts thrown in and I enjoyed it as such. Peter Cushing is in fine form as Prof. Van Helsing but John ForbesRobertson's Dracula is a pale imitation of Christoper Lee's iconic vampire. Perhaps I would have felt differently if Dracula had been given more to do. As it is he makes only a cameo appearance at the beginning and very end of the movie.For the most part the movie chronicles the adventures of the seven brothers and one sister as they travel with Van Helsing to their ancestral village to rid it of a vampire curse. The siblings are all skilled in the martial arts which partially compensates for their lack of distinctive personalities. They overcome numerous obstacles along the way before finally reaching the village and encountering the vampires and their zombie allies in one final battle. The movie ends with the obligatory encounter between Van Helsing and Dracula which is brief and somewhat unsatisfying.Again this is not the best Hammer movie I've ever seen but I have to give the studio credit for trying. The later Christopher Lee Dracula movies were getting awfully repetitive and formulaic and the decision to move the locale to China after an opening sequence in Dracula's castle offered interesting possibilities for a new approach to the old vampire legend. Indeed the sight of Oriental vampires riding horses and wielding swords and aided by legions of zombies did make for some interesting viewing.This movie is definitely a must see for all aficionados of Hammer horror and well worth a look for other horror fans. I wonder whether the clowns who hacked up Golden Vampires and turned it into Seven Brothers are the same talentless morons who ruined Kiss of the Vampire and Evil of Frankenstein for television. Their names should be posted on a wall of shame so all will know who they are!";

	schema:reviewBody "This teamup between the almighty Hammer studios and Shaw Brothers resulted in a very imaginative and exciting movie and I'm quite sure it easily could have been regarded as a classic if only the script was a little more solid. The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires now simply is an entertaining fusion between KungFu and vampirism yet not good enough to be highly memorable. It all starts out terrifically with a Chinese pilgrim traveling many moons in order to reach Dracula's Transylvanian tomb and to bid him help. Help to resurrect seven infamous Chinese bloodsuckers that once terrorized the population of a small Chinese village. Dracula isn't the only one heading for China as his arch enemy Dr. Van Helsing goes on an expedition to unravel the myth of the Asian vampires as well accompanied by his son a Swedish widow dreadful English accent included and a small army of martialarts siblings. Van Helsing faces the 7 golden vampires that are now minions to the almighty Count Dracula. The acting performances are very weak with the exception of Peter Cushing who clearly amuses himself and simply is an outstanding horror actor but especially the guy who plays Dracula fails in his role. So weird not to see Christopher Lee in this role by the way. Even though the idea of blending them in a horror movie is original the Kung Fu fighting scenes take far too long and there are too many. Really good news for the horror fanatics however is that Legend of the 7 blah blah blah contains lots of bloody sequences and particularly the nasty decomposing process of the undead is gruesomely shot. Aside from the vampires Roy Ward Baker also throws in a bunch of zombies which always helps to increase the funlevel. It's eventually the incoherent plot that prevents this film from being a real success. The initial surprise effect of mixed styles is weakened near the end by uninspired twists and the tedious use of settings. Enjoy the flamboyant sequences and the overall lightheaded tone as much as possible and don't ask yourself too many questions.".

First off it looks like Hammer wanted to capitalize on the growing popularity of martial arts films but keep to their monster movie roots. This is acceptable because I know that Hammer was starting to suffer because their previous formula of making Gothic horror films was not as lucrative as it had been in the 1950s.Professor Van Helsing travels to China to teach about vampires at a university. He gets roundly rejected by the faculty but a young student tells him that one of the legends that Van Helsing referred to did occur. The student enlists Van Helsing to help him and his seven brothers and sister defeat the vampires. Oh and earlier a Chinese priest who worshiped the vampires went to Transylvania and was taken over by Count Dracula. He went back to China to make the vampire group strong again.The plot obviously suffers because they're combining two kinds of films that don't always match up. There was some decent production value and the actors and actresses were all very professional. However the film suffered because of the way that these two types of film were mixed. It tries to be serious and deliver on the martial arts action but at the same time it gets campy in places and seems to almost parody itself. The problem is that it seems like they were trying too hard to make a hit.".

	schema:headline " Cult Classics The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires";
	schema:reviewBody "What a fun treat this flick was. I've always been a fan of classic monster movies Frankenstein Dracula etc. When it comes to the Hammer Horror films I tend to favor those films over the more noticeable Universal films. They're in color they have a lot more imagery to look at and the acting particularly the acting from Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing is top notch for films made in the 50s 60s and 70s. While Horror of Dracula and Curse of Frankenstein remain two of my all time favorite horror films there is one other film that I've been dying to review ever since I gave it a watch a few months ago. It's the 1974 horroraction thriller The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires directed by Roy Ward Baker and Chang Cheh. If you're looking for a film that combines horror with fast paced ninja action and fighting this might be a winner in your book because it's an interesting and entertaining piece of cult classic filmmaking. First off I'll point out that this is more of an adult film with some things that may be a bit disturbing in the eyes of young viewers. There's disturbing torture scenes blood and gore and gruesome death scenes that may thrill you chill you or make you spill. Luckily there's not a lot of it and there's enough action to take your mind off those certain elements. It's as if they took a vampire film and blended it together with a Bruce Lee film. The action scenes are fun packed and exhilarating to watch reminiscent of the action scenes in Enter the Dragon and Game of Death. Whenever you need a rush of adrenaline watch the action scenes in this film. They will surely give you that burst of energy you've been longing for. I should also point out that this is the first Hammer film where Christopher Lee does not play Dracula. Instead Dracula is portrayed by John Forbes Robertson whose voice is dubbed over by David de Keyser. It's a bit of ridiculous voice over work but it's a cheesy movie to begin with. It's a bunch of warriors fighting off bloodthirsty vampires for heaven sake! The final fight between Van Helsing and Dracula is a bit underwhelming and anti climatic. Dracula topples over turns into a pile of dust and Van Helsing looks on as if nothing happened. Bullcakes! A brutal beatdown like the one in Horror of Dracula would have been much more epic. This is one of the last Hammer Dracula films after all. But it doesn't matter. The last hour or so has been nothing but entertainment for me for the action is so great to watch and gets you in that action packed kinda spirit. The plot is typical for a early 70s action thriller but it's not to say that the plot isn't interesting. It involves ancient stories from yesteryear medallions and Dracula taking the form of a average Chinese villager. How unique! The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires can be considered a masterpiece in it's own right even if the acting is not the greatest the cinematography is a bit off and the film has a touch of datedness. Nevertheless you can come to enjoy this flick for the off the wall and outlandish piece of cinema it is. It's not the least bit boring nor does it drag. It will keep you captivated until the screen turns black and white letters appear on the screen.".

Kungfu fighting British horror movie sets lots of fog machines and awful special effects highlight this slice of strange 1970's drivein camp.I can say that the kungfu sequences are pretty good although it's no 36th Chamber of Shaolin and the vampire twist is pretty different. Also it's surprisingly bloody for the age although it's no Shogun Assassin and I was entertained by some pretty good arterial spray here.All in all if you like the British horror and the kungfu stuff check this one out. Interestingly Rob Zombie puts this in his top 5 horror movies of all time. I'm not sure I'd even call this one a horror flick.6 out of 10 kids.".

	schema:headline " better than you think its going to be.";
	schema:reviewBody "Excellent if occasionally awkward mixing of the Hammer Horror films with the Shaw Brother martial arts films. The plot has Dracula going to China and taking over the body of a Chinese warlord. He then sets up a zombie army to do his bidding. Professor Van Helsing is brought in to help fight his old enemy. He joins forces with a family of martial artists and thats when the fun begins.I know it sounds silly and quite frankly it is. At the same time the film is also a real fine adventure film its not really scary. The performances are good and the action almost nonstop. Its the mixing of two genres that shouldn't work together but somehow they do.The film was originally cut up and rearranged for American release. If you've only see that shortened 75 minute version you really haven't seen the film since that removes some dialog sequences and repeats some action and horror bits to bring the whole affair up to a reasonable running time. The shorter American version is okay but its nowhere near as good as the full original version though I know at least one person who prefers it. One of the better Hammer horror films. this is must see for anyone who likes horror and martial arts films".

	schema:reviewBody "It would be easy to trash this movie based upon  poor make up  actually monsters' makeup is one of the WORST among B series movies EVER   boring soundtrack  it mostly consists of a few notes repeated ad nauseam   negligibletoabsent SFX HOWEVER This movie blazed a trail  matching suspensehorror movies with exotic legends and places  many big budget Hollywood kolossals would trek later namely BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA. Can we just imagine this movie with BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA soundtrack budget and SFX? Yet this movie's budget one decade earlier was probably 112th of BTLC's if not less. Even BTLC although a great movie for me didn't fare at its best. I find the idea of mixing 70ish HK kungfu styled action with horror and mysteries to be very good but many might disagree. Following 70s HK clichs there is no character development and acting skills are negligible. Action is great too and i shame the poor makeup and SFX. Cushing cannot act at his best looking a bit disoriented in there. A movie i've watched a few times anyways.".

That would be just as well since the actor is a very weak substitute for Christopher Lee. But it doesn't matter to the movie. It's silly but it has a lot of good things in it. It's well shot although indifferently edited the scenes of the vampires and their zombie army are genuinely creepy the action scenes are fun all the women are very attractivefor some reason the vampires first strip off their blouses maybe they moonlight or sunlight as modeling agentsand the occasional contrasts between the Christian and Buddhist religions are intriguing and might have been expanded into a general theme for the movie. The tape I saw included both the original version and the shorter American version which is a shambles. What instructions did the cutter have Mess it up?".
