	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this film at the FanTasia film festival in Montreal and was blown away by it. I really didn't expect anything and was more than surprised with the professional quality of it. High praises go to the DP for amazing lightings and colours. The filmmakers were not shy on using efficient camera movements reminiscent of Kubrick's works. The music was discreet and up to the point no cheap tricks were used here to scare us with a sudden raise in volume or other easy silly tricks we see way too often in Hollywood movies in recent years. The acting was flawless which is not only a sign of a great scriptwriter but of good direction of actors on behalf of the filmmaker. I have seen some pretty awful dialogue in some horror films which the actors obviously couldn't say with a straight face so it's nice to see some great dialogues in a horror film! But my appreciation didn't stop with the technical aspects of it. It was a very efficient horror film in the sense that it produced raw emotions for the audience. It doesn't make us jump up in our seats but it makes us cringe. This is why i call this a REAL horror film as opposed to an easytodo thriller. The ideas were original the cutting of the scenes led us to think of different possible ways the story could unfold and kept us interested till the end.Really this is a MUST SEE film. Being a Canadian film I do hope they will get good distribution and that the world will be able to see this. This team of filmmakers and actors will go far. Keep their names in mind because I would bet that we'll be hearing them a lot in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the kind of film that bitterly divides an audience. It has a complex script that teeters precariously close to the edge of convolution and being too clever for its own good. And yet for those who like it  I count myself among their number  'The Dark Hours' is the kind of film that stays with you for a long time after you've finished watching it as you chew over its possibilities again and again. It is a fascinating epistemological exercise.What I like about this movie is what may actually be more aggravating for others. I like that it doesn't tie up very nicely with an easy explanation. We as an audience can't actually know for sure what happens with certainty. The beauty of the film aside from a stellar acting job by the always excellent Aidan Devine is the use of an unreliable perspective. We learn through the course of the script that the doctor is terminally ill with cancer and that she is treating herself illegally with an experimental drug. The drug has a huge plus in that stops tumors from growing and spreading. Of course it also has two major negative side effects hallucinatory visions and an eventual coma from which no emergence seems probable. The Doctor's view of the world and by extension ours is compromised by the time she gets to the restaurant and begins to hallucinate. By the end of the film everything we see is untrustworthy and suspect.Return now to this notion of not actually knowing what goes on. It does seem fairly clear that she either suspects or discovers an adulterous affair between her husband and sister. It also seems fairly certain that when she goes into the bathroom she overdoses on the drug. Does she commit suicide after confessing her illness to her husband and sister or with psychopathic Harlan acting as a messenger from her subconscious does she discover in her coma that she has stumbled on to the lovers and murdered them in a moment of insanity with an axe? I lean towards the first possibility since it explains the rattling of the doorknob that she interprets as mice in the attic. There are many strong cases to be made for the other. The important thing though is to give 'The Dark Hours' a chance. The script doesn't really know that answer but the fun of knowing that you can't really know what happened doesn't bother me. Throw in a lightening quick pace and great tension to compliment very good performances from both Kate Greenhouse and Aidan Devine and I think you've got a pretty good movie to invest your time in.".

	schema:headline " Well done if slightly overrated little horror thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Some of the comments I've read about this movie so far seem to be a little too much on the positive side. While I'm not saying that this isn't a good film  as usual with obscure films made in countries other than the USA  there's a fair few people overrating it when really it's just another variant on the idea used in Funny Games over a decade ago which wasn't even original then done with less panache and less to say. After a slow first twenty minutes The Dark Hours finally gets going and once it does get going it does indeed become very thrilling and it's easy to see why many people enjoyed it for that reason. The idea that the movie draws on mainly is the horror of having your space invaded by a maniac and the film then dashes this central theme with ideas of immoral acts being justified and the horrors of the truth. The film follows psychiatrist Samantha Goodman as she travels to a small cabin in the woods to stay with her husband and sister. A young man who might be more than his mousy appearance suggests... soon interrupts their stay.The thing I like most about this film is the isolated 'cabin in the woods' setting. Horror classic The Evil Dead proved that this setting is a great location for horror and The Darks Hours is just one of the films to confirm that. The invaders force their innocent victims to partake in a series of macabre and terrifying games  and this too helps to add to the atmosphere that the movie is creating. Much like it did in Funny Games. The Dark Hours is brought to life by a talented cast of unknowns and director Paul Fox proves his worth by getting good performances out of all of them. Kate Greenhouse takes the lead role and is backed up by the quartet of Aidan Devine Gordon Currie Iris Graham and Dov Tiefenbach. The acting here shows how good performances can enhance a script as The Dark Hours works from a very basic plot that would be lost if the cast want up to the challenge of bring the characters to life. Overall while you wont catch me describing this film as 'terrifying' 'brilliant' or even 'intelligent' The Dark Hours is definitely worth seeing as it pulls psychological horror together with shocking gore well and represents a modest success for nonUS obscure horror.".

	onyx:emotionText "Some of the comments I've read about this movie so far seem to be a little too much on the positive side. While I'm not saying that this isn't a good film  as usual with obscure films made in countries other than the USA  there's a fair few people overrating it when really it's just another variant on the idea used in Funny Games over a decade ago which wasn't even original then done with less panache and less to say. After a slow first twenty minutes The Dark Hours finally gets going and once it does get going it does indeed become very thrilling and it's easy to see why many people enjoyed it for that reason. The idea that the movie draws on mainly is the horror of having your space invaded by a maniac and the film then dashes this central theme with ideas of immoral acts being justified and the horrors of the truth.

The process of madness of Dr. Samantha using experimental drugs as her last chance to survive and having hallucinations is impressive and very original. While watching the film I was comparing the story with Michael Haneke's Funny Game but the plot point showing that jealous Samantha actually killed her husband and sister under the effect of the drug and used her patient and his victim as a scapegoat to support the reality is refreshing. Unfortunately the Brazilian DVD is very poor without any Extras or comments that might give further explanations of the screenplay. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Horas de Horror Hours of Horror".

After realizing what movie it was I went on here the IMDb forum and saw all the gloating reviews the film was picking up. Now onto the film. The film is basically a thriller with a bit of horror elements thrown in mostly gore. The casting was brilliant as well as the screenplay. The way the film was edited together was somewhat nonlinear and it was just spoton excellent. I won't say too much about the actual film because I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it but it's very reminiscent of a French film that was released earlier this year in the states and will be on DVD this Tuesday. After the excellent film the director was there and had a Q and A session. He said the film took 18 days to shoot and that the film would most likely not get a theatrical release here in the states. He said there was a planned release for Canada at the moment. First regarding the shooting duration that just shows how talented the director and cast were. To be able to pull off great and genuine roles. However possible see this film. Be it on DVD or in the theaters. We need to support genuinely great horror films just as these.".

The Dark Hours is a quite interesting and an extremely well done thriller. It touches on a human drama exploring the dark sides of human mind but does it in a way that a viewer can relate to.

The entire movie is in a sense a selfexploration for the protagonist and is a sort of a character description done in a very beautiful way.

So this is ultimately a small ensemble filmfive characters in a couple of rooms and we get to know all of these characters very well thanks to both the writing by Wil Zmak and a fine set of performances. The characters are fully fleshed out and we can either identify andor sympathize with them so when some of them do terrible things to others it has a lot more impact and even when it's only a threat and there's nothing graphic about it we feel it almost as if these events were happening to friends. The Dark Hours is very literally a psychological film a fact reflected in its main character's occupation and the circumstances of the villainous characters.It's also a rubber reality filmthose are defined partially through shifting realities where we as an audience usually along with at least some characters don't know quite what was real if anything.

The ending of the film is clear enough while still being nicely ambiguous. There is also an alternate ending on the DVD that is less ambiguous but I don't think it works nearly as well. More ambiguity is better in a film like this.And if you want themes and subtexts Fox has them here in spades including the desperation of those who know they're dying the classic who's crazy conundrum between psychiatric professionals and their patients and the turmoil of disintegrating relationships.But you don't have to pay attention to that stuff to enjoy this excellent film.

The direction and cinematography impressed me a great deal. I don't find many films with smart layered scripts. For the first 15 minutes I was a bit offkilter. It did jump around. But I found if I just relaxed and didn't try to figure everything out the film ended up more enjoyable. It doesn't spell it out for you or hold your hand the way that most big budget films do. This is a thinking person's film.Unlike some of the reviewers I didn't find the ending confusing at all. I will say though that I did not like the alternate ending. While it was welldone I thought it completely changed the tone and meaning of the story. I am one of those people who don't need a happy ending with all the questions tied up in a little bow. I like a little mystery. I like to stretch my mind.There were some disturbing scenes in the film that may put some people off. Without giving too much away the dog thing was very hard for me to watch. It was one of those it's only a movie! moments for me. There is not much gore but what there is is cringeworthy.Overall I recommend this film for those who want to mentally participate in the unfolding of a interesting and challenging story.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dark Hours is one of those rare horror films that takes itself and its audience seriously. There is no black humour no manic referencing of horror classics and no someoneisabouttogetdiced eerie music. As a result Paul Fox has succeeded where most American film directors have failed  in making a scary movie that is actually scary.This film reminds me somewhat of Alexandre Aja's hugely overhyped Haute Tension. Both films contain violent home invasion scenarios which are subsequently turned upside down by revelations about the sanity of the protagonists. In this case the central character Samantha joins her husband and sister for a weekend in their remote cabin. Unfortunately their stay is well and truly ruined by the appearance of Harlan an expatient of Samantha's intent on revenge. As the story unfolds it becomes increasingly ambiguous as to whether Harlan is real or a projection of Samantha's own psychosis. The reason why I find The Dark Hours superior to Haute Tension is that within this film's albeit unlikely parameters the plot twist not only makes sense it also serves to raise the suspense. Neither of which can be said for the events in Aja's film.Gore hounds need not be concerned. This is not a lame psychological thriller. The Dark Hours contains a significant amount of gritty violence and one startling act of selfmutilation. The gore effects are uniformly well done and horror fans will enjoy several unexpectedly grim plot developments. The bloodshed is balance nicely by the terror of Harlan's games his interpretation of Truth or Dare was a highlight and the uncertainty about Samantha's own mental state.The performances are generally very good. Kate Greenhouse is a revelation as Samantha. Hopefully she'll be leaving Canada for Hollywood in the not too distant future. Aidan Devine is another standout as Harlan. This actor has been underappreciated for far too long. Harlan is yet another memorable character to add to his long list. The supporting cast is not as impressive. The actors who play Samantha's husband and sister are rather dismal. Their responses during the Truth or Dare game are unintentionally amusing which was really quite a feat given the context. Paul Fox contributes to the film's success with his stylish direction particularly his innovative use of sound effects and editing.The Dark Hours leaves a number of questions unanswered. You do not have to scratch too far beneath the surface to find holes in the plot even if they are neatly camouflaged by flashbacks and clever editing. Despite these faults I enjoyed the film immensely. I just wish someone could tell me what that damn noise in the attic was meant to signify.".

She has hallucinations and occasionally will blank out and see people's mouths moving but hear no sound. That's the first sign of things to come.

He knows she is sick and has a tumor but he is not aware of the results she's gotten from the most recent tests. He tells her that he is busy and he has to finish writing his book so he can't. He will be too busy with her younger sister who is apparently jobless and still living at home. She helps him edit his work.Sam leaves and proceeds to join them anyway at their cabin in the woods. Not long after she arrives there is a knock at the door and a stranger comes into the house. Then the unthinkable happensa patient of Sam's who was in a coma and not likely to live suddenly shows up at their door too. Apparently the first guy is his accomplice and they are out to torture and terrorize Sam and her family.What's going on here really? Will Sam be able to escape with her life? And what will happen to her husband and her little sister? You can find most of this info out from reading other reviews. I just thought I would add my 2 cents worth. I thought this movie was boring. The acting was poor especially Sam's sister. The psychopathic drifter the madman's apprentice was also very corny and poorly acted. The plot twists were all supposed to be shocking revelations but really they were simply predictable and staid. They've been done before and better in many other films. There was not a single moment of anything even resembling tension or scariness in this film.I got this film for free so I can't complain about wanting my money back. However to those of you who have not yet offered up your money DON'T BOTHER! It's a huge waste of time. Go see something else that's more worthwhile and leave this on the shelves where it belongs.".

The Dark Hours a Canadian production is much like a combination between Funny Games where two psychopathic killers take a family hostage and forces then to play sadistic games and any film take your pick where the protagonist can't tell fantasy from reality due to a mental condition.In some films the effects of fear and unpleasantness are achieved by frightening and startling the spectators often using cheap cheats like sudden loud music. Not such is the case in The Dark Hours. In this film the audience is in a way tortured along with the characters.Nothing makes a good Horror film great like some unexpected and surprising twists. In this film  what at first bothered me was the fact that the questions asked aren't fully answered. Meaning the audience can't know for sure what really happened and what didn't. Eventually I realized that this feature was exactly what made this film what it is.What's real? What really happened and what happened only in the protagonist's imagination? Come the film's end  you'll be debating with your friends or yourself as the film provides halfproofs to support or disprove any theory.Personally I prefer it when the twists and endings of films do in fact answer all the the questions the original story plants in the spectators' minds making us go Ohhhhhh now I get it!. Still I really appreciate the M.O this film uses to invoke confusion and despair.I do think tagging this film scifi is pretty inaccurate but I guess this is a matter of personal interpretation like almost everything else about it.All in all The Dark Hours proved to be an original and mindblowing film taking the audience for a ride of questions and confusion. For me  that has really done the trick. Very highly recommended for any Horror fan who enjoys it when films successfully mess with their minds!".

It is annoying watching the rest of the movie knowing what is gonna happened and at the end realizing you were all right but despite all the bad things I wrote the movie succeeded keeping me awake and I think that the movie deserves to be watched.";

	schema:reviewBody "It all starts off so well too. The opening shot of Wolfgang Petersen's Poseidon is beautiful. A single take that begins beneath the surface of the ocean that swings up and out of it as the underside of the ship slices through the waves before pivoting round the colossal cruise liner and zeroing in on Josh Lucas running on the deck. With the sun setting in the distance and the immense size of the vessel itself contrasted with the deep blue of the water this is a visually astounding entrance to a movie that is unfortunately very shallow indeed.A remake of the classic disaster movie The Poseidon Adventure this tells much the same story with a small group of passengers trying to escape a doomed ocean liner after it capsizes due to a freak wave. Given the beloved status of the original besting it was going to be tricky from the start so how to do it? Bestow the characters with as much depth and humanity as possible arrange it so that you don't want any of them to die just as the original film did? No. That isn't the 21st Century Studio Approach to blockbusters at all the trick is explosions! Lots of explosions! And dangerous stunts that happen in very quick succession with no set up whatsoever.As a result things happen very quickly. We've hardly got to know anyone on the ship before the wave strikes and sends their world tumbling upside down in a hail of glass and debris. Trapped beneath the waves there is no debate on the best means of survival but instead a bull headed rush to escape as soon as possible and before you know it barely any time has elapsed before we have our luckless nobodies dangling from lift shafts diving through burning oil slicks or scrambling up air vents rapidly filling with water. This could all be very entertaining if it wasn't so empty and if only they'd eased back on the throttle a little bit we could have had a much more successful film.Kurt Russell for instance is wasted. As an ex firefighter and former Mayor of New York with a failed marriage behind him they could have crafted the image of a troubled man going through a midlife crisis who finds himself tested beyond his limits. Instead the only hints at any characterisation are him protesting his daughter's cleavage bearing dress to leave no doubt that theirs is a strained relationship. Then there is Richard Dreyfuss who has finally found a bigger boat whose character might as well be listed in the credits as depressed elderly gay man. Everyone else is just as vacuous and while Josh Lucas is certainly a charismatic focal point it cannot make up for the two dimensional stereotypes of Kevin Dillon's gambler Lucky Larry or Mike Vogel's performance as Christian the fiance of Russell's daughter who manages to put in perhaps the worst attempt at acting you will see in a blockbuster this year.It does have a few commendable points though. One death scene involving a lift shaft jagged metal spikes and an explosion is an adrenaline pumping crowd pleaser and the aforementioned scramble through the flooding ventilation shaft is really quite tense the ensemble cast squeezed together in a claustrophobic nightmare as the water bubbles up around them. Ultimately though it is not enough to save it. Poseidon may make for a diverting hour and a half but Hollywood needs to learn a valuable lesson about plotting bigger explosions and insane stunts are nowhere near as impressive if we don't care about the people involved. The original version made an entire generation terrified of getting on a boat with Ernest Borgnine this is just laughable.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the original POSEIDON ADVENTURE the venerable SS Poseidon was on its last voyage even before it had a wave of bad luck. Headed to port to be turned to scrap the aging luxury liner was comfortably aged and loaded down with a bunch of amiable Blist movie stars playing rather endearingly ordinary people. POSEIDON the remake is apparently far from being on its last leg sparkling new and lavishly decorated in nondescript tasteless elegance it is carrying a passenger list of dubious VIPs who don't even have enough dimension to be clichs and are played by actors who though competent would barely even rate being on the Blist. But it does seem to have a healthy cargo of things that blow up. Indeed it seems that more of the unfortunate victims of this seagoing disaster meet fiery deaths than watery ones  explosions being far more photogenic than the inability to hold ones breath for very long.POSEIDON the new movie is very much like Poseidon the new ship cold efficient impersonal and doomed to sink like a rock. The most remarkable thing about this SS Poseidon is that it has a huge bridge full of technicians and flashing electronic gizmos yet the 150foot tidal wave that flips the boat sneaks up on everyone without warning. Apparently the wave spotting equipment they use is from the same company that created iceberg detecting equipment for the Titanic. Indeed the first person to spot the tidal wave is a passenger played by a strangely subdued Richard Dreyfuss whose impromptu suicide attempt is rudely interrupted. The movie itself is pretty much an empty vessel though it is certainly a product of its time. Trivial concerns such as story and character are jettisoned in favor of elaborate and expensive sets and CGI special effects. Indeed the imagery of the new POSEIDON is most impressive and outshines the thencutting edge productions values of the 1972 original. Yet it isn't nearly as effective in any regard. The original film had its ragtag band of survivalists interacting with their topsyturvy environment where this time the stunts and sets and CGI simply overwhelm everything and everybody. Like so many CGI blockbusters human interaction is merely a bothersome detail the real focus being on the violent extermination of masses of nameless faceless victims. And once again Hollywood has mistaken technological gimmickry for storytelling skill. When the film does try to escape from tired predictability it bites off far more than it can chew. At one point a main character is compelled to kill another character in order to save himself yet this intense and perverse moment early in the film is never dealt with again. The surviving character must neither redeem himself or face karmic punishment for his act. The secondary character is just killed and forgotten  presumably because the character and the actor playing the part weren't important enough to care about. After that it is hard to care about the fate of anyone else. The film has no sense of humanity let alone a sense of humor about the absurdity of the entire premise.The cast not unduly burdened with characters to play or chances to actually act run the obstacle course with dogged professionalism. Kurt Russell is no Gene Hackman but he is in the unfortunate position of being too good of an actor for this type of film yet not big enough of a star to actually carry it. Young Jimmy Bennet is perfectly convincing as a terrified child and Josh Lucas has an impressive underbite perfectly suited for jutting out his chin in fierce determination. Other than that the cast is unremarkable sadly lacking even any Carol Lynleys or Pamela Sue Martins let alone such wonderfully hammy pros like Roddy McDowall Stella Stevens Ernest Borgnine or the inimitable Shelley Winters. None of the charactersactors stand out enough to be sympathetic endearing or even memorable. Indeed the three female leads  Jacinda Barrett Emmy Rossum and Ma Maestro  are so interchangeable that it is hard to tell their characters apart. I suppose that the filmmakers wanted this to be like the remake of KING KONG an eyepopping special effects reinvention of a wellworn story. But instead POSEIDON ends up being like the woefully unnecessary remake of PSYCHO there was no need demand or purpose for this film to exist and the filmmakers reveal they have no apparent clue as to why the original is loved in the first place. That's what happens when you set sail without a compass you just get lost at sea.".

Before you jump on the bandwagon and start bashing it on this basis alone keep it mind that the original film was not exactly a masterpiece. It was a film that sacrificed scientific reality to propel an inane plot filled with onedimensional characters and compensated for it with actionoverload. Poseidon is exactly the same  ridiculous plot intrepid characters and big slice of adventure. What is different in this version is the masterful CGI. This is a perfect time to remake a film like this much better than in 1972  just go overboard with special effects and no one will notice the flawed writing which is basically a sketchbook mess.This is the reason Poseidon does not fail in entertaining the audience. I'll admit that I was skeptical when Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas appeared in all her plastic surgery glory and Josh Lucas spouted out some cheeseball line Where is the disco? Why you feel like dancing now? but I set its cringeworthy dialogue aside early on and focused my energy on not wanting to kill Fergie. The giant tidal wave capsizing the luxury liner Poseidon would take care of that leaving only a small group of people fighting to reach the top and get out. Another thing besides special effects that is by far better in this version is that the characters are actually interested in surviving and do not stop every few minutes for a petty argument as in The Poseidon Adventure 1972. Make no mistake however these characters are still dumb to the core getting by on lucky circumstances occasional heroic feats and conveniently appearing objects and hatches  you've seen it all before but damn this is sensationally quality action.Overall Poseidon is bathed in a militantly hectic mood and is as fastpaced as any action film you'll see. It features mindnumbing special effects overdoses of excitement and just typical Wolfgang Peterson overkill. It definitely won't disappoint you if you're looking for cheap but solid adrenaline kicks. I'd even happily sit through this experience again.6.510".

Oh thats right  Armageddon. You have the annoying drunk which ends you are supposed to hate so they die so that seems like a just death.Anyways so the characters are clichd and so are the circumstances this movie could have been better if it had more special effects but it only have a small wave. I thought this kind of movie which was clichd went out in the 70's and 80's at least disaster movies these days if they follow the clichs do it subtlety and it also has good special effects to help keep it afloat this movie was so obvious in its clichs.Also did I miss something  as where did they get the lifeboat and flare gun from in the end?Also some more convenient circumstances  1 guy goes down to reverse the engines so they can all live and cant find the button is just about to die and with his last dying breath finds and presses the button2 they all escape the ship just as it goes down3 two helicopters appear moments after firing off a flare gunand hows some of the dialogue.. I think it was Richard Dreyfuss who says I'm an architect so I know ships aren't designed to stay afloat upside down.. Since when does it require to be an architect to work this out??This movie was a shame and feels like it jumped right out of the 70's disaster era. This is one of the worst movies I have seen".

	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood you better get your act together. Thanks you for spitting out another INSTANTLY forgettable Blockbuster Thank God I only paid 4 dollars to see this. Not only can't the Studios come up with original material. The material they remake is worse than the original. If this crap keeps up you will have even less of an audience. A good cast given nothing to chew on and a Director who has made great films and this is what we get? 150 million and the Ballroom set in the original was more impressive?Video games are so prevalent in society that I fear their mind numbing influence is starting to permeate even NON video game derived movies. The original movie was a good solid involving movie. This remake takes every element of the original and removes what made it involving. I mean EVERY element. There are people out there making these decisions!! And they are paid huge sums to make these decisions! With the talent in front of and behind the camera this is truly frightening as this seems to be the norm at the present.Right from the start there is almost NO set up. We don't know where the ship is where it is sailing even what ocean it's on! Things that actually would create some atmosphere like the originals speech by the Captain explaining the origin of Poseidon. Greek God of the Sea. They are sailing on the Mediterranean to Greece? Get it? Cheesy but involving. You know it gives the proceedings some gravatis some mystery. In the remake we get nothing we are are in Video game land we don't have time for such things.Even the cause for the disaster has absolutely no set up. Happy new year bang the tidal wave hits. Unlike the originals slow build up as it explained WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHY! Even the effects in the original worked better. They were simpler but executed as a whole created more of an impact because of the tension that was built up. Again a sense of gravity HUMAN INVOLVEMENT and Atmosphere! Even in the original Leslie Nielsen's corny grimace as the wave engulfs the ship. It's goofy but you REMEMBER IT. You know a character we identify with reacting to the impending disaster. It's a very basic cinematic technique. But I guess todays more sophisticated audience don't need this kind of thing anymore.There is no human involvement in the wave hitting in this remake. The Captain isn't called to the bridge no build up just some crew members we've had no contact with running around. Absolutely unmemorable. The effects are impressive but who cares I'm not given anything to latch on to.Straight across the board EVERY situation is diminished from the original. The scene chewing conflict between Gene Hackaman and Ernest Borgnine is totally lost in the remake. There is NO conflict with the characters. NONE! It's just one disaster to overcome to the next. You know  like a VIDEO GAME.Even the self sacrificing Shelly Winters death swim has almost no emotional impact because the character doesn't return and die in front of everybody. Like DUH! Hey screen writers perhaps you should learn of something called ELEMENTS OF DRAMA!! Even if you have no talent you could at least COPY the original not make it worse! Absolutely mind boggling!! If you WANTED to sabotage the original you couldn't have done a better job. UNREAL! All you film lovers just keep repeating Things will get better Repeat it like a prayer.".

	schema:headline " Not a Remake...";
	schema:reviewBody "It is important to point out that this new film is only based on THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE ... it is not a remake. When a passenger ship named Poseidon is hit by a large wave on New Years Eve and capsizes a handful of people struggle to escape. Other than that do not expect any similarities  not one character not one line of dialog not one scene...I first saw the original film when I was ten years old and have been a huge fan ever since. Surely TPA as imperfect as it may be was the catalyst that spurred my interest in ocean liners architecture classical music ... and Art Deco design. Therefore I was excited about the latest film  and pleased that it had been given to a talented director. I knew that the film and its characters had been changedupdated and was cool with that. But after viewing the new film twice now I feel a bit let down.I don't want to touch on the stale characters. Although it is a major flaw that subject has already been addressed again and again on this board.The cast with the exception of Dreyfuss are ALL buff and beautiful  no fatties or uglies here. Of course some of the physical obstacles in this film would require the endurance of a champion athlete and the bravado of a Schwarzenegger action hero! This is definitely not the motley group of survivors found in the original.The CGI graphics were very good. The ship was beautiful in a glitzy Las Vegas sort of way ... but the Poseidon never seemed very real to me. Perhaps it was all those overly elaborate CGI camera shots? Not really sure why. The Titanic certainly seemed real in TITANIC. But for me the Poseidon seemed as plastic as the people on it.The capsizing sequence was stunning but so many areas of the ship were highlighted in such a short time that I never really felt I was part of the action. There were no screaming passengers clingingfalling from overturned tables. No man falling backwards onto an illuminated skylight a famous cinematic scene. And no Christmas tree!?! The Christmas tree played a pivotal role in the original film ... from passengers falling into it during the capsizing ... to it unexpectedly crashing down ... to the survivors climbing it and Mrs. Rosen getting stuck in the spokes ... to it falling back into the flooding Dining Room when panic ensues! Why leave it out entirely when there are so many cinematic possibilities? Instead the characters in the new film sneak out of the Ballroom using some stacked chairs. There is absolutely no plea for others to join them even though they know that anyone left behind may die. I suppose it says something about today's society ... I'm getting out of here  to hell with everyone else!. But these guys are supposed to be the heroes in the film?Don't expect much humor in this film either. I really missed the funny scene with the upsidedown bathroom set. I can't imagine not working that into the new movie! But these new actionsurvivors don't seem to require toilets ... or rest. They keep going and going  through one unrealistic scenario one after another!It was strange that the survivors find heaps of dead bodies everywhere they go but never any other survivors. A ship this size would be expected to have over 4000 people onboard. Where are they? When our survivors merge in the NightclubDisco they then struggle to find an escape route. So where did the 200300 other people who left the room moments earlier go? And why can't our survivors seem to find a staircaseelevator core on this ship? Every modern passenger ship has several  found every 200feet or so. There is always one adjacent to the atrium in addition to the grand stairway and glass elevators. Perhaps all the other people immediately ran up one of the usually everpresent staircases and escaped out a porthole hours earlier? That would certainly explain the absence of other people...I must admit that I missed John William's music from the original. I wonder why he wasn't hired to update his existing TPA score  dramatic in all the right places and the deep bell sound accompanying the music is indeed haunting. And wouldn't it be fun for all us oldtimers if they had used The Morning After Academy Awardwinning song from the original and updated it in the new film?As fun as the original film may have been I know that it is flawed so some rewriting would be expected. And the producers obviously felt the need to update the original film to appeal to modern movie and cruising audiences. But this new version seems soulless. I feel that they may have been better off setting the film in 1972 and using the original campy script! That wonderful but cheesy dialog ran the gamut from the ridiculous to the sublime! Some of the quotes are classics! The new film's dialog is completely forgettable.I suppose that this new film is fine if you are not expecting much. I was obviously hoping that Petersen would turn the original film into another TITANIC. But this POSEIDON is what it is ... a mindless summer action movie with dazzling special effects. Should appeal to teenagers. Though it is doubtful that this new film will inspire many youths or ever become a cult classic. And decades from now will it have web pages fan clubs and conventions devoted to it?Actually I'm guessing that by this time next year this POSEIDON will be largely forgotten ... as it should be.".

Talk about impatience can't we wait to get home to surf the net. I just think that the director knew today's audience that would go to see this movie did not have the patience to sit through any character development and got to the action as quickly as he could. We reap what we sow.The special effects were good and most of the action scenes were on the edge of your seat intense.The thing that really spoiled the movie for me was the ending. HERE'S THE SPOILER. Wasn't it convenient that a life raft with a flare gun was waiting for the survivors as they jumped out of the ship. Am I the only one who thought this to be totally absurd and clich.".

Talk about impatience can't we wait to get home to surf the net. I just think that the director knew today's audience that would go to see this movie did not have the patience to sit through any character development and got to the action as quickly as he could. We reap what we sow.The special effects were good and most of the action scenes were on the edge of your seat intense.The thing that really spoiled the movie for me was the ending. HERE'S THE SPOILER. Wasn't it convenient that a life raft with a flare gun was waiting for the survivors as they jumped out of the ship. Am I the only one who thought this to be totally absurd and clich.";

	schema:reviewBody "On New Year's Eve the luxury cruise ship Poseidon is hit by an enormous wave that flips it upsidedown stranding thousands of passengers underwater. A group of passengers join together to try to escape the ship.The original Poseidon was decent disaster film. It had engaging characters decent special effects and a cheesy storyline. The remake is more or less the same minus the interesting characters charm and suspense. Okay the remake did have a few suspenseful scenes though nothing very memorable or original. The reason why the film wasn't very suspenseful was because the characters were all one dimensional and dull. There was no character development at all so it was hard to care for these people. While watching the movie it's just easier to refer to them as generic titles like the old guy or something. Actually if you use this method then you can probably figure out who will die and in what order they will die.The acting is very weak and unconvincing. Josh Lucas is an okay actor but he wasn't very good here. He just didn't make a good hero nor was his character very likable. Kurt Russell was okay nothing special. Emmy Rossum was terrible as Jennifer. Her performance felt so forced and over the top. The way she expressed her emotions just looked so fake and unconvincing. Jimmy Bennett was just annoying as Conor. Richard Dreyfuss was very misused and his character seemed out of place. Jacinda Barrett gives a laughable performance it was just very poor. I should warn you or comfort you? that Stacy Ferguson from the Black Eyed peas is only in the movie for about 10 minutes maybe a little less.When judged as a disaster film Poseidon is actually pretty decent. The special effects were great though 160 million was obviously just a bit too much. Wolfgang Petersen is really good at making a film appear stylish including the ship which looked amazing. His storytelling skills aren't as good though. The combination of a weak script didn't help matters either. The movie was just too corny at times for my taste. For example there was once scene where Josh Lucas was planning to escape the ballroom and one by one the rest of the characters just come up and ask to come along. It was just a bit too obvious and they should have handled it differently. I also thought it was kind of dumb that all the characters were able to hold their breath underwater for large amounts of time. Despite these flaws there were a few engaging scenes and some touching moments. Also the movie is pretty short so it's not really too much of a pain to sit through. This helped the experience a little though I wouldn't have minded a longer movie. In the end Poseidon may not be worth checking out in theaters but it should make for a decent rental. Rating 610".

The best bit is the special effects which are absolutely top drawer. For some reason Hollywood can do some really good FX and CGI when it comes to boats and the CGI rendition of the Poseidon itself in the opening scene is incredibly well done.Top marks also to the Producers for making sure the Poseidon is a proper British flagged Southampton registered ship and not some Americanised tub.Much like its predecessor though I fully expect this version to become stable Bank Holiday afternoon television filler material for the next twenty years.

How come the boyfriend show absolutely no signs of injury 10 minutes after being freed from the lighting rig? Dreyfuss should have been dead after getting hit by that door.

Where are the original ideas? The Hollywood movie industry and most of American TV for that matter has become far too idealistic in my view. The characters are depicted as not how people really are but how we would like them to be and the viewers often emulate what they see on screen as if life actually IS like that. Why should it be all about the 'bottom line'. Out of the top 10 top grossing movies each year how many actually make a profit? It seems to be a matter of just churning out this sort of garbage and hoping for the best. Why don't the major studios spend the same amount of money making fewer but better films? One wonders sometimes how people are convinced into investing good money in making this rubbish. Poseidon? So far this 'blockbuster' has grossed 50 million  a long way from the 140 million it cost to make. Chances are it won't even break even. It becomes very obvious right from the start that it is formulaic and clichd. For example why anyone in their right mind would take a woman and her young son along with the exploring party is anyone's guess. Probably because they prove useful along the way. The Hispanic busboy Valentine who tags along was the obvious candidate to die being a nonentity an unknown actor. It's all squarely aimed at the 'demographic'  the 1330 group. That's why there is always a child involved in the story why most of the characters are 30 years old  and good looking. That's why we have a politically correct cast with a black captain Hispanic entertainers etc. There is a always a love interest to attract the female segment of the audience and there is always a happy ending one way or another. We have the usual combination of 'B' list actors and those desperate for work who go through the motions of what passes for acting these days. 'Stand on your mark and say your line when it's your turn'. Don't the directors realize that when people talk to one another they often interrupt one another? Robert Altman knows this but few others. The special effects are good but with a few too many quick camera movements that are hard on the eye after a while. After only a few minutes I realized that I had seen this movie before in all its forms. Even though the backdrop changes the character development is always the same. The guy who cares only for himself discovers that he has some redeeming features The hero will do heroic things and maybe make the supreme sacrifice to save others.

	schema:headline " Who will Survive? NOT the audience!";
	schema:reviewBody "Paul Gallico's novel published in 1969 is not so much a disaster novel as it is a grim character study of people caught up in a disaster. The book is gripping in it's savage brutality. The character's are stripped of all pretensions and self delusions. They reveal more and more of their inner selves as they climbed further and further into the ship.The 1972 film only hinted at this. The Hallmark TV film only had conventional characters who reacted in conventional and unsurprising ways to the various challenges.Now Wolfgang Peterson has stripped the story of all humanity and created what amounts to a two hour film in which the audience watches a very large kinetic sculpture designed to destroy itself. The actors seem to be more like cogs and wheels in that sculpture than human beings. There is no character development and no plot. Yes the special effects are fantastic especially as the wave strikes and capsizes the ship. The sets are stunning but sterile and the action is absolutely nonstop. And THAT is all the film has going for it. Peterson seems to be catering to those with minds only developed enough to pay attention to movement and pretty lights like a small baby watching a mobile hung over its crib.Many of the actors are quite good. We know that because of their past bodies of work. Unfortunately in this film they may as well have had animated wax figures playing their roles. True the Irwin Allen film had a number of overblown and hammy performances but those actors at least had something to bite into. A lobotomized Frances Farmer would have been able to handle these empty insignificant characters. In interviews Richard Dreyfuss commented that he did this film for money. I certainly understand that! He definitely didn't do it because it was a great part. He played a gay man suicidal and depressed because his lover has left him. Unfortunately his being gay seemed rather gratuitous. Publicity for the film stated that he suddenly discovers he very much wants to live. This also seemed gratuitous.Kurt Russell plays the role of a former NYC firefighter and mayor and seems to have fallen into the real life role of aging action hero making way for younger action hero. Kevin Dylan plays a character named Lucky Larry who seemed obviously patterned after computer game icon Leisure Suit Larry. His character would have been quite enjoyable had he not been so reprehensible.As far as the rest of the cast went you may as well have taken them like so many Barbie and Ken dolls popped off their heads and interchanged them.The costumes were pretty much what you might expect to see aboard ship on New Year's Eve but nothing strikingly great. The only one that stood out was the singer who I understand is a member of The Blackeyed Peas. It was so awful I mistook her for a Charo impersonator. But at least it stood out.One thing I must give the filmmakers an A on. The underwater shots of the ship were extraordinarily impressive. The attention to detail with all the debris and parts of the ship breaking away seemed very realistic. I do have a final question however and a nitpicky one at that. Do they no longer bolt down tables and other large furniture aboard luxury liners?".

	onyx:emotionText "Paul Gallico's novel published in 1969 is not so much a disaster novel as it is a grim character study of people caught up in a disaster. The book is gripping in it's savage brutality. The character's are stripped of all pretensions and self delusions. They reveal more and more of their inner selves as they climbed further and further into the ship.The 1972 film only hinted at this. The Hallmark TV film only had conventional characters who reacted in conventional and unsurprising ways to the various challenges.Now Wolfgang Peterson has stripped the story of all humanity and created what amounts to a two hour film in which the audience watches a very large kinetic sculpture designed to destroy itself. The actors seem to be more like cogs and wheels in that sculpture than human beings. There is no character development and no plot. Yes the special effects are fantastic especially as the wave strikes and capsizes the ship. The sets are stunning but sterile and the action is absolutely nonstop. And THAT is all the film has going for it. Peterson seems to be catering to those with minds only developed enough to pay attention to movement and pretty lights like a small baby watching a mobile hung over its crib.Many of the actors are quite good. We know that because of their past bodies of work. Unfortunately in this film they may as well have had animated wax figures playing their roles. True the Irwin Allen film had a number of overblown and hammy performances but those actors at least had something to bite into. A lobotomized Frances Farmer would have been able to handle these empty insignificant characters. In interviews Richard Dreyfuss commented that he did this film for money. I certainly understand that! He definitely didn't do it because it was a great part. He played a gay man suicidal and depressed because his lover has left him. Unfortunately his being gay seemed rather gratuitous. Publicity for the film stated that he suddenly discovers he very much wants to live. This also seemed gratuitous.Kurt Russell plays the role of a former NYC firefighter and mayor and seems to have fallen into the real life role of aging action hero making way for younger action hero. Kevin Dylan plays a character named Lucky Larry who seemed obviously patterned after computer game icon Leisure Suit Larry. His character would have been quite enjoyable had he not been so reprehensible.As far as the rest of the cast went you may as well have taken them like so many Barbie and Ken dolls popped off their heads and interchanged them.The costumes were pretty much what you might expect to see aboard ship on New Year's Eve but nothing strikingly great.

Poseidon is an especially unnecessary remake. As happens so often with remakes the remakers squander the original's appeal as if they have no idea why 1972's The Poseidon Adventure was a hit. Video games must have influenced the film too. As an intrepid group of characters make their way through the bowels of an overturned ocean liner they're tested by one chamber of death after another.Knowing so little about Poseidon's characters it's difficult to care about their fates. On the contrary characters in The Poseidon Adventure are practically members of the family. The acting wasn't anything special and most of them where Blist celebrities who where trying to get noticed by the public to reestablish their careers.Overall this film wasn't anything above average. And will never be anything compared to the 1972 classic. Don't waste your time on this one it isn't worth it.110 See It If You Liked The Poseidon Adventure and Titanic Luke Rowe".

	schema:reviewBody "99 minutes of my life I'll never get back ... Hey Hollywood ... how 'bout I just bend over next time?Wow! Where to begin? What a pathetic excuse for a movie! I just read through about 12 of the pages and it's comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. Though I am worried about the very few who raved about it especially the guy see page 15 who had seen it 3 times and was going back for a 4th ... a 4th!!! Let's see ... 396 minutes of this joker's life given to this movie that's 6.6 hours to you and me Russ not to mention the money. Are you kidding? Did you just receive the gift of sight after a life of blindness? Were you raised by apes in the jungle? Wolves in the forest? Don't have movies on your planet? What could it be?First of all why why why remake this? Laziness? Apathy? Maybe it was a dare. Whatever you do DON'T bother to create characters and write a script! What a waste of budget that would be. Please spend it on obviously overdone CGI! What a miserable cast! I honestly didn't care if one single person made it out alive! In fact I was rooting for Josh Lucas' overdone jaded gambler to bite it every step of the way! Note to Mr. Lucas Matthew McConaughey called and he wants you to stop trying to be him!The only character I had one iota of concern for was Valentin Freddy Rodriguez who is promptly killed by Richard Dreyfous to save himself just moments after having one leg over the railing in an 'I'mdespondentbecausemyloverleftme' sulk. Wait! Maybe he was just disgusted that Fergie was the musical act of the evening! Come to think of it I might have sought other options myself ... So you've got this meager cast of characters who you know only enough of not to like. Kurt Russell's character's daughter is a spoiled brat who immediately let's you know she will not be 'patronized' and had a miserable childhood with a father who was mayor of New York. Pity. Nope. Don't care if she or her fianc make it  especially after the straightfrom daytimesoaps scene in the end! I need you to tell me you love me he says as he dawdles so long before diving down to go turn off the propellers they're only hope at this point that Kurt Russell gets tired of waiting and sacrifices himself! Perhaps it was the bad acting that made him take the plunge. Who knows?Then there was the kid with the bad haircut and the tendency to wander off. Sigh I won't even go there. Within minutes the ship hits the wave and flips all with absolutely no warning yet the bridge is loaded with the most modern system out there. All we get is a 'did you feel that?' and then confirmation via binoculars that sure enough death approaches in the form of an unannounced 'rouge wave!' Sound the alarm! Now we're upside down. The special effects were decent and it was exciting but it's over in seconds. When the dust settles we're left with a ballroom with chandeliers on the floor bodies and debris everywhere but something's missing ... what could it be ... Oh!!! The Christmas TREE!!! The enormous tree that was conveniently bolted to the ground hanging from the now ceiling which allowed the original cast to climb out is not there!!! Here we go again Hollywood. For the love of God  oops! sorry!  let's not offend anyone! 'We can't have a Christmas tree! Other religions will complain! I don't care if it was a giant menorah or if they shimmied up Buddhas face! That was a major scene in the original! Tsk! Tsk!Once out of the ballroom the start button on the video game is pressed and we march on obstacle after obstacle to the bottom  now the top  of the boat so we can get out and BR rescued. Make a bridge climb jump swing over the pit of fire ... all that was missing were power pellets and warp zones! Every now and then someone dies. Whoopie! Cross another one off. Who had money on someone panicking in the air shaft? You win! We almost lose haircut boy but to no avail. Jaded gambler guy comes to his rescue  probably only so he can bag his mother if and when they do make it out of there. Finally we lose Kurt Russell who either drowns or his body rejects his facelift. Can't really tell. Again don't care. Never did. One more gone. Check! However he manages to reverse the engines as he breathes his last thus subjecting us to the rest for a little while longer. Not so long story short they jam the propellers and climb out to fresh air. And wouldn't you know it? Magically there is a lifeboat just floating there! What?!? What?!? Someone must have entered a cheat code! I'm sorry but this can't be serious!! Why not just have another cruise ship just happen by scoop them up and they can carry on celebrating the new year? Better yet how about that alien we mentioned earlier swing by in his UFO and take them back to his planet where they can live forever as gods! Whaaaaaaa????Preposterous! Absurd! Ridiculous! Downright laughable!They fire a flare and within seconds two helicopters appear and we are finally rescued from our personal disaster!What a waste! Everyone involved should be ashamed! Save your time and money! Go watch the original! ... the one with 'adventure' in the title for a reason!!".

It felt like this film was edited with a hack saw that took away all suspense. All of a sudden a wave comes and it turns over.

I saw the original when I was 10 and one burned chef in the kitchen was really heartbreaking. But now people are bar b cued in flash fires or electrocuted in nightclubs with no feeling. when Lucas tells Dreyfus to deliberately drop the waiter in order to save himself then Drefus kicks the poor guy to his death  you could really feel the audience detach.

Now the film THE POSIEDON ADVENTURE had many enduring and endearing characters worth remembering. Has Hollywood stooped so low that now every film has to have the token this and the token that. You had some really good and talented actors playing really bad parts.The CGI effects for this flick were great but good FX do not a movie make. The new SS POSIEDON looks clean and cold. No character but a cookie cutter of every other modern cruise ship and with all its modern technology couldn't detect a huge rogue wave coming straight for her. Now the SS Posiedon in the POSIEDON ADVENTURE was a character unto herself. You knew the ship's back story and its certainly near future was already decided but she had character. That's not something that you can get from a computer driven image.Let's see Hollywood go back to using scale models of ships in sea disaster flicks rather that saving the budget and go with a computer image.The flick is not worth seeing on the big screen. Wait to rent it far cheaper and you got twofive days with it.On the IMDb scale a generous 3 out of 10 On my movie scale 1 out of 4".

People say that everything is CGI. Not true. The only things that are CGI in the whole film are the ship the wave. That's it. Everything else is sets. People actually were thrown around the place. Water did come in to the ballroom. I think some people don't give this film enough credit. The first time I watched it I was in awe. It was such a convincing film. The look of the ship and how it interacted with light made it look so real. Sure some of the film is farfetched. And sure you don't get to know the people on board. But that is because of the pace. They can't stand there for halfanhour spewing their guts out about themselves when the ship is sinking. The pace of the film is supposed to be rushed. The ship is sinking and it's not going to stop sinking to let the people stop for a break. So I say give the film a break. If you haven't seen it and are judging it on what your friends family have said ignore them. Watch it for yourself you may find the film is actually better than what others say.

	schema:reviewBody "www.kajatm.com It has been said that the imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. However when it comes to remakes in Hollywood imitation often result in movies that are far worst than the original. The remakes that have actually turned out to be good while limited have had some success in recent years. Such movies as the Thomas Crown Affair Ocean's 11 Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Grudge and The Italian Job we very well done and have become some of my favorites. Poseidon my friends is not one of these movies.Just like the original Poseidon is the story about a new cruise ship that has been struck by a rogue wave which results in the ship flipping over and trapping the guest within the sinking ship. The main characters of the original have been replaced by Josh Lucas Kurt Russell Richard Dreyfuss and Jimmy Bennett. Again just like the original a group of passengers realize that if they stay where the captain wants them to stay they are in certain doom and will end up drowning. And this is where Poseidon lost me. Where is the compelling speech from Josh Lucas just like Gene Hackman before him to try and convince the passengers to follow him out of the ship? The whole scene is lost without this speech. Why is it that from that point forward it seems like the whole new version of Poseidon is on fast forward? There is no plot development no character development and basically it just seems like Wolfgang Peterson had something better to do while making this movie. I understand that the ship is sinking and they have to get off as soon as possible but I distinctly remember the original having the same story line and I didn't feel like the characters were running some obstacle course that they needed to get through in 2 minutes. I think that if he would have taken the time to watch the original he would have come to the realization that he could have put 30 more minutes in the movie and it probably would have turned out better.The only positive thing that I saw about this movie was the scenes that showed the ship getting hit by the rogue wave. I would like to take the time to thank whoever created CGI. People flying everywhere people dying water taking over the boat and just the realistic destruction that they can create using a computer is really amazing. This is the only category that tops the original. But outside of that this movie left me very unsatisfied.Some classic movies such as The Great Escape The Dirty Dozen Empire Strikes Back The Magnificent Seven The Wizard of OZ Caddy Shack Airplane Jaws Raging Bull Cool Hand Luke The Sting and Rear Window should automatically go on the These Movies Reached Perfection the First Time so we are Never Ever Remaking Them! list. Poseidon Adventure should have been one of these movies. I hate the fact that nothing is sacred in Hollywood.Give me Gene Hackman give me Ernest Borgnine give me Red Buttons give me Roddy McDowell and give me the original Poseidon Adventure. Don't give me Josh Lucas don't give me Kurt Russell don't give me Kevin Dillion and don't give me the new Poseidon. If you have never seen the original Poseidon Adventure I fully expect you to enjoy this movie but unfortunately I have and that ruined my movie experience. But then again what do I know? Why didn't someone tell me that Richard Dreyfuss now looks like he is 101 years old. What happened? Did he enter some sort of aging machine that took him from his 50's to senior citizenship?".

Although technically a French Film it was mostly made in Japan and gives some insight into Japanese culture. The film provokes both tears and laughter in successive bouts. I didn't like the beginning with all its techno rubbish but once that was out of the way and the story got going I really enjoyed myself. Reno was really quite amusing and the storyline although nothing original enables the spectator to enjoy him or herself. In addition the Japanese actress was cute. Although the film cannot be considered a major work of art it is sure to have international success as its theme is fairly universal and should be appreciated across a wide variety of cultures. There are many things which would make anyone laugh whatever their culture or origin. There is little typically French about the film and indeed most of the action is in Tokyo. I can say fairely safely that all but the most cynical would get a great deal of fun out of this 90 minute stint. Bravo and let's hope the film gets known worldwide !".

	schema:reviewBody "Wasabi' is a highspirited French action comedy with a Japanese name.  This Luc Besson production stars Jean Reno in a wonderful performance as a toughguy French cop who is as quick to use his tongue as his overeager fists.  One day out of the blue Detective Fiorentino discovers that he has a 19 yearold daughter by a Japanese woman who left him almost 20 years ago breaking his heart in the process.  The girl Yumi turns out to be an orangehaired free spirit who hates cops and has been led to believe that her father raped her mother.  Much of the film is spent with Hubert and Yumi getting to know one another as they uncover secrets about her mother's past that seem to have made the young woman the target of some rather unsavory characters.The plot is the least of the matter in this film.  As directed by Gerard Krawczyk Wasabi' is really all about style.  Besson's screenplay is fitfully amusing doling out cleverness and cutesyness in roughly equal measure.   Cinematographer Gerard Sterin brings out the colorful richness of the urban Japanese landscape and editor Yanne Herve doesn't linger longer on the jokes and sight gags than is absolutely necessary.  These elements help to compensate for the somewhat desperate air that afflicts the screenplay from time to time.The prime asset of Wasabi' is Jean Reno's performance.  Reno perfectly mines the comic potential inherent in the material through the tone of weary cynicism and superiority to all around him that he conveys throughout.  As an actor who has played this type of roguecop character many times in his career Reno obviously relishes this opportunity for a little goodnatured selfribbing.  And he does a splendid job.Wasabi' is little more than a piffle when all is said and done but Reno makes it worth seeing.".

As a huge fan of that film I was skeptical but quickly let go when I became involved with the characters. It's more of a comedy than anything else perhaps somewhat satirical especially in the night club. Music? You have to respect the culture the group it represents the tone it's trying to set mainly the daughter's generation.To me this was an interesting example of how you can take the same story and execute it in a different way.

	schema:headline " Entertaining with a nice blend of FrenchJapanese Sensibilities";
	schema:reviewBody "As others have commented this is certainly light entertainment not heavy on elaborate plot lines. I actually saw this movie today on a flight from Japan and found it delightful. It certainly is a film that was pitched to a French Audience tossing in simplified bits of Japanese pop culture Witness I have never encountered so many Japanese that could speak French as in this movie. Nevertheless this is what I liked about the movie1. The interplay between Fiorentino Jean Reno and his sidekick Momo Michel Muller was consistently humorous throughout with Muller delivering the punchline and nearly upstaging Reno throughout. My favorite scene is when Fiorentino is eating generous gobs of Wasabi hence the name of the film and Momo not wanting to be outdone by his mentor nearly gags to death on the stuff. I was laughing out loud  maybe because it reminds me too vividly of the first time I ever ate sushi and nearly died doing the same thing as Momo!!2. Ryoko Hirosue who plays Yumi the previously unknown daughter to Fiorentini is one of the current hot young faces in Japan and has appeared in many TV dramas and movies. She certainly provides all the eye candy I could ever wish for in this film. But I must admit a certain new foundrespect for her acting abilities as she pulled off her lines in French flawlessly while maintaining her trademark cuteness and capturing the carefree attitude of today's Japanese youth. She provided a foil of a different sort for Reno her bright colors pink hair pink everything offering a striking contrast to Reno's darker demure look.The Yakuza were portrayed as mindless goons in this film and there are certainly better films out there if you want to know more about Yakuza but it appeared that they played their role which was to showcase Reno's machismo in a humorous way something along the lines of Jackie Chan films  they are more like props in the film than anything else.All in all I was entertained by this film which is all I was looking for during my 11 hours crossing the Pacific.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard maybe impossible to categorize what kind of movie Wasabi is. First it starts off as a kind of parody of Dirty Harry movies. Then it becomes a pretty serious look at the sadness and inability to let go the main character has had for almost 2 decades. Then it becomes a kind of goofy buddy movie once in Japan. Then a murder mystery. Then a shootup action movie. Then...While the movie keeps wildly changing tone right up to the end these constant changes actually didn't bother me at all. In fact I enjoyed how the movie kept surprising me by this and I was soon eagerly waiting to see just what direction the movie would change to in the next few minutes. And whatever the tone happened to be at any time it was pretty welldone  the action was good the comedy was amusing and the serious moments were pretty effective.I won't deny that the movie is pretty weak on plot  it takes a while before any real plot begins and what remaining plot is barely there. For one thing the mastermind behind the plot doesn't appear until near the end and he's dealt with thoroughly in the next scene he appears in. As well there are some notable holes in this shred of plot just how did the main character's lost love get hold of all that money even considering where she was working all that time? But despite the barest of plots and with some big holes at that the movie is never boring and is constantly entertaining. Though it's certainly not the cream of European cinema Wasabi would be a great introduction of it to someone who may have been avoiding it because of the wrong idea that all European cinema is dull and pretentious drama.".

It also shows modern culture like the cute girls dyeing their hair brown or blonde clubs and various video game arcades.

	schema:reviewBody "WASABI 2001 is a variation on fishoutofwater action comedies like the RUSH HOUR films with a nod to more deadly serious Japanset predecessors like the Michael Douglas starrer BLACK RAIN 1989. Written by Luc Besson it tells a tale of a French cop called to Tokyo for the reading of his old girlfriend's will only to learn that the girlfriend died under suspicious circumstances that a cache of 200 million is involved and that he's the father of the dead woman's daughter of whom he's now the legal guardian until she turns 20 in two days. There is plenty of formulaic cartoonish action capitalizing on the nononsense cop's tendency to hit or shoot first and ask questions later but it's balanced by some delightful interaction between Hubert the gruff if sentimental middleaged cop played by Jean Reno and Yumi the terminally cute endlessly trendy Japanese daughter played by pop starTVfilm actress Ryoko Hirosue. Some scenes manage to combine the action and fatherdaughter antics seamlessly as in a department store shopping trip where Yumi runs ecstatically from one section to the next while Reno quietly ferrets out and knocks unconscious each of nearly a dozen Yakuza thugs tailing them all miraculously without attracting her attention. In a later scene he has a French Intelligence comic relief sidekick Michel Muller show him cases of advanced weaponry while Yumi changes into her purchases in an adjacent room bursting through the doors in a flamboyant display of each new outfit while the two men scramble to hide the hardware from her view and tell her how great she looks.The script is just as contrived and implausible as it would be in the hands of Hong Kong or Hollywood filmmakers who've all done similar material but it's handled with a light enough tone and given over sufficiently to the lead performers to make it a pleasant if undemanding experience. It's always a treat to see Reno in a starring role and he's quite believable and charming throughout in a patented movie star role that Bruce Willis might have played in Hollywood or Lau Ching Wan in Hong Kong. The lean and wiry Ryoko Hirosue all arms legs nose and chin is kawaii' to the nth degreelike a saltier earthier Audrey Hepburnand steals the film whenever she's on camera which isn't often enough!. The character is quite volatile and given to wild mood swings punctuated by tears one minute and sly grins or girlish squeals the next. She's quite a fashion plate as well. The actress reportedly learned her French dialogue phonetically but she handles it like a pro as if she'd been speaking it much of her life.".

Basically the plot is Reno is a cop in France and finds out his girlfriend in Japan who left him 19yrs ago mysteriously died and he goes to the funeral. Talk about not letting go. And finds out he has a 19yr old daughter. But not to go to into it to much but there is yakuza explosions guns and great one liners. The first 5 mins draws you into the movie with Reno punching out a woman in a dance club. Then 10mins in drag queens rob a bank and Reno beats their ass bad. Literally. That alone makes you want to keep watching. Just to see what the hell is going to happen next. I'm a bit bias and I gave it a 10 but Its a great action flick that I watched more times then I can count.".

It's a mix of comedy and action having the main language french but also having some Japanese lines and the story being in Japan. Another nice thingwas seeing a movie showing a modern Japanwithout the samuraigeisha clich. The character Yumi Yoshimido looks exaggerating sometimes in her way to speak or her crazy way to dressbut this is how many of the modern Japanese teenagers behave.I was also very surprise to know that the actress who played YumiRyoko Hirosue didn't know how to speak frenchand she learned her lines phonetically! I am not french but she spoke in the movie very well to me and also her acting was greatsince she was convincing in her role.Watch this movie...it's very worthwhile!".

Krawczyk keeps things moving and there is never a dull moment.Carole Bouquet That Obscure Object of Desire For Your Eyes Only is absolutely charming as the love interest.But the story is Japan not France. Hubert was stationed there 19 years previous and finds his old girlfriend has died and left him a daughter Yumi Ryoko Hirosue  Departures.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Grard Krawczyk Taxi 2 3  4 and produced by the prolific Luc Besson Wasabi stars the charismatic Jean Reno as Hubert Fiorentini a tough Parisian cop who travels to Japan when the only woman he has ever loved dies naming him in her will.At the reading of the will Hubert is told that he has inherited guardianship of Miko's supercute daughter Yumi Ryoko Hirosue until she reaches the age of 20 in two days time. It doesn't take a shocked Hubert long to realise that Yumi is also his daughter.Whilst paying his respects at Miko's funeral Hubert finds evidence of foul play cyanide crystals around Miko's nostrils and later discovers that Yumi's inheritance is a staggering 200000000. With help from Momo Michel Muller an old friend in the French Intelligence he uncovers the truth Miko a secret agent went to work undercover in the Yakuza when her real identity was discovered by the badguys she transferred the Yakuza's money to her daughter's account but was killed before she could escape.And now the Yakuza want their cash back...Wasabi is an enjoyable actioncomedy that with some more action would've score an 8 out of 10 with me. Reno Hirosue and Muller are extremely likable in their roles and Krawczyk does a pretty good job of keeping the fun bubbling along. Only Besson's occasionally sloppy script lets things down in places a couple of plot lines seemingly go nowhere Hubert's relationship with Sofia and something about a book of names and numbers and despite the promise of some explosive action we are shown all sorts of amazing firepower Hubert only ever uses his handgun against the baddies. I really wanted to see some of those rocket launchers put to use!In my experience Besson movies whether produced written or directed are unpredictable affairs they range from the great Leon The Transporter to the passably entertaining Taxi 2 to the pretty mediocre Kiss of the Dragon Taxi. Wasabi is nearer the top end of the scale but with a bit more care and attention it could have been one of the best.".

Here not need to make expose a Boeing four tanks and twenty cars to have a GOOD scene of action. Let us note the recourse to the numerical effects but without abuse. The first start in France with the presence of the charming Carole Bouquet  good. But the best in this film is  Ryoko Hirosue. I had undoubtedly never seen it before Ryoko Hirosue. It is she who gives the tone to this film Ryoko Hirosue is the radiant sun. The fact that she plays in French is there for much and with a very pretty voice.In two words it is a good film to see between friends without expecting big action like in 'Leon' nor hilarious moments like in 'Shrek'... but a good distraction.

This Big Gun of Jean Reno looks as big as Arnold Swarzennagers in the movie The Last Action Hero. I like Jean Reno more in this type of role because he has developed a natural character persona which is typecasted by his choice of directors and screenwriters. Especially in roles such as in movies The Ronin The Professional and Wasabi. The virtuous science behind Wasabi seems like a common tie with the movie The Fifth Element compassion. In other words the philosophy of science and its methods is the key. Coincidently Gary Oldman plays the bad guy as Zorg and a corrupt cop in the Professional where individual egotism and objectives obfuscate the universal principles of wearing a badge in global criminal justice. Most difficult ethical planning is most important when you have to make life and death decisions within the field of global criminal justice. Decide to pull a gun and if you do should you use it? However some people choose to take advantage of other people. They intend to use them as the guns. They use them as living banks to deposit their illegal money. They use them to force political action with their heritage. Playing on the global ethical conduct of people is the most inexpensive method for getting what you want when you want it.

	schema:headline " Clint Eastwood's First Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "By the early 70s actor Clint Eastwood's career had gone from being a mere extra to a wellknown Hollywood star. Thanks to the success of Sergio Leone's immortal Westerns Eastwood was noticed and soon he began to work in very good projects with great results. Despite being a respected actor nobody could have imagined that his talent as director was even superior to his acting skills and after a fairly good debut in 1971 the thriller Play Misty for Me he crafted his first masterpiece in 1973 as a tribute to his own artistic mentors the haunting western High Plains Drifter.High Plains Drifter is the story of a small mining town named Lago which is constantly troubled by outlaws and gunfighters. One day a stranger Clint Eastwood comes to town and manages to kill three of those outlaws gaining instant recognition and the offer of having whatever he wants from the town if he gets rid of the rest of the gang. He accepts but the town doesn't know that the mysterious stranger has a secret that will change their lives for ever.The figure of the stranger comes to town to alter the fragile equilibrium of their existence and soon the town's own demons return to haunt them. Eastwood's character is not exactly the hero we know but a morally ambiguous cruel man that doesn't hesitate to use and abuse the townspeople and that clearly has an agenda of his own. Written by Ernest Tidyman this is a dark tale that explores the ambiguous morality of people and the concepts of justice and revenge.Eastwood's second directorial effort is a powerful movie that brilliantly combines the elements of Western with those of suspense and thriller. Due to his solid career in Westerns Eastwood knows the genre's characteristics and pushes them forward to create something more a movie beyond its genre. With brilliant camerawork he goes from dream sequences out of a nightmare to day sequences in Leone's Spaghetti Western style. This is definitely a tribute to his mentors In fact he included a small reference to his directors in a cemetery scene.The acting is remarkably good with Eastwood himself leading the cast with great skill and his powerful presence. His character is a lot more complex than his Man With No Name and it could be said that he mixes in one character the characteristics of the three outlaws of The Good The Bad and the Ugly. The underrated Billy Curtis is great as Mordecai probably the only one in town who knows and understands the stranger's secret. The rest of the cast is very good and even those in small roles such as William O'Connell as the barber give performances of high quality. Apparently Eastwood's talent with people was there from the beginning.Tidyman's story is very wellconstructed and can be seen from diverse points of view. Every character in town is welldefined no matter how long their screentime is and Eastwood makes the most of it. It's hard to find a flaw in this movie and I really can't praise it enough. It is a story that once that grabs you never lets you go.High Plains Drifter is a mustsee not only for Western fans it is a powerful story that is more than what it seems. Great camerawork haunting images terrific script superb acting all pieces fit to create Clint Eastwood's first masterpiece. This dark western sets the path of Eastwood's career as a director and one can see why is he one of the best directors alive. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "A lone gunman with no name and seemingly with no past rides into the dusky town of Lago. The residents of Lago at first view the stranger with suspicion but when news that some outlaws that are out for blood are on their way to town they ask the stranger for his help. This is Clint Eastwood's first Western film that he directed and it's clear and evident that the guy not only loves the genre that made his name he also knows what makes it work. Obviously having worked for Sergio Leone Eastwood was making notes because High Plains Drifter oozes the mythical aura of many of Leone's finest genre offerings. To which with thanks the result is one of the best offerings in the 70s for the Oater enthusiast. The film opens with our mysterious drifter slowly coming out of the beautiful sprawling haze and into Lago it's ethereal then there's just the sound of the horse breathing and the clop of its hooves that can be heard the sound mix here is incredible it's a gloriously mysterious opening that sets the tone perfectly. Yet Eastwood is just toying with us though for a quick jolt of sex and violence snaps us out of the beatific warmth and into a quite hauntingly cold and morally challenged place. From here on in the stranger will demand all manner of odd things from the residents of Lago he seems to be toying with them and revelling in their discomfort with Lago quickly resembling an arid hellhole. You see Lago has a dark secret and our mysterious stranger has a purpose and it's this purpose that makes High Plains Drifter an intriguing and gripping experience. A well known fact now is that the great man of the genre John Wayne wrote Eastwood to strongly complain about his harsh vision of the West one can only think the Duke failed to grasp the post Vietnam feel of a 70s made Western. It's a great directorial effort from Eastwood more so when you marry up his acting performance to his directorial duties. Very much the perfect role it lets Eastwood accentuate his rugged Western leanings. Eastwood would direct the similarly themed Pale Rider in the 80s and then the genre crown topper Unforgiven in the 90s. A Western great in each decade? Well that will always be debatable but what we do know is that the Western genre was considerably lucky to have had such a man to keep the genre going for the newer interested wanderers into the Wild West. Beautifully photographed Bruce Surtees on the shores of Mono Lake California it's a film pungent with sex sadism retribution and risks. High Plains Drifter is mystical and magnificent and essential Western fare. 910".

The hero is a mysterious ghostlike figure and he fights against the evil and corruption that infests a small town in the middle of nowhere. What sets these two films apart is that here Eastwood is fighting a lone battle  and his only sidekick is the midget Mordecai while almost all other inhabitants of Lago are corrupted orand cowardly.Eastwood delivers one of his strongest performances here and manages to be charming and humorous besides exacting coolblooded vengeance. His interactions with the two women Marianna Hill and Verna Bloom both solid in their roles who are very different draws comparisons to his earlier film Hang 'Em High. But what sets this apart from the typical Eastwood fare is the dark nature of this movie. Anthony James the man with the unforgettable face is once again back as one of the main villains. The rest of the cast are quite forgettable and lesser known names which adds credibility to this movie making it a film to be taken seriously and not just a gathering of famous faces.This film's perhaps strongest asset is the excellent screenplay by Ernest Tidyman the Oscarwinner for French Connection and it is probably the best screenplay ever written for an Eastwooddirected western. The storyline never ceases to surprise and is full of suspense and great dialogue. As always Clint knew who to pick. As always in the Clint films this movie is not about love. Clint and Bloom's affair almost results in love but it never gets the chance to develop. The surprise ending adds a great touch. This film really is a delight for fans of Clint Eastwood and unusual filmnoirish westerns.".

	schema:headline " A dark cruel supernatural western";
	schema:reviewBody "A small frontier town is worried and scared for it's future.  Three men who murdered the sheriff in front of the whole town have been released from jail and are heading back to take revenge on the town.  When a stranger comes into town he is offered anything he wants if he will help defend them against the men.  The stranger accepts but both he and the townsfolk have hidden agendas.High Plains Drifter stands out from Eastwood's many good westerns simply because it is a lack darker than many others I've seen and also possesses a weird supernatural quality to it.  The plot is immediately dark although it starts with Eastwood being who we expect him to be an early rape sets him out with a more morally complex character than I had expected.  This darker cruel strand continues as it is clear that although hired to protect them the stranger also seems to be taking pleasure from harming the town itself.Those who have seen it will know the ending although it is evident from the first flashback what the film's twist is.  Knowing it doesn't make the film less enjoyable but it is probably better to figure it out yourself.  The film also has a good streak of humour going through it and is enjoyable  the twist of the stranger punishing the townsfolk easily filling the time.Eastwood is as good as always but the support cast is also full of well known faces.  The direction is good and adds to the weird feel to it the music makes it feel other worldly and the flashbacks to the whipping stop it all getting too light.  By the time the town literally becomes hell the film has always won me over.Overall this is maybe not the best western Eastwood has ever done but it is certainly one of the most different!

	onyx:emotionText "A small frontier town is worried and scared for it's future.  Three men who murdered the sheriff in front of the whole town have been released from jail and are heading back to take revenge on the town.  When a stranger comes into town he is offered anything he wants if he will help defend them against the men.  The stranger accepts but both he and the townsfolk have hidden agendas.High Plains Drifter stands out from Eastwood's many good westerns simply because it is a lack darker than many others I've seen and also possesses a weird supernatural quality to it.  The plot is immediately dark although it starts with Eastwood being who we expect him to be an early rape sets him out with a more morally complex character than I had expected.  This darker cruel strand continues as it is clear that although hired to protect them the stranger also seems to be taking pleasure from harming the town itself.Those who have seen it will know the ending although it is evident from the first flashback what the film's twist is.  Knowing it doesn't make the film less enjoyable but it is probably better to figure it out yourself.

	schema:headline " Completely disturbing dark violent western with an interesting Supernatural element";
	schema:reviewBody "High Plains Drifter is one of the many Westerns I have seen as of recently. So far it is the most unique and the most dark twisted story yet. Clint Eastwood directs but this is far from usual tale. High Plains Drifter is perhaps one of the most unique westerns in existence because of it's Supernatural suggestions and it's disturbing theme. Nonetheless you'll be captivated by it's mood and style and when it's all said and done you'll likely have many questions and want to see it again although it will leave you feeling truly afraid for the first time of The Man With No Name.Clint Eastwood directs and stars as the mysterious stranger who rides into a small town one day and faces a group of gun slingers hired to keep trash out of the small town. But in true Eastwood style he makes short work of them and suddenly becomes the only gun slinger in town to protect them. But is he protecting them?? This time Eastwood's stranger is disturbed vicious violent completely off the deep end. Whereas the strangers in his previous films have been far more cool and collective there is something evil about this man. As the film is hyped in the first 20 minutes he commits three murders and a rape and takes control of the town. Seeing Eastwood in this role is a little jarring always having pictured him as the Western Hero but still he plays the role to it's fullest and makes this what it is. Billy Curtis plays Mordecai the man who becomes the stranger's wing man so to speak. Curtis is more of the hero than anyone in town and is mostly under rated by everyone there. He does a great job of adding the overall feeling of gloom to the small town. The rest of the cast that make up the small town including Verna Bloom Mitch Ryan Robert Donner Jack Ging and Stefan Gierasch do a great job. They all have this distinct air of being dirty evil no good and as the history of this town unfolds we discover their individual sins and deeds that they have committed. Terrific character actor Geoffrey Lewis plays Stacey Bridges the typical Western villain riding himself into a completely not typical western town where sin is being rectified. When Eastwood is the most evil thing in the Western you'd have to be a good actor to still come across as a bad guy and Lewis does that perfectly. He's a worth adversary to Eastwood's stranger.High Plains Drifter is one Western I could debate and discuss on for hours and hours. I think Eastwood is a ghost or some sort of angel of Vengeance sent to this town to make them pay for allowing a good man to be whipped to death in front of them in order to hide their shady business dealings with a mine that belonged to the Government. There is so much depth and hidden story to this film that it is just amazing!! The entire back story of this town unfolds while we are watching Eastwood exact his revenge and turn this town into Hell literally. We don't know exactly what the town has done until it's nearly all over but he gets his vengeance and makes them pay. Without a doubt a disturbing and twisted film and an absolute must see for anyone who loves cinema and wants something different from a classic tried and true genre like The Western and leave it to Eastwood to pull it off. I think High Plains Drifter is probably one of the most underrated films of all time. The tone of the film and message and story is so disturbing I'm not sure I'd ever watch it again and yet that being said it was so brilliant. I know many have said that Eastwood has explained numerous times the stranger in this film and that he was completely human but I like to look at it from a Supernatural angle because there is a sincere shiver up my spine when Mordecai says to Eastwood's stranger I don't even know who you are and Eastwood says...Yes you do and rides off into the sunset until he literally vanishes into thin air. It's completely different and a must see!! 910".

	schema:headline " Welcome to Lago no actually its Hell!";
	schema:reviewBody "A mysteriously callous stranger Clint Eastwood rides out of the desert into a small town called Lago and terrifies the locals by raping a lady and treading over the townsfolk but when he kills three cowboys who wanted to make something out of nothing. The inhabitants are grateful that he freed them but then they try to hire him to protect from three more cowboys who will return back to town when they finish their jail sentence in the next day or two. The stranger refuses the offer at first but when they tell him he can take anything for free and have power over the town he accepts the offer. Through this power he changes things around in town for his pleasure and this causes disruption amongst the locals who seem to regret hiring him.Oh I just love this bewildering film and I can't get enough of it! What we get here is a brutally mystical revenge western by DirectorStar Clint Eastwood. I was totally mesmerised by it and Eastwood's direction is on the boil by capturing a strong essence of charm and also discomfort. It has a lot of elements going for it that it makes you well me want to watch it over and over again. That's probably a good idea too as thorough symbolisms and blinding supernatural occurrences fill the cryptic story. Some you might pick up on while others don't seem to standout but are hidden under the material. Those enigmatic factors really keep your full interest as the plot is played out very well with an eerie beginning that just pulls you in and then it ends with such a cunning conclusion. Before we get to the conclusion the haunting climax definitely builds sheer dread and packs bite with its visuals a lot of bite! There's not much action in the film but the story's subplots is what guides it and slowly builds the questions. You just wonder  There's got to be more to this new stranger in town and the townsfolk seemed to be keeping some hidden secret or sin behind close doors? The more the story builds on those the queries the less you seem to worry about the lack of gunfights and brawls. You actually start to read more into these mysteries when some of the questions are answered towards the end. Though also watching the stranger toy around with the guilty townsfolk is pretty riveting stuff.Another feature that blows you away would be how atmospheric it does get with a pounding and alienating score that ticks away with its high pitch and howling sounds. These just added more unease to Eastwood's character when he was on screen with this humming score in the background. It just holds such an inspiring awe with its striking rigorous and desolated backdrop that went handtohand with the brood horror and hell that follows the town's inhabitants. Engrossing scenery fills the backshot with its vast mountains ranges and open spaces of dirt and rocks. One thing that stood out for me was the quieter moments when it focused on body language and facial expressions to portray emotions. This really added to the alarming mood and a fairly sparse script was incredibly effective in making it highlystrung. Even the uneasy sound effects are used to great effect especially in a particular nightmare scene. Violence is pretty much in your face and at times rather brutal but Eastwood paces it superbly and fits it into the story. The humour that fills the story is a bit of a variety as sometimes there would be some subtle and dry humour but then again when the dwarf was on screen it seems to play more as a loud joke. Steady camerawork is evident with plenty angle shots from behind and above and the occasional zoom. The texture of the film's material and powerful visuals is real moody daring and it has a fairly coldhearted tone to it all. It just leaves you with such an empty feeling.Performance wise the cast was nothing but topgrade. Dauntingly malevolent is a good way to describe Eastwood persona as the mysterious stranger in which he gives a typically firstrate and hypnotic performance as usual. Is he some sort of Revenging Angel or a ghost of the past? This is what you ask. But antihero definitely comes to mind. The supporting cast is exceptional with the likes of the Verna Bloom Billy Curtis Marianna Hill Mitch Ryan Stefan Gierasch and Jack Ging.This is one spellbinding semisupernatural Western!".

	onyx:emotionText "A mysteriously callous stranger Clint Eastwood rides out of the desert into a small town called Lago and terrifies the locals by raping a lady and treading over the townsfolk but when he kills three cowboys who wanted to make something out of nothing. The inhabitants are grateful that he freed them but then they try to hire him to protect from three more cowboys who will return back to town when they finish their jail sentence in the next day or two. The stranger refuses the offer at first but when they tell him he can take anything for free and have power over the town he accepts the offer. Through this power he changes things around in town for his pleasure and this causes disruption amongst the locals who seem to regret hiring him.Oh I just love this bewildering film and I can't get enough of it! What we get here is a brutally mystical revenge western by DirectorStar Clint Eastwood. I was totally mesmerised by it and Eastwood's direction is on the boil by capturing a strong essence of charm and also discomfort. It has a lot of elements going for it that it makes you well me want to watch it over and over again. That's probably a good idea too as thorough symbolisms and blinding supernatural occurrences fill the cryptic story. Some you might pick up on while others don't seem to standout but are hidden under the material. Those enigmatic factors really keep your full interest as the plot is played out very well with an eerie beginning that just pulls you in and then it ends with such a cunning conclusion. Before we get to the conclusion the haunting climax definitely builds sheer dread and packs bite with its visuals a lot of bite! There's not much action in the film but the story's subplots is what guides it and slowly builds the questions. You just wonder  There's got to be more to this new stranger in town and the townsfolk seemed to be keeping some hidden secret or sin behind close doors?

	schema:reviewBody "I'm perfectly willing to allow Clint Eastwood his pronouncement of ambiguity regarding the character of 'The Stranger' and have read with interest the many opinions offered in the reviews and threads on this site. I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times over the years but today it was with the express intent of crystallizing my opinion. As I've felt all along the character of The Stranger is indeed a mortal man the brother of the slain town marshal Jim Duncan and I'll get into that in a minute.Let's keep in mind that Eastwood himself has had quite some time to reflect on his direction and portrayal in the film and the subject of a ghostly apparition had time to take hold of viewer consciousness. The film itself has added to the controversy at least twice via statements made by hotel owner Lewis Belding Ted Hartley. The first time occurs right after he supervises the evacuation of his hotel remarking disparagingly to the Preacher Robert Donner  ...they're emptyin' my whole hotel throwing out paying guests right into the street just to make room for our new guardian angel. Later when addressing Lago's citizens at a town meeting right after the dinner scene with The Stranger and Callie  ...couldn't be worse if the devil himself had ridden right into Lago. So right there you have the seeds planted for both an avenging angel and a demon bent on revenge.There IS a real mystery to the film but it's not the identity of 'The Stranger'. To fully understand it's important to view the movie in it's unedited form via tape or DVD. Watching High Plains Drifter on TV even a cable channel leaves too much out particularly in the way of dialog and especially regarding the character of Callie Marianna Hill and her relationship to the people in the town.The movie offers two flashback scenes the first by 'The Stranger' only about twenty minutes into the story the second by Mordecai Billy Curtis again shortly after the evacuation of the hotel guests. In both flashbacks one is able to recognize every citizen of Lago that we already know by name EXCEPT ONE. About midway in each scene a character is shown entering from and then retreating back into the shadows with half of a bearded face visible. It's the face of The Stranger. The reason Eastwood's character can recall with clarity what occurred on the night Marshal Duncan was killed is because he was there. The mystery then becomes why he was powerless at the time to intervene on his brother's behalf. Presumably he wasn't a citizen of Lago or he would be recognized so there must have been another reason for him to be there. Visiting his brother certainly but for reasons unknown and unexplored 'The Stranger' did not become involved at the time of his brother's death.The one person who had an inkling to The Strangers' identity I feel was Sarah Belding making reference to the dead marshal in an unmarked grave. But The Stranger wasn't biting he intended to remain anonymous a position he affirmed when he first checked into Belding's hotel and didn't register. Sure he could have used a phony name but then some of the mystique he was attempting to establish would have been compromised.I'm quite intrigued reading some of the threads maintaining certainty regarding The Stranger being a 'spirit' citing reactions the character has as if one could actually know how a spirit would go about his business. But since we're playing that game I'd offer two reasons why he couldn't be a spirit or a demon. On the ride into town The Stranger's reflection is shown on one of the store front windows as he goes past. Then in the first bar scene The Stranger's arm casts a shadow on the wall as he takes his beer. Granted most of my spirit and demon lore has come from other movies and popular literature but I believe that both of those occurrences aren't possible with beings from the other side. What REALLY intrigues me now is if Eastwood was clever enough to consciously plant those things in the film to keep everyone and his brother no pun there guessing. Oh and one last thing  if The Stranger really WAS a ghost then who's ghost was the horse he rode in on?When I first entered a rating for this film on IMDb I gave it a strong '8' as one of the upper echelon film Westerns right up there with High Noon Shane and Eastwood's own Unforgiven. However now after having so much fun watching and rewatching the movie and reading some of the great discussion on this site that has to warrant at least two bonus points I'm reestablishing my rating as a '10'.One last thing  if you're interested in hearing Clint Eastwood himself describe whowhat the character of The Stranger represents head over to his website at httpwww.clinteastwood.netwelcome2.htmlFollow the links to the movie and then click on the audio icon for High Plains Drifter.".

He shot his gun with lethal accuracy when anyone gave him trouble and was noncommittal to the cowardly townsfolk who wanted his help to take care of the outlaws released from jail.

The antihero with no nameClint Eastwood of course a  throwback to his days making spaghetti westerns in Italy with Sergio  Leonecomes riding tall in the saddle down into a valley with a mining  town by a lake. The movie was shot around the Mono Lake area of  California. Particularly effective in this unforgettable opening scene  is the music sounding like the high whine of the wind off of the  desert. This town would be Lago later to be renamed Hell by  Eastwood's character who is identified in the titles as The Stranger.  The stranger really just wants a shave and a bath and something to  drink and eat and place to lay his head for the night. What he gets is  a bad time from some roughnecks and a woman Callie Travers played by  Marianna Hill who has attractionavoidance feelings for him. He shoots  the three guys and rapes the woman before the movie is twenty minutes  old. What I mean by this not being politically correct is that despite  herself she likes it! That sort of thing is not done in cinema these  days. The idea that a woman might be turned on by being raped would not  play before today's audiences nor would a Hollywood producer make such  a film.  I won't go any further into the plot but suffice it to say that  Eastwood is just beginning to kick tail. It seems that everybody in  town is cowardly and without the will to protect themselves from the  bad guys especially the three who just got out of jail and are headed  their way. How Eastwood who directed from a script by Ernest Tidyman  The French Connection 1971 Shaft 1971 etc. handles the familiar  revenge theme is interesting.  First it is no accident that Eastwood's protagonist is named the  Stranger. That is the English title of a famous novel by Albert Camus  that surely influenced Eastwood. Camus's stranger is an existential  antihero a kind of benign sociopath who really doesn't feel anything  for others except as they affect his life. But he is not particularly  violent and just lives from one day to the next without any direction  or goal. He just exists. Eastwood's stranger does more than just  exist. He takes action and he is very good at it. Indeed I can't  recall a western movie in which a gunman could draw faster or shot  straighter or any movie hero who was less afraid of putting his life  on the line. So in a sense what Eastwood has added to Camus's stranger  is Nietzsche's superman. And herein lies I think the underpinning of  Eastwood's philosophy and his message. Note that the people in the  town to a man are cowardly. The only exception is Sarah Belding Verna  Bloom who like the aforementioned Callie Travers can't resist the  stranger's forceful charm and falls in love with him. This somehow  inspires her to leave the corrupt town.  Yes the town like most of human society is corrupt. And yes the  average man in the street is cowardly and without the will to defend  himself. It is only the ubermensch that rare breed celebrated in the  works of the German philosopher who has the skill the strength and  the will to bend events to his liking and to take on those who would  use violence to achieve their ends.  So what Eastwood does here in his second directorial effort following  Play Misty for Me 1971 is to diverge from Leone's formula. While  there is some very funny and intentionally ridiculous dialogue in such  films as for example The Good the Bad and the Ugly 1966 or For a  Few Dollars More 1965 or A Fistful of Dollars 1964 there is little  that is funny intentionally or otherwise in High Plains Drifter.  Furthermore whereas Leone just wanted to make a buck and saw that  toughminded heroes or antiheroes involved in actionfilled revenge  plots was a good way to do it Eastwood is interested in also making a  philosophic and perhaps political statement. We are degenerate we  humans he is saying except for those rare individuals who take the  law into their own hands make their own rules and through superior  skill and bravery make their own luck and create their own reality as  does his stranger.  In this film there is also an element of the supernatural or so it  would appear. The stranger sees in his head the whipping of a past  sheriff of the town. Perhaps it comes from the mind of the dwarf  Mordecai very well played by Billy Curtis by the way who witnessed  the tortured death while hiding under the saloon. At any rate the  stranger shows that he is just as handy with the whip himself as he is  with his sixgun.  By all means see this for an early look at the work of Clint Eastwood  as both an actor and a director. You will not be bored I can assure  you. But don't invite the girl friend over. If there was ever an  antichickflick this is it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this first in the early 90s on a VHS. Jus revisited this recently. Dee Barton's eerie film score really stood out in making this a mystery western film. The first viewing did create a sense of suspense. In this film Eastwood once again plays a mysterious stranger this time meting out justice in a corrupt frontier mining town. The scene in which he enters the town there is this eerie music in the background. The same music is repeated when he departs from the town. I liked the film's dark tone and thought this was more than just a western. The movie has a mystery to it. When I saw it first I thot that Clint was the dead spirit of the Marshal but when I saw it recently I think it's left ambiguous. It cud hav been the brother of the Marshal or some spectator who was hiding in the dark n came back prepared for the revenge. Please feel free to explain me. Nevertheless its a nice film but not that good compared to other westerns. This is Clints first western to be directed by himself n 2nd as a movie director.".

Over the years since High Plains Drifter was released back in 1973 it has reached cult statues and Eastwood has never made another western as good and as High Plains Drifter and that includes The Unforgiven.

	schema:reviewBody "I rank HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER as a better than average Clint Eastwood film with Eastwood himself at the helm as director. It's really a character driven story set against a western backdrop with Clint as the avenger who rides into town presumably to avenge the murder of a man whipped to death while the townspeople shrank back in the shadows merely watching.We learn later that the whipped man threatened to expose a secret about the town's mine that they were hiding and his name was Marshall Duncan the man responsible for turning in the outlaws who served prison time and came back for their own brand of revenge.It's a grim story with some clever plotting and a relentlessly suspenseful tone that keeps you glued to your seat until the final acts of revenge have been executed.I know none of the players other than Eastwood but VERNA BLOOM who reminds me a little of Vera Miles facially is excellent as the only halfway decent person who recognizes the mission Eastwood is on. He plays the role with his usual grim sense of humor and sarcasm riding off into the hills after most of the bad guys are disposed of.The final scene is set up so that he never actually gives his name but he tells the sheriff inquiring What's your name? that he should know to whom he's speaking and the camera pans to the grave marker of Marshal Duncan indicating perhaps that Clint is the brother of the murdered man. At least that's the implication I get from the ending.Summing up Fascinating mysterious enigmatic and compelling western is food for thought...but full of graphic violence not suitable for young kids.".

	schema:reviewBody "We all conscientiously form initial impressions as to how to process a movie a book music architecture clothes or any number of things. When watching the opening sequence of High Plains Drifter I scratched my head a bit and decided this film was going to explore the dark side of human nature. That would include revenge jealousy lust greed and hypocrisy.The town people of Lago are attempting to live in a kind of a bubble. They desire to ignore as much as possible outside their city. They want a kind of closed utopia even if the bond between the various members in the town is all fake as everyone is out for number one with their only shared desire being keeping a profitable mine open. This was solidified after a earlier visit from some dark men resulted in the murder of the Lago sheriff who knew a dark secret about the mine that could destroy the town. After taking care of the sheriff situation the town decided to hire enforcers for what they couldn't stomach themselves. These men would be the filter keeping outsiders out and also to protect them from the same dark men who killed the sheriff as they went to prison unexpectedly which if they ever get out could be a revenge call waiting to happen. Now it's clear we have tenuous line between law and order moral men and those pretending to be.Clint Eastwood's mysterious character he isn't even revealing his name is on the surface as bad as any gun slinging outlaw but maybe the town can use him to their advantage as in short order the enforcers are all dead and those murderers seeking revenge are thought to be days away from being released from prison i.e. more commentary on corrupt laws?. Thus a uneasy truce between Eastwood's drifter and the town is born. It's going to be a strange marriage to say the least.The uneasy truce gets more strange and things naturally reach a critical mass. The drifter is all about what you reap you sow it would appear as what is left of Lago will have to start over. Perhaps it will be a very different town sans certain hypocrites and a hideous red paint remaining. Lago is a town that won't be the same and that's for sure. The story is the movie and the movie is the story. It's a bit surreal and dreamy at times but it's a solid western tragedy rooted in the classics. It's the old story of evil vs. good just not as straightforward and more cryptic thanks to Eastwood's drifter character. A newer classic is the bottom line.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fairly big Clint Eastwood fan for 20 years  interestingly enough though I'd only seen this his second directorial effort and first western as director once a long time ago. Seeing as how I was going to be revisiting The Outlaw Josey Wales for a film club though now was as good a time as any for a rewatch.The plot couldn't be simpler in many ways harking back to A Fistful of Dollars in its elegant stripped storyline A stranger Clint rides into the town of Lago quickly getting into a shootout that he didn't start and besting the three gunfighters that the town had hired to protect them. The townspeople are afraid of another trio who had once been on the payroll also doing time in prison for a crime committed a year before that the town is complicit in and due back to wreak vengeance. Seeing as how their protectors are dead they agree to hire the stranger at any cost and he proceeds to wreak havoc on the town in more ways than one before proceeding on his way after filling his bargain in apocalyptic fashion.If the plot's simple the characters style and symbolism of the piece are a little less so. The Stranger it seems is haunted by dreams  memories or visions who can say for sure? of a man who seems to be him the town's former marshall whipped to death by those same three men riding back for their own vengeance. Lago means lake and the town sits on an unnamed body of water the town seems brandnew most of the buildings are still under construction and unpainted though from what we learn it's been around for over a year the townspeople are greedy and cowardly and The Stranger is cold merciless in the end even demonic. Is he a figure of vengeance a revenant or demon sent from the real Hell that he names the town after and that the marshall is seen in one flashback as damning it to as he orders it painted completely red before the killers arrive in town? Though nearly everybody in the town is unpleasant a couple of more positive images do stand out  Verna Bloom in one of the two significant female roles is the hotelkeeper's wife who seems at first to despise The Stranger but seemingly just because he's another brutal bastard  when she realizes that he's the only man in the town with guts she softens and he beds her just before the showdown. A dwarf Mordecai Billy Curtis is also treated more softly with The Stranger proclaiming him sheriff and mayor pumping him up to the point where he alone of all the townsmen shows any guts at the eventual gun battle. I suppose it could be said that Clint's vengeful figure is capable of some charity and feeling towards the only two positive and good characters in the film. Significantly enough the other female character a single woman perhaps a whore? it's never very clear named Callie Marianna Hill who he rapes shortly after entering town develops an ambiguous lovehate attitude towards him and it's left quite ambiguous as to how much has to do with the rape which both The Stranger and other townspeople deny or because he then ignores her for the most part even after she betrays him at one point.A town that seemed promising and new fresh and full of vitality at the beginning of the film perched on a cool lake and apparently prosperous at the end has been halfburnt and decimated through a supernatural wrath a vengeance for the greed and cowardice that killed a marshall and cowers before his redeemer  this is oldTestament filmmaking of a pure kind that Eastwood never really returned to in such an obvious way. There are certainly obvious odes to his spaghetti years in the dirt and violence and unpleasantness of the townspeople and their souls in Dee Barton's wonderfully eclectic eerie score and of course in Eastwood's character I also think it shares some kinship with the Don Siegeldirected Civil War film The Beguiled from 1971 another film with more than a touch of the supernatural and few redeeming characters. But Clint makes it his own through the economy and his refusal to make things any more flashy or outr than the screenplay calls for which is plenty. The cast is terrific mostly made up of names that were secondtier at best at the time and are largely forgotten now. Bloom and Curtis are especially good Perhaps not one of the very best 70s westerns and I'd certainly still put it behind Josey Wales and Unforgiven in Eastwood's westernography but it's definitely one of the weirder and more fascinating examples of the genre from America during the period.".

Bloom and Curtis are especially good Perhaps not one of the very best 70s westerns and I'd certainly still put it behind Josey Wales and Unforgiven in Eastwood's westernography but it's definitely one of the weirder and more fascinating examples of the genre from America during the period.";

	schema:reviewBody "This violent Western is set on Northern outdoors and the star is a mysterious revenger a man without name  who comes to the aid of embattled citizens. It deals about a gunfighter Clint Eastwood arriving a little town called Lago that has the usual shops and buildings as General merchandise Livery stable Hardware Barber shop Saloon  Hotel and of course the Church. The drifter donning his sixguns is contracted by townspeople to protect them from a trio of avengeseeking outlawsGeoffrey Lewis Dan Vadis Anthony Jameswho have justly released from jail. But the villagers wind up painting the little town and calling it  Hell.Well crafted Western with interesting screenplay by Ernest Tidyman. Although atmospheric  it's also downbeat and sometimes just downright nasty. The story is almost terrific as the drifter comes to strange frontier town just in time to reckoning villagers and bandits. This stirring picture contains a powerful examination of morality and hypocrisy on people of a little town. Good casting with several secondaries as Michell Ryan Marianna Hill Verna Bloom Walter Barnes Robert Donner and special mention to Billy Curtis as midget become Sheriff and Mayor. Exquisitely shot by Robert Surtees with a magnificent cinematography on the barren exteriors and snowy mountains backgrounds. Thrilling and suspenseful musical score by Dee Burton. The film is made in somewhat similar style to Pale rider 1985 only this time the drifter appears to have been sent from hell rather than heaven to right from ordinary injustices. Later on Eastwood produced and directed another successful Western Unforgiven1992 also with some common theme.".

	schema:headline " My Favorite Clint Eastwood Western";
	schema:reviewBody "While other Clint Eastwood westerns have received more fanfare The Outlaw Josey Wales and Unforgiven come to mind this is my favorite of them all. This most certainly isn't your Daddy's traditional John Wayne fare and those expecting to see as such will be surely disappointed or at the very least surprised. Eastwood made a name for himself in the 60's as the Man With no Name in several Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns and he continues this antihero character in 1973's High Plains Drifter a dark revenge fantasy many viewers mistakenly think has supernatural elements to it.Eastwood rides into the town of Lago and immediately guns down three troubleshooters who goad him into a fight. We quickly find out the dead men had been hired to protect the town from three other criminals who are due to get out of a territorial prison and seek revenge on those in Lago who had been responsible for their imprisonment. Realizing he is their best chance to save the town and themselves from impending destruction several town leaders unsuccessfully seek his help. After initially refusing their request Eastwood relents when he is promised anything he wants in exchange for his services. Throughout the film he takes full advantage of the town's offer through humiliating requests outrageous demands and inconveniencing its many residents while ostensibly setting up an ambush for the arriving criminals.We find out through a recurring dream that former sheriff Jim Duncan was whipped to death in the center of town while cowardly townspeople watched and refused to help. Eastwood's arrival is no accident it is implied much later in the film and by Eastwood himself off camera that he is the brother of the dead sheriff out to seek justice thus explaining his nononsense demeanor and harsh treatment of the townspeople.We root for the Eastwood character not because he is a genuinely good person but because everyone in town is either crooked the mining officials gutless bartender barber sheriff or simply unable to stand up for themselves the women the midget. We revel in Eastwood's actions simply because everyone else receives their just comeuppance. This film is well acted well paced and entertaining. Present are many fine character actors Mitchell Ryan Stefan Gierasch Walter Barnes Geoffrey Lewis and many others who all lend to the enjoyment of the film. A must view for all Eastwood fans and another fine addition to his outstanding canon of work.".

I had thoughts of the Japanese version of 'Shall We Dance' ringing through my mind but perhaps the dancing is the furthest you can compare between the movies. The emotional depth of the movie was somewhat unexpected...sadness some corniness some laughter. Yet the movie worked where it needed to and kept moving at the right pace leaving me at the end feeling like I had seen everything that had happened. Except that at the end I had been so entranced with the characters I was wondering how they themselves turned out.The movie pulled me in nicely with a strong story that was well developed and a really good watch.If you're looking for something a little different and open to learning a little bit about life in a small Japanese town in the 1960s I think this gives you a good feel for the people the attitudes and a change that took grip in a dramatic and lighthearted way.Kudos to the director and production team!".

Yet the movie worked where it needed to and kept moving at the right pace leaving me at the end feeling like I had seen everything that had happened. Except that at the end I had been so entranced with the characters I was wondering how they themselves turned out.The movie pulled me in nicely with a strong story that was well developed and a really good watch.If you're looking for something a little different and open to learning a little bit about life in a small Japanese town in the 1960s I think this gives you a good feel for the people the attitudes and a change that took grip in a dramatic and lighthearted way.Kudos to the director and production team!";

We get a realistic glimpse into the Japanese homes the workplace and the local eating place as well as some Japanese customs particularly the sumimasen in this small 1960's Japanese town.A Hula Dance teacher is brought to a small mining town to teach Hula to the young girls in hopes that the town will create a Hawaiian tourist attraction in the near future. The young girls are presented with an opportunity to change their fate and unknowingly the fate of their town. The majority of the townsfolk are in complete opposition putting the young girls at serious odds with their families and the society in which the live. This story is loaded with dramatic personal interactions between characters. Many of the characters are developing people becoming better persons. The sensei undergoes a bit of an attitude adjustment inspired by her dancers. However it is not until a climactic Hula Show that we realize the true heroine of Hula Girls.I shall recommend this to all aspiring dancers.

Unlike most other Japanese dramas whose atmospheres are quite refined and reserved where the characters display their emotions and feelings in moderate and poetic manners that we often regard as a typical Japanese culture the characters in Hula girls are pretty much straight forward in expressing their emotions and rather rough in manners. It reminded me of the atmosphere of old Sicilian village where Toto of Cinema Paradiso had spent his boyhood where people are rough and tough in manners and sometimes even vulgar but still warmhearted and have good humanity.Hula girls is a heartwarming human drama. It will warm your heart in a little different manners from other typical Japanese human dramas. It makes audiences sometimes laugh and sometimes shed tears. It will make a wonderful family movie.

	schema:headline " Wonderful music wonderful Japanese comedy is great family entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "Make no mistake about it this is a Japanese comedy with few ties to Hawaii. But that doesn't take away from the fact the film is wonderfully scored believably acted and a fun entertaining movie. Screened for the first time in the U.S. in October 2006 as the finale gala extravaganza at the Hawaii International Film Festival 1 Asian festival  one of world's 10 best overall now many hula teachers and Hawaii fans may have feared this movie might take a less thanseriousenough view of the sacred Hawaiian dance. But upon viewing this lighthearted comedy critics had to sit back and appreciate just how loyal the film remained to the Japanese interpretation of hula. Japanese view hula as a dance and Hawaii as a warm tropical paradise in much the same way American filmmakers viewed Hawaii in the 1950s. Viewers even kumu hula and critics shouldn't forget that this is a film about that Japanese interpretation  at that time and not impose upon it the serious more cultural aspects a current movement in Hawaii is bringing back to the dance. In fact the director of Hula Garu successfully gets away with this by making the film a comedy and never trying to delve into the historical religious or other cultural dimensions of hula. While not true to today's view of hula in Hawaii this film is not about today or Hawaii. It's about an obscure little town in northern Japan that created a Hawaiian village concept complete with its own hula troupe to attract tourists and save the town from extinction. Several heart warming moments in this 'To Sir With Love' teacherconquers impossibleodds themed story bring tears to the spectators' eyes. And the music could hardly have been more perfect to help accentuate those emotional moments. Ukulele virtuoso Jake Shimabukuro's score is perfect and likely to win awards and possibly even help make Jake a household name on the U.S. mainland as it already has become in many circles in Japan. The film's screenplay successfully draws the audience into the characters in a way that forces even the most critical hula fans to forgive the film's small imperfections. The only strong disappointment I had about the film was how it confused hula and Tahitian dancing. On the other hand that's a common misconception that all Hawaii visitors make since hula troups almost always perform both types of dances in public. So in a sense the film is true to the way Japanese and tourists perceive hula if not to hula itself. This film is not a film about Hawaii or hula dancing but a comedy about how Japanese have adopted this wonderful dance in its own way while respecting the Hawaiian culture in doing so. Keeping that in mind viewers will have little to critique and everything to enjoy about this film the acting and the wonderful music. Overall this is a fun enjoyable family movie which deserves to be seen on the big screen. Don't wait to rent the video. See it in a theater and feel the energy the music and the strange story that began Japan's growing love for Hawaii's greatest export.".

Hula Girls based on true events takes place in a small Japanese coal mining town in the late 60s where its town folks find that with the shifting reliance on oil from coal the survival of their town is at stake when a major company decides to retrench and cut its headcount.In attempts to makeover their economy ain't that familiar the sleepy town has decided to come up with a Hawaii Center a resort like facility where the warm atmosphere of Hawaii will be recreated in their coldcoal environment. It's a drastic change from blue collar to the service industry and with the young girls being roped in to be dance performers the traditionalists are up in arms against the entire project. Skimpy outfits and gyrating moves don't make it easy and neither does an outsider being roped in to teach the girls a new skill turn out popular too.Hula Girls winner of many awards in the 2006 Japanese equivalent of the Oscars and also the Japanese submission to the 2007 Oscar's Best Foreign Language film actually seemed a little too familiar in its narrative style bringing to mind movies such as Waterboys Swing Girls Linda Linda Linda and the more obvious reference and similarity will be that of My Mother is a Belly Dancer well for most of the first half anyway. But perhaps with this familiarity it took less time for the audience to identify with it and it set on its focus to endear the key characters to the audience.As mentioned it's about change set against the backdrop of changing industries attitudes and skills. It's a heartwarming story no less about the strength of sisterhood where unity sees them battling challenges ahead much against all odds especially when adversity comes from within. It's not all serious as it sounds as there are ample comedy infused especially with its outcast characters such as the nerdy mom and the plus sized tomboy and their initial attempts at performance during road trips advertising their new attraction.Like movies in the similar genre it doesn't take long to identify the leader of the pack in Kimiko Yu Aoi as she becomes the protg of the teacher Mrs Hirayama Yasuko Matsuyuki given the thankless task of whipping the girls into shape. Yu Aoi is no doubt the star of the movie with her good looks and time dedicated for her to show what it takes. And expect a number of sniffles as the filmmakers weaved in classical dramatic moments primarily aimed at activating those tear ducts.At its heart it's a movie on the triumph of the human spirit against adversity and of friendship. It's not without its flaws like when certain transitions seemed to suffer from lack of time devoted to provide more depth but when the formula comes to the end with its rousing highly anticipated finale showed in its entirety and in full regalia you'll no doubt be giving full of applause for its showmanship.Definitely going into my books as a contender for the best movies of the year. Highly recommended despite its slow start.".

It's not without its flaws like when certain transitions seemed to suffer from lack of time devoted to provide more depth but when the formula comes to the end with its rousing highly anticipated finale showed in its entirety and in full regalia you'll no doubt be giving full of applause for its showmanship.Definitely going into my books as a contender for the best movies of the year. Highly recommended despite its slow start.";

It is set in Fukushima Prefecture in Tohoku area about in 1965.The place Iwaki was famous for coal mines. At that time coal was replaced by oil so the coal mines were almost closed down and workers lost their job. So some people decided to make a Hawaiian center for a new business. The main feature was a Hula dance show. They hired a coach Matsuyuki Yasuko to teach local girls professional Hula dance. The local girls were very naive and spoke in strong Tohoku accent not stylish . Their dance performance was terriblewhereas the coach from Tokyo was very cool fashionable and confident and her Hula dance was amazing and breath taking.Interestingly local people were prejudiced against Hula dancers like strippers. One of the students said in the interview My tits are small. is it OK? It's very embarrassing but I don't care because my father was fired so I have to make money. The coach said you don't have to be naked. When one girl put on her costume and showed her brothers and sisters at home and her father found them he got really mad saying  what a shame! you are almost naked and hit her many times and cut off her costume and hair. Local men were a sexist. That made the coach really angry and she went to a men's public bath and hit that father bathing in a bath saying you don't have the right to do such a terrible thing. She was very strong.The coach was not a kind person and very strict and sometimes critical to her students. But she liked her students very much. They influenced each other. Their parents didn't accept that their daughters danced Hula but in the end they were reconciliated and cheered them up. One mother said  I thought working means to make money doing something tough or hard like to live or to die as your father has done. But after I saw you dance in front of people what entertains people is also a job. This is also a feelgood movie where you can see relationship between the coach and her students daughters and their parents.The ending was an excellent Hula dance show by local girls. It was amazing! But I personally think the girl who danced solo Aoi Yu shouldn't have been that too slim. Hawaiian dance doesn't look great if the dancer is too slim.".

The Japanese love for the Hawaiian culture is also very apparent as evidenced in their love for Hawaiian music slack key guitar in particular and dance the Hula. It is said that there are over 250600 students currently learning the Hula in various Hula Halaus schools throughout Japan. Japan born Korean film maker Lee Sangil's wonderfully rousing Hula Girls touches upon that fascination and pays tribute to the expressive and beautiful art form of the Hawaiian Hula. The film is inspired by the the real life Jouban Hawaiian Center at present called 'Spa Resort Hawaiians' in Iwaki City Fukushima which was developed in 1961 in an attempt to stimulate the local prefecture's economy. Similar to Peter Cattaneo's Full Monty as well as Linda Linda Linda Swing Girls and Backdancers Hula Girls similarly centers on a group of misfits who conquer their insecurities and problems through the learning of a particular skill or talent here Hula Dancing. While Aoi Yui Gaichu Memories of Matsuko is given the lion's share of the movie's best moments her dance solo in the end is marvelous it is TV star Matsuyuki Yasuko who is the most interesting character as a disgraced Tokyo dance instructor hoping for a second chance at redemption. The supporting cast is also quite wonderful with Toyokawa Etsushi Yamazaki Chizuya and Kishibe Ittoku bringing great comic moments. While there is a lot of vibrant dancing in the film particularly in the end I kind of hoped for more elaborate and longer choreographed sequences. The comedy aspects are fun but there are scenes where you definitely will be shedding a few heartfelt tears. At 2 hours the movie may seem long but actually I sort of wished it had continued further. Local slack key entertainer Jake Shimabukuro's music is prominently used in the background and deservedly so as it adds to the film's enjoyment. Hula Girls is a great feel good movie that celebrates Hula and shows that the Aloha Spirit which in addition to meaning hello goodbye or love can also refer to resolving any problem accomplishing any goal can transcend cultural differences and prosper in as diverse a setting as Fukushima Japan.".

Except instead of being set out in the middle of CHAINSAW territory now it's an ancient sprawl of Mayan ruins. The fact that Four Beautiful GenX'ers are involved is about where the similarities end. Mr. Eli Roth I'm sorry to inform you that you got served.Because just when you think that THE RUINS is really nothing more than just another yawninducing slasher movie it takes this turn into THE OUTER LIMITS that you don't ever expect it to. And it's so much the better  and more terrifying  for that.Jonathan Tucker HOSTAGE Showtime's MASTERS OF HORROR Jena Malone BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA Shawn Ashmore the XMEN series and Laura Ramsey LORDS OF DOGTOWN star as two best friends and their respective boyfriends on vacation in Mexico for a period of beaches booze and knockin' da boots before Tucker's character Jeff takes the educational equivalent of the Bataan Death March attending med school. The whole nightmare starts pretty simply as nightmares often do in these things. The two couples meet cute with a German tourist Mathias Joe Anderson whose own girlfriend an archaeologist has gone to her latest dig with Mathias's brother. He invites his new friends to come with and since there's not much more excitement to be had other than getting fittopuke drunk on too much cheap tequila they take him up on his offer.Really. Bad. Move.The Fearless Foursome go to the dig site with Mathias and his friend Dimitri Dimitri Baveas and nothing too alarming or remarkable happens along the way. It's when they get there that the fajitas really hit the fan. Because this set of ruins is no ordinary dig site. And if you have prepared yourself in advance for the ghost of some tickedoff Mayan god ready to rip out the hearts of these intruding Americanos you are way offbase my friend. What they find is more insidious horrific and literally creepy than anything you've seen in a long LONG time. Kudos must immediately go to Scott Smith the author of A SIMPLE PLAN for adapting his pageturner of a runaway bestseller into something that should make Stephen King green with envy. The core idea is not an original one but the way Smith uses it and his depictions of how it affects the characters involved is GradeA 100 pure classic horror. Director Carter Smith with his major movie debut is great at ratcheting up the scares and the gore quotient as he wrings some pretty genuine performances from his cast.But the nasty creepiness and dread are just the black frosting on this rotting cake. Dig underneath and you get some super bonuses one scene that will forever make the hobbling scene from MISERY seem like a Sesame Street cakewalk and one unbelievably goosebump raising sequence that will forever have you getting freaked out about your cell phone. I can't tell you why...because the less you know about it the more terrifying it is. Yes the creative forces here make the most of milking the themes of isolation hopelessness and impending death. But it's the HOW not the why that sets THE RUINS apart from any other movie of its kind that's been made before or since.Right now I would rank this one right up there with Neil Marshall's THE DESCENT as one of the Top Ten Best Horror Films made in this decade.Gee in spite of all the remakes still ongoing maybe there is still some hope for horror after all. I can promise you this much THE RUINS is as good a description for what your nerves will be like by the climax as it is the title of a very good horror thriller.".

And it's so much the better  and more terrifying  for that.Jonathan Tucker HOSTAGE Showtime's MASTERS OF HORROR Jena Malone BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA Shawn Ashmore the XMEN series and Laura Ramsey LORDS OF DOGTOWN star as two best friends and their respective boyfriends on vacation in Mexico for a period of beaches booze and knockin' da boots before Tucker's character Jeff takes the educational equivalent of the Bataan Death March attending med school. The whole nightmare starts pretty simply as nightmares often do in these things. The two couples meet cute with a German tourist Mathias Joe Anderson whose own girlfriend an archaeologist has gone to her latest dig with Mathias's brother. He invites his new friends to come with and since there's not much more excitement to be had other than getting fittopuke drunk on too much cheap tequila they take him up on his offer.Really. Bad. Move.The Fearless Foursome go to the dig site with Mathias and his friend Dimitri Dimitri Baveas and nothing too alarming or remarkable happens along the way. It's when they get there that the fajitas really hit the fan. Because this set of ruins is no ordinary dig site. And if you have prepared yourself in advance for the ghost of some tickedoff Mayan god ready to rip out the hearts of these intruding Americanos you are way offbase my friend. What they find is more insidious horrific and literally creepy than anything you've seen in a long LONG time. Kudos must immediately go to Scott Smith the author of A SIMPLE PLAN for adapting his pageturner of a runaway bestseller into something that should make Stephen King green with envy. The core idea is not an original one but the way Smith uses it and his depictions of how it affects the characters involved is GradeA 100 pure classic horror. Director Carter Smith with his major movie debut is great at ratcheting up the scares and the gore quotient as he wrings some pretty genuine performances from his cast.But the nasty creepiness and dread are just the black frosting on this rotting cake. Dig underneath and you get some super bonuses one scene that will forever make the hobbling scene from MISERY seem like a Sesame Street cakewalk and one unbelievably goosebump raising sequence that will forever have you getting freaked out about your cell phone. I can't tell you why...because the less you know about it the more terrifying it is. Yes the creative forces here make the most of milking the themes of isolation hopelessness and impending death. But it's the HOW not the why that sets THE RUINS apart from any other movie of its kind that's been made before or since.Right now I would rank this one right up there with Neil Marshall's THE DESCENT as one of the Top Ten Best Horror Films made in this decade.Gee in spite of all the remakes still ongoing maybe there is still some hope for horror after all. I can promise you this much THE RUINS is as good a description for what your nerves will be like by the climax as it is the title of a very good horror thriller.";

It's clever in a sense creepy to the bone and new with an insane entertainment level that it keeps your attention and doesn't let go.I found the creatures an effective and nice sinister twist to deal with next to the other conflict of being stranded upon the Mayan ruins away from all civilization except the natives who are hellbent on letting them die up there and I thought while the characters were stupid that was the right way to handle the situation considering that most people would lose their wit in situations like that after some time and I always like it when horrors try to make their characters believable because that makes up for them not being special. It was so compellingly good just to watch what all happened and I really enjoyed the scenes and thought that it had excellent suspense and a wonderful atmosphere of claustrophobia and paranoia.Yes it gets a little bland around the edges and like I said it's not like it ranks among the greatest films of all time but I truly do think it is a satisfying taste of what effective legendary horrors could do if they were made with better care because it has all the right substances but just falls flat a little with it's slight mediocrity. Regardless it is nonetheless very amusing and indulging. I praise the creators for coming as far as they did with a poor direction and for toppling over a lot of horrors that have been made in the past decade. Too bad more people didn't see what I did because it is quite underrated and under appreciated I think.".

Once they get there they find themselves trapped on the temple by some locals. However they begin to realize however that they are keeping them there for a horrifying reason....On the surface this is yet another movie about American tourists getting into trouble in another country. However unlike for example Paradise Lost the Hostel movies Wolf Creek and such the threat here is not from a human source but something else. It's a refreshing change but that is only one of the plus points in this good horror movie. There are many more.The script written by Scott B. Smith based on his own novel is pretty good. The characters are well written and the plot as it unfolds takes it's time to play out which again is refreshing. Most American horror movies seem to want to rush through the opening scenes to get to the socalled scare moments but Smith takes time with his plot as he did with his other script the brilliant A Simple Plan. This movie isn't as good as that but it is still good. One of the key things is he never explains how or why the temple is doing what it is doing yet you never really question it. He allows some intelligence in not only the characters but also in the audience watching. Again a refreshing change.The performances from the cast are good. The script allows time for the cast to make their characters believable for a horror movieand as the horror and terror mounts they react in different ways.The direction by Carter Smith is good. He creates a sense of dread as the the events play out. While the movie is not particularly scary he creates a sense a good sense of dread right up to the end and also doesn't try and copout at the end or allow for some awful twist. Again a welcome change.The movie does have some scenes that are bloody or graphic and gory it's not over the top. There is a reason for the violence in the movie and also the blood and gore. It's not simply there to grossout the audience though the scene with the makeshift amputation will have that effect no doubt!!.At a time when most of the American horror movies are either remakes or sequels it's nice to see a horror movie that while not original at least is different. And for that reason alone it's worth watching.".

I won't say more since I'm going tempted to tell you way too much...which would be too much since the plot is simple. Its almost too simple. The reason the film works is that the film has decent characters and it does things that are decidedly not your typical horror movie choices. Its short its sweet and it works. Its not perfect there are one or two things I didn't like but on the whole its a very good very creepy film. Frankly while Brazil got upset about Touristas a year because it might make think people about going there Mexico should worry since this film will make anyone think again about going into ancient ruins. 7.5 ish out of 10 on the horror scale because thinking about the screams makes my skin crawl".

It helped me personally that I knew next to nothing about the film before viewing it and unlike some film lovers I'm not overly familiar with the young cast though Joe Anderson is always on my plus list after his turn as Peter Hook in Control. But while it clearly didn't revolutionise horror as a genre it at least had the gumption to veer in a different direction going deeper in basic thematics than similar big budgeted films have.Tension is deftly mounted what blood and body horror there is and a couple of scenes are genuinely wince inducing and well staged is not cheap and exploitive while the finale doesn't cop out. True there are some unanswered questions that leap out when the end credits roll and anyone expecting a fast paced thrill ride are right out of luck. Yet for those who lean towards a good psychological horror then this is very much recommended. 7.510".

The only corny parts in this movie I would consider mediocre and not that big of a deal.The acting was overall pretty decent. I've always been impressed with Ashmore since he played the only good role in the Animorphs TV series. I was also very impressed with Jonathan Tucker's acting. Malone and Ramsey through in great performances as well.The chills in this movie were real. My fianc' was so disturbed during this movie that at one point he started biting my scalp. The movie also uses an excellent balance of silence and music in appropriate sections. And the fact that the audience is kept in the dark about some of why this was going on is also a big bonus. There isn't an overabundance of blood and gore but it's great for this movie. Kudos for a horror flick that does it right!".

Even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with. With the title ruins you would think that out of 3000 years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit. This is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most but not a crocodile. Either way this film was like that it entices you to think about ruins of Mayan or Inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect. But plants?.... come on is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd?. As for this movie it will hit the 'b' list in no time. I have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see but it didn't make up for the rest of the film. And a plant mimicking a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed. I am a fan of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects. I do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense. The thing had a better story line than this did. Even the ring had me jumping for more but the ruins is just that..... ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers. The premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder.".

It's truly disappointing because the casting was pretty impressive in particular Malone. There is some very impressive camera work and a couple of moments where the audience is bound to jump but the soul of the book is lost because the monster of the film is as scary as a plate full of cilantro.The beginning of the film is quite promising and knowing the author adapted his own book one keeps hoping it will retain its spirit but when the first character is dismissed in a very shocking manner one wonders why the rest of the cast wasn't dispatched pretty much in the next two minutes saving us some listless sequences.When reading the book the scenes in the tunnel are some of the most horrifying and claustrophobic in memory as we witness tragedy after tragedy and some very horrifying moments. We've seen how scary scenes in these setting can be. For example The Cave plunges you into hell as darkness is as scary as anything can be when well timed suggestive flashes can be. In The Ruins it looks like Christmas Trees were used to attack the girls and let's not even go to the flowers' looks and sound special effects.I was wondering where this film was made since the humidity of the Yucatan peninsula seemed to have dissipated along with any signals of common sense. Is Hollywood capable of doing something right even with original material? Or is it easier just to pillage what worked in the cinema before and do a halfhearted remake? On the other hand if this works maybe someone will make a sequel and fix everything that didn't work here. Now that sounds like some original thinking.".

	schema:reviewBody "The scariest thing about freshman director Carter Smith's new horror movie The Ruins is the closing credits that list comedian Ben Stiller as one of the executive producers. What was Stiller thinking when he sank his bucks into this chiller about cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps up on its victims and devours them. Oscarnominated scenarist Scott B. Smith of A Simple Plan adapting his own bestselling novel sticks steadfastly to the standard clichs and conventions of all twentysomething scary sagas where reckless youth do everything but tote signs begging the forces of evil to eat them. Were cretinous characters not enough to contend with in this nihilistic nonsense we're treated to yet another film where American tourists find themselves in jeopardy simply because they are Americans. Furthermore unlike really good horror movies that explain why the monsters have a need to feed The Ruins provides no explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of its villainous vines. The setup for The Ruins resembles the 2006 horror movie Turistas where slimy South Americans trapped brainless American backpackers and harvested them for their internal organs. Indeed Turistas generated some legitimate thrills and chills. The Ruins spawns nothing in the way of either thrills or chills. A malicious mastiff that suddenly lurches oncamera to snarl at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill. The rest of The Ruins borrows from another movie The Descent a superb 2006 chiller about a bunch of babes plunged into a nightmare experience when they get lost in warren of caves inhabited by albino mutants with a blood lust for murder. A couple of other movies that served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind too. They are the straightforward 1968 Hammer horror classic The Lost Continent about murderous vegetation that menaces innocent bystanders in a sea of derelict ships and the Roger Corman cult class The Little Shop of Horrors 1961about a New York florist that grows a maneating plant in his shop.. The Ruins unfolds in the scenic sunny Mexico where four frolicking American college kids Eric Shawn Ashmore of the XMen movies Stacy Laura Ramsey of The Covenant Jeff Jonathan Tucker of Sleepers and Amy Jena Malone of Pride  Prejudice are wrapping up their tequilasoaked spring break. Stacy loses a prized earring in a motel swimming pool but a helpful Teutonic twentysomething tourist Mathias Joe Anderson of Copying Beethoven recovers it and the group embraces him as newest best friend. These people live to party and they have already made friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his wayward brother who has accompanied a cute female archaeologist to a remote Mayan pyramid that isn't listed in any guidebooks. He offers to take them with him and they accept. First rule of horror movies if nobody knows about the place where you're going you'd be well advised to avoid it. Since they have only one day left and they haven't done anything adventurous our two couples along with their Spanishspeaking Greek friend Dimtri newcomer Dimitri Baveas decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid out. They catch a bus into the interior of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. A cabbie glances at their map and warns them to stay away. Second rule of horror movies when the natives warn you to steer clear you steer clear. A crisp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind and he hauls them off to their destination and then he skedaddles in a heartbeat. No sooner have our heroes found the mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth that looks suspiciously like a variation of Mississippi kudzu in the jungle than superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is haunted and they kill Dimtri without a qualm when he tries to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists scramble to safety atop the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Eventually the vines slink out to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point The Ruins turns into Bug the recent and ridiculous Ashley Judd schizoid movie about insects that get under your skin. Before long our heroes are carving each other up in a futile effort to extract the vines from under their skin. One particularly gruesome scene shows the Americans lopping off the German guy's legs to save his life. By comparison it makes the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition look tame. The Ruins ranks as just another vine mess with nothing to redeem it.".

With the exception of PASSION OF THE Christ they seemed to revolve around a formula of  Backpackers meet up abroad  get kidnapped by indigenous nutters and get explicitly tortured to death . The end  On the surface THE RUINS may be just another horror film where horny teenagers get bumped off one by one but dig a little deeper and you'll find something different . Oh and isn't that last sentence appropriate as to happens to these characters ? Set in Mexico some American backpackers meet a German who suggests visiting an ancient Mayan temple which the backpackers agree to  only to be attacked by some locals who kill one of their party and chase them up to the top of the temple . Why do they do this ? Strangely this inciting incident is never really explained but this shouldn't be taken as a massive criticism because it's an enigmatic horror film that whilst having some truly stomach churning effects never really talks down the audience . Both the director Smith and the screenwriter Smith combine to tell the story via the characters situation . By this I mean the audience are never one step ahead of the characters . When a plot turn  of which there are many  happens both the audience and characters see the revelation on screen at the same time . Certainly the whole premise of people being murdered and mutilated by semi intelligent flora is ridiculous but it's written  directed and acted with such conviction that the laughable becomes very credible within the film's running time . What THE RUINS sets apart from other films in the sub genre of torture porn is that there's a strong element of body horror along with character's optimism being crushed . These two aspects are summed up with one of the characters finding out that there's vines growing inside her . She has them graphically cut out  Ah she's saved  gasp both the backpackers and audience . She screams that they're not all been purged and cries that there's one inside her head . Sure enough a small bulge in her forehead moves around . Hopes are built up and quickly dashed in this pessimistic shocker All in all this is a rather memorable horror film . It's a film however that will not appeal in any shape or form to those who don't like gore . Interestingly enough I once had a conversation with a professional film critic that the banned video nasties of the 1980s are often tame compared to more mainstream horror films of the early 21st century and he agreed . You'd be very hard pressed to name a more stomach churning film than THE RUINS but that said it also concentrates on suspense and mystery and struggling against natural adversity which while perhaps not making a great horror certainly a very memorable one".

You'd be very hard pressed to name a more stomach churning film than THE RUINS but that said it also concentrates on suspense and mystery and struggling against natural adversity which while perhaps not making a great horror certainly a very memorable one";

	schema:headline " A decent enough thrill ride";
	schema:reviewBody "Just when you thought it was safe to vacation in Mexico comes the new horror film The Ruins based on a pretty cool book or so I've heard by Scott Smith who adapted his own book into the screenplay. Four attractive American college students Jeff Eric Amy and Stacy meet a German traveler while on vacation in Cancun who tells them about a hidden Mayan archaeological dig site in the jungle he plans to explore. Do they tag along of course they do. So off they all go after a night of heavy tequila drinking along with another attractive Greek guy. Almost immediately they sense something is wrong upon arriving at the Mayan temple inundated with vines and beautiful red rosy flowers. This isn't your typical Little Shop of Horrors vegetation either. The ruins have an evil aura about them and the unsuspecting vacationers are suddenly trapped on top of the ruin as some Mayan descendants make camp around the ruin so as to keep them from escaping the ancient temple. There's plenty of good stuff in The Ruins. Queensland Australia substitutes for the mountains and landscape of Cancun must be those extra tax breaks. And the young cast are good enough to add a sense of realism to the horror that is brought upon them. The Mayan cast also who quarantine the tourists on top of the Mayan ruin are quite effective. First time director Carter Smith definitely brings on the chills and thrills in The Ruins. There's a psychological nature that plays well but I've got to tell you this movie is pretty damn gross. Smith goes straight for the gutwrenching thrills. It's pretty graphic as far as graphic violence can go. You'll be squirming in your seat during a couple of horrific scenes when a traveler is injured with a broken back and another has these creepycrawler vines inside of her body as they try to take them out using a hunting knife. Lots of gore and blood here so in that sense it delivers. The Ruins is a decent enough thrill ride that will make you think twice about visiting any type of ancient ruin yet to be discovered while on your next vacation in the jungle.".

Clearly what worked in the novel and our own imaginations simply does nott transfer to film well. It's no wonder it bombed at the box office. It's silly and unbelievable . And every thrill is telegraphed to the audience minutes before it happens. My 14 year nephew got bored and went to see Nim's Island. The acting was so godawful. Who are these people?? None of the pretty boys and girls could convey an honest sentence of dialog if their life depended on it.

	schema:reviewBody "What makes a bad film? I will never say don't see this film because that limits your creative comparisons to others in the industry. The rating you see above 6.5 during this writing is the most inaccurate rating I have seen on IMDb. The Ruins is simply NOT a good film in any way shape or form.I have never been so extremely disappointed in a movie that seemingly had such potential as this. If I had a choice between seeing this again or Wicker Park which I always reference as the worst movie ever. Even the nudity yes I am a male was still unnecessary and just pointless. In fact the idea that I'm even reviewing it makes me angry!So anyway here is a very broken down review of the movie. I am not going to go over the synopsis there are plenty of well written summaries already here.Biggest Problem of All Before you get to the details  there is about 2 minutes of the film actually IN the ruins. That's it. The rest is on TOP of the ruins. At the onehour mark which is after the last you see of the inside I thought holy crap. Astonished bewildered and just plain depressed I continued to waste another 40 minutes of my life.Acting Pretty good acting especially the female cast. Kudos to them on working with a horrible script.Plot The idea of the film is a great setup. People interacting with a cursed ruins not completely original but it peaked my interest. However the writing was 010. I cannot emphasize this enough  the writing of this movie as well as the direction is some of the worst I have ever experienced and I have spent years of my life watching countless movies good and bad. Please be aware I have not read Scott B. Smith's novel this is associated with but if this movie is anywhere along the lines of the book then Scott Smith should be banned from the silver screen ever again. The reason is primarily inconsistencies lack of climax and extremely horrible resolution to the film.Character Development Absolutely none. Even afterwards I don't know crap about who anyone is nor do I care. You can't identify with anyone and you don't even remember their names afterwards. Just plain bad!Musical Score This is easy  there is none. Oh sure there is a cello here and a few drums there. But just listen during most of the film...silence. Music is what drives human emotion it has been a part of civilization since the dawn of mankind. Why remove that from films? No idea. Ask Carter Smith and whoever else is responsible.Plethora of flaws To make this short here are the major flaws I found in this film which is what destroyed its ability to ever be considered a decent film please revisit after viewing When their friend is shot in the first 20 min of the film nobody seems to care. They scream for about 10 seconds and then act as if it was 10 years ago. The girls shed a tear or two but the guys seem to say oh well.  The doctor of the group knows all about infections yet he doesn't give instruction to his friends who pick up the Greek with the broken back 3 feet off the ground by his legstorso. I mean seriously?  Who goes to an ancient Mayan ruin without flashlights radio's non cellphones dummies water supplies food and proper gear. I have never been to such a place but you better be sure I would at least have a flashlight and some batteries!  If I were a girl and I was sleeping on top of some ruins after my friend died and another man was paralyzed I wouldn't sleep in my panties. There are all kinds of strange men with weapons around you  why would you want to sleep in next to nothing?  Apparently there is only one side to the ruins since there were about 15 guys out there but no sign of anything on the other side. Guess production costs were too high and they couldn't construct a fully 3 dimensional prop.  Quote Four Americans just don't' disappear. Yes I too am American yet I would never even concoct that phrase in my head in time of crisis.  So they cut of a guys legs to save him but then in the next scene he is laying there with open wounds while dust blows into what remains. Real smart Doc.  The horrible one liner Well at least we cut his legs off about 1 min. after the guy dies. Sigh...  So the guy that is paralyzed from the waist down gets a bit to bite down on while they cut off his legs yet the girl they cut open with a knife just sits there watching and eventually screaming while the doctor sticks his dirty fingers into her wounds. Yea that makes sense.Ending Very slapped together as if they cut it down afterthefact just to rush production. 'Nuff said.In conclusion see this film but only over a friends' house that treats you to the rental fee. I would still suggest you see something that actually makes your heart rate raise even 1 BPM over your resting rate. At least then you'll be 1 more above what I was during this film. I could go on for another 10 pages but if anyone is still reading this they either have a lot of patience or agree with me. If you agree with me I am sorry to hear you wasted your time on the film as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just screened The Ruins and didn't think much of it beforehand. I thought it looked cool but didn't really expect anything bad or good. All in all it was better than most movies of it's kind and could've easily been worse but could've been just a little bit better too.Of course it's about a group of young people that by chance find their way into the old ruins of some old Mayan pyramid thing. When they get there they're ambushed by the Mayan? locals and pretty much held at the pyramidruins against their will. The locals won't let them leave and stakeout the outside of the ruins with guns and arrows and all that cool stuff. So really what's one to do in such a freaky crazy situation? There's not much to do other than survive which is what these people struggle to do throughout the movie. Not only do they have to worry about surviving from hunger or dehydration five people have only ONE bottle of water to ration plus a a tiny bit of food but they also have to worry about not only the crazy ass killer vinesfoliage that inhabit these ruins but they also have to worry about staying sane.Everything that can go wrong pretty much does. The worst things happen to these people. Really. I was watching and every few minutes I just said Wow that's a bitch. That sucks. Not only do they have to worry about freaky killer vines they also have to worry about themselves because one of them starts to go insane and one of them is seriously injured.I know what you're thinking. The whole notion of killer plantsvines sounds completely stupid. I thought so too. How was this going to be scary or even kind of freaky? Personally I thought they handled it pretty damn well. What could've ended up being ridiculous and stupid ended up being kind of freaky. It's not really the vinesplants themselves that are scary it's just the idea of what they are and what they do to these people that's kind of scary. The scenes inside the pyramid where it's just wall to wall of this scary crap was a little creepy because they were everywhere and it was overwhelming and claustrophobic at the same time. The scenes inside the actual pyramid are scary because it's so dark and it's such a confined space that these vines actually were kind of freaky because they were pretty much walltowall. It was an abyss filled with these plants that mimicked the noises around them making them that much more creepy.Of course the movie's filled with blood. Lots of it. The violence is great because most of it didn't come from the vines like you'd expect most of the crazy crap was a result of the characters the presence of the vines just made things worse and nastier. None of the gore is there to really shock you it's just there it just makes you cringe instead of yell in excitement like most movies of it's kind. There's a really nasty scene involving a guy legs a hunting knife a rock and a hot pan...and it's nasty....The only thing I was missing from the movie was that it didn't really pack much of a punch. It was just there there wasn't that much to it. A lot of what happens is sad and effective especially how a lot of these characters get screwed over but I would've preferred if there was just more to it. I thought it would've been better if the movie was just an allout downer even though nothing really positive ever happens. The characters act like you'd expect too. They go through every decision rationally and logically and opt not to do things that they know will get them killed. They react just as you'd expect someone to react in a situation like this.It's a cool movie because it doesn't take the easy way out like most horror movies do. Bad things happen to characters that you like even though you kind of hate to see it because all these characters are pretty likable and interesting. I thought the ending could've packed more punch because it ended up being too bland for my taste but that's just me. Even though some unexpected stuff happens it still could've used some more punch. But eh. Who cares?This was a pretty cool movie. Could've been a little better but could've ended up a lot worse too. Pretty damn entertaining and some pretty crazy violence. Score 8".

So the story is that a bunch of students has traveled to Mexico for their vacation where they meet this German fellow who knows about some forgotten temple of the Aztecs or the Mayans... But look out you guys this temple is haunted or cursed or something like that. So some people from an ancient tribe shows up to keep the students on the temple and now they are trapped... Now you're probably thinking HEY!... That doesn't sound THAT boring.... But wait I am of course saving the best 'till last... This temple is haunted by nothing less than a plant. An evil plant with the ability to copy sounds like a ringing phone and of course the ability to eat humans...Now if you by now are thinking that the plot sounds scary and you want to see it then by all means do it but I'm just angry that I didn't know what the hell this was... The summary says BLAH BLAH BLAH Ruins haunted by something evil.... Here's a quick biology lesson Plants can't be evil!!

Mostly I will just say that in order to have a good horror movie you have to have some scares or suspense or something. This really tried to be good and the actors did the best they could with the terrible script. Don't watch this unless you want to be scared of plants that's right plants!!! Sorry I realize that is a spoiler but that is it folks a vine is what you are supposed to be scared of! I might have read the book that supposedly Stephen King thought was good. I hope he skips this joke of a film. Try watching some good horror movies. Oh wait they are all PG13 pieces of garbage. We finally get an Rrated one and it blows! I don't know when we will get a good Horror film again but I sure hope Clive Barker or Wes Craven can come up with some NEW horror material. That' right I want some NEW material but as long as all these dang kids keep going to watch all these rehashed flicks the rest of us are going to have to continue to endure them! It is because of terrible movies like this that remakes keep happening. Although I didn't like this at all I was glad to at least try out a NEW horror flick. Please don't go see Prom Night or we will keep having to see more remade 70's  80's films!".

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason I can't see that people who have read the novel by Scott Smith will enjoy this adaptation as much as those who have not but nonetheless all will find this horror thriller extremely satisfying especially gore lovers.Amy Jeff Stacy and Eric Jena Malone Jonathan Tucker Laura Ramsey and Shawn Ashmore are on vacation in Mexico relaxing and drinking by the beach and poolside before they all go their separate ways to college. When they meet a German named Mathias who needs to visit a site of ancient ruins in the jungle to find his missing brother the vacationers although reluctant decide to tag along and have some fun on their last day. Boy did they have the wrong idea.Soon after they find the foreboding hidden path deep in the jungle they stumble upon an abandoned archaeological dig amidst an ancient pyramid covered in vegetation. The local Mayans show up and after they shoot one of the other tagalongs and force the group up the trail keeping guard around the pyramid it becomes clear that the vacationers are being held hostage. Fear hunger and insanity begin to set in as over a three day period the group's mentalities begin to diminish. One by one they fall prey to the evil vines that reside on the ancient ruins and it slowly becomes clear that they're probably not going to make it out of Mexico alive. Does this sound stupid? Sure. Killer vines that's laughable. But during their stay you slowly begin to realize this isn't funny at all. It's hardcore chilling and the vines are nothing to laugh at. They're used to a terrifying effect especially in a chilling scene when Amy and Stacey descend into the pyramid and the vines try to kill them.As far as quality the acting is top notch especially from Jena Malone and Laura Ramsey. Ramsey's Stacy suffers the worst physical harm and her performance is the best as she clearly goes insane when some nasty vines nestle in under her skin. All of the actors are exceptional and the audience will feel very attached. It's especially hard to watch when they start dying. These are real people in a horrifying situation. This isn't a mild horror film it pulls no punches. It's straightforward and although it is about killer flowers it's as good as a horror movie can get and the tension that director Carter Smith builds through the great pacing is unbearable. Kudos also goes to Jena Malone who has broken free of her childhood performances and is getting into much more mature work. She is promising here.I won't spoil the outcome of the character's fates but I will say for fans of the novel that the story is twisted around somewhat. Scott Smith adapted this from his book. The same events basically happen but he's switched up his characters and the end starts to stray further and further from his novel. That's not to say that it doesn't work for I think that it makes the experience better you can go in expecting some new scares even if you've read the harrowing novel. I was supremely pleased at this take on the horrifying story and I was surprised to find myself shaken when it was over particularly during the grueling scene when Stacy cuts into herself repeatedly with a hunting knife to pull out vines. This is one of the most unsettling scenes depicted in a horror film recently. You won't forget The Ruins and it's one of the best horror movies in a long time.".

Fabio Testi is good as a prison escapee with a mission and we find out in flashbacks just what that mission is what it has cost him and what his ultimate payoff will be. Charo Lopez plays Jessica somewhat more important to the plot than most women in these films and the film features quite a lot of her.

This meaty Western contains interesting plot  violence  shoot'em up and is quite entertaining  though drags at times  balancing in ups and downs . This moving Spaghetti packs noisy action  thrills  drama with surprising final . For money for pleasure for revenge he doesn't care why he kills or how .

Offbeat ChorizoSpaghetti Western coproduced by Spain and Italy and follows the Sergio Leone wake and it is proceeded in violent style . The film packs violence  shootouts  high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . It's a thrilling western with breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist Fabio Testi against the heartless Eduardo Fajardo and his underlings . Testi is fine he ravages the screen  hit and run and kills but is finally detained and strongly tortured . This movie is a lot of fun to watch. It's an acceptable story with a touch of peculiarity some particular characters and an amazing music score . The picture is a tale of justice and revenge as a man goes to a border little town and looks for vendetta against his tyrants . The basic plot is typical spaghetti western fare but what makes this movie stand out is its style . This is an exciting film plenty action  thrills fights  gundown and breathtaking outdoors from Spain as Alcala De Henares  Hoyo De Manzanares and La Pedriza  Madrid . Acceptable action sequences with rousing attacks and spectacularly realistic shootouts. Charismatic performance for whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor  Fabio Testi is good in his usual tough role . Fantastic performance by the always great Eduardo Fajardo as the slimy menacing exploiter make up for  here in his ordinary role as a corrupt and in a cruelly baddie character  he is terrific and bears a hysterical and tough aspect  subsequently he would play similar characters . Appears as secondaries the habitual in SpanishItalian Western such as Jose Calvo  Daniel Martin  Miguel Del Castillo  Rufino Ingles  Massimo Serato  Romano Puppo Goffredo Unger  and Luciano Pigozzi nicknamed the Italian Peter Lorre and many others. There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some shoot'em up or stunts every few minutes. There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax  as in the final gunfights and the spectacular conclusion . The movie gets the usual Western issues such as avengers antiheroes  violent facing off  exaggerated baddies soundtrack with Morricone influence  among them . The sense of pacing is such that his film can be counted on to move quickly and smoothly . The musician Bruno Nicolai usual collaborator to Ennio Morricone  composes a nice soundtrack and well conducted  this turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie as it's full of enjoyable sounds and haunting musical background  including unforgettable tunes that will play in your mind over and over long after the movie is realized. The soundtrack contributes tremendously to the atmosphere of the film including an emotive leitmotif the music score is perhaps the best part of this film . Striking and acceptable cinematography by Emilio Foriscot  though is necessary a perfect remastering .The motion picture was produced by Eduardo Manzanos Brochero who started producing Il Coyote and The Jiusticia De Coyote by Joaquin Romero Marchent with Abel Salazar and Gloria Marin .

	schema:reviewBody "When a top secret camouflaged plane is stolen and hidden secret agency BNS needs to get an agent into Hungary to uncover and prevent the sale of the weapon.  Agent Alex Scott is selected to go undercover with civilian boxer Kelly Robinson and use his upcoming fight to gain access.  However Kelly is less cooperative than first hoped and the mission risks being compromised. Can they stay out of trouble long enough to stop the sale?Take a little bit of Shanghai Noon a little bit of Rush Hour remove the oriental spice from the stew et viola!  you've got I Spy!  By mixing the essence of Jackie Chan's sidekicks from both these films and putting the resultant stew into a comedy spy movie you have this enjoyable if unspectacular film.  Wilson does his usual stuff but is still effortlessly funny Murphy does his best Chris Tucker impression and does a good job playing a little dumb and is funny as well.The plot sees them doing well it doesn't really matter what they're doing just that Wilson is Wilson and Murphy is playing up to good effect!  The plot just about provides enough material to keep the film going but the odd moment where the comedy banter quietens down the weaknesses of the plot are immediately laid bare.  This is not to say it isn't good enough for this type of film but just that at times it is all very slight and a bit thin. The comedy is more based on banter than anything else so if you like the two aforementioned Chan movies then this should be enjoyable as the humour is of the same vein.The support cast are all pretty average.  Janssen does an OK job looking pretty but Malcolm McDowell just shows his face to no great effect.  The funniest cameo is Gary Cole who plays an Irish spy playing a Cuban  he is just so unexpected in his actions that I had to be amused of course he is helped by Wilson'' reactions to his character.Overall this was kinda overlooked at the UK box office and I think it was because it was very slight and flimsy.  However for gentle laughs based on good banter rather than set up jokes this is a surprisingly fun comedy despite not sticking in your mind for longer than 15 minutes after you watch it.".

For better or worse I can say it was about what I expected.I put this movie in two categories and I think I placed it right it's a decent comedy with parts attempting to live up to an action movie. At its heart though it tries to be comedic and funny so that's upon what it should be judged. Thankfully you will get the chance to laugh out loud but unfortunately not as much as you'd like to laugh out loud at a comedy. I won't even mention rolling on the floor. The story isn't something really new but it has quite a few humorous plot twists. The socalled funny character is Kelly who really inflicts a fair amount of pain on his adversaries but he is just such a nicely drawn egocentric guy that it actually works on a comedic level. It's always just about him and him and then some more. The actors have their charm but I won't really dwell on this as they are as high profile as it gets Hollywood style so you know what you get. Perhaps Wilson could have spiced up his game with a bit of the unexpected but all in all he does what he does best.I did feel a bit let down by the special effects with some flimsy looking explosions placed here and there. However the host city of Budapest looked really gorgeous throughout making it well worth it's money shots.To draw the line the film isn't great but it's fine enough. No brilliant ideas or anything like that just the usual comic stuff.".

As funny as Murphy has been over his film career I for one have gotten tired of his loud and abrasive characters. It's getting tiresome.

Wilson was more likable in this film and Famke Janssen was interesting.There are a few wild action scenes in here and this film is played strictly for two things comedy and action.

	schema:reviewBody "Obviously the creators of this film did not care for the original show. If they had they wouldn't have gone so far out of their way to alter it beyond recognition.Kelly and Scotty were suave urbane competent. Neither one of them was James Bond. They never stopped into the spy center to pick up their gadgets.Kelly did NOT have a posse a bevy of biatches or a private airplane with his name splattered on the side and he did not refer to himself in the third person. AND he was a WHITE tennis player not a black exhibition boxer. I guess white men can't jump so they made the black guy the athlete. Robert Culp was incredibly sexy but did not refer to himself as Agent Double Oh Nine and a Half. I mean ewe!

If it were a stand alone flick about a couple of spy guys then so what. But as it is it's basically an affront to the original I Spy. Was their only research a poster or something? Because the original show is available on DVD so it's not as if it's gone from the planet.It brings to mind the horrific update of the Wild Wild West a Razzie Award fav.I don't have any problem with black people updating these characters and stepping into the roles. But do they have to do it so badly? Kelly and Scotty were never goofy or grossly incompetent. Ok so they walked into a couple of fists along the way. It was subtle comedy not this overblown mess. This Kelly and Alex are hopelessly off the mark.Updates can work ScoobyDoo Addams Family Bradey Bunch but there has to be SOME respect for the source material even if it's parody. How can you parody something you've never bothered to see.And gawd this movie makes me love Culp and Cosby even more than I already do!".

They never stopped into the spy center to pick up their gadgets.Kelly did NOT have a posse a bevy of biatches or a private airplane with his name splattered on the side and he did not refer to himself in the third person. AND he was a WHITE tennis player not a black exhibition boxer. I guess white men can't jump so they made the black guy the athlete.

It wasn't that long ago when this guy was extremely funny. Now the only thing funny is how he gets talked into appearing in sht like this. Title regards Eddie Murphy referring to himself in the third person. He plays boxing champion Kelly Robinson sent on a mission with reluctant agent Owen Wilson. Plot is replaced with idiotic situations with spy movie clichs and an ending that goes into overkill. Director Betty Thomas employs an idiotic scene where the agents end up upon a truck hauling new cars. They cut them loose at the pursuing villains but never does the driver stop to investigate his suddenly descending cargo. Thomas made a great comedy in Private Parts but this is hardly in the same range as that film. Murphy and Wilson are fine comedic performers but this junk does neither one of them any justice. Famke Janssen was a great villainess in the 007 film Goldeneye but she demonstrates none of that talent here. Malcolm McDowell will always be remembered for his great performance in A Clockwork Orange but this is a film he will likely not wish to reflect upon. The result is a pointless comedy with pathetic production values that render it totally unwatchable. Score 0  10".

The movies has very little in common with the show so why even bother trying to link them?  Trying to pull the nostalgia element into the picture.The movie itself is not bad but it isn't good either.  The jokes and the plot are rehash that's been done before but better.  Eddie Murphy pulls his loud and obnoxious but funny character out of the closet again but it only helps a little.  Wilson plays a sort of bumbling character that he does pretty well.  They had the money for a topnotch cast and plenty of special effects where is the story where is the great interaction you need for a good buddy movie.  This movie does have some funny moments but it doesn't stand up to what you know it could have been with this cast and a little more work.  It feels like someone was watching late night tv and said hey that could work let's get a black comedian and a white guy and make them spies and so they got everyone in place then said oops forgot a script whip one up quick.".

She must still live in the 60s when Hungary used to be quite different than in the last 20 years.I mean come on.... it's not only unfair to use 3035 years old ! police cars in the movie that takes place in 2002 but showing the population of the country as if 95 of it was even older the the director over 90 years old and as if all Hungarians were smelly jerks who don't shave their armpits is simple premature moronic and above anything extraordinarily amateurish. Not that the rest of the movie is great  it's not. The acting isn't bad but the dumb dumb script and the entire production quality incl. action sequences footage visual fxs notoriginal music and especially the location sound are awful match the uptodateness of the 35 y.o. police car. Really really lowkey. Just like our pathetic director.ps please if Betty Thomas or her representation reads this email email me at hazikristofyahoo.com I work in the film industry on a pretty high level and would be very interested in talking to you about this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "This is nothing that new really but it's still great fun for sure due to the wonderful chemistry between Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy!. All the characters are cool and the story is good as well plus Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy are simply amazing in this!. Malcolm McDowell is kind of wasted as the main villain however Famke Janssen makes up for it with her sexy performance plus it has a cool twist in the finale as well. I have never seen the TV series however I found the movie to be very entertaining and will indeed check it out if I catch it on TV! plus it had some cool boxing scenes as well. Gary Cole's accent was terrible in my opinion and I couldn't believe he did that role plus I think this should be at least near the 6.0 range. Also as far as Buddy Buddy movies go this one is really good and it had some really cool action scenes as well plus the scene where Eddie is telling Owen cheesy stuff to say to Famke to make love to her was just hilarious. This is nothing that new really but it's still great fun for sure due to the wonderful chemistry between Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Betty Thomas does a very good! job here with great camera work cool angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is a lot of fun!. Eddie Murphy is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely hilarious wonderfully cocky had wonderful chemistry with Owen Wilson did his usual great routine seemed to be enjoying himself had a very cool character and as always I loved his wisecracking! Murphy Rules!!!!. Owen Wilson is also amazing he is extremely hilarious played it straight like Murphy did his usual great routine and proved why he is one of the funniest guys in Hollywood today! Owen Rules!!!!. Famke Janssen is sexy as hell and did just awesome with what she had to do and had an unpredictable character I loved her. Malcolm McDowell is OK as the main villain but looked bored and was rather wasted and is totally restrained which was very disappointing. Gary Cole is so so here his accent didn't convince me at all and he didn't have many scenes. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. 12 out of 5".

	schema:headline " 5 Suggestions Would Make This Movie Look Better !";
	schema:reviewBody "1  Reverse it !  Eddie Murphy is the shy spy and Owen Wilson is the vain star. Because when you watch Wilson as the main hero and Murphy as the clumsy sidekick that is so inequitable. Murphy is such a charismatic star and Wilson is just the dude from Jackie Chan's couple movies of Shanghai. And to tell you the truth he in here didn't prove at all that he's more ! 2  The lead actress !!  Yes Famke Janssen can be vague and powerful which serves when we know about her dark side at the end. However Janssen looked older and taller than both of the lead actors. So please replace her we want more suitable more hot one ! 3  Where are the genuine lead actors of the original show ?!!  For God's sake Bill Cospy and Robert Culp were very much alive when this came out they're both still in shape and having the ability to act well better and funnier than others too ! and when the makers of the movie would cast them as guest stars it might be a nice gratitude attraction's factor and stamp of originality for the movie itself. But they DIDN'T !? By the way there is one clever episode of Cospy where the original 2 heroes of I Spy meet again and in spite of being just a 30 minutes of sitcom It was more enjoyable than some long expensive  supposed to be good  movies ! 4  A climax which's better than THAT fake brief one !  disregarding the very facile solutions of everything suddenly like the bomb which didn't explode because of the water or something !. Actually when they put 10 minutes sequence of masterly brilliant chase at the middle of the movie then a pale scene  surely shorter weaker and taking place at just one place  as the big climax of the same movie.. well that's what I call a rhythmic disorder. It easily makes the viewer go out of a movie with a condition of being not satisfied. It's the same problem of a lot of resent action movies like for example Enemy Of The State  1998 where it could render the whole enjoyment as a deficient ! 5  The Script  it had a lot of hastiness with the same clichs stereotypes events that we've seen hundreds of times before yet with smarter wittiness and stronger spirit. Not another project must end as technically wellmade Only ! I'm not talking about depths. I'm talking about the jokes' dexterity and the imagination's freshness. Because with THAT script in THAT direction I felt like I was watching 2 goofs hanging in the backyard of some big studio imitating other Action comedies.. poorly ! But sorry. All of those suggestions are without any capacity because what's done is done! It's not a good movie anyway and that's the fact of it already. However as we live the age of Hollywood's poverty of new original thoughts those humble suggestions of mine could be useful indeed but for the remake of this the sequel the prequel or maybe.. The spin off !".

Basically a high tech prototype stealth fighter aircraft called the Switchblade with the capability to become invisible has been stolen U.S. government. They believe that Gundars Malcolm McDowell is responsible and will want to sell the plane so the government have sent top spy Alex Scott Owen Wilson to investigate the theft and to help his assignment he is given a partner. He is teamed up with cocky loudmouthed and egotistical boxing champion Kelly Robinson Eddie Murphy who Gunnars is a fan of and he will be attending the big match in the place the plan has supposedly been taken. Naturally Alex is not happy with this pairing because he has seen how arrogant and irritating Kelly is but slowly as the situations they are in together become more dangerous they find common ground and similarities. Obviously after near death situations and Kelly trying to help Alex express his feelings for fellow agent Rachel Wright Famke Janssen there is the point when they break apart but they turn up at the same place. In the end after succeeding in the big match Gunnars does indeed show his villainous side but Alex and Kelly succeed in defeating him and finding the stolen plane. Also starring Gary Cole as Carlos Phill Lewis as Jerry Viv Leacock as T.J. Keith Dallas as Lunchbox and Sugar Ray Leonard as Vegas Commentator. Laid back Wilson and motormouth Murphy do alright individually and together in the scenes and there might be the odd giggle and explosive action and chase sequence but it is another television series based film that will not please everyone a not great comedy action.

The writing lacked much of the tension of Shanghai Noon Wilson's earlier film with Jackie Chan but Wilson's repeat of a low key inept character did provide some balance to Murphy's constant egodriven upstaging.My suggestion is catch this at a matinee where you can pay a reduced price for admission.

	schema:reviewBody "Colorful and thrilling movie based on facts  set in rural South of Spain in the 19th century about Andalucian bandits  plenty of thrills  action and strong drama . This motion picture is a SpanishItalian Coproduction compellingly realized by Forqu . It packs gorgeous outdoors  charming cinematography  a sad soundtrack and luxurious costumes  all meld together under Jos Maria Forqu's enjoyable direction . It is set during the 19th century  it tells the story of group of outlaws  from very different origins attempting to survive  hiding from the law enforcement officers and their fighting against the evil mining company that exploits the unfortunate people of their home village . Set in Andalucia where had been proliferating ruthless bandits  who alone or in bands  engulfing the region with merciless assaults and ominous murders . For ironies of history  many bandits were good benefactors of the humble and poor people  giving rise to the glamorous as well as romantic legends of the generous Andalucian Bandidos . In fact almost all of them were selfish and ambitious men  who could not be expected no sense humanitarian . These gangs were cruel and savage outlaws that infested the area from Sierra Morena and surroundings . These Bandoleros seem to have a whole praise by singing Coplas of blind sung in couplets and romances of blind singers which dedicated to bandits as Lucero  Luis Candelas  or Cura Merino . It begins with Andrs Luis Pea killing a foreman  being helped by Pedro Alberto Farnese who accidentally kills a warden  then  both of whom flee and trying to embark towards America . Along with their womenRosario  Isabel de Pomes and Maria  Luisella Boni fleeing from justice  take refuge in caves in a hilly area  in Sierra Morena  Andalucia and they join forces with a band led by Juan Cuenca  Francisco Rabal . As the gang is commanded by Jun Cuenca whose name runs throughout the mountains and villages  being relentlessly frightened and hated by townsfolk . This provoking film contains a parable of freedom and justice and dealiing with the good thief from the Christian tradition  where one of the condemned is pardoned by Jesus  El Rico . Nice acting by Francisco Rabal in the role anineteenth century Andalusian bandit similarly to Llanto para un Bandido.IT has magnificent scenarios masterfully photographed by the great cameraman Cecilio Paniagua and including gorgeous landscapes predominating throughout the story . It was one of the first color films produced in the country . Being shot on various locations in Burgos Castilla y Len Marbella Mlaga Serrana de Ronda Ronda Mlaga Andaluca  Spain .The movie achieved a deserved award in Berlin as Silver Berlin Bear and Nominated Golden Berlin Bear . Besides  it won Cinema Writers Circle Awards Spain 1958 CEC Award Best Actor Francisco Rabal . And National Syndicate of Spectacle Spain 1957 WonPrize of the National Syndicate of Spectacle Best Film  Best ActorFrancisco Rabal and Best Supporting ActorLuis Pea .The motion picture was well directed by prolific filmmaker Jose Maria Forqu and shot in comic book style and with great flair  being noted as one of the first Spanish music videos . As Bring a Little Loving or Dame Un Poco De Amooor is full of videoclips realized in Richard Lester's Help and A hard day's night style . Here Forqu carries out a decent  nimble and professional direction  though including some flaws and gaps . Jos Mara Forqu was born in Zaragoza  being father of actress Vernica Forqu and director lvaro Forqu . He was a director and writer known for filming some classic Spanish films  such as  Un Millon En La Basura 1967  Accidente 703 1962  Amanecer en Puerta Oscura 1957  Embajadores En Infierno 1956 and especially Atraco a Las Tres 1962 .

This wonderful film has fallen between the cracks somehow but the discovery of it only adds to it's charm. Like a rare natural wonder hidden far off the beaten path some afternoon you may be trudging through your day and stumble onto this film a beautiful sentimental picture. If you like Capra you will love Gigot. Not for the dark of heart or impatient this film will move you to tears. It has the feel of a small foreign film but has the heart as big as any film ever made. Directed by Gene Kelly the set's are wonderful the acting subtle and superb the music perfect and most important of all The Great One Jackie Gleason's performance as the mute Gigot has a depth and pathos that few actors have ever achieved. I wonder if John Candy wasn't partially reflecting on 'Gigot' when he played his Del Griffeth character in 'Planes Trains...' There is something behind these actors performances that could not have been acting. Like Buster Keaton one gets the sense that deep down the character is a reflection of the pain the actor truly feels. Check your local listings to see if this is playing and record it. A 10 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "This splendid film is a lost masterpiece. Most everyone I talk to that has seen it saw it on a local television matine. So far as I can tell it is not available on video. This wonderful film has fallen between the cracks somehow but the discovery of it only adds to it's charm. Like a rare natural wonder hidden far off the beaten path some afternoon you may be trudging through your day and stumble onto this film a beautiful sentimental picture. If you like Capra you will love Gigot. Not for the dark of heart or impatient this film will move you to tears. It has the feel of a small foreign film but has the heart as big as any film ever made. Directed by Gene Kelly the set's are wonderful the acting subtle and superb the music perfect and most important of all The Great One Jackie Gleason's performance as the mute Gigot has a depth and pathos that few actors have ever achieved. I wonder if John Candy wasn't partially reflecting on 'Gigot' when he played his Del Griffeth character in 'Planes Trains...' There is something behind these actors performances that could not have been acting. Like Buster Keaton one gets the sense that deep down the character is a reflection of the pain the actor truly feels. Check your local listings to see if this is playing and record it. A 10 out of 10.";

	schema:headline " A heartwarming Gleason tribute to Chaplin and The Kid";
	schema:reviewBody "This precious movie Gigot was made by Jackie Gleason as a tribute to his love for Charles Chaplin and his classic silent film The Kid 1921. Gleason's character Gigot is poor basically a tramp and mute the muteness a plot device to emphasize that communication in film is all the more profound and emotional when the actor does not speak but has to communicate to the audience through facial expressions and pantomime alone. Jackie Gleason would have been a WONDERFUL actor in the silent era. He is outstanding in Gigot. I'll bet Chaplin loved this film. Even the lovely French style music reminded me of similar music in Chaplin's silent classic City Lights 1931.Instead of a little boy Jackie Coogan in the original Gleason makes the little child a girl one who is so traumatized by life and living with a prostitute mother that she rarely speaks either. These two souls don't need words to communicate their love for one another.One of the most powerful scenes in the film almost painful to watch is when Gigot takes little Nicole the winsome Diane Gardner whatever happened to her? to a church. Of course she has been raised without faith and Gigot yearns to teach the child about Christ's sacrifice on the cross but he can't tell her in words. He starts hitting himself in frustration but the love of the little girl rescues him from his torment. They'd never put a scene like that in a modern mainstream film in Hollywood today. Not politically correct.Just like with Chaplin films there are mixtures of pathos and comedy. These juxtapositions are timeless and still effective as long as the human heart remains sensitive to others besides itself.Often broadcast on the Fox Movie Channel but unfortunately in pan and scan. This film needs a remastering and an official DVD release in its original widescreen.10 out of 10.".

We fear for the gentle Gigot and we want to give him a voice so that he can express what he represses deep beneath his pleasant demeanor. We want him to love and be loved by the charming child but we want to infuse him with a worldliness that will better arm him to deal with the selfish woman of the streets that can't deserve exposure to a heart like Gigot's......We know that he's destined for heartbreak and that being mute will only sharpen the alienation that he will feel....Jackie Gleason's understanding of his character is more than solid his interpretation of the lonely janitor is a revelation. The most gifted Comedians' comedy is fueled by a unique inner pain. This reservoir can be tapped for Drama as well sometimes even more effectively. This is at first poignant but at last an unforgettable film.".

Looking back the subject matter is a little adult the streetwalker planning to run off with her lover  take her little girl thus leaving Gigot. I have yet to see it on video or even on late night.

	schema:headline " Definitely a film to watch";
	schema:reviewBody "I had a lot of first reactions to this movie. For example and in no particular order 1 How did they ever find backers to bankroll this movie? 1 hr 42 minutes of almost no dialogue following a mute around some very unpicturesque neighborhoods. Yes it is at times very moving other times wonderfully funny. But I'm amazed anyone thought this movie had ANY chance of selling enough tickets to turn a profit. I'm certainly glad it was made but also very surprised.2 I found this movie very cynical. That's not a criticism by any means just an observation. The folks in the neighborhood are almost uniformly cruel which of course makes Gigot's small kindnesses stand out that much more. Even at the end SPOILER ALERT at Gigot's funeral the neighbors are all extremely hypocritical. And when they then discover that Gigot is still alive they go back to their miserable old selves. It's not the sort of thing I would have expected from 1960s Hollywood but I found it all that much more interesting as a result.3. I was often struck by Gene Kelly's success in capturing little details of everyday street life in an unglamorous part of Paris. Though An American in Paris was as far as I know all shot on MGM sets in Hollywood it seems to have awakened a real interest in Paris for Kelly. This is not a picturepostcard Paris. Actually the way it was shot very often reminded me of The Red Balloon 1956 which was shot in the same sort of poor Paris neighborhoods. There is also the same sense that innocence will get hurt in such neighborhoods.4. I was surprised and pleased that this was not a lot more sentimental. Gleason and Skelton two of the mainstays of TV in the 1950s and early 60s often indulged in excessive  for my tastes  sentimentality in their mime sketches. I thought Gene Kelly did a good job of keeping the movie from spilling over into that. In the same respect the prostitute is not redeemed and reformed at the end. In its own way it's more realistic than I would have expected coming from Gleason.5. The music is very noticeable throughout sometimes for better sometimes not. But the sound of that music evoked in me memories of the Jackie Gleason Show which I haven't seen in half a century. He must have used the same arranger to get that sound with the strings. Very distinctive. To anyone who watched American TV in the 1960s it immediately says Jackie Gleason. I haven't seen the remake with W.H. Macy. I understand it's no longer set in Paris. But then the Paris Gigot portrays had largely vanished by the time The Wool Cap was made. Les 30 glorieuses as the French call the three decades after the War renovated much of the squalor that you see in the movie you would have to go out into the banlieue to find an equivalent and then the population would no longer look French to Americans  or in a different sense to some rightwing modern Frenchmen.In short this is a very enjoyable 1h42. If you think most of humankind is cold and hypocritical you will find plenty of material to support your views. The scene in the bar where the men get Gigot drunk so that he will make a fool of himself I found very painful to watch. It was well done yes but very painful. If you think dogs and cats are cute you'll be happy as well. The use of the cat to lead the camera around in parts of the movie which again recalls The Red Balloon is really very clever. If you're looking for romantic views of Paris or romance for that matter you won't find it here. You will find a good story well performed and well directed. It's not Citizen Kane but I've sat through a lot worse without complaining.Just a note after a second viewing. This really is one fine movie. Very cynical yes presenting a very cynical view of most of mankind. But a very moving film. Gleason's performance really is remarkable.".

Set in 16th century Europe the story's foundations are firmly planted in realism. The horror comes from masterful application of suspense fear and dread that is gradually introduced in each scene. By the time you reach the climax you're paralytic gripped by fear  eager to watch to the end but terrified by what may happen next.Having said that this movie isn't for everyone. If you're after a bunch of oversexed blonde and artificially enhanced teenagers being hunted down by a knife yielding psycho  you're gonna hate this. If you're after fastpaced action you'll be yawning throughout the film. If you're after a complex horror film marked by developed characterisation a unique premise and set in an unfamiliar time in history you will be pleased.This is a rare horror film that focuses on atmosphere and restrained scriptwriting resulting in a mature sophisticated experience for the discerning viewer.

	schema:headline " Like guilt this horror sticks with you";
	schema:reviewBody "Following the end of the decadeslong war between Russia and Sweden a group of soldiers from both countries is assigned the task of defining a new border. Among this group are Eerik and Knut two brothers who couldn't be more different. The former is a vicious soldier who has been fighting his entire life while the latter is a civilized collegian who came along due to his expertise in crafting maps. On a scouting run separate from the rest of the group the two encounter a farmer and his daughter. Bad things happen and the brothers rejoin the expedition the next morning but what transpired at the remote farm leads to severe feelings of guilt for Knut. He even feels that he's being followed. Continuing their trek across the barren terrain the men eventually come across a mysterious town where no such place should logically exist. What's more something seems very off with the inhabitants and more importantly with the sauna that stands just outside of the village's reach.I caught this back in early December on a cold dreary night. As much as I despise cold weather it actually made for a fitting atmosphere in which to watch this film. Not just because of the snowy locales or skies drained of color but also due to the chilling predicament of the characters and the weight of the film's themes. Sauna is a picture that festered in my mind for a good while afterward. I didn't know what to expect going in but I came out thinking that this was one of the most intriguing horror films I had seen in years. I bought the DVD shortly after my initial viewing though I still have yet to revisit it. All these months later it continues to pop back into my head from time to time. It has stayed with me in a way that only a truly haunting piece of work could. I intend to rewatch it when I feel that the timing is right not before.The film boasts a strong period setting and some effectively unsettling moments all about that first time Knut catches a glimpse of a figure across the swamp set against a mood of pure despair. The characters here are as cold and gloomy as the atmosphere which surrounds them. The acting is resoundingly strong across the board most notably that of Ville Virtanen as the bloodthirsty Eerik. His character is that of a murderous sociopath who has never known anything but war yet Virtanen instills the part with a certain sense of empathy and regret underneath the seething hatred. We are also privy to cinematography that while dark and drained of life has an exquisite beauty to it. You really feel the chilled air right along with the characters. I'm still not sure that I fully understand everything that goes on in the film but hey half of the fun is speculating. There are numerous layers here to keep your mind busy with interpretation. Oh and the ending is quite something as well!Alas discussion around the web appears to be sparse when it comes to this title. If you like eerie artistic horror you owe it to yourself to give Sauna a shot. You may not care for it as this kind of film will never be for everyone but you will witness one of the more unique genre entries in many a year. All in all it's a fascinating film that is rewarding in more ways than I can count.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having premiered his debut feature Jade Warrior at Toronto in 2006 A.J. Annila returned with his second film Sauna yet another blend of two unexpected genres. He was originally approached to make the movie as a teen slashercomedy but thankfully the producers had enough faith in him to make a serious horror movie that would appeal to both the art house crowd and die hard horror fans.Sauna follows a group of Swedish and Russian soldiers who are assigning new borders after a decades long war between the two countries has ended. In this group are two brothers Erik the lifelong soldier who keeps a running tally of the innocent people he's killed and Knut the younger more pacifist brother who is part of the group because he is an expert mapmaker. After an unexpected encounter with a farmer and his daughter the two are haunted by unshakable guilt as they continue with the expedition. The soldiers find a small isolated village in the very center of a large swamp an eerie place where no children have been born in years and the old do not die. It seems almost as if God has forgotten them.With the discovery of the village and its solitary sauna Annila builds on the horror aspects of the film and presents some genuinely scary images. The review on the TIFF website says the film recalls both Tarkovsky and Eli Roth and I agree Sauna is at once contemplative and terrifying. It raises questions about morality and guilt and at the same time has scenes that are as scary as a Japanese ghost horror. The acting from Ville Virtanen and Tommi Eronen who played the brothers was superb. The cinematography was was also really beautiful. Overall I feel like this is one of the best horrors of the last few years and it is highly recommended. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Eurohorror is doing good business lately. France GreatBritain and Spain are all battling on the front lines but smaller countries like Belgium are producing splendid genre works too. Enter Finland a somewhat cinematic void for me showing their muscles with Sauna. A horror film that fairs well with its European peers but also succeeds in giving Finnish cinema a face although a grim one.The film's premise is kept rather vague and for people not living close to Finland or familiar with its history the film might take a flying start. Two teams one Finnish and one Russian are sent out to draft a new border after a longraging war. They cross the barren lands in order to fight a more civilized war in trying to decide who gets what. Even though the film is set a good 400 years back in history it could've well been just 50 years ago. Not that the film looks too modern for its setting it's just that the characters are never really surrounded by recognizable cultural references. Safe from a pair of glasses and the clothing it's all swamp and unforgiving nature that is served to the audience.The two teams don't get along very well but the one really stirring things up is Erik a longlife warrior who has trouble adjusting to the newfound peace. Even though he wears glasses to fake a distinguished look he is a true barbarian murdering and abusing everyone coming across his way. The only one he seems to care for is his little brother who was sheltered from the war as college student. The first half of the film is spent drawing out the relationships between the different characters giving the audience some time to adjust to the happenings in the film. From the moment they arrive in an unlisted village in the middle of a swamp the the core plot and the titular Sauna make their entrance.Sauna has a couple of things going for it. First of all there is the performance of Ville Virtanen portraying the Erik character as someone that is simply terrifying. As simple as those glasses may be they make him out as someone with a certain sense of civilization while in reality he is as bad as they come by. His performance is hard as nails and unsettling. The rest of the casts plays along nicely although none of them really make a big impression.Visually the film is very consistent. Grey dark colors and rough landscapes make up most of the visual scenery. No bright colors are seen even the blood in the film is dark red almost black. The camera work is solid too and helps in setting the atmosphere nicely. But even though it gives the film plenty of flair there's never that little extra to make the film rise above its rivals. The soundtrack too is extremely fitting with some very nifty sound deformations and good supporting music. It has an ambientlike quality only furthering the grim and dark atmosphere of the film.As the film progresses the story is slowly revealed an even though the premise is intriguing you'll be left guessing at least for a little on how it all fits together. The ending is somewhat vague and even though impressive won't bring you any clear answers. Looking back at the film it has a lot of parallels with Vinyan even small details  just think of the shots of water becoming bloodsoaked though Sauna is a much more subdued film without any real climaxes or cinematic bursts. Depending on what you like more you might prefer this one over Vinyan which has more curves compared to the straight line that is this film.Nonetheless Sauna is an impressive experience solid in just about every department. Extremely strong lead nice and fitting visuals great soundtrack and intriguing storyline. And if you won't miss the climaxes this will be exactly your thing. A recommendation for all fans of European horror out there. Just don't be expecting guts and gore Sauna plays at atmosphere grit and travels through the darker parts of the human mind. 4.05.0".

I was there for the world prim ere in Toronto and the director was there to share with us what he intended to say in the movie. It's not especially profound but wise nonetheless. He said that if you go too far along in life without facing those you hurt then eventually it's too late to make amends that eventually if you try to face your victims they'll be faceless.

Luckily I saw some pictures of this Finnish movie and they looked really great.Everyone looking for a horror movie should stay away from this. Its pretty laughable that so many people focus on the sauna and some ghosts in this movie as typical horror clichs while the director works so obviously on making every single piece and image in this movie a symbol for guilt.Sauna or Filth which is the far more fitting title referring to a statement by one of the Russian soldiers in this movie is placed after the RussianSwedish war around 1600 when a group of Russian and Swedish soldiers are setting for the new borders. The opening of the movie with the drawing of borders in blood and then the first shots of water turning red already indicate where this movie is going. Everything is carried by some great cinematography and the lead characters 2 brothers of a very different kind. One is Knut a mapmaker with high goals the other is Erik a soldier with a grim past who has his problems adjusting to the new peace.Erik constantly looking for trouble soon gets the group of soldiers into problems when messing with a family. The town the group soon finds in the middle of a swamp becomes a clear symbol of Erics previous atrocities with as many inhabitants as victims on Erics list a strange girl reminding them of recent wrongdoings also involving a sauna and animals and people who clawed out their eyes. The whole issue of not being able to face your past is present throughout the movie that is more like a fable. There is plenty of interesting historical information as well as philosophical dialog including the story about the king and filth or the thoughts if hell is just a place that god turned his back on. The place is soon presented and the irony is that yet everyone is fighting for the land soon there is a place that no one wants to take but rather wants to give to his enemy.Sauna is full of these abstract images and the finale is far from a clear resolution. After all the director clearly tries to make the viewer have his own thoughts. Actually I am still working on figuring the closing images out but however this is a damn interesting and different movie with great cinematography acting and an interesting setting. There sure are some horror elements in this movie but I'd rather consider this a mix of arthouse movie and drama and its definitely worth giving a chance.".

The only person he looks at with a certain form of consideration is his younger brother Knut an academic and philanthropist who has ambitions about going to Stockholm to become a professor. The two brothers are posted at the cold border between Sweden Finland and Russia in the years 1595. The war that started in 1570 between Russia and Sweden after Russia had made an attempt to conquer the swedes possessions in Estland is over. Now the borders are to be set and a commission consisting of the brothers Spore and three Russian's sets the course north on a two day march through a widespread quagmire to meet another commission by the river Kiertm. The tension between the men rises rapidly and when Knut experiences clear visions of a woman he and his brother left behind in a locked cellar his moral compass is awakened.Finnish director AnttiJussi Annila's second feature film an ominous and atmospheric horrorthriller about two very different brothers' mystic experiences during the Nordic twentyfiveyearwar visualizes the fine line between reality and imagination through it's dominating use of visuals and sounds. Through passionless landscapes surrounded by mountains trees and water we follow five uncooperative men who are haunted by a horrible misdeed committed by the Swedish brothers. The men arrive at a nameless village that has a sauna which according to the folk myth can wash away people's sins. A sauna reminiscent of the one in Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker 1979 where one's innermost wishes could come true.Sauna has a masterful narrative that moves very quiet for a long time. The invincible boost of intensity has a striking effect and escalates with unpredictable pace towards the film's thrilling climax. The enigmatic screenplay is a substantial example of the art of storytelling within Scandinavian film and obtains a short though leading dialog that underpins the film's obscure atmosphere. With his perceptive filming Aj Annila follows the characters at all times with the exception of some distant photos of the grand landscape and the esoteric sauna. Characteristic for Annila's direction is frequent use of close ups and handheld camera movements. A metaphysical study of character a terrifying folklore or a historic drama Sauna is no stereotypic horror film. Without exaggerating the use of splatter scenes Aj Annila manages to create a cryptic poetic illusory and continuant atmosphere which is a character in itself and almost solely representative of the film's horror aspects. From the mythical depictions of milieu and the detailed costumes a realistic sense of time and place is contrived. The acting is excellent and seen as a whole Sauna is an audiovisual and epic masterpiece with auras of mysticism that tinder's of artistic expressions.".

If you're a fan of foreign films and don't mind a bit of confusion and tomfoolery when it comes to the plot this may be the movie for you.Sauna's beautifully filmed and acted even though the subtitles on my copy were rather choppy I believe mine was a fan translation as it was filled with typos grammatical errors etc. I got the emotional feel of the movie the entire time just via the beautiful acting. It has some gorgeous sets and costumes as well  although this isn't historically accurate at times. As a horror movie it fails. It isn't going to scare you while you watch it it may be unsettling or unnerving at times but you won't scream or wet yourself. I prefer this personally. The end scene hit me mostly because that sort of thing I won't reveal much as to not ruin it terrifies me. In fact it was after a nightmare related to that damned scene that I woke up and decided to write this!If it was trying to be more than unsettling though it failed.The plot is confusing and can be draggy. I think if someone sat down and gave this movie proper subtitles it seems no one has yet it would be less confusing but not much so. Some of the mysteries never panned out and there are a few plot holes that aren't exactly small. If this movie had had another 15 minutes of screen time it's a very short movie imo it would of been much more creepy and less tiring trying to puzzle out those plot holes.I would watch it again  for the acting beautiful filming and the occasionally unnerving scene. I wouldn't watch it for horror or consider it the best movie ever made.".

One poster tagged it as the unsettling area between paganism and Christianity. While I hoped there would be a true exploration of what I perceived to be a supernatural tale about sin vs redemption what I got was a real quick period piece about a Japanese style ghost.The visually stunning film does a wonderful job of conveying a very unsettling landscape... one that does seem devoid of any type of god and the main character of Eerik is wonderfully portrayed by Ville Virtanen. But overall the film seemed too short lacked closure and the obvious ending that stresses 'open to interpretation' comes off more like 'closed to thought.' Even though it runs at 84 minutes and with subtitles... the overall effect is impressive to a degree. But the overall absence of expository dialog in the last 20 minutes leaves one almost baffled.I expect good things from the director... AnttiJussi Annila. And while Sauna is a step in the right direction of good moviemaking it trips over it's subject matter at the finnish line.".

I keep discovering more beauties in Lelouch's works and at the same time wonder more and more how much that France he pictures or more precisely the behavior of the people is drifting out of understanding from me like it was a different planet and I live just a 2 hours train ride from France.. Recommended very much if you like to experience the unexperienced  and that's what movies are for aren't they?";

Other actors are good also but the show is stolen by these two especially Luchini who creates a whole scene under a tent in the mountain that was clearly not forecasted.This is a movie about coincidences about love about love's fools. This is a pure entertainment that makes you laugh but also makes you cry by moment. We find out all Lelouch's signatures touch including some dreaming philosophy lot of great talkative exchanges and a scenario that just doesn't want to go anywhere else than to offer moments of lifes as intuited by the title of the movie Tout ca...pour ca is a famous quote in French meaning something like All this... just for that??.If you like to dream if you dont need to be shown an american plot with good guys bad guys princess to save and solid morale at the end you will like this movie and have a truly great time watching it. If on the contrary you need to be taken care of and you dont like to let your brain go with the story pass this movie.

These two themes are the backbone of the two chief plots of the film. On the first road we follow the love toin gs and froin gs of a judge Francis Huster and a lawyer Fabrice Lucchini with their wives and mistresses. Then on a second road Lelouch films the adventures of three immature men acted by Grard Darmon as a taxi driver Vincent Lindon as a waiter and Jacques Gamblin. They wound up together after a disappointing love affair for each of them and plan to earn as much money as they can to leave France with Jacques Gamblin's daughter. Their twobit tricks and swindles will bring them to court.Do these two plots complement themselves? There's superimposition and you have to wait until the end to see fusion maintained. Frankly Lelouch had better discarded his judges' love stories because they are uninteresting and flimsy. It's the same drawback as le Chat et la Souris 1975 another honorable effort from Lelouch in which all that deal with Philipe Lotard's sentimental life was gratuitous filler. And in spite of Lelouch's virtuosity at camera his directing seems extracted from a film of the seventies and makes his effort a little obsolete. It also could have gained with a more tightened editing.But when the film lays the focus on the incredible adventures of the colorful threesome of men it really gathers pace and takes off thanks to the energy conveyed by the three actors. It amounts to a beneficent change of scene fueled with humor.All this for that? It means a little lame but enjoyable excursion from a filmmaker who persists in developing his personal ideas in films?

I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was though especially the acting from Lindsay Lohan. Her character in the film as well as in real life is one messed up young woman. Doing or saying whatever is needed at the time to get her through the situation her character is very realistic and believable. I personally know a young woman with just these types of issues and reactions. Ms. Lohan's acting ability is phenomenal  and like other amazing but difficult actors her offscreen antics never show up in the finished product. If she can straighten her life out an Academy Award will be hers someday.As always it's wonderful seeing Jane Fonda back on the silver screen  and she looks superb! Too bad Mary Tyler Moore went crazy with the plastic surgery or she could and should! look this good now too. Felicity Huffman is as usual stunning  her work is simply too good to ignore  hopefully her and her husband William H. Macy will act together in the future. I'm surprised he wasn't involved in this project as a producer or something like he was in Transamerica.This film is difficult  it's a very very serious film with deep hardtowatch issues going on. Yet at the same time Garry Marshall has tried to make it a lighthearted comedy too  it can't be both. From the looks of the finished product I'd say a lot of the film ended up on the cutting room floor  too many scenes are simply not dealt with the way they should have been  like when Jane goes to buy the liquor  where's the struggle with the issue of what she is doing? Nowhere  instead we are treated to a supposed comical scene of her trying to hide the fact she's bought the liquor. Bizarre! It's like the film makers felt the movie had gotten too heavy at that point and needed some comic relief. Strange! The Mormon aspect was dealt with poorly too  the guy's issues with not having premarital sex rang false  an LDS Mormon church member who was raised in the church would know the reason why premarital sex is frowned upon not just that it would make God mad. The writer seems to know no more about the LDS religion and beliefs than some person told him  and he seemed to do no more indepth research about it.Still don't let these complaints turn you off from seeing Georgia Rule. It's well worth your 2 hours.".

The Mormon aspect was dealt with poorly too  the guy's issues with not having premarital sex rang false  an LDS Mormon church member who was raised in the church would know the reason why premarital sex is frowned upon not just that it would make God mad. The writer seems to know no more about the LDS religion and beliefs than some person told him  and he seemed to do no more indepth research about it.Still don't let these complaints turn you off from seeing Georgia Rule. It's well worth your 2 hours.";

The advertisements and marketing of this movie also seemed lackluster.

Seventeen years old Rachael has grown up to be a liar loose character rebel illmannered etc. Lilly decides to leave Rachael with Georgia in one of the small towns of Idaho  hoping that Rachael will learn some good things from her grandmother. There are funny moments between religious Georgia and rebellious Rachael. Soon Rachael discloses that she was sexually molested by her stepfather Arnold Cary Elwes and this becomes the intrinsic turning point in the movie. Rachael keeps on changing her statements every now and then. Is Rachael telling the truth or lying? That forms the remaining story.The character of Rachael was very puzzling to begin with. Being careless sexually active liar outspoken rebellious made us cringe to begin with. But as the story progressed the character with such weirdness looked so real and acceptable.All the actresses acted well  Jane Fonda Felicity Hoffman but this very talented Lindsay Lohan captures the show  all in all. Hats off to Director Garry Marshall for bringing such a women's issue on the forefront and touch such a delicate topic out in the front fore.The landscape of Idaho is capture miraculously. Some reviewer disagreed with the overly religious bent of Idaho people but I think that does not matter  one need not take such small things to heart. It is just a story and as projecting as being nonreligious is a nonissue so projected being religious should be.Overall a welcome experience of an underthecarpet subject  of child molestation  treated with not so much heaviness and darkness.Stars 7.5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Audiences can rebel and demand money back for numerous reasons. Viewers certainly do not like being misled by a trailer.Georgia Rule is a prime example of an illmarketed flick. Truth be told I don't know how anyone could market the film. Is Georgia Rule without merit? Absolutely not! Is it a quirky comedy peopled by foreigners from California mixing with the quirky locals? Yes. Is it a slapstick comedy with clever comebacks? Yes. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM??? Quirky and clever comprise at the most 15 minutes of the film. Here is a serious drama about a family disintegrating because of communication problems and damaging behavior. Slowly the onion peels before the unsuspecting town and the audience too. Long hidden problems drive squirminducing behavior on the part of the three female protagonists. The supporting cast whether villains or heroes perform wonders with roles better fleshed out than expected. The photography immerses watchers into smalltown Idaho and its natural beauty. The score is unobtrusive  good. Now to the big stuff  this script by Mark Andrus is another of his studies in deception distrust sex and revenge. None of these subjects is softened  the full impact of behaviors is up front and inyourface but the characters seem real  these are not clichs.  I did not expect such a weighty film from Garry Marshall. He doesn't shy away from the material. He trusts his leads to get the job done.  And they deliver. Felicity Huffman walks a line as deftly as a tightrope walker. Her pain and confusion are very visible without being melodramatic or overwrought. Jane Fonda has a more difficult role  her Georgia barely reveals anything. Her every fiber tenses with control  you can almost hear her jaw clenching as she watches her daughter and granddaughter with disbelief. The surprise for me was Lindsay Lohan. A wise viewer would do well to set aside all the stories about her behavior during the making of this movie what she delivered was simply amazing. Her character Rachel wears her demons on what few clothes surround her body. Miss Lohan's facial expressions veer wildly from vulnerability to defiance to dismay to anger and everything in between. The three ladies who carry Georgia Rule may fight it out come Oscar time. As for the film I can't recommend it if only because of the subject matter.".

Georgia won't tolerate this though she knows there's something wrong and has to let Rachel know that there are people there who love her and remind her the difference between right and wrong.The story was really good I think some of the characters could have used a little more developing but it still worked. Was it a chick flick? Oh yeah. But I think this is one of those rare one's that I don't mind. The girls did a great job on acting so did Dermot Mulroney who played Simon. The ending was just a bit flat and I felt like there could have been a better conclusion but you'll see if you watch it.

	schema:headline " Garry Marshall brings another emotional and moving story to screen";
	schema:reviewBody "I suppose ultimately my expectations weren't high going into Georgia Rule considering the lack luster reviews by critics and the ongoing poor press of it's young star Lindsay Lohan but I forgot one key element...the director. Garry Marshall is brilliant!! He has done some of the most entertaining films in history including my personal favorite The Princess Diaries as well as Pretty Woman Beaches and a host of absolutely classic Television shows. Marshall has a way of capturing reality he has a way of making us fall in love with his characters and be riveted by their lives and what happens to them. He just makes his films come alive and Georgia Rule is no exception to Marshall's rule. The film is a little more gritty and dark perhaps a little more adult than what Marshall usually delves into but that being said it still has it's charm it still has a dark twisted humor to it and it still has Hector Elizondo who Marshall likes to cameo or feature in his films. The cast is brought together very well and everyone works well together in it and you love being a part of the daily routine of the small town. There is enough drama emotion comedy and overall scenes of pure joy to make this a good movie.I'll start with Jane Fonda. As famous as she is this is only the second movie I've ever seen her in...the first was MonsterInLaw and I became an instant fan of hers. Her comic timing her character and her performance was downright brilliant. In this turn she is Georgia a firm and dedicated woman who lives on her own and but is well known to the townspeople. She has a set way to do things and no one is going to tell her otherwise. Georgia is terrific...the perfect match for Fonda and does a great job. Fonda is such a talented actress and Hollywood elite and she lights up the screen and yet still comes across as this down home lovable character. My only complaint is that she wasn't used more in the film than she was. Felicity Huffman I became a big fan of after watching the brilliant film Transamerica where she played a man wanting to go through the transformation into a woman...her performance was amazing. In Georgia Rule she plays the daughter of Jane Fonda's Georgia Lilly. Now Lilly hasn't always appreciated her mother's firm nature and has had a rough go of it battling alcoholism two marriages and her wild and uncontrollable daughter. Huffman isn't the forefront of the story but she adds a lot of emotion to her role. Her battle with alcoholism and her daughter and her estranged second husband give way to some very powerful moments. She is a great actress. And now we tread lightly into the world of the recently arrested Miss Lindsay Lohan. We all heard she was nearly fired from this film for her wild ways and I mean her role in this film must strike so close to home it hurts. As Rachel Lohan plays a confused and messed up post high school graduate who likes her recreational drugs drinking and random sexual encounters. She doesn't want to listen to so called 'authority figures' and thinks her life is just fine but she's hiding a devastating secret. Lohan I thought overall was good...she didn't match the performances of her senior performers but to go up against Jane Fonda is pretty impressive. She has some great lines and she definitely pulls off the firecracker role very well. Also on the plus side she looks relatively healthy considering her real life health issues as of late. Dermot Mulroney is also very good and actually shows some life to his usually rather dull performances as local DoctorVeterinarian Simon. Simon becomes almost like a father figure to Rachel and is the one to really bring her back around to coming to terms with herself and her issues. Mulroney is a good addition to the cast. Cary Elwes rounds out the cast as Rachel's stepfather and Garrett Hedlund as her love interest. Elwes is appropriately normal looking but still becomes the villain in a different way and you want to see him get his just end. Hedlund is okay as the naive and love struck Harlan. He comes across as a bit of a dolt which is okay but ultimately you don't want the main romantic interest to be downright stupid. Naive is one thing.Despite it's serious content the film is about sexual abuse and comingofage in a different sort of way...something director Garry Marshall does with style always the film has some genuinely funny moments. I wouldn't hesitate to see this film again because there was something charming about it and ultimately it did have it's happy ending although my one big complaint is that Cary Elwes' character never truly gets what's coming to him. I wanted to see Lohan take her aggressions out on him. However the scene with Jane Fonda's Georgia hitting him with the bat is priceless. This film is a classic I think and will go far despite critics and dollar signs. See it!! You'll enjoy it!! 8.510".

	onyx:emotionText "I suppose ultimately my expectations weren't high going into Georgia Rule considering the lack luster reviews by critics and the ongoing poor press of it's young star Lindsay Lohan but I forgot one key element...the director. Garry Marshall is brilliant!! He has done some of the most entertaining films in history including my personal favorite The Princess Diaries as well as Pretty Woman Beaches and a host of absolutely classic Television shows. Marshall has a way of capturing reality he has a way of making us fall in love with his characters and be riveted by their lives and what happens to them. He just makes his films come alive and Georgia Rule is no exception to Marshall's rule. The film is a little more gritty and dark perhaps a little more adult than what Marshall usually delves into but that being said it still has it's charm it still has a dark twisted humor to it and it still has Hector Elizondo who Marshall likes to cameo or feature in his films. The cast is brought together very well and everyone works well together in it and you love being a part of the daily routine of the small town. There is enough drama emotion comedy and overall scenes of pure joy to make this a good movie.I'll start with Jane Fonda. As famous as she is this is only the second movie I've ever seen her in...the first was MonsterInLaw and I became an instant fan of hers. Her comic timing her character and her performance was downright brilliant. In this turn she is Georgia a firm and dedicated woman who lives on her own and but is well known to the townspeople. She has a set way to do things and no one is going to tell her otherwise. Georgia is terrific...the perfect match for Fonda and does a great job. Fonda is such a talented actress and Hollywood elite and she lights up the screen and yet still comes across as this down home lovable character. My only complaint is that she wasn't used more in the film than she was. Felicity Huffman I became a big fan of after watching the brilliant film Transamerica where she played a man wanting to go through the transformation into a woman...her performance was amazing. In Georgia Rule she plays the daughter of Jane Fonda's Georgia Lilly. Now Lilly hasn't always appreciated her mother's firm nature and has had a rough go of it battling alcoholism two marriages and her wild and uncontrollable daughter. Huffman isn't the forefront of the story but she adds a lot of emotion to her role. Her battle with alcoholism and her daughter and her estranged second husband give way to some very powerful moments. She is a great actress. And now we tread lightly into the world of the recently arrested Miss Lindsay Lohan. We all heard she was nearly fired from this film for her wild ways and I mean her role in this film must strike so close to home it hurts. As Rachel Lohan plays a confused and messed up post high school graduate who likes her recreational drugs drinking and random sexual encounters. She doesn't want to listen to so called 'authority figures' and thinks her life is just fine but she's hiding a devastating secret. Lohan I thought overall was good...she didn't match the performances of her senior performers but to go up against Jane Fonda is pretty impressive. She has some great lines and she definitely pulls off the firecracker role very well. Also on the plus side she looks relatively healthy considering her real life health issues as of late. Dermot Mulroney is also very good and actually shows some life to his usually rather dull performances as local DoctorVeterinarian Simon. Simon becomes almost like a father figure to Rachel and is the one to really bring her back around to coming to terms with herself and her issues. Mulroney is a good addition to the cast. Cary Elwes rounds out the cast as Rachel's stepfather and Garrett Hedlund as her love interest. Elwes is appropriately normal looking but still becomes the villain in a different way and you want to see him get his just end. Hedlund is okay as the naive and love struck Harlan. He comes across as a bit of a dolt which is okay but ultimately you don't want the main romantic interest to be downright stupid. Naive is one thing.Despite it's serious content the film is about sexual abuse and comingofage in a different sort of way...something director Garry Marshall does with style always the film has some genuinely funny moments. I wouldn't hesitate to see this film again because there was something charming about it and ultimately it did have it's happy ending although my one big complaint is that Cary Elwes' character never truly gets what's coming to him. I wanted to see Lohan take her aggressions out on him. However the scene with Jane Fonda's Georgia hitting him with the bat is priceless.

If it had just been a typical chick flick that didn't say or do anything bad I think it would have sucked. The plot was okay but the ending left me wanting more closure. It had a Happy ending but I wanted to know what happened to the Stepdad if Rachel actually had a tape if her and the boy got together. There were a lot of unanswered questions without obvious answers. Over all I thought it was a pretty good movie I laughed a lot and would definitely rent it when it came out on DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "Sadly most audiences are probably giving this film a negative reception though it is one of the most assured pieces of this year. Jane Fonda is back with her stoic nonsensical acting lending gravitas to the piece. That should be enough warning that the piece is not going to be a silly comedy but a piece dealing with darker and forbidding issues.To begin with every behavior has a source and the rather impulsive selfdestructive defense mechanisms of the Lohan character have a horrible beginning. She alledges some misconduct on the side of a male relative and this sets off a series of storms that eventually lead to a satisfying conclusion. The frustrating part of the movie is not that anyone is bad but that much more can be expected from all the participants. Jane Fonda does light supporting work as the skeptical grandmother than is afraid to lose her footing by changing routines. She is perspective but ineffective when providing solace. In fact she messed up raising her own daughter now a victim of her own demons and facing a new tragedy with her daughter's own crisis.Marshall does well with the darker themes and he has cast the film beautifully with Lindsay Lohan proving she is a girl fully able to show the many facets of a troubled character. She is also funny in a defensive way sympathetic and never a true victim. She shows the strength that skipped a generation in her family and reluctantly accepts her grandmother's approach to life.Georgia Rule suffers not from its material but Hollywood's silly approach in marketing a film that should have been treated with more respect.".

Legally blonde was an excellent film. Georgia Rule on the other hand was a disorganized weak poorly written unrealistic example of movie making at its worst. by the end of the film I didn't care who was lying or if anything was resolved. The most important thing in a film is a good STORY. This story is weak and never develops just because the subject matter is deep doesn't mean the story is good. A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change and is primed for that change over the course of the movie. In Georgia Rule the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Secondly there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time you've only got a couple hours in a movie. That means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the poorly written story and the litter of weak dynamic characters I can't even say I liked anyone. Every character was a mess. That's fine if your're writing American Beauty but not when you're attempting a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being no I'm not cutting her any slack because she was molested crap happens to everyone and we're all responsible for our own actions. The Dudley Do Right Mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitments...and Simon I mean seriously what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl who's been molested just stay over occasionally unless he's an actor or a politician.

Male characters are just for decoration cardboard clichs with nothing better to do than either fall in love with the complicated women either being total jerks.Women might enjoy this movie more than I did but it is hardly average. There are some good jokes and there is decent acting in it. The script wanted to be something like an onion being peeled away showing layer upon layer of familial complexity but they either run out of imagination or out of money by the end of the first half.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say that I was really disappointed when I went to start writing a review for this film. According to the page for this film the location shooting never got out of the state of California. I really did think that they actually shot this film in Idaho. I guess in a sense I have to tip my hat to the location managers and set designers for what they did.That being said the film is about three generations of females in one family. Mom Felicity Huffman is having all kinds of behavioral problems with daughter Lindsay Lohan growing up in worldly San Francisco. So she's shipping her off to Hull Idaho to stay with her grandmother Jane Fonda. Fonda's an old hand at dealing with rebellious kids as Felicity was and is quite the wild child in her day. Of course all three generations come to an agonizing reappraisal of their situation and in that fateful summer they get to know each other better.Life does imitate art because the film is now getting reams of publicity due to Lindsay Lohan's behavioral problems in real life. And of course Jane Fonda back in the day was no stranger to being a rebellious individual. She still has a few detractors me included for visiting and broadcasting from a country we were at war with. Still you can't deny the talent gene.In Georgia Rule's favor also is that it does sort of put a lie to that old line about there being no women's roles written these days. The female players definitely have center stage here.There are three substantial male roles that are filled nicely Dermot Mulroney as the town veterinarian and Huffman's former sweetheart Cary Elwes as Huffman's sleazy husband and Lohan's stepfather and Garrett Hedlund as the young Mormon kid Lohan first seduces then falls for. In many ways Hedlund has the most interesting part in the film.Best scene for me Lohan's confrontation with the girlfriends of Hedlund's former girlfriend. Has to be seen and I have no doubt she would have carried out her 'threat' to them.It's a good film it has both it's serious and comic moments nicely blended.".

If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a dramacomedy then he should have watched The Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. Junebug. And so on. And so on.The only way I feel I can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that Georgia Rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation. Say that the movie The 40 Year Old Virgin was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child. But instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn belly laughs and comedy would ensue with all of the characters' reactions being that of fake lifeless human beings pretending to care. Throw in a yellow parakeet Dermot Mulroney as the flattest most nondimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy tootanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other and you've got Georgia Rule.I found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers screenwriters actors editors etc..who have a lot more talent and aren't getting noticed.Don't see this movie  my rule.

Yes the ending is somewhat Hollywood happier than real life my bebut not in the way you might expect and not without an understanding of many of the difficult underlying realities.Lindsay Lohan's performance in this movie blew me away. I left the theater today thinking Oscar for her. I like Lindsay Lohan but I don't remember thinking before this that she deserved an Academy Award.Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman also bring powerful performances to this movie. And Lindsaywowthank you for an amazing courageous performance. Yes the character of Rachel is cute and sexy and spunky and rebellious but Lindsay also makes her real and shows the powerful connection between the interweaving of her character's personality and her struggle to cope with an impossible problem.There is one moment about halfway through the movie when there is a moving confrontation between Jane Fonda's character and Lindsay Lohan's. The entire success of this movie hinges on Lindsay's performance in that moment. If she hadn't hit it perfectly the movie would not work.She was perfect. And it was all simply just in the look in her eyes.This is an amazing movie worth seeing more than once and deserving of far more serious consideration than it is currently getting.

The welldefended French coast has been dubbed the Iron Coast by the Germans. The British command is reluctant to give the greenlight to this operation codenamed Operation Mad Dog mainly because of the high chance of failure. The Canadian officer is known to have botched a few previous operations under his command. The main opponent of the Mad Dog operation is a Royal Navy captain whose son died during a failed commando raid led by Major Jamie Wilson. However after much debate and haggling the operation is approved by the R.N. Admiral in charge. The training of the commandos is harsh under real battle conditions featuring live explosions and machinegun fire. During the training several accidents occur resulting in a few deaths and wounds. The operation's future hangs into balance but it finally receives the ...";

The purpose of the raid was to disable the only dry dock on the French coast that was large enough for the German battleship Tirpitz sister ship to the Bismark. During this stage of the war this was a very important consideration as the Tirpitz could of created a great deal of havoc if it where to get into the North Atlantic and attack the vital convoys that where keeping England in the war. The actual raid was a success. The dry dock and associated equipment was damaged so thoroughly that it no longer was a viable option for the Germans to risk their last battleship in the North Atlantic. It was also a very costly mission. A bombing raid that was supposed to provide a diversion actually had the opposite effect and alerted the Germans. The losses incurred where described as appalling with most of the commandos killed wounded or captured. To reflect the importance of this raid 5 Victoria crosses and 68 additional awards where handed out to the some of the 600 particpants. Only the battle of Rorkes drift saw more Victoria crosses awarded for a single action.".

	schema:headline " Fair Canadian commando flick with a good cast";
	schema:reviewBody "Paul Wendkos is an average director at best but has the ability to turn a potentially terrible movie into a satisfying action flick. Attack on the Iron Coast is yet another lowbudget entry in a series from Oakmont Production and although it presents nothing new but holds attention so well that the clichs are easy to overlook.John C. Champion's script is a fictional takeoff on a real WWII event much like his earlier and much worse Submarine X1. This time the story is based on Mountbatten's raid on the dry dock at St. Nazaire in which a ship laden with explosives crashed into the repair dock and destroyed important German repair facilities.Lloyd Bridges A Walk in the Sun plays Major Wilson a takeoff on Lord Mountbatten who's first commando mission in France turns into a shambles. But he is given a second chance when he plans an even riskier operation to destroy the German repair dock at LeClair SteNazaire. The only problem is that Captain Franklin Andrew Keir Lion of the Desert is opposed to the mission from the start and the two must cooperate as the mission is a joint ArmyNavy operation.This film is really a mixed bag. What's good is really really good and what's bad is really really bad. Lloyd Bridges gives a sincere performance as Major Wilson but his character isn't developed as much as I would have liked. We're treated two a twodimensional hero who doesn't have any weaknesses he brings to mind John Wayne's Colonel Kirby of The Green Berets. His conflict with Franklin is the core of the movie and provides enough tension that the German enemies aren't needed until the final act.The German characters are disappointing. We're treated to some very shallow characterizations which bring to mind the worst excesses of Hogan's Heroes. The officers sit and watch dirty movies and become sated on fine wine and liquor while their subordinates bring in urgent reports of an approaching enemy ship. This is very unfortunate because both George Mikell and Walter Gotell are very capable German actors who have had very good roles in the past  chiefly The Guns of Navarone where they acted together in 1961. This really let me down. It would have been wiser to exclude German characters altogether and dwell on the commandos some more.The action sequences are withheld until the final 20 minutes or so of the film and range from wellcrafted to laughable. Scenes of British commandos dashing about in alleyways and dockyards are excellently staged and wellshot even if they're very generic. The scenes of British minesweeper in the bay however feature some of the worst miniature work of the period. It's obvious that this feature had a low budget because they aren't many extras or realistic explosions in the entire film.Wendkos manages to keep things interesting by moving his camera fluidly and often shooting from high or low angles giving the audience a unique perspective on the dialogue or action. The sets are alltop notch and the exteriors are very welldecorated. The German dockyard is expansive and really has a fresh authentic feel to it and the various British war offices are equally believable.Attack on the Iron Coast is nothing more than a routine satisfying 90minute film. There is nothing fresh and unique about it but some fair acting and fast pace keep it engaging.".

Having watched it I discover a movie with superb performances by Lloyd Bridges and Andrew Keir in fact the entire castand better production values than A list war movies such as In Harms Way Tobruk and Operation Crossbow.This is the only movie Paul Wendkos directed that has impressed me. Using oblique camera angles and careful pacing he manages to get the most out of his meager budget. Likewise the producers managed a much more expensive looking movie along the lines of The Dirty Dozen with many more sets to dress. The photography here is equally as good as In Harm's Way. Too bad the script isn't betterwith a rather trite subplot to explain Keir's conflict with Bridges. Keir's arguments against the raid did not require them. What I did like about the script is that what appeared to be obstacles Keir used to sabotage the raid actually contributed to its success.I must disagree with another reviewer regarding the ship miniatures. They look realistic on my computer screen. However I have seen other movies In Harms Way 633 Squadron The Guns of Navarone where the miniatures and flats looked perfectly fine on the big screen but not on TV. In fact in both War of the Worlds 1953 and Thunderball 1965 the wires holding up the models can be clearly seen on television but not the big screen and both of these films were nominated for Oscars War of the Worlds winning.I don't want to spoil your enjoyment of this film by overpraising it. So please go into it with an open mind and judge it by 1968 technical standards. I believe you won't be disappointed.".

As the valiant soldiers sailed it down the throat of the enemy . They carry out their risked assignment while keeping their activities hidden from outsiders and German airplanes . At the end  they arrive in the enemy port commanded by Nazi officers  Van Horst Walter Gotell and Captain Strasser George Mikell . The Germans had a number of reinforced submarine pens but the target of the actual attack was the dry dock facilities . It was called The St Nazaire Raid or Operation Chariot that commenced on March 28th 1942  it was a successful British amphibious attack on the heavily defended Normandie dry dock at St Nazaire in Germanoccupied France during the Second World War.World War II war film loosely based on the Operation Chariot  an attack on the Iron coast in St Nazaire . It's a fictionalized recounting of the known mission on St Nazaire  here called LeClair SteNazaire with a sustained and predictable story  although partially based on true deeds . Acceptable acting from Lloyd Bridges and Andrew Keir as two commanders who take on a strong battle of wits . The film progresses with Commander Major Jamie WilsonLloyd Bridges takeoff on Lord Mountbatten training the crews of the ships  even though the crew lacks faith in his command abilities . He must overcome tensions with his antagonist Captain FranklinAndrew Keir . This and the 1952 film Gift Horse are based on the same World War Two raid carried out by British forces on the locks of the French port of St Nazaire in 1942 . The highlights of the movie are the violent as well as exciting fights of the crews who successfully fend off an final attack at St. Nazaire or LeClair . And thrilling scenes at the final when the ship penetrates the highly armored stronghold  nets in the port  and explosives blow up under the dry dock . It includes stock WWII  especially when show up some planes  the clips of the diversionary air raid were taken from the film The Dam Busters 1955 . Atmospheric cinematography by Paul Beeson  Walt Disney's usual cameraman though an alright remastering is necessary . Being filmed on location  shooting was filmed in Gaddesden Place Hemel Hempstead HertfordshireMillwall Dock Millwall London England UK French port of St. Nazaire and St Katharine Docks London England UK . Good and enjoyable musical score by Gerard Schurmann  though parts of Ron Goodwin's score from Squadron 633 1964 were used without credit. The film was produced by Oakmont production  a company exclusively dedicated to warfare films Submarine X1  Hell boats  Mosquito Squadron  Thousand plane raid  Last escape . The motion picture was professionally realized by Paul Wendkos who displays enough spectacular images to keep things interesting . Apparently director worked on the film's original screen story with writerproducer John C. Champion but is uncredited for such . Wendkos whose works remain undervalued in USA directed various TV series and some films as Guns of the Magnificent Seven  Cannon for Cordoba Gidget The Flight The legend of Lizzie Borden and Hell boatsThe film is based on real facts  these were the followings  The operation was undertaken by the Royal Navy and British Commandos under the auspices of Combined Operations Headquarters on 28 March 1942. The extra ships were along to transport all those who took part back to England after the operation. All of the 18 addition ships were sank during the attack. Other ships did accompany the attack but remained outside the area of the attack. In the actual operation the obsolete destroyer HMS Campbeltown was the lead ship in the attack. She was accompanied by 18 other smaller craft. St Nazaire was targeted because the loss of its dry dock would force any large German warship in need of repairs such as the Tirpitz to return to home waters via either the English Channel or the GIUK gap both of which were heavily defended by British units including the Royal Navy's Home Fleet rather than having a haven available on the Atlantic coast. The obsolete destroyer HMS Campbeltown accompanied by 18 smaller craft crossed the English Channel to the Atlantic coast of France and was rammed into the Normandie dock gates. The ship had been packed with delayedaction explosives well hidden within a steel and concrete case that detonated later that day putting the dock out of service for the remainder of the war and up to five years after. A force of commandos landed to destroy machinery and other structures. Heavy German gunfire sank set ablaze or immobilised virtually all the small craft intended to transport the commandos back to England  the commandos had to fight their way out through the town to try to escape overland. Almost all were forced to surrender when their ammunition was expended and they were surrounded . After the raid 228 men of the force of 611 returned to Britain 169 were killed and 215 became prisoners of war. German casualties were over 360 dead some killed after the raid when Campbeltown exploded. To recognise their bravery 89 decorations were awarded to members of the raiding party including five Victoria Crosses. After the war St Nazaire was one of 38 battle honours awarded to the Commandos the operation has since become known as The Greatest Raid of All within military circles. The men who took part in this attack received more awards for bravery then any other operation of it's length then any other operation before or since.".

It includes stock WWII  especially when show up some planes  the clips of the diversionary air raid were taken from the film The Dam Busters 1955 . Atmospheric cinematography by Paul Beeson  Walt Disney's usual cameraman though an alright remastering is necessary . Being filmed on location  shooting was filmed in Gaddesden Place Hemel Hempstead HertfordshireMillwall Dock Millwall London England UK French port of St. Nazaire and St Katharine Docks London England UK . Good and enjoyable musical score by Gerard Schurmann  though parts of Ron Goodwin's score from Squadron 633 1964 were used without credit. The film was produced by Oakmont production  a company exclusively dedicated to warfare films Submarine X1  Hell boats  Mosquito Squadron  Thousand plane raid  Last escape . The motion picture was professionally realized by Paul Wendkos who displays enough spectacular images to keep things interesting . Apparently director worked on the film's original screen story with writerproducer John C. Champion but is uncredited for such . Wendkos whose works remain undervalued in USA directed various TV series and some films as Guns of the Magnificent Seven  Cannon for Cordoba Gidget The Flight The legend of Lizzie Borden and Hell boatsThe film is based on real facts  these were the followings  The operation was undertaken by the Royal Navy and British Commandos under the auspices of Combined Operations Headquarters on 28 March 1942. The extra ships were along to transport all those who took part back to England after the operation. All of the 18 addition ships were sank during the attack. Other ships did accompany the attack but remained outside the area of the attack. In the actual operation the obsolete destroyer HMS Campbeltown was the lead ship in the attack. She was accompanied by 18 other smaller craft. St Nazaire was targeted because the loss of its dry dock would force any large German warship in need of repairs such as the Tirpitz to return to home waters via either the English Channel or the GIUK gap both of which were heavily defended by British units including the Royal Navy's Home Fleet rather than having a haven available on the Atlantic coast. The obsolete destroyer HMS Campbeltown accompanied by 18 smaller craft crossed the English Channel to the Atlantic coast of France and was rammed into the Normandie dock gates. The ship had been packed with delayedaction explosives well hidden within a steel and concrete case that detonated later that day putting the dock out of service for the remainder of the war and up to five years after. A force of commandos landed to destroy machinery and other structures. Heavy German gunfire sank set ablaze or immobilised virtually all the small craft intended to transport the commandos back to England  the commandos had to fight their way out through the town to try to escape overland. Almost all were forced to surrender when their ammunition was expended and they were surrounded . After the raid 228 men of the force of 611 returned to Britain 169 were killed and 215 became prisoners of war. German casualties were over 360 dead some killed after the raid when Campbeltown exploded. To recognise their bravery 89 decorations were awarded to members of the raiding party including five Victoria Crosses. After the war St Nazaire was one of 38 battle honours awarded to the Commandos the operation has since become known as The Greatest Raid of All within military circles. The men who took part in this attack received more awards for bravery then any other operation of it's length then any other operation before or since.";

	schema:reviewBody "Haunted by his failure in a previous mission Major Wilson signs up to lead Operation Mad Dog even though the risks are high.  Mad Dog seeks to bring several boats of commandos onto a heavily fortified part of France's coast  one of them full of explosives.  While the commandos raid the shore the ship will explode and reduce the defences to rubble and leave the area open for attack.  However accidents during training are only the start of a fraught and dangerous mission.From this period it is not unusual to have a commando movie  if fact they were quite common and quite popular.  Taking this as my reason I decided to watch this film but quickly regretted bothering.  The plot is not anything new  training a group of men for a risky mission against all the odds.  The first half of the film is quite slow and the training is given none of the wit of Dirty Dozen and other movies that have done it better.  Worse still is the fact that the film delves into Major Wilson's personal life giving long scenes the feel of a melodrama.  The actual attack is quite short and quite ordinary  lots of men running round alleys for 5 minutes.  The model work is also pretty poor considering the time it was made  they really could have done better.Another reason for the film lacking teeth is the fact that I never really cared about the characters.  It was surprising that given how much of the film is spent talking that only the two lead characters were developed to the point that I could give a damn about either of them.  Of the two leads Bridges is miscast and didn't convince me he was a tough wartime Major. Keir however was solid and I enjoyed his character.Overall this is a pretty poor film that is dull for the most part.  It aspires to be a film like Dirty Dozen but it never manages to get anywhere near it.  Poor characters uninvolving development weak action and a plot that does exactly what you expect it to.  Even if you want a film in this genre you can do way better than this.".

He is at conflict with several other allied officers especially Andrew Keir who blames him for the death of his son conflicting with him over every decision made aboard ship. Bridges is seemingly acting defensive over the failed mission and seems all too eager to clear his name by becoming commander of a very important upcoming mission. Drilling scenes are interpolated with his home life which leads to his grade school aged son asking the above question.Every veteran working actor in the 1960's seemed to be asked to star in these assembly line war dramas and while some became classics a good majority of them are instantly forgotten. This one is amongst the later overly scored in domestic scenes and focused on personal conflicts in the preparation of the mission attacking German troops on the French coast rather than coming together to defeat the enemy. It slows down horribly with these scenes and it makes it hard to root for characters who are fighting on the same side but are carrying on their own private war. This seems to have been rushed out as part of a quota agenda without regards to anything that might make it stand out like The Dirty Dozen. I will give credit to where it is due however and say that the ending is incredibly action packed and filled with tension making it worth the ride to get all the way through.".

This lowbudget World War II thriller marked the first collaboration between The Burglar director Paul Wendkos and scenarist Herman Hoffman a year later Hoffman reunited with the director on Guns of the Magnificent Seven. Clearly Attack on the Iron Coast doesn't show Wendkos in the best light. The combat sequences are adequate but immaculate. Soldiers spin fall and tumble but they dont bleed. Not only does this United Artists release imitate the narrative of 633 Squadron but also the producers have recycled composer Rod Goodwin's 633 compositions. Oddly enough one seems to underline the other. Compare the use of certain musical cues with those in 633 Squadron and you can tell what is happening.An aura of foreboding hangs like The Sword of Damocles over a topsecret raid in this wartime actioneer. Our heroes plunge into combat on the French coast at the port of Le Claire. Le Claire ranks as the German fleet's most vital and important installation on the French coast. Actually the raid resembles the historic St. Nazaire raid in 1942. The commandos follow headstrong commander Major Wilson Lloyd Bridges into enemy country. Over an hour elapses before we are treated to gunfire galore on enemy soil. Wendkos and Hoffman focus largely on the Allies and the agonies of Major Wilson who defends the mission despite the wrath of his worst critics. One of those critics is Captain Franklin Andrew Keir who lost his son during a previous attempt to sabotage those German coastal facilities. The closest Iron Coast comes to conflict is the drama between Wilson and Franklin. We get only the merest glimpse of the Germans before our heroes apply burnt cork to their faces. Altogether this exercise in stiff upper lip heroics is lackluster until the commandos launch their raid. Attack on the Iron Coast is far from memorable but eminently tolerable.

Despite the presence of Lloyd Bridges this is a very cheap filmwith lots of recycled film footage and a plot that just limps along to the conclusion. I only recommend it for diehard war film fansREAL diehard fans indeed! Things to look for Lloyd Bridges playing a Canadianyet inexplicably his wife and son have British accents!

Here she plays a car thief just out of the slammer after her dear old mom has gone to the big jump lead in the sky but not before leaving a cassette tapping either Delon or Belmondo as the biological father of Paradis. So off she goes to find them via a boosted car which just happens to belong to the Russian mafia who are not best pleased.

It was however a failure because this film was expensive to make due to its stars Vanessa Paradis JeanPaul Belmondo and Alain Delon the restless story and its treatment. Critics were hardly tender towards the Leconte 1998 vintage and view the three stars' incredible adventures in an unfavorable light. With hindsight une Chance Sur Deux is sandwiched between two Leconte masterworks Ridicule 1996 and la Fille Sur la Pont 1999 and didn't seem to be in the hearts of many Leconte aficionados.However I'm eager to restore it to favor. Sure it doesn't match the two aforementioned Leconte works as well as other pearls in his filmography but it has more than good stuff to spend a pleasant time in front of your telly. The starting point could make you guess you're going to watch a reflective piece of work. A young girl Alice is released from prison and is confronted to a serious problem two men who are retired gangsters claim to be her father. They will have to team up to save their daughter from the clutches of the Russian Maffia Colombian traffickers and the police.Quite quickly after having timidly broached the issue of paternity on a humorous tone Leconte's film takes a lighter direction to entertain thanks to an unlikely but exciting scenario with stunts chases interspersed with laughter. I especially dig the moment when Belmondo and Delon oblige a gangster to practice bungeejumping to help them in their investigation. And amid this flood of unexpected twists and mad adventures shot with a style close from the comic strip Leconte didn't lose his trademark with witty cues and one of his thematic tastes the duo of men even if in this domain une Chance Sur Deux is much less elaborated than other Leconte films on the same topic like Tandem 1987 or l'Homme Du Train 2002. One also shouldn't forget some eccentric characters like the cop acted by Michel Aumont.The three stars don't take themselves seriously and it's the position adopted by Leconte to better involve the audience. So don't be fooled by the lukewarm reception the film garnered about ten years ago and let yourself immersed in this maelstrom of agitation shot with rigor and a conscientious manner.".

I was even surprised to learn that Leconte had been unimaginative enough to use it again ! As an advertiser he knows his job. But this movie convinces me he should stop spoiling film... Turning to Belmondo and Delon they are lost for action movies. And Paradis... well she was a rebellious teenager in Noces blanches. And she looks quite the same in 1 chance sur 2.

With the help of famed paleoanthropologist Yves Coppens as a cowriter and scientific adviser he also directed Homo Sapiens 2005 and Le sacre de l'homme 2009. So it is hardly surprising to see him further explore his favorite subject in a new work the difference this time being that he has chosen the big screen to express himself in preference to television.Ao le dernier Neandertal which illustrates the thesis confirmed by recent discoveries based on DNA analysis that some Neandertal and Homo Sapiens had offspring together undoubtedly benefits from this change of scope which does not mean that it is the best in Malaterre's fourinstallment saga. Very spectacular indeed the film has epic qualities when it comes to Ao's struggle for survival in all weather conditions aesthetic assets when it describes the beauty and cruelty of nature of wild life. And actor Simon Paul Sutton is very believable as Ao the desperate creature who sees all the members of his clan die around him managing to express his feelings mostly through looks grunts and body language. Which is some kind of a feat. Last but not least is the creation of a consistent specific language that the viewer does not understand with the exception of one or two words. Too bad then that Malaterre resorted to a commentary in modern language to explain exactly what happens. JeanJacques Annaud had been able to do without such an expedient in his amazing Guerre du feu.On the other hand for all the modernity of its scientific approach the film is nothing else but a boy meets girl story complete with the usual clichs boy and girl don't get on love is born and they live happily ever after. Worse the female lead Aruna Shields is too pretty to be true. Luckily her acting is good which partly compensates for the initial mistake but you need a good dose of suspension of disbelief to really come into this aspect of the story. Despite this weak point Ao remains worth watching. Even if a few details leave to be desired you really feel you are living a long long time ago constantly asking yourself whether YOU could have survived in such a hostile environment. This is enough to justify the price of your movie ticket I think.".

	schema:headline " Not too bad though a little obvious.";
	schema:reviewBody "I actually quite enjoyed this movie even though for the first ten minutes or so I was hating it with a passion. So why the change of heart? Well first off the movie is without speech of any meaningful kind at all. The prehistoric people do have languages but you can't understand any of it. It's not a big deal since the scenes do a pretty good job of showing not telling as they play out. The plot is fairly simple as well so you are never really in much doubt what is going on.But here's where the problems I experienced in the first ten minutes come in. Even though it is essentially speechfree there is just the worst documentarystyle narration going on at times. You're probably saying this isn't too bad. But trust me you have to hear it to understand why I hated it so much.The narrator reads his dialogue like he's just been informed his entire family has died in an automobile accident. Flat uninterested and with all the liveliness of a cymbalclapping monkey toy that's had its batteries removed.Without exception its the worst delivered narration I've ever heard.

	onyx:emotionText "I actually quite enjoyed this movie even though for the first ten minutes or so I was hating it with a passion. So why the change of heart? Well first off the movie is without speech of any meaningful kind at all. The prehistoric people do have languages but you can't understand any of it. It's not a big deal since the scenes do a pretty good job of showing not telling as they play out. The plot is fairly simple as well so you are never really in much doubt what is going on.But here's where the problems I experienced in the first ten minutes come in. Even though it is essentially speechfree there is just the worst documentarystyle narration going on at times. You're probably saying this isn't too bad. But trust me you have to hear it to understand why I hated it so much.The narrator reads his dialogue like he's just been informed his entire family has died in an automobile accident. Flat uninterested and with all the liveliness of a cymbalclapping monkey toy that's had its batteries removed.Without exception its the worst delivered narration I've ever heard. It sucks you right out of the action and sets your nerves on edge. You want to scream at the screen for him to stop. To shut up. To let you enjoy the movie. But he never does.Thankfully the narration is heaviest near the start. It becomes sparser and more spaced out as the movie goes along and you even forget about it at times.

The hero is a wandering Neanderthal hunter who meets up with a woman who just so happens to be a Homo Sapien. The two fall in love but not before the surprisingly modern plot elements play out. And that's the main problem with AO it feels very modern in places particularly with a modernlanguage voice over narration which really feels out of place and the usual gender issues which would play out on a modern romantic comedy.As a film this does have a fair few strengths. The visual look is strong with fine cinematography bringing to life the snowbound terrain. The effects are strong and the look of the Neanderthals is an authentic one. There are some truly exciting moments like the polar bear fight. It's so unfortunate then that most of the running time is wasted with romantic nonsense when the director had the change to make something so much more profound.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has lots to enjoy  great wartime entertainment by some of the big names in music at that time good if recycled comedy and great dancing by Eleanor Powell. However its main problem is all of what I just mentioned. It can never seem to figure out if it is a romantic comedy a musical or a movie about wartime sabotage but it does grow on you.The comedy is mainly recycled from Buster Keaton's last silent film Spite Marriage and in fact Buster was a gag writer on this film and most of Red's other movies for MGM. Here Red Skelton plays Joe Reynolds reprising Buster's part as a worker in a laundry enamored with stage actress Constance Shaw Eleanor Powell. He manages to show up at the same places Shaw shows up at by borrowing his customers' formal attire. Just like in the original the leading lady is jealous of her leading man because he is romancing someone else  a potential backer for a show. Shaw marries Joe without knowing or caring what he does for a living and there is the repeat of the putting the unconscious bride to bed scene that there was in Spite Marriage. When the day after the wedding she learns he does not in fact own gold mines but is a pants presser the newlyweds separate at least for awhile. The situation in which Joe plays the hero here has to do with a plan to blow up a munitions storehouse next door to the theater where Constance Shaw is working. Spite Marriage had seafaring bootlegging gangsters as villains which of course would have made no sense in 1943.There are some great numbers by Powell if you are a fan of her dancing  I am. The disappointing part is that a couple of the numbers are lifted from other films. The finale is lifted from 1936's Born To Dance and there is another number that was shot for the film Honolulu. Part of the reason for this is that the lasso number towards the beginning of the film was so difficult that Miss Powell knocked herself unconscious while performing it and thus other numbers were substituted for the originals planned.Finally there are some great musical numbers by the Dorseys and Jericho performed by Lena Horne.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hope they paid Powell triple. That rope dance she does is maybe the most demanding gauntlet of timing I've seen in years of viewing. I'm not surprised the rehearsal for it knocked herself out cold IMDB. Then too she's got the movie's comedic highpoint where Skelton has to bend her upside down and sideways while she's knocked out with sleeping pills. And catch that climactic toplike spin in front of the mock battleship that had me dizzy for a week. To me the movie's really her showcase. On the other hand Red's routines pick up slapstick momentum toward the end but the first part has him do little more than wear a goofy grin. As a Skelton fan I don't think it's the comedian's best showcase.On the whole the 100minutes amounts to a rather unwieldy package with a few overstretched routines and an awkward Nazi subplot. But then this is 1943 and everybody's got to do their part. Note for example how class differencesa pants presser vs. a Broadway starare overcome while Blacks are presented in a non demeaning way. It's like we've all got to pull together to defeat the Axis. And catch that last sequence where Red battles the Nazi Hodiak. Judging from the screen environs I'll bet it was filmed in MGM's prop room with the lifts props and catwalks all doing their part.Overall as another reviewer points outit's more a movie of parts than a whole. But some of those parts are fairly memorable. Most of all however hats off to the fearless Elinor Powell.".

The gags that follow are weak for the most part but occasionally some bright bits of humor do crop up along the way.For comic timing nothing beats the scene where Powell takes the sleep medicine by mistake and Skelton is unable to wake her up to either put her in a chair or on a bed. Her limber body provides a lot of chuckles as he struggles to get her off the floor. The timing by both is impeccable and it's one of the film's best routines.Too bad her dance numbers aren't staged as well as that sequence which runs a little too long. They're serviceable but that's about all.Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra play some nice tunes best of which is Star Eyes sung by Bob Eberly and Helen O'Connell. An audition scene featuring Hazel Scott at the piano and Lena Horne as vocalist on Jericho is a lively routine that gives the film a much needed musical highlight.But for both Skelton and Powell this is one of their lesser efforts. Sam Levene Thurston Hall John Hodiak and Richard Ainley offer good support.".

The highlights of the movie revolve around Eleanor Powell including a classic lasso dancing number near the beginning of the film. Her other numbers are clips from Honolulu and Born to Dance. Also some nice musical numbers from Lena Horne and Hazel Scott.It's a watchable movie but nothing special. The comedy is especially weak. And what was with that tackedon Nazi saboteur plot? I would suggest watching the first ten minutes or so for the Powell number and then fastforwarding to whenever you see someone singing or dancing. The rest is nothing to bother with.".

First it's a remake and the original starring Buster Keaton is a better filmthough for Keaton standards it's also a weak effort. Second like too many of MGM's films the studio insisted on inserting a lot of music into the film as they really didn't seem to trust comedy. Because of this Skelton who could be very funny seems like an afterthought at times. As for the smaller strike against the film because it was made during WWII they inserted a completely unnecessary subplot near the end about some evildoer trying to blow things up to somehow aid the Axis. It really made no sense and was obviously tossed in at the last minute.Note To show how poor this movie is the final musical number is recycledtaken from a Powell film Born to Dance made seven years earlier.".

Of course the players have noticed him and he's always a well dressed man about town. But that's because he has the pick of suits to wear as he works for Sam Levene as a hotel valet and he borrows his customer's clothing for a night out. I won't say more but Red was treading into Bob Hope territory here as the schnook who always wound up with the girl. In this case a glamorous dancing star like Eleanor Powell. There's hope for all of us and a lot of Hope for Red as well in this film. Coming for specialty numbers are jazz pianist Hazel Scott and the great Lena Horne. Not to mention Jimmy Dorsey's Orchestra with singers Helen O'Connell and Bob Eberly who were at the height of their popularity when I Dood It came out. Thurston Hall plays Powell's producer Richard Ainley her insufferable leading man and John Hodiak in one of his earliest films was a Nazi spy and saboteur.

	schema:reviewBody "I have this notion that the thirties was a great pressure cooker for movies during which time all sorts of experiments were tried. Out of that period came the genres we know today plus the great invention of Noir uniquely American.So I've been watching lots of 30s movies not because they are good or particularly enjoyable. But because you can see the genotype of today's movies which is to say I can see the origins of how we all dream and mostly imagine.Now here is an anomaly a 30s movie made in the 40s. I can only imagine that it was to feed the warstarved theaters. It is a remake and borrows musical numbers from a couple films that really were made in the 30s.It is a spliced picture three movies combined something that was common in the 30's.One movie is a stage show. Simple and straightforward. Lots of variety here.A second movie is a comedic fold a movie where all the players are involved in some way in a play different than the earlier mentioned performances and more like Gone with the Wind. Lots of physical humor here. Red Skelton's technique was to perform a comedic motion like rolling his eyes after getting bonked in an exaggerated fashion and then abruptly stop before it finished and look at the audience with a big grin. It was humor about humor a not very sophisticated but an effective fold that would grow into what we have today and call irony.The third movie has a wartime saboteur. Because the fold the notion of the play within the play is explicit here the explosion is to blow up the theater and somehow simultaneously threaten the nation by mechanisms unexplained.Its a mess these three parts not integrated in any way.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

But one genius plus one genius equals some great comedy so that was okay with me.However I was really blown away by three performers I didn't know very well. Eleanor Powell was a fine actress and a fantastic dancer. Check out her lasso dance near the beginning of the film. Absolutely amazing! And then later in the film comes Hazel Scott a phenomenal jazz pianist who I'd never heard before. Then shortly thereafter we have Lena Horne in her powerful Jericho number. Those scenes alone make the movie worth spending a little time on.There were a lot of musical numbers too many in fact and I have to admit I fast forwarded through the more tedious of them.

While there is a story it not only was done before but the film still does not make a comfortable fit for Red. Skelton would not hit his stride until television.This is a war time production obvious from the themes. Amazing to me is the unlisted cameos. For example Butterfly McQueen is in this one along with a fairly large group of unaccredited folks. Butterfly walks a poodle near Skelton when he is sitting defeated in a park.The plot has Skelton chasing a show girl as a pants presser chasing her by going to every one of her live shows. Meanwhile a member of the cast of the show is planning to blow up the theater. The plot is not as important as the music and dancing it turns out with Red doing some comic relief.You gotta love Powell and Lena Horne who are great. This is Vincente Minnelli working with a mixed race cast before the war is over. This same year he is directing an all black cast in Cabin In The Sky and it appears he literally borrows some of the cast from that picture to make cameos lat in this picture.As a fan of Red am glad I finally caught this one. So far the scripts for Red in his films are lacking and this one is not an exception. At least here he got an AList Director and cast along with Jimmy Dorseys Orchestra.".

	schema:reviewBody "While there is a definite art deco look to the mediocre musical comedy I Dood It it is a minor credit in the list of masterpieces by the great Vincent Minnelli a subpar entry in the credits of the great MGM musicals. This comedyfarce has a starstruck dry cleaner Red Skelton so enamored of Broadway star Eleanor Powell that he follows her everywhere she goes. Today we call that stalking. To get into a nightclub featuring the Dorsey Brothers where she goes regularly he borrows a tailored suit which coincidently fits him and ends up married to her when she uses him to make her beau jealous because of his interest in another woman. But she finds she can't get rid of Skelton too easily and he ends up saving the day when her costar tries to rob a warehouse next to the theater in which they are appearing.Little thought was put into this musical for the poor Ms. Powell as it includes two numbers previously seen in two of her other movies. A hula from Honolulu is lifted right out of that film as is the final from Born to Dance. While Ms. Powell has aged well in the seven years since that film she doesn't really look exactly like what she used to anymore so don't be surprised when you find yourself shaking your head. Her one dance number a tricky rope tap dance does stand out as does Lena Horne's walkon of Jericho. Skelton and Powell share a nightclub dance where he is trying to avoid the actual owner of the suit that ends up comical due to his paranoia over being exposed. Another highlight is the wedding night scene where a passed out Powell having taken a sleeping potion keeps falling out of bed and Skelton tries different acrobatic ways to get her back in so she can sleep it off.However the play within the play obviously a ripoff of Gone With the Wind is so bad it seems like something spoofed on The Carol Burnett Show. And with Skelton yelling about a bomb hidden in the basement you want to yell at your TV No. It's not in the basement. It's on the stage!. There is a funny bit of Noises Off! like humor with Skelton messing up when he ends up in one of the actor's costumes on stage then fights with the villain on a rising setpiece. So while there are some really funny moments influenced with the help of Comedy Adviser Buster Keaton they are few and far between and much of the film is ridiculous.Patricia Dane's horrendous character seems to have no motivation for her nastiness towards Powell although Powell isn't the sweet ingnue here destroying a dressing room in one scene in quite a show of temperament. However the presence of some wonderful character performers Thurston Hall Butterfly McQueen Sam Levene Marjorie Gateson helps sustain the film from total boredom. With his first contract film out of the way Minnelli would go onto the artistic triumph of Cabin in the Sky before his true talents were revealed with a colorful musical called Meet Me in St. Louis.".

But as Tako ages he starts to question whether or not that's the whole story and is determined to find out.Along with this Father looks at the changes that the Magyar Republic underwent after the war. An example is the school's renaming previously St. Benedict's School the proSoviet government renames it State School. In that sense I would say that the movie plays a role similar to I vitelloni by Federico Fellini and The Burmese Harp by Kon Ichikawa since they looked at the new directions that Italy and Japan were taking respectively and how they were having to deal with what happened during WWII. Hungary also had to do this although it really had to follow the Soviet Union.Either way Apa is certainly a formidable piece of cinema history.

	schema:reviewBody "I think that a list of John Wayne's five best pictures has to include Fort Apache. It's the first and best of the cavalry trilogy that he did with John Ford. Oddly enough he has less screen time here than in the other two due to the fact that he was costarring with another big Hollywood name in Henry Fonda.It's first and foremost the story of a clash between two men who see the United States Army in very different terms. Fonda is a former general who's seen glory in the Civil War but has been shunted aside. He wants to get back on top in the worst way. He's exiled to Fort Apache in the Arizona territory while the big headlines concerning the Indian wars are going to the campaign against the plains Indians which was true enough.Wayne has also seen some glory in the Civil War. But he's a professional soldier and just wants to live long enough to retire. In fact Ward Bond who is the sergeant major at the post has also dropped down in rank he was a major in the Civil War and a Medal of Honor winner. This was a common occurrence at the end of the Civil War. During the war promotions came swiftly because of battlefield service. Something called a brevet rank was instituted a kind of temporary promotion. You could be a brevet brigadier general and have an actual rank of something like major. After the Civil War as the U.S. Army shrunk to its prewar size soldier reverted to previous ranks. This was something John Ford was keenly aware of when he made Fort Apache.Ford's stock company was never better. Even minor bit parts are woven nicely into the whole story. And his photography of Monument Valley it's beauty and vastness was never better even when he used color. Look at the scenes with John Agar and Shirley Temple riding and with Wayne and Pedro Armendariz on their way to parley with Cochise. Really great cinematography.Ford had a couple of inside comments in the film. In a scene where Henry Fonda is getting an incomplete message from the post telegrapher the telegrapher who might have strolled in from a CagneyO'Brien film informs his commander that the message was interrupted in the middle of the last woid. With both Irish and southern recruits in Fort Apache a Brooklynese telegrapher would not have been out of place.George O'Brien and Anna Lee play Sam and Emily Collingwood who both knew Henry Fonda's Owen Thursday way back in the day. It's hinted that O'Brien had a drinking problem and that's why he's at Fort Apache but he's looking for a transfer out. It comes as the regiment is moving out against Cochise. Charles Collingwood was the second in command to Admiral Nelson at Trafalgar. Nelson became a British hero martyr historians know about Charles Collingwood. When newspapermen at the end of Fort Apache remark about men like Collingworthnot being remembered it was John Ford making a statement about the worth of all the men who contribute their lives to defend their nations not just the leader heroes.That remark by the way is the stage for one of John Wayne's finest acted scenes in his career. A soliloquy photographed through a cabin window about the life of the professional soldier the camaraderie the toughness the bravery required of these men and how they deliver for their nation. In a later film John Ford uses the line that in the west when the legend becomes fact print the legend. Henry Fonda's quest for martial glory was a blunder but his story for the sake and tradition of his regiment is whitewashed and he becomes an inspiration.Of course some of the lowbrow comedy that one expects from John Ford is here aplenty with the four drinking sergeants and their efforts to make soldiers out of the recruits. Led by Victor McLaglen the quartet rounds out with Dick Foran Jack Pennick and Pedro Armendariz. See how they dispose of the contraband they are charged with destroying and its consequences.Fort Apache also takes the side of the Indian here. Cochise played by an impassive Miguel Inclan is a figure of strength and dignity. Later on Jeff Chandler in another film brought speech to the dignity and that role launched his career. Cochise is the only true major figure in the film. He bedeviled the U.S. Cavalry for over a decade in Arizona Territory with guerrilla tactics Mao Tse Tung would have envied.Fort Apache is a grand ensemble film and you will not be bored for one second in watching it.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Ford's FORT APACHE is the first of a threefilm cycle chronicling the exploits of the U.S. Cavalry in the settling of the West but it is far more than that as a thinlydisguised reworking of the George Armstrong Custer story it provides insight about a leader so blinded by his own ambition and ego that his actions nearly wipes out his command and would have to be 'coveredup' by an Army that always protects its 'own'. Ironically in whitewashing his actions he becomes a national hero giving him posthumously the attention he'd craved. The story is a powerful one and in the hands of a topnotch cast FORT APACHE is as timely today as when it was first released.Henry Fonda's Lt.Col. Owen Thursday is a complex driven man a martinet who considers his transfer to the western outpost as a slap in the face by the War Department. Accompanied by his daughter Philadelphia a grownup and vivacious Shirley Temple he arrives at Fort Apache early and discovers the welcoming festivities are not for him but for the return of the son of Sgt.Major O'Rourke Ward Bond a new second lieutenant fresh from West Point. The younger O'Rourke portrayed by John Agar and Philadelphia are immediately attracted to one another they were married off screen but displaying a 'class' snobbery Col. Thursday nixes any chance of an officer's daughter and an enlisted man's son even if he is an officer having a romance.As the new commander Thursday shows an insensitivity to both his own men he rebukes former commander Capt. Collingwood played by George O'Brien in front of the other officers and the intellectual and tactical skills of the Indians drawing the ire of John Wayne as Capt. Kirby York. He does convince York that he is interested in parlaying with Cochise however and soon York whom the chief respects is on his way to Mexico to get him to cross the border for a meeting between the two leaders and the corrupt Indian agent Grant Withers whose actions had led to the current insurrection.Ultimately Cochise does cross the Rio Grande and Thursday reveals his true plan to demand a return to the reservation or face annihilation. York feels betrayed and warns Thursday that he's setting himself up for a massacre especially as the commander intends to bring his entire command to the meeting. Thursday simply sneers at his warning sarcastically suggesting that York is crediting Cochise as being as brilliant as Napoleon.The meeting is brief with Thursday showing no respect and sure enough ends disastrously. Cochise prepared for a potential betrayal has lined the canyon walls beyond the meeting place with hundreds of sharpshooters and despite York's warnings leading to his being branded by Thursday a 'coward' and ordered to remain with a rear guard the Colonel leads his command in a charge into the canyon...In an unsympathetic role Henry Fonda is marvelous actually making Col. Thursday believable if not likable. John Wayne despite star billing is actually secondary plotwise but is excellent as the officer who learns finally what it means to command by watching the wounded Thursday return to his command and face certain death.Major subplots of all three 'Cavalry' films would be devoted to Sergeants and FORT APACHE offers four truly memorable ones in Bond Pedro Armendariz Victor McLaglen and Dick Foran.FORT APACHE is a film that could easily stand alone as a superb drama as the first of the trilogy it set a high standard and is considered by most critics as the finest of the three films.It is unforgettable!".

	schema:headline " Fonda And Wayne Clash In John Ford Cavalry Pic";
	schema:reviewBody "LieutenantColonel Owen Thursday arrives at a frontier fort  to take up his new command.  His harsh unbending philosophy of soldiering creates something of a stir in the regiment.  His pretty daughter Philadelphia causes a rather different commotion.The headstrong commander refuses to listen to the advice of his loyal captain Kirby York who knows frontier life and enjoys a rapport with the indian chiefs.  The two officers are both strong characters and their differing ideas inevitably lead to a clash.Cochise and his braves are willing to accommodate the white man so long as their concerns are handled with diplomacy.  Unfortunately the highhanded approach of LieutenantColonel Thursday cause relations to deteriorate and conflict ensues.In the course of the 1940's and 50's director John Ford returned repeatedly to this subjectmatter John Wayne in Monument Valley with the US cavalry fighting redskins and singing Irish folksongs.  The stirring anthem in this movie is The Girl I Left Behind Me sung as the regiment rides out in full panoply to meet Cochise  although She Wore A Yellow Ribbon gets an airing too.The cavalry regiment itself is a protagonist in the story regarded as a living entity by its members.  When Captain York is promoted to Colonel and commands the regiment he makes a powerful speech stressing the continuity and tradition which have made the regiment great.  The sense of hierarchy is strong. This is a world of order in which army regulations govern even the way an officer presents his callingcard.  Soldiers can quote the regulations by heart.  This wellregulated military force will we feel impose civilisation on this wild frontier.Examples of the regiment's rigid code keep recurring.  The NCOs' dance has its own elaborate protocol which not even Colonel Thursday dares to flout.  Feelings over the O'Rourke marriage reach boilingpoint but everyone adheres to the rules of military courtesy.  Washington's Birthday is celebrated as a regimental occasion.  The Irish sergeants are all related by blood and marriage and as their exuberant fraternal greetings subside military discipline asserts itself effortlessly.I'm not a martinet protests Colonel Thursday the most extreme martinet imaginable.   He is inflexible in his enforcement of the military code and too stubborn and wrongheaded to listen to the advice of his officers who are experienced frontier campaigners.  He completely misses the presence of Cochise's war party because he has no combat experience and doesn't know to watch the skyline for dust clouds.  In addition Thursday is a terrible snob.  He calls young Michael O'Rourke a 'savage' for a perceived laxity of discipline and sets his face against the marriage of Michael and Philadelphia because of the barrier between your class and mine.  He is dismayed that the son of a sergeant should have passed through West Point and needlessly offends Cochise by talking down to him.And yet even Owen Thursday has a human side.  We gather that there is some personal secret between him and Captain Collingwood and we almost smile when the armchair collapses under him.  Most tellingly Thursday returns to the beleaguered redoubt after he has been rescued.  He redeems himself by rejoining his soldiers in the thick of the fighting.When young Philadelphia Thursday Shirley Temple studies Michael O'Rourke in her purse mirror we know that these two will be the love interest.  Also as this incident illustrates the womenfolk of Fort Apache tend to run the show in this masculine enclave.  The Thursday residence is somewhat joyless especially when compared with Aunt Emily's cosy quarters. The women brush aside the colonel's seniority and call in Mrs. O'Rourke to refurnish the place.  In one of the film's good jokes no fewer than eight Mrs. O'Rourkes answer the call.  There is a touching scene when the regiment moves out and the women are left together.  Mrs. Collingwood is torn because her husband has his safe posting back east and needn't go into battle but she knows how important it is for him to prove his courage.  The womenfolk urge her to call him back but she reluctantly allows him to ride out.John Ford laced many of his films with Irish humour and Fort Apache is no exception.  The ubiquitous Victor McLaglen plays Sergeant Festus Mulcahy and he and the O'Rourkes run the fort  that is whenever they are not in the jailhouse on charges of drinking and brawling.  Outrageously Mulcahy promotes a raw recruit to corporal simply because he's Irish. Quincannon virtually lives in the jailhouse but he has a fine tenor voice so he is released from custody in order to serenade the young lovers with his rendition of Genevieve.  When the dishonest trader Meacham has his whisky stock confiscated and marked for destruction the sad faces of the sergeants make a comical picture and the subsequent 'destruction' is even funnier.Ford is a master of composition.  York rides out to parley with Cochise and is engrossed in dialogue leaving Thursday stranded and excluded.  We hear the thunder of hooves offscreen before we see the charge and its impact is magnified accordingly.  In the sequence where York and Beaufort ride to negotiate with Cochise the screen is filled with stunning images of rock and sky.  The charging cavalry are cleverly 'lost' in their own dust which closes behind them like a curtain ending the scene.Wayne is curiously subdued in this film.  This is partly because he plays a conscientious subordinate and partly because the confrontation with Fonda is eclipsed by other plot developments.".

This wellregulated military force will we feel impose civilisation on this wild frontier.Examples of the regiment's rigid code keep recurring.  The NCOs' dance has its own elaborate protocol which not even Colonel Thursday dares to flout.  Feelings over the O'Rourke marriage reach boilingpoint but everyone adheres to the rules of military courtesy.  Washington's Birthday is celebrated as a regimental occasion.  The Irish sergeants are all related by blood and marriage and as their exuberant fraternal greetings subside military discipline asserts itself effortlessly.I'm not a martinet protests Colonel Thursday the most extreme martinet imaginable.   He is inflexible in his enforcement of the military code and too stubborn and wrongheaded to listen to the advice of his officers who are experienced frontier campaigners.  He completely misses the presence of Cochise's war party because he has no combat experience and doesn't know to watch the skyline for dust clouds.  In addition Thursday is a terrible snob.  He calls young Michael O'Rourke a 'savage' for a perceived laxity of discipline and sets his face against the marriage of Michael and Philadelphia because of the barrier between your class and mine.  He is dismayed that the son of a sergeant should have passed through West Point and needlessly offends Cochise by talking down to him.And yet even Owen Thursday has a human side.  We gather that there is some personal secret between him and Captain Collingwood and we almost smile when the armchair collapses under him.  Most tellingly Thursday returns to the beleaguered redoubt after he has been rescued.  He redeems himself by rejoining his soldiers in the thick of the fighting.When young Philadelphia Thursday Shirley Temple studies Michael O'Rourke in her purse mirror we know that these two will be the love interest.  Also as this incident illustrates the womenfolk of Fort Apache tend to run the show in this masculine enclave.  The Thursday residence is somewhat joyless especially when compared with Aunt Emily's cosy quarters. The women brush aside the colonel's seniority and call in Mrs. O'Rourke to refurnish the place.  In one of the film's good jokes no fewer than eight Mrs. O'Rourkes answer the call.  There is a touching scene when the regiment moves out and the women are left together.  Mrs. Collingwood is torn because her husband has his safe posting back east and needn't go into battle but she knows how important it is for him to prove his courage.  The womenfolk urge her to call him back but she reluctantly allows him to ride out.John Ford laced many of his films with Irish humour and Fort Apache is no exception.  The ubiquitous Victor McLaglen plays Sergeant Festus Mulcahy and he and the O'Rourkes run the fort  that is whenever they are not in the jailhouse on charges of drinking and brawling.  Outrageously Mulcahy promotes a raw recruit to corporal simply because he's Irish. Quincannon virtually lives in the jailhouse but he has a fine tenor voice so he is released from custody in order to serenade the young lovers with his rendition of Genevieve.  When the dishonest trader Meacham has his whisky stock confiscated and marked for destruction the sad faces of the sergeants make a comical picture and the subsequent 'destruction' is even funnier.Ford is a master of composition.  York rides out to parley with Cochise and is engrossed in dialogue leaving Thursday stranded and excluded.  We hear the thunder of hooves offscreen before we see the charge and its impact is magnified accordingly.  In the sequence where York and Beaufort ride to negotiate with Cochise the screen is filled with stunning images of rock and sky.  The charging cavalry are cleverly 'lost' in their own dust which closes behind them like a curtain ending the scene.Wayne is curiously subdued in this film.  This is partly because he plays a conscientious subordinate and partly because the confrontation with Fonda is eclipsed by other plot developments.";

	schema:reviewBody "Fort Apache is the movie of respect. John Ford's message seems to be that everybody deserves respect. First of all as natural in Ford's poetic ideology the simple lowclass horse soldiers with their sense of community their sober courage their stoic dedication to duty. Also the veteran officers Capt. York  John Wayne and Capt. Collingwood George O' Brien share these plain but strong feelings with lower ranks and have a deep friendship towards them. Then the Indians here the Apaches are represented as noble brave fair warriors forced to war only by patent injustice. Important is the scene in the finale when the winning Apaches nobly spare John Wayne and the other soldiers of the supply lines.But Ford in not yet satisfied even the arrogant dumb haughty colonel Thursday Henry Fonda deserves respect. His problem is that he's stupid that's all. Actually Thursday is a pathetic figure he is the unique miserable character in the film mainly because he is alone an outcast in the tight community of other soldiers. Moreover he is frustrated in his ambitions of career and he is in some sense constantly humiliated in his pride by the veterans of Fort Apache. For instance Thursday arrogantly wonders why the son of Sgt. O' Rourke Ward Bond was admitted to become an officer but he readily realizes that the sergeant got this privilege from his outstandingly heroic actions on the battlefield something that Thursday probably had always dreamed and never got. The priceless experience of the veteran officers is always understated by Thursday in a somewhat childish whimsical way. But perhaps he has a guess that he's wrong and his reaction is to close himself into an armour of upperclasspride scorning the love of her daughter for the sergeant's son.However the movie develops through magnificent images of the Monument Valley subtle psychological touches sense of humor moments of emotion action suspense. Then we get to a great scene that proves how cinema can be deep art. The horse soldiers are ready for the final attack everybody is perfectly conscious that they will be slaughtered by the Apaches... everybody but the dumb colonel. They accept their fate quietly well their job is to face death possibly to die in the most idiotic way why not? This seems nonsense nowadays but here Ford gives us a perfect representation of the spirit of the Nineteenth Century. Then suddenly Thursday accuses York of cowardice and commands him to the supply line together with the reluctant Lt. O' Rourke John Agar. Then York in a plain way informs Sgt. O' Rourke that his son will not participate to the suicide attack. These news immediately raise the spirits of the soldiers not caring their own deaths they roar an hurrah. The boy their son is safe he will marry his girl they will have children the life will continue. Here Ford touches an extremely profound chord something even deeper than our human souls the core of our animal essence. Here we have the instinct of the mammal which offers itself to the predator in order to save its puppies.The remainder of the finale with the ambush and the partial redemption of Thursday is superbly filmed and crowns a timeless masterpiece of cinema Fort Apache.".

In any other Western the roles would be reversed but John Ford trusted his stars as actors to not be typecasted and particularly with Fonda he strikes some really rich ground. Part of that is in his direction maybe some of Ford's stern and sometimes bullheaded self could identify somewhere in Thursday but it's also Fonda being able to find certain beats or pauses or inflections that add dimension to what is a mostly stiff and unmovable Cavalry Colonel who is a gentlemen second and a military man first. Wayne is also very good here as he often was for Ford more than any other director save for maybe Hawks as he's moreso apart of the ensemble as opposed to a fullblown star and there's even some subtlety where it's usually not seen by him.The story itself is also ripe for Ford's wonderful blend of allAmerican warmth and criticalwhileembracing of American West themes and there's a lot of extra entertainment with the supporting cast mostly a who's who of genial drunks and weathered firsttimers and exCivil War soldiers. And with one exception a poetically ironic but unnecessary scene with Mrs. Thursday getting the telegram of his transfer right before the climactic battle there's barely a scene that doesn't register as something worthwhile for the story or for some interesting characterization or even something in as simple as a dance between Thursday and O'Rourke that reveals how good Fonda could be at staying in character while in a formal bit like that. We're also given the proverbial 'good' youngactor performances from John Agar as the West Point graduate young O'Rourke who's after Shirley Temple's daughter of Col. Thursday.Fort Apache allows for all of the thrills and curiosities of watching an 'oldfashioned' Western but there's more than meets the eye for Ford. It's all so deceptively simple it's not quite as masterful as the Searchers but it's very close at deconstructing the myths of strong American men going to kill Indians and win the day inn honor to reveal the savagery underneath where logic is thrust aside. But at the same time Ford still celebrates the valor in men in the old west and there's something of a forerunner to the message of Man Who Shot Liberty Valance when legend becomes fact print or film the legend  albeit with some truth sprinkled here and there. Surely one of the better Ford and Wayne Westerns and one another in the equally or even moreso rewarding collaboration with Fonda here revealing a whole other side than a Lincoln or Tom Joad. 9.510".

In fact it was very funny seeing Wayne portraying the voice of reason while Henry Fonda was more of a martinet and could have cared less about honor and truth.Along the way these two great actors are supported by old familiars like Victor McLaglen and Ward Bond as well as Shirley Temple and her then husband John Agar. Despite criticism leveled towards Agar by the media over the years and to a lesser extent to the adult Temple I think they did just fine in their roles and made a positive contribution to the movie.And finally the action and cinematography is tops. It's hard to imagine a more beautiful black and white film or one where so much care and effort was given to make a great film.".

If there is no doubt of his importance to the development of the Western his uniquely sentimental poetic glorification of the white American's conquest of the wilderness is both picturesque and reactionary...The cavalrymen get a more honorable deal from three films made in succession by him 'Ford Apache' 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' and 'Rio Grande.' These are quite properly referred to as his 'cavalry trilogy' as they deserve to be considered as a body of work dedicated to a particular theme that of the life of the cavalry and their role as frontier protectors in times of Indian uprising...'Fort Apache' is about the tensions in an isolated fortsocial and military  hierarchy tensions and ultimately the purely military tensions that arise when the commanding officer is transparently illfitted for his command...Henry Fonda is a vain domineering and embittered colonel who can't get over losing his Civil War rank as general... He arrives at the Arizona desert outpost to take over from the experienced Indian fighter John Wayne... He is arrogant accepting no advice and further alienates the hardbitten veterans by refusing to support the romance of his lovely daughter Shirley Temple with a young lieutenant from West Point John Agar who happens to be the son of sergeant major Ward Bond. There are nice touches in the film here about army traditions and undisciplined troops Civil War veterans living in noisy harmony amusing and touching moments with variety of vignettes that deal with the everyday lives of Fort Apache cavalrymen and pretty Irish drunk humor from Victor McLaglen... The inevitable climax concerns of course the colonel's arrogance and ignorance leading his men into an Apache massacre...Ford consistently finds the most beautiful way to frame a scene and the black and white photography is stunning... But the best of the trilogy is undoubtedly 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' which remains for many their favorite Western movie...".

Henry Fonda is great as a bitter unhappy colonel who feels unappreciated by the military hierarchy and is displeased by his assignment to the isolated desert areas. John Wayne gives the film just the right balance as a captain who looks out for his men and knows Indians. Ford has his regular cast on board for the film and John Agar and Shirley Temple handle the romantic clinches. The pace is slowed somewhat by comedy bits that add nothing to the film's substance.

John Agar her husband at the time so I've read was also lackluster so they matched on screen as well. We are all aware  or have been made aware  of John Ford's Irishness but in this case things got wildly out of hand. The humor was broad  extremely broad  and the jokes wore thin from the very beginning. What irritated me most however was the musical score. At the start of the film already with the magnificent vistas of Monument Valley the score is overly forceful staccato and as obtrusive as it is intrusive. The music is everywhere even when it's not needed and spills off some scenes into others where it isn't even appropriate. It is consistently loud and impairs rather than aids what's on the screen. Someone should have edited the score!Curtis Stotlar".

	schema:headline " An entertaining western with plenty of value in the characters writing and commentary";
	schema:reviewBody "Owen Thursday is hardly impressed when his new command is the desolate Fort Apache but resolves to make the best of it. When a group of Indians strike out from the local reserve led by warrior Cochise Thursday sees the challenge as being key in winning back the military honour he feels has been denied him to date. However Captain York persuades him to allow York to go into Mexico to talk peace and convincing him to return to the US to broker a resolution  but will Thursday's obsession with honour and glory cause a bloodier ending? Interweaving this central plot with romantic and comic subplots makes a standard western into a much better one even if it sometimes causes it to feel a bit slow. The story concerns an outlying post and the first half of the film lays down the characters their relationships and who they are in ways that are interesting and produces a mix of funny moments and rather slower dramatic moments  all of them work as well as one another and it enriches the final section of the film. It is in this final third of the film where the action starts and it is rather dramatic and exciting it also brings out a lot more of the subtext about the arrogant leadership of Thursday based on the character traits that we have already had developed in him in regards his men and his daughter. It is made to look easy but the script does it well and even finishes with Ford's ofttouched assertion that the legend was often printed in favour of the less impressive truth  although it still has a salute to the serving men.The cast are all pretty strong although naturally the script favours the men although having said that Temple is quite good if you can get past her precious princess performance. Fonda has the main role and manages to make his character convincing and arrogant at the same time  we never hate him so much as just see his failings. Wayne has a straighter role to play and he is as good as ever with it although it is hardly the most challenging character I've seen him play. Agar is a bit stilted and unsure of himself  unsurprisingly his chemistry is good with Temple they were married at the time but it is the other parts where he appears overshadowed by the stronger male actors. Support is roundly good particularly in the comic roles as filled by Bond McLagen and some of the other NCO's. Direction is good although I felt that the landscapes were there rather than being integrated into the fabric of the film.Overall this is a worthy film. Perhaps not the best of the ford films but still an intelligent film that delivers the goods just like a standard western would while also having good writing in the characters and subtexts. The cast are mainly good and the whole film feels professional and entertaining.".

John Wayne plays one of his soldiers Kirby York seasoned and smarter about working the the Indians. It's a great contrast and the one large charge toward the end of the movie is chilling in its lack of hope it single minded stupidity. That for me was the point of the movie.But John Ford the director known for this kind of movie above all really had another point too. Because Owen's brazen military idiocy was really a guise for making the troops get better at the jobs. It came down to military honor and professionalism above working with the Native Americans for a common peace. So a lot of people got killed.Note that Owen seems to know he won't succeed and makes sure that York is alive by the end to take over the troops. Which York does and in the last scene we see that there is a kind of blind respect for Owen after all is said and done.At least in part. If you omit this overly glad ending where Owen frankly undermines all the integrity and respect built up through the movie and with John Wayne giving it his best solidity you have a kind of antiwar movie. That is it shows the vulnerability of people to military leaders out of touch and to following orders blindly. The whole movie is rife with moments of men having to do things they really shouldn't because of some superior deciding it's a good idea.But Ford does not omit the ending. This is about the larger sacrifices you have to make a soldier even when it seems silly in the short run. Because the long view has something more to do with order and the rule of law. Ford was famously Republican conservative like Wayne and just the opposite of Fonda and this is Ford's movie. There are many scenes of corny humor or just slow parading of horses and soldiers in the amazing Monument Valley landscape. There is Shirley Temple to account for a hohum actress as a young woman. And there is the usual array of stereotypespeople and situationsthat make this kind of movie sometimes very difficult to watch. But it's a classic in all those ways too if you are cut out for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Henry Fonda portrays Colonel Owen Thursday in this post Civil War cavalry Western and manages to clash with virtually everyone else in the film including his own daughter Philadelphia Shirley Temple. Thursday is assigned to Fort Apache in the Arizona Territory an end of the line outpost in which he feels shunted aside as regards his military career. Complicating matters the pretty Phil is immediately attracted to West Point graduate and Second Lieutenant Michael O'Rourke John Agar. Against this backdrop Thursday must deal with an Apache tribe increasingly dissatisfied with reservation life and their treatment at the hands of dishonest trader Silas Meacham Grant Withers. When Thursday decides that the Apaches must return to the reservation against their will his resolve is questioned by Captain Kirby York John Wayne who has always stood by his word with Apache Chief Cochise.Subordinate to his superior officer John Wayne does an admirable job in maintaining a delicate balance between following orders and resolutely pointing out the Colonel's folly in pursuing his course against the Apaches. York self assuredly gets Cochise to agree to a parley only to learn that Thursday's intention is to attack with a regiment and earn the glory that will get him promoted to a more suitable assignment. Noting York's attitude as cowardice Thursday relieves him of command and details him to the supply train. Thursday's only redemption if it can be called that is that he returns to battle after being severely injured and with the outcome of the battle no longer in doubt. His death in combat cements his reputation even as his arrogance and defiance to the end causes his own downfall.In one of her final film roles Shirley Temple seems out of place in the wild west and her characterization of the Colonel's daughter is at times pouting and demure. There were moments in the film that she reminded me of the young Judy Garland.John Agar marks his film debut in this movie he would go on to mini fame in the mid 1950's in such B scifi and horror gems as Revenge of the Creature Tarantula and The Mole People.Word must be mentioned of the superb cinematography in this film the expansive desert imagery and rock formations often times overshadow the story as if the affairs of soldiers and Indians could even attempt to outweigh the beauty and grandeur of nature.Besides the movie's star players the film boasts a talented supporting cast including Ward Bond George O'Brien Victor McLaglen and Dick Foran. Their finest moments usually come in the form of comic relief as portrayed in a scene showing new recruits learning to ride horseback. But it's in a scene left to one's imagination that brings the biggest chuckle when Colonel Thursday requests his men to destroy trader Meacham's supply of rotgut moonshine. Following orders they each pick up a cup in full readiness to complete their mission.".

Against this backdrop Thursday must deal with an Apache tribe increasingly dissatisfied with reservation life and their treatment at the hands of dishonest trader Silas Meacham Grant Withers. When Thursday decides that the Apaches must return to the reservation against their will his resolve is questioned by Captain Kirby York John Wayne who has always stood by his word with Apache Chief Cochise.Subordinate to his superior officer John Wayne does an admirable job in maintaining a delicate balance between following orders and resolutely pointing out the Colonel's folly in pursuing his course against the Apaches. York self assuredly gets Cochise to agree to a parley only to learn that Thursday's intention is to attack with a regiment and earn the glory that will get him promoted to a more suitable assignment. Noting York's attitude as cowardice Thursday relieves him of command and details him to the supply train. Thursday's only redemption if it can be called that is that he returns to battle after being severely injured and with the outcome of the battle no longer in doubt. His death in combat cements his reputation even as his arrogance and defiance to the end causes his own downfall.In one of her final film roles Shirley Temple seems out of place in the wild west and her characterization of the Colonel's daughter is at times pouting and demure. There were moments in the film that she reminded me of the young Judy Garland.John Agar marks his film debut in this movie he would go on to mini fame in the mid 1950's in such B scifi and horror gems as Revenge of the Creature Tarantula and The Mole People.Word must be mentioned of the superb cinematography in this film the expansive desert imagery and rock formations often times overshadow the story as if the affairs of soldiers and Indians could even attempt to outweigh the beauty and grandeur of nature.Besides the movie's star players the film boasts a talented supporting cast including Ward Bond George O'Brien Victor McLaglen and Dick Foran. Their finest moments usually come in the form of comic relief as portrayed in a scene showing new recruits learning to ride horseback. But it's in a scene left to one's imagination that brings the biggest chuckle when Colonel Thursday requests his men to destroy trader Meacham's supply of rotgut moonshine. Following orders they each pick up a cup in full readiness to complete their mission.";

Also the ending was very unsatisfying in which the mean officers is made out to be a hero in here which wasn't the truth. The fact is he led his men into a needless slaughter. Shirley Temple's role Philadelphia Thursday was also disappointing. True she look very pretty and was interesting to see as a 20yearold but her role was dour  which doesn't fit her image and she and John Agar Lt. Michael Shannon O'Rourke want to get married after having known each other for just a couple of days???!! Only in the movies although Temple wound up marrying Agar in real life!.The best part of the film as the scenery but I also say that in a John Forddirected western because likes Monument Valley and so do I. Ford seems to feature it in all his westerns and it always looks good. In fact that scenery was shown more often that in any other movie I've seen and it's awesome whether it's in blackandwhite or color. It makes me wish I could see this in widescreen".

Ford had deep contacts with the Navy Department well before the war and was enamored of the military his entire life. This finds deep expression in this film.Also central to the film is the theme of sacrificing one's life for one's country and the plight of the supportive women left behind. This was clearly on everyone's mind when the movie was made in the immediate aftermath of WW2. Ford explores this theme thoroughly.Here's some things I likedThe historical setting is highly accurate. especially in its depiction of Cochise's band. Ford is often depicted by many modern commentators as a racist. I saw no evidence of that in this film. Cochise behaves reasonably and honorably the U.S. government Indian agencies are presented precisely as the ruthless villains that they were and Kirby York accurately represents some of the more reasonable military men who honestly tried their best to resolve an impossible situation.One historical detail that is a little annoying to those of us who have read widely about the Apache Wars is the lack of Apache scouts working side by side with the soldiers tracking the renegades. Also the imaginary displacement of CusterThursday from South Dakota to Arizona is inaccurate but seems a legitimate use of artistic license.Of course Wayne and Fonda are fantastic. Surprisingly Shirley Temple comes across very well. And the more I watch Ward Bond the more I consider him a very underrated actor.There is another very common John Ford motif running through the movie criticism of class distinctions. Colonel Thursday is a stuffed shirt who looks down his nose at Sergeant's son who is courting his daughter. This theme is handled here much more deftly and effectively than it was in Ford's first Western Stagecoach.Civil War themes are woven very nicely into the plot and characterizations. Now here's a few defects that detract from Fort ApacheWhile I appreciate Ford's strenuous efforts to build strong characters in his plots the first half of the movie plods along at times as too many characters are developed at once.One of Ford's best qualities was his understanding of the necessity of comic relief in action movies. In Fort Apache however his humor fails miserably for most of this movie. He's always been corny but for me it usually works. Many critics say they didn't like the humor in The Searchers but I enjoyed it and found it effective. Not in Fort Apache though.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's funny albeit not particularly surprising how five years after Warner Brothers made a laudatory and completely inaccurate General Custer biopic They Died with their Boots on RKO released this relatively truthful portrayal of Custer's character and his comeuppance yet with a fictional Custersubstitute. What is surprising however is that while the former also an excellent picture by the way is more in the line of a historical drama Fort Apache feels more like the iconic mythic Western.Fort Apache was the first screenplay by criticturnedwriter Frank S. Nugent. Nugent gave us some of the best examples of things aficionados might associate with the postwar Western  reverence for ageing men of the west conflicted heroes who do the wrong things for the right reasons or the right things for the wrong reasons and a humanistic yet still antagonistic attitude towards native Americans. These aspects are often cited as motifs of the director John Ford. However such motifs do not appear with any significance in Ford's earlier Westerns whereas they do appear in Nugentscripted Westerns directed by other people such as The Tall Men 1955.But let's give Ford his due here. He did play a major part in making these films what they are. Now this was his third picture made in Monument Valley and he would shoot another six in this breathtaking location. Notice how especially in the first few shots the camera keeps pulling away from the action to focus on one of those sandstone buttes. Ford's act of drawing our attention to them wasn't just because they are pretty and iconic not to mention becoming something of a trademark for the director. They are also part of his scheme to use landscape and space to balance the action and the narrative.To explain what I mean let's leave behind the buttes and plains for a moment and look at how Ford films interiors. These little homesteads and army outposts are shot so that their small size and limits are clearly defined. Often three surrounding walls and the low ceiling are visible  it's not true as is sometimes claimed that John Ford was the first person to show ceilings on indoor sets but I'm willing to bet he showed them more than any other director of his era. This pattern is extended to the exteriors in the midst of the military camp which are surrounded by hills and usually shot with buildings lining the frame and so don't look like proper wideopen outdoors. And yet these spaces aren't constrictive as they might be they say Fritz Lang or Jacques Torneur shoots interiors. The homely dcor and tender arrangements of people give a feeling of cosiness. Often the outside world can be glimpsed through a window or doorway. The overall effect is that these spaces are little pockets of sanctuary in a dangerous world desperate attempts to keep the wilderness at bay.When our heroes do venture out onto the plains we are struck by the full force of Monument Valley in all its eerie emptiness. Forget beauty and magnificence this is actually quite a frightening place where a wagon or a cavalry troop looks puny and exposed and where Indians could by lurking on any hillside. You see for better or for worse the action in this picture relies upon us feeling as if the Indians are a genuine threat. And when you think about it there are only a handful of action sequences in the whole thing. But Ford keeps us going with a continuous tension and sense of dread. Compare this to many poor quality Westerns which hit the audience with a shootout every ten minutes and yet still fail to hold our interest.Much as Ford was a great craftsman Fort Apache bears the side effects of his lack of attentiontodetail and his tendency to rush things. He makes a glaring and amateurish error in the sequence where a small group of soldiers are ambushed by an Indian war party. He shows us the soldiers riding off then but then cuts to the pursuing Indians from the opposite side so it looks as if the two groups are in fact riding towards each other. When the larger cavalry detachment appears to the rescue it is anyone's guess which direction they are supposed to be coming from. Still you do get to see the Ford stock company at its best highlights of which are burly character actor Ward Bond proving he could do deep and tender and a great comedy routine with Victor McLaglen involving bootleg liquor.The subgenre of the cavalry Western had very different fixtures and fittings to your typical horseopera with no saloons no cowboys no outlaws and no railroads and with military discipline smothering the individualism of the typical Western hero. But this particular example is nevertheless steeped in the Western tradition  the boldness of pioneers the loneliness of the frontier and the strength of community. Frank Nugent wrote it John Wayne acted it and John Ford filmed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "La Bibbia or The Bible is director John Huston's attempt to bring the stories of the book of Genesis to life.  His movie while not compelling is interesting and holds the viewers attention.  Many big names including Huston himself are featured.  The movie begins where the bible begins with the creation of the world.  Michael Parks and Ulla Bergryd exude childlike innocence as Adam and Eve.  After their fall and banishment from Eden they are cursed by God to suffer for their disobedience although it quickly becomes clear that they have not been abandoned by him.  They have children Cain and Abel. Richard Harris and Franco Nero play the famous brothers they would go on to play best friends a year later in Camelot although it is Harris who steals the scene by quickly dispatching his brother.  Stephen Boyd brings his signature good looks and booming voice to the role of Nimrod although the story of the building of the Tower of Babel is fairly short and Boyd's role limited.  By far the most charming part of the film features Huston as Noah.  Huston brings humor to his role and the segment is a delight for any animal lover.The movie concludes suitably with the story of Abraham and Sarah the biblical patriarch and matriarch of the nation of Israel although there is a detour to cover the story of Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gommorah by the Angel of God.  The legendary figures of Abraham and Sarah are played appropriately enough by two legendary actors George C. Scott and Ava Gardner.  Of the two Scott offers the more compelling performance although Gardner holds her own.  They are visited by Peter O'Toole whose appearance in the film is more along the lines of a cameo. An honorable mention must go out to little Alberto Lucantoni who injects feeling into his role as Isaac particularly in the last scene of the sacrifice.  This is quite a feat for a child actor.In conclusion although this is not the best biblical film I have seen it is by far not the worse and worth at least a rental from your local video store.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was released in September of 1966 which placed it at the close of a long tradition of Hollywood Biblical epics. I was around ten years old and had a vinyl LP of its great musical score which I played over and over before I finally saw the movie on the big screen of a theater. Our family was not particularly religious but this film was one of those that had a profound influence on me and made me interested in knowing more about the Bible.Looking at it today I see more depth. The opening footage from all over the world of the days of the Creation is still breathtaking. As a child I felt uncomfortable with the partially nude scenes of Adam and Eve and even now I believe nudity needs to be implied. Otherwise my mind stops focusing on the story and thinks I just saw a naked actor!. Also a theory of some Bible commentators is that animals are clothed with feathers or fur and Adam and Eve were clothed with a glow of light emanating from within them. When they sinned that glow disappeared and they were then totally naked before they hit on the idea of fig leaves. This interpretation would not likely have been known to John Huston. Beyond that the film rolls on quite nicely through the first twentytwo chapters of Genesis. The cinematography is rich and beautiful. I do think a few too many scenes were interpreted as desert settings since many of the Bible lands were lush and only outskirted by desert as a result of the climatology of the region being somewhat different more than 4000 years ago though of course that's controversial. Either way the storyline still follows the episodes of salvation history. One reviewer said it looks like they just kept shooting until they ran out of film and decided to call it quits. To me it was essential they kept going until they climaxed the film with the sacrifice of Isaac which pointed forward to the day when God would inaugurate a new creation. Thus there is a great arc of theme in the epic from In the Beginning to The New Beginning.Overall the movie looks like a liveaction version of Sunday School art. By that I mean most of the scenes are like pictures I've seen in religious artworks. For example Adam and Eve are portrayed by cleanshaven white people. Cain bashes Abel over the head instead of slitting his throat like the sacrifices he'd watched  see I John 312 in the original Jerusalem Bible 1966 not the New Jerusalem Bible 1985. This Tower of Babel somewhat rightly resembles a Sumerian ziggurat yet more resembles Renaissance paintings of it. Modern researchers have discovered that Noah could have been a king and the ark was actually a huge flat barge shaped like a giant shoebox to ride the tidal waves of the Flood. The movie pictures things like I've seen them all my life a peasant Noah and a rounded boat with a house on top and that shape would capsize in no time. The only thing they didn't have was a giraffe sticking out of the window.Nevertheless you may enjoy these traditional depictions. I'm just preferring literal Biblical research combined with the look of what has been discovered in archaeology. Yet for me the overall effect of this film is still profound and quite moving. It's been said that George C. Scott's portrayal of Abraham was the low point of the movie but I thought his crusty performance was inspiring! I was also thankful they didn't picture Abraham like Santa Claus. For the most part watching this film was an enjoyable and uplifting experience. Any Biblical movie should give us a taste of what things were like and then we should always go back and read the Book. There we will find the authentic atmosphere of the actual words. Still one line the scriptwriters put in the mouth of Abraham is not found in the Bible yet it does reflect what the Bible says of him. It has helped me with my faith. It is the line where Abraham asks Shall the Lord speak and Abraham not believe?".

I would have given it ten stars but he did take some artistic license with Scripture and he did kind of ham it up in the Noah's Ark sequence. Also he left out the part where Noah got drunk after the flood and cursed one of his sons because they made fun of his nakedness. Otherwise this is a beautiful film. It reminded me a little bit of HOW THE WEST WAS WON in that he chronicled a few generations in this story and many of the actors had little more than cameo appearances. The Creation scenes were absolutely gorgeous. I read somewhere that he didn't want to use animation drawings for the Creation because he felt that the world was in a constant state of creation and he had a crew film some of the wonders of the world at work. The results are stunning. The world really looks fresh and new in this film. You can tell he put a lot of care in making this film.As a musician I have to comment on the music in this film. It is as beautiful as the film. Too bad the soundtrack is out of print now. I had the album when I was younger and I played it nearly every chance I got. I never knew until I saw on this site that Ennio Morricone had a hand in writing some of this score don't know which parts but was uncredited. Instead a Japanese composer named Toshiro Mayuzumi did most of this score a composer I haven't heard of since.Until PASSION OF THE Christ this was the last of the big Bible epics and is an underrated masterpiece worth seeing. THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ doesn't count because it took the Scriptures and butchered them. 9 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A long though reasonably faithful rendition of the first 22 chapters of the bible.";
	schema:reviewBody "This was actually a pretty good movie which is based upon the first 22 chapters of Genesis. It begins with the creation of the world and leads to a climax where Abraham goes to sacrifice his son Isaac at God's command however God intervenes and provides a ram for the sacrifice instead. The narration of the movie comes from the King James Bible which I suspect was the main bible that was used at the time and is quite faithful to the narrative however there are a couple of additions such as Nimrod being the king of the world and building the tower of babel and the removal of the scenes where Abraham passes his wife Sarah off as his sister twice.The theme of this movie is faith verses unfaithfulness and obedience verses disobedience. It begins in the garden of Eden where God commands Adam and Eve not to eat from the fruit of the garden of good and evil and ends with God faithfully offering his only son Isaac the son that he waited until he was over 100 years old to conceive as a sacrifice. However Abraham and a majority of the movie focuses of Abraham and on Noah two of the great heroes of faith in the bible is not perfect as can be seen when he listens to his wife and lays with his maid servant Hagar because he does not trust God with his promises. However he does learn as he grows and when Hagar demands Abraham's blessing for Ishmael Abraham refuses.The movie is a little liberal with some of the character namely with Noah's wife who in the bible is unnamed being a contrast with Sarah in that she is faithful and provides Noah as a helper and a supporter during the time of the flood when no doubt Noah would have at times questioned God and wondered if there would ever be a time when he would escape from the ark.Wind plays a dominant role in the movie at least in parts and represents God's power. We see the wind at the beginning of the movie when the world is created but we also see the wind come about with the flooding of the earth and also with the destruction of the Tower of Babel. However it is also interesting that as the film leads to the climax of the sacrifice of Isaac Abraham is leading Isaac through the ruins of Sodom another addition to the movie and both are questioning God's decision to destroy everybody including the children. This questioning though is what is going through Abraham's mind as he takes his only son the son he waited over 100 years to conceive up to the altar to offer up as a sacrifice. However Abraham demonstrates his faith by laying Isaac onto the altar and lights the fire and as he is about to slit Isaac's throat God steps in and rescues Isaac providing him with a substitute a ram to offer up instead.I guess Isaac's question as to why the children were also destroyed is answered with the question of sin for as is revealed all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and all are deserving of death. Even though Isaac is a child or a young adult Isaac has sinned and brought God's wrath upon him but is saved through a substitute. Further it is also the question of the first fruits. Isaac is Abraham's first born and it is the first born that is given up to God. We see this with Cain and Abel. Abel offers God the best of his flock while Cain goes to make his sacrifice but instead of offering his best he keeps it for himself which in turn angers God and thus his sacrifice is rejected.".

More could have been done with characterizations but in the time given was satisfactory. Just watch and enjoy for its face value.";

However looking at this tale of Old Testament fire and brimstone directed by nonbeliever John Huston one could say what it really takes is an atheist. You see you have a problem when trying to make a cinematic presentation of the first portions of the bible which are pretty much a litany of genocide misanthropy and dubious morality in which it appears God is to be endured rather than praised. How do you present such a story in humane and accessible terms? The Bible In the Beginning was written by noted Quaker playwright Christopher Fry. Fry does two very important things  firstly he arranges a handful of bible stories into one satisfying arc in which God's vindictiveness towards humanity is made a running theme ending with the final act of mercy in the story or Abraham and Isaac making this one story rather than a collection. The second thing Fry does is to avoid doing a realist job. Rather than doing what most of the ancient world epics before this did filling in gaps and fleshing out characters to create a kind of biblical drama Fry uses only what is actually in the bible. He doesn't for example try to imagine what Cain and Abel might have argued over as children or what bedtime stories Sarah told to Isaac what little dialogue there is is either lifted directly or adapted closely from Genesis itself. Whether or not it was Fry's intention the effect is to keep the narrative at the level of a distant mythical tale. It also leaves the story open to a broad visual interpretation.This is where Huston comes in. Huston makes The Bible In the Beginning a real feast for the eyes from the kaleidoscopic creation scenes to the gorgeous glimmering light in the garden of Eden to the arc towering over the plains like a Dali painting to the cryptic use of darkness and shadow in the city of Sodom. By and large Huston's vision is one of mysterious beauty like gazing upon some ancient artefact. I say by and large the latitude afforded Huston by the Fry script also allows him to do the Noah's arc story with a touch of slapstick comedy. He originally wanted Charlie Chaplin to play the part of Noah and I so wish Chaplin hadn't turned him down. Nevertheless Huston himself steps into the breech and does a passable Chaplinesquire act and this segments comedy is gentle enough to fit in with the overall tone of solemnity. Huston's collaborators are crucial to the overall effect too. Of particular note is the musical score by Toshiro Mayuzumi at times playfully MickeyMousing the action at others matching the imagery in its surreal grandeur. The best of the acting performances is certainly George C. Scott's powerful turn as Abraham. Scott is unashamedly theatrical but again this is in line with the style of the production going for extravagant presentation rather than dramatic realism.The Bible In the Beginning was the very last of the wave of ancient world epics that began back in 1949 with Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah but it is also quite probably the best. Rather than trying to put a recognisable human spin on the story and sermonising directly at its audience Huston's epic takes the bible for what it is a work of mythology on the same level as The Iliad or The Nibelungenlied. And when taken as a mythical saga rather than an apologist piece for God at his most belligerent it can be viewed as a picture of incredible power and beauty.".

	schema:headline " Limited adventure of viewer from the beginning to the end...but has its precious moments too!";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1960s saw the heyday of great spectacle epics concerning ancient stories set in Rome Greece Egypt as well as the adaptations of selected biblical texts. John Huston after the successful production BARABBAS 1961 by Richard Fleischer in Dino De Laurentiis Studios made a film concerning the first part of the Book of Genesis from the Creation to Abraham. Spectacular cast of stars was one of his key aspects in the film  George C. Scott Ava Gardner Peter O'Toole soon after his magnificent LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and the director himself. But the content? Very predictable! Yet though you may know the text perfectly well it does not mean that the film will bore you to death. It has some very strong points and moments of fine cinematography despite being a sluggish word for word Bible on screen. Nevertheless when judging the film at once one has to be very careful since Huston's film turns out to be different than other movies. When I saw THE BIBLE for the first time I could not evaluate the film easily as one piece of work. Because of its particularly specific content the movie has to be treated according to its different stories it deals with.The creation is filmed nicely and though it does not bring anything new the viewer may rely on visual experience. The beauties of Iceland Galapagos Islands seen from time to time the waterfalls of Iguazu ... all these marvelous locations add a splendor to the director's imagination of how God created the world. Then we see Man Adam Michael Parks and Woman Eve Ulla Bergryd. The sequence with the forbidden apple is so long that one can fall asleep before something else happens. The event is treated literally which is proved by the fact that the snake speaks. And then we all know what happened... The director shows the adventure of man from the beginning... The story of Cain and Abel is presented quite briefly. Then comes the explanation of how men spread on earth and we move to a magnificent story Noah's.This sequence is the blooming part of the film shot in a gorgeous way which makes THE BIBLE really worth seeing. Noah played by the director himself John Huston builds an arch with his sons. We see a group of people strangely worn who are mocking outrageously at him. I loved the later moment when animals are entering the arch. It's humor combined with great visual effects and wonderful music the exotic tune begun by Noah who plays his flute. The whole sequence in the arch when great waters flood the old world holds viewer's attention throughout! I remember one brilliant moment when after many days of rain Noah looks outside and the sunshine appears in the arch which causes the joy of animals and the dance of Noah's family. Another splendid moment is the rainbow appearing in the sky God's everlasting alliance with men when all the animals are already stepping on the new earth. This sequence is truly as the trailer of the film said full of delight humor and humanity.Noah's story is followed by a moral and a short Babel Tower sequence. We see King Nimrod Stephen Boyd who walks up the tower to reach God with his arrow. This is a fine performance of Boyd the actor difficult to be recognized because of the exotic make up but besides him there is nothing spectacular. There is a glimpse at people speaking different languages but comparing it to other stories the Babel sequence is very condensed and could have been longer and more creative. That is more or less the moment which marks the half of the film.The second half of Huston's BIBLE deals only with Abraham and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah within it. Although George C. Scott gives a marvelous performance as the father of many nations the story is presented in a boring way. There are however some little brilliant moments in it that should never be skipped when one decides to see the film. These are for instance the visit of the three guests at Abraham's Peter O'Toole. Except for the seemingly ordinary visit there is a thrill of mystery felt throughout. The figure of manangel disappears gradually as Abraham asks him about Sodom. Other moments worth considering are the final scenes when Abraham walks with his son to make sacrifice of Isaac his only son. They step on the ruins of Sodom. George C. Scott wonderfully portrays a man divided within obedient to God but at the same time rebelling against Him loving Him and quarreling with Him. We only hear the echo of his voice to God while seeing the skeletons and ruined Sodom's temples and gates. Finally the sinful cities are showed in a way nobody later did show e.g. SODOM AND GOMORRAH 1962 by Robert Aldrich entirely different in its treatment. Here we see a ROTTEN decadence of its inhabitants for example a woman having ecstasy at the sight of a calf and an orgy of people with painted faces. Besides these little moments the story of Abraham in THE BIBLE is definitely too long and tedious.But when watching the film one has to have certain goals. To see THE BIBLE just for the sake of it makes the film quite useless. So either I see it because I want to admire the cast get to know the beginning of Genesis Book in a visual way or I want to see the film as a cinema work of the middle 1960s which is of interest to me personally. Therefore it is a very specific film that is hard to evaluate once and for all. Some people may get bored with it entirely while some others may find it very interesting. It depends on viewers. I recommend it mostly because of Noah's sequence but do not promise a rousing adventure. 610".

The event is treated literally which is proved by the fact that the snake speaks. And then we all know what happened... The director shows the adventure of man from the beginning... The story of Cain and Abel is presented quite briefly. Then comes the explanation of how men spread on earth and we move to a magnificent story Noah's.This sequence is the blooming part of the film shot in a gorgeous way which makes THE BIBLE really worth seeing. Noah played by the director himself John Huston builds an arch with his sons. We see a group of people strangely worn who are mocking outrageously at him. I loved the later moment when animals are entering the arch. It's humor combined with great visual effects and wonderful music the exotic tune begun by Noah who plays his flute. The whole sequence in the arch when great waters flood the old world holds viewer's attention throughout! I remember one brilliant moment when after many days of rain Noah looks outside and the sunshine appears in the arch which causes the joy of animals and the dance of Noah's family. Another splendid moment is the rainbow appearing in the sky God's everlasting alliance with men when all the animals are already stepping on the new earth. This sequence is truly as the trailer of the film said full of delight humor and humanity.Noah's story is followed by a moral and a short Babel Tower sequence. We see King Nimrod Stephen Boyd who walks up the tower to reach God with his arrow. This is a fine performance of Boyd the actor difficult to be recognized because of the exotic make up but besides him there is nothing spectacular. There is a glimpse at people speaking different languages but comparing it to other stories the Babel sequence is very condensed and could have been longer and more creative. That is more or less the moment which marks the half of the film.The second half of Huston's BIBLE deals only with Abraham and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah within it. Although George C. Scott gives a marvelous performance as the father of many nations the story is presented in a boring way. There are however some little brilliant moments in it that should never be skipped when one decides to see the film. These are for instance the visit of the three guests at Abraham's Peter O'Toole. Except for the seemingly ordinary visit there is a thrill of mystery felt throughout. The figure of manangel disappears gradually as Abraham asks him about Sodom. Other moments worth considering are the final scenes when Abraham walks with his son to make sacrifice of Isaac his only son. They step on the ruins of Sodom. George C. Scott wonderfully portrays a man divided within obedient to God but at the same time rebelling against Him loving Him and quarreling with Him. We only hear the echo of his voice to God while seeing the skeletons and ruined Sodom's temples and gates. Finally the sinful cities are showed in a way nobody later did show e.g. SODOM AND GOMORRAH 1962 by Robert Aldrich entirely different in its treatment. Here we see a ROTTEN decadence of its inhabitants for example a woman having ecstasy at the sight of a calf and an orgy of people with painted faces. Besides these little moments the story of Abraham in THE BIBLE is definitely too long and tedious.But when watching the film one has to have certain goals. To see THE BIBLE just for the sake of it makes the film quite useless. So either I see it because I want to admire the cast get to know the beginning of Genesis Book in a visual way or I want to see the film as a cinema work of the middle 1960s which is of interest to me personally. Therefore it is a very specific film that is hard to evaluate once and for all. Some people may get bored with it entirely while some others may find it very interesting. It depends on viewers. I recommend it mostly because of Noah's sequence but do not promise a rousing adventure. 610";

Also dinosaurs would have been around during the flood so a few of them should have appeared. They did have many other animals which I was quite surprised with...I really enjoyed the turtles. The ark wasn't quite as it would have been but they did very well on making it look the size.

	schema:reviewBody "The Bible In the Beginning... is an AcademyAward for its score nominated American movie from 50 years ago. It was written by Christopher Fry and directed by John Huston already a 2time Academy Award winner at this point. The title basically says already what this is exactly about. It is a collection of contents from the bible that do not have anything to do with each other. So it is basically several movies in one. This is maybe a good thing from the perspective that this is a truly long film and you do not have to watch it all at once without anything getting lost. IMDb lists several runtimes but I did not see the version of 3.5 house luckily but the one with 174 minutes.I personally somewhat enjoyed the first two sequences with Adam  Eve and Noah played by Huston himself. He sure has the looks for the part and it's no rarity that he acts in his films too. He is also an Oscar nominee for performing. Unfortunately everything afterward Abraham Isaac was not of particular interest to me maybe because I wasn't even vaguely familiar with the story in contrast to the first under 90 minutes. Had the film ended around 1.5 hours I probably would have been more generous with my rating but this way it was really dragging at times and occasionally a tedious watch. Also the acting could not really convince me even if the script wasn't bad and had quite a few fairly smart moments.If you have a religious background or are just interested in religiously themed films this one is worth checking out. Unfortunately neither of the two applies to me and still I liked half of the film at least to some extent. However as a whole I felt this was too long wouldn't even want to imagine a version that is still almost another hour longer and I lost interest in the character at some point I have to admit. That's why I would not recommend it to general audiences. Admittedly it's not worse than The Passion of the Christ.".

Huston took great pains not to imply too much onto the Scriptural narrative and added only what they knew at the time to be biblically historically and archaeologically accurate.

I have seen the depicting of Sodom and Gommorah but this was unusually welldone here. All the scenes appeared to be authentic. And I liked the cast. Michael Parks was adept at playing Adam and his female counterpart was excellent as Eve. I was impressed with again the flood of Noah though in places it maybe was a bit more comical than it was intended to be. John Huston performed well his part of Noah and he had a good voice that of God and his narration voice was excellent. Stephen Boyd was as mean as ever as Nimrod. George C. Scott conveyed well an aging Abraham Peter O'Toole acted well his triple role that of the three angels who visited Sarah and Ava Gardner was her beautiful self as she betrayed to the screen that Sarah was still a beautiful lady even in her older years. But I do have one objection to the production. While I liked the scenes and again the manifestation of the various Biblical stories I frankly thought the acting left something to be desired. I'm not trying to rescind but while I still think the actors came across well in their individual roles they seemed to just say their lines and thus in places did not put much feeling into what they said.

As the film begins we see a house being demolished.It belongs to a lowcaste landless farm worker.The land on which it stood had been tilled by him for decades but the landlord has now sold it to an industrialist.An old man who lives with his wife and two young children watches the tragedy with sad haunted eyes.His face speaks for the whole community which has nowhere to turn to.They form a group and go to the upper caste village headman house where they are reminded of their place in society. In fact they belong to the lower castes that have won reservation in government jobs.None of the characters here have produced civil servants.There appears to be a further class divide among them ever harder to surmount.

	schema:headline " Colorful film about Punjab region with amateur actors beautifully portrayed";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as part of the Rotterdam Film Festival 2012. The film director was present and started his introduction by telling us that India produces many films per year mostly for the masses of which at most 10 can be deemed of the art house category. He attended film school not long ago and always wanted to develop his own style. And I can say upfront that he did with great success.He spent five years in the Punjab region while himself coming from an other province. He preferred not to shoot with actors people with this title on their business card but employed local people instead. He had to specifically instruct them to behave normally do not act.These amateur actors were beautifully portrayed in more than one meaning of the word by virtue of long close ups and also long silences. This perfectly blends in with the way of living in this region. The same can be said about the overall slow pacing of this film. Even a still scene can create its own sound and tell what's going on if I may quote the director. It leaves the concept of time open for interpretation by the viewer the story can cover days weeks whatever.Plenty of local color was thrown in as a bonus. We witnessed some colorful creative cursing by one of the women in two different instances. Also a quote from one of the men is worth recalling When God gave wisdom we were overlooked. The general attitude of the locals is to accept their fate having the feeling that they can't won't do much about it.As a matter of fact as told by the director life is becoming very difficult for the common man in that region. We saw a few men with money and power very few I assume and the rest tries to make ends meet but is bound to fail eventually. By the way I could not help myself wondering what all these people do for a living.All in all a perfect inside view in a part of the world we never see. The average Bollywood movie provides us with a very different view on the country and this film is a welcome exception. I gave he maximum score for the audience award when leaving the theater.".

	schema:headline " Alms for a Blind Horse Review  In the Nutshell";
	schema:reviewBody "The film is set in a village in the outskirts of Bathinda city where villagers work in the fields of the local landlord. It is a village where people are trying hard to make peace with their existence.On a foggy winter morning a family wakes up to the news of the demolition of a house on the outskirts of the village. Father a silent sympathizer joins the community in demand for justice whilst his son Melu a rickshaw puller in the city participates in a strike by his union. Injured and alienated Melu spends the day quietly resting and drinking with friends in the night they debate the meaning of their existence. Both father and son are equally clueless about their futures.The film is a powerful exploration of the daily struggles of the urban and rural workers in a Punjab where the gap between the rich and poor is getting wider and people's hopes and aspirations for a better life are shattered.As the director says it is difficult to say what the film is about as it can mean different things to different people which it should. At the surface the film speaks about the margins where the socially repressed and exploited have been conveniently cast away. It's about a day in the lives of a family who are witnesses to the play of power equation unfolding around them. It's about silent witnesses devoid of power to change or influence the course of destiny. It's about invisible violence and desires simmering discontent and angst that are reflected on people's faces.The village portrayed is not the pictureperfect Bollywood village with verdant mustard fields and huge private mansions. It showcases the underbelly of caste'ism and marginalized farmers. The helplessness and angst of Dalit's in a village in Punjab is beautifully captured.Amazing part is that most of the actors in the movie are not real actors but real villagers of the same village where the film is shot.The creative producer of the movie Mani Kaul known for critically acclaimed movies like Uski Roti 1970  Duvidha 1974 was also mentor of the director which is clearly reflected in his style. Mani's parting words before the director left for the shoot were Go beyond what you know! and the director says I would start feeling dissatisfied if things were going too much according to the plan. I kept struggling with Mani's thought. Having finished the film now I know what he meant! Gurvinder's style doesn't share much of functional details although the way he handles the sounds the empty frames  the silence is incredible. This is what would probably alienate him from taking the film to a wider audience. He seems happier experimenting with the notions of time and space within a filmic narrative.Anhey Ghorey Da Daan is nevertheless a rewarding watch for those who are open to not treading the beaten path!".

	schema:headline " One of the Funniest Movies Ever Made";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is hilarious quite simply put. What's even funnier is that some people think it's real. It's a scripted faux Mondo style globehopping documentary on the worship of Satan every bit of it dreamed up by a writer and performed by stock or nonactors who were following a screenplay of sorts. Yes Anton LeVay makes an appearance but the Walrus was Paul etc It's just nonsense but great for the press to putter about and LeVay agreed to be in the film plus another he participated in SATANIS THE DEVIL'S MASS as a publicity stunt for his Church of Satan nightclub.The narrator of the English language version is a treasure It's actually frequent genre actorstar Edward Purdom and the tipoff to what is going on should be his blas description of an initiation ritual in which a young supplicant's slim sexy body is ceremonially covered in blood from a severed boar's head  shown from multiple upclose tight angles. I am sure such a ritual actually exists somewhere but come on ... This could be a long Monty Python sketch about otherwise ordinary British twits played by Italians going about their lives as hensacrificing orgy participating followers of Satan only there's no punchline. It's all straight man material poker faced in sincerity about pretending to show us the alleged pastimes of various satanists and describing it all in the same way that a NOVA episode about Amazon rain forest tribespeople might be narrated.The film IS rather dated  the surviving home video prints look very old tired washed out and about five generations of dubbing old. There's a shorter version called WITCHCRAFT 70 that you can sometimes find online as prior rentals then a super rare longer version called WHITE ANGELS BLACK ANGELS that purports to be uncut. It probably is but the print used was so shabby and overused when transferred that it's hard to tell splice damage is rampant the film has a discontinuous narrative it's more a collection of oddly staged little scenes cleverly edited together by someone with a very offbeat sense of humor.A lot of the hilarity seems inadvertent but then again you never know. The whole idea of this school of filmmaking is a puton and if you aren't in on the joke you might actually think that some inventive film crew actually did get access to forbidden rituals  film events as they were really taking place. I think a better question would be how accurate is the depiction of dark worship presented? I don't doubt for a minute that some of the participants actually are coven members reenacting their little orgies or whatever but the point of the film was to entertain not educate indoctrinate or even shed light on Satanic worship. It's almost pure exploitation and only notorious because of the subject matter  amount of bare naked bodies. I will concede that it goes on for about a half hour longer than it really needed to My attention started to wane at about the sixty minute mark though I am sure that if you are into this kind of stuff it will all be riveting ... even the repeated night shots of a city skyline. Which must have looked pretty cool to the cameraman tripping on the hillside but don't mean much on a small screen.Still it's a priceless movie especially with that hilarious narration. As Homer Simpson might put it It's funny because they seem to be so serious about something so stupid. Hilarious.710".

It probably is but the print used was so shabby and overused when transferred that it's hard to tell splice damage is rampant the film has a discontinuous narrative it's more a collection of oddly staged little scenes cleverly edited together by someone with a very offbeat sense of humor.A lot of the hilarity seems inadvertent but then again you never know. The whole idea of this school of filmmaking is a puton and if you aren't in on the joke you might actually think that some inventive film crew actually did get access to forbidden rituals  film events as they were really taking place. I think a better question would be how accurate is the depiction of dark worship presented? I don't doubt for a minute that some of the participants actually are coven members reenacting their little orgies or whatever but the point of the film was to entertain not educate indoctrinate or even shed light on Satanic worship. It's almost pure exploitation and only notorious because of the subject matter  amount of bare naked bodies. I will concede that it goes on for about a half hour longer than it really needed to My attention started to wane at about the sixty minute mark though I am sure that if you are into this kind of stuff it will all be riveting ... even the repeated night shots of a city skyline. Which must have looked pretty cool to the cameraman tripping on the hillside but don't mean much on a small screen.Still it's a priceless movie especially with that hilarious narration. As Homer Simpson might put it It's funny because they seem to be so serious about something so stupid. Hilarious.710";

	schema:reviewBody "OK first the one review above about a lot of stuff being occult in 1970 doesn't even seem to be about this movie. I think he's confused it with something with a similar titlesubject.There are two movies which use some of the same footage. The Italian version White Angels Black Angels is more like a Mondo documentary of the 1960's.The American version titled Witchcraft '70 is a better version in my opinion. It's tone treats witchcraft with a more sinister view. It leaves out footage of Hare Krishnas that the Italian version has and has a much more spookier theme. Plus it has a cool psychedelic opening with low tech but effective graphics.I'll focus on the American release although for some reason it's harder to find. Try to find it it's better. . The first scene features some kind of WiccaCrowley type cult. The High Priestess' name isn't given nor the name of the cultcoven. The rituals appears Wiccan but uses Crowley's Hymn To Pan although it could still be Wiccan and there's a challenge to the JudeoChristian God in the movie by the buxom High Priestess if there be any power left in Heaven let it transfix my breast. How charming. Wicca was born out of Crowleyism so it's hard to say what the cult it exactly. Satanist? Wiccan? Thelema? Mixandmatch? Oh well. While Wiccans nowadays may whine about the movie lumping them together with Satanists the truth is the line was more blurry back then...even though they won't admit it.Next we see Alex Sanders perform a Wiccan wedding. In the 70's Wicca was all about nudity and sex unlike the very watered down version of Silver Ravenwolf.There's also scenes with Anton LaVey reading the destruction ritual from The Satanic Bible and the Invocation of Satan...different material from what is in Satanis. If you want to see what a bunch of Yahoos LaVey and the original Church of Satan were see that movie. Even so you still get to see LaVey wearing goofy devil horns and pimping out his own wife as a nude altar. The Church of Satan ritual scene has less nudity than the Wiccan and Voodoo groups even though they're more evil oddly enough.There's a Brazilian Macumba purification ritual which shows prostitutes being chastised. It's seems to have been shot in 8mm and the narrator says it's someone's vacation home movies...might have been.There's an LA voodoo ritual which supposedly was recorded with a hidden camera but looks like it could have been staged.There's an Indonesian Hindu exorcism ritual with daggers and for some reason a scene of a Dutch Charismatic church singing hymns in church proably to add little footage.There's also another UK Wiccan ritual in England with a probably fake interview with a witch from said coven who for some reason was an American. They do the old fashioned Eko Eko chant in that scene. Wiccans were exhibitionists who wanted the spotlight back then unlike now? lol!. They thought nothing of getting naked and selling out their religion for the cameras. Wiccans nowadays with a few exceptions will be rather disappointed in watching how the originals did it.There is a scene showing hippies in Devil's Canyon were the Mansons hung out. The scene depicts the kind of made up witchcraft hippies practiced resulting in one girl getting assaulted although you really can't see what's going on. This could be another staged scene...or who knows it could have been real. Real as reality TV. The Mansons stole some NBC TV camera equipment so who knows it might even be some of the long lost Manson porn you hear about...but I seriously doubt it.There is nudity in the film but no actual penetration. It was an X rated film when it was released...would probably be considered an NC17 today. Some people find the Witchcraft '70 version creepy and even scary. I've had friends that had to get up and leave the room when I showed it. Seriously. If you know someone curious about the occult this would probably nip it in the bud for them...unless they're truly weird. There's no mention of Jesus or the Bible or anything it just shows the weirdos for what they are.Another good film in this genre if you can find it is Journey Into The Beyond 1975 or 76 narrated by John Carradine although it would be considered more slanted in favor toward the occult.".

Seariously it's obvious that this movie was supposed to have educational tone witch maybe it had in 1970. but today it looks like poor Christian mockumentary on everything blasphemous. This isn't movie that'll teach you anything about occult and supernatural this is the movie you should watch with your friends and have really good laugh.P.S.

I had to research this since I was basically 5050 for either believing it or not and a bit sad to see in the other reviews that it was all faked with actors. So good people this stuff is real basically the only things not completely provable are the Finnish ceremony and the black mass but I'm personally quite sure that they were not made up. Why would they be? It was very easy to find stuff like this happening all over the world. I guess people were more open with their occult ceremonies at the time but they're still happening take for instance Marina Abramovitch and all the famous people and politicians who go to her ritual parties. Rappers and musicians are openly worshiping Lucifer etc.So sure this looks a bit silly but the witchcraft was real.".

After viewing several mundane comedies I found What's the Worst That Could Happen? to be refreshing. A quick summary of the plot Kevin Caffrey Martin Lawrence attempts to burglarize billionaire Max Fairbanks' Danny Divito home. Max turns out to be in the house and holds Kevin at gunpoint until the police arrive. He then tells the cops that the ring on Kevin's hand belongs to him and the cops force Kevin to cough it up. The problem is that Kevin's new girlfriend had just given it to him. The rest of the movie deals with Kevin trying to get the ring back. Danny DeVito is hilarious and this is my favorite Martin Lawrence movie yet.The plot is original and I thought the supporting actors were great. I would have given William Fichtner a bit more of a roll. He really had little to do with the plot yet I found his portrayal of gay Detective Alex Tardio to be one of the funniest parts of the movie. I read the book and will admit that the book's ending is a bit more satisfying but not a major issue. I have never seen a group of criminals and scoundrels more likable than the group in the movie. Everyone in the movie the thief the rich guy the politicians the judges and everyone in the periphery seems to be morally depraved. I guess that is what makes this movie so funny. If you enjoyed Blue Streak then you're going to love What's the Worst That Could Happen?.".

This is something I think moviegoers should do read the book and go to see the movie to compare and contrast. The book is full of rich comical characters as is the movie but there are differences.The film stars Martin Lawrence as Kevin Caffery a suave intelligent thief who often cases art auctions for new prizes to steal. However his partner named Berger John Leguizamo lets him in a score at a mansion owned by Max Fairbanks a wealthy businessman Danny DeVito who is going bankrupt. The two thieves break in the house and DeVito catches Lawrence and steals his prized ring his girlfriend gave him. He is then bent on revenge and out to get it back.The plot is basic and works well and the film is smart funny and actually even silly. Most silly movies get trashed and aren't given credit for trying to make us laugh a bit. What's The Worst That Can Happen has a good amount of intelligence to it but also has a good amount of summer movie silliness and it fits and works in a comedy that is well made and very entertaining.Give it chance and it might work for you.Costars Glenne Headly Nora Dunn Bernie Mac William Fichtner Richard Schiff Larry Miller and Ana Gasteyer.".

However his partner named Berger John Leguizamo lets him in a score at a mansion owned by Max Fairbanks a wealthy businessman Danny DeVito who is going bankrupt. The two thieves break in the house and DeVito catches Lawrence and steals his prized ring his girlfriend gave him. He is then bent on revenge and out to get it back.The plot is basic and works well and the film is smart funny and actually even silly. Most silly movies get trashed and aren't given credit for trying to make us laugh a bit. What's The Worst That Can Happen has a good amount of intelligence to it but also has a good amount of summer movie silliness and it fits and works in a comedy that is well made and very entertaining.Give it chance and it might work for you.Costars Glenne Headly Nora Dunn Bernie Mac William Fichtner Richard Schiff Larry Miller and Ana Gasteyer.";

	schema:reviewBody "If the box office rest of summer ends up as good as this movie was movie fans will be in for a real treat. Martin Lawrence returns to the big screen with his hilarious brand of humor as he teams with Danny DeVito in What's The Worst That Can Happen?What's The Worst That Can Happen? revolves around a wouldbe burglar named Kevin Caffrey played by Lawrence is caught in the act by the home owner billionaire Max Fairbanks played by DeVito. The tables are turned when Fairbanks steals Caffrey's ring given to him by his girlfriend. The rest of the film circles around getting the ring back. From this moment on I knew I was going to be watching one funny film.Joining Lawrence and DeVito is John Leguizamo as Kevin's partner in crime Burger Carmen Ejogo as Kevin's girlfriend Amber and Bernie Mac as Kevin's uncle. The addition of these actors is evidence that What's The Worst That Can Happen? is a sure hit with all ages.Lawrence wears two hats in What's The Worst That Can Happen? as producer and star and he has success in both capacities. Furthermore he was a true asset as an actor in What's The Worst That Can Happen? because he brought a unique brand of humor. His style is one to be proud of because he truly makes the comedy enjoyable and the humor so funny you'll be laughing so hard it will hurt. I appreciate his comedic ability and acting talent.DeVito adds credibility to one truly fun comedy. I couldn't have asked for a better actor to portray Max Fairbanks. There is not a lot to say about DeVito because his lengthy and steady body of work speaks for him. With so many great films under his belt I knew I was going to be watching a true master at work. In addition to credibility DeVito has presence and humor in that made me smile from ear to ear and start to finish. He is solid comedic genius that brings a great amount of comedy and presence that will leave everyone smiling.Leguizamo has a true niche for comedy as he proves in What's The Worst That Can Happen? I wasn't sure how to gage Leguizamo because I have only seen one other film with him so I was surprised to learn he was one of funniest and talented actors in the movie. The chemistry between Lawrence and Leguizamo was perfect because they seemed to work so well together. Leguizamo was a great compliment to Lawrence and his brand of humor. I enjoyed every minute they shared the screen because I knew I was going to laugh.Ejogo was a true pleasure to watch because she brought excitement and charisma to the movie. I relished each scene she was in because I got the opportunity to see a true natural at work. Mac was a true surprise because I didn't expect him to turn in a good performance. Ejogo joins a handful of actresses that includes Monica Potter Kate Beckinsale and James King who are on my list of nominees for the prestigious honor of being called best newcomers of the year. The true geniuses behind What's The Worst That Can Happen? were the writers because they created something special. The writing in this movie is very enjoyable and good because it compliments Lawrence's comedy and DeVito's humor. The games set up by the writers were incredible fun to watch since each scene skillfully crafted.Also the audience received a bonus when the writer added action and suspense. Though What's The Worst That Can Happen? succeeds mostly with comedy it also entertains with action and suspense.I knew with scenes like Kevin's taunts to Max over his cellphone while he was in a senate subcommittee What's The Worst That Can Happen? will entertain every single person who buys a ticket for this movie. I could not ask for anything more from the writers of What's The Worst That Could Happen because watching this story play out is a thing of beauty.One solid guarantee I can make to potential viewers of this movie What's The Worst That Could Happen will leave you laughing until it hurts. Lawrence and DeVito are a lethal comedic team that fills the screen with laughter suspense and action. What's The Worst That Can Happen? is one of the most entertaining films I've seen. The bottom line is this film is harmless fun that will delight and entertain you for two hours. I hope everyone gets the chance to see how great these two talents come together and create one of the funniest movies this year.".

So I'll concentrate on them in this review. Here it goesDe Vito is perfect as always. Noone could play the part of the complacent billionaire better than him! He does the best he can do with the material he's given but his talent could have been used more appropriately if the writers had done a better job...Martin Lawrence also playes one of his usual parts quite similar to the part he played in Blue Streak. He does everything expected from him including getting in disguise more than once and producing some Eddie Murphystyle jokes. But seeing Black Knight and now this one may ask isn't he repeating himself too much now? Sure he's funny but he's also getting annoying to more and more people...We also have some goodloking actresses especially the lady playing Lawrence's girlfriend. Their parts are unfortunately too brief to be memorable.Ohyes there's also William Fichtner playing one of the weirdest detectives in the history of cinema! Am I the only one who thinks he was doing a parody of Willem Defoe's character in The Boondock Saints??As far as the plot well it's all about a ring...".

	schema:reviewBody "What's the Worst That Can Happen? 2001 Dir Sam Weisman  Cast Martin Lawrence Danny De Vito John Leguizamo Glenne Headly Carmen Ejogo To answer the question presented by the title the film could have been so much more worse just by being longer. It is a comedy about a constant attack of bad luck. Martin Lawrence plays a thief who is caught in the midst of robbing Danny De Vito but when police arrive De Vito steals his ring that was given to him by his girlfriend. This becomes a seesaw battle of revenge until reaching a conclusion where theft is rewarded. Director Sam Weisman has comic timing but a poor choice in scripts. He has previously directed such junk as George of the Jungle and The OutofTowners. With a list like this it isn't likely that he will be up for any Academy Awards achievement trophy any time soon. Lawrence has seen better days and De Vito is certainly capable of better. He actually played a role similar to this in Tin Men. Both comics are hilarious when the material is good but this ranks as merely career suicide. Glenne Headly has an embarrassing role as a fortune teller. John Leguizamo plays Lawrence's partner in crime in a role that is every bit as useless as it sounds. It is a routine comedy nearly devoid of any laughs. So what's the worst that can happen? Lawrence and De Vito could get suckered into a sequel. Score 2  10".

Absolutely freakin' nowhere!!!What's the worst that could happen?  Write a silly meaningless script that's not even worthy of receiving the green light as a sitcom pilot and throw in all this great talent to the filmmakers' disposal.  The only scene where I recall laughing is the opening where Martin is speaking to a woman at the auction house and says that the painting on the wall is as fake as her glasses.  For the rest of the movie I chuckled but even chuckles were few and far between.Why did Danny DeVito who we all loved as Louie DePalma on Taxi even consider starring in this clunker?  All he does is ape around struggling to hide his embarrassment of being in the movie in the first place.  As for Lawrence he's forced to succumb to the same lame schtick he did in Blue Streakanother socalled comedy with a terrible script.  Since there's no funny material he tries to make the audience laugh with stupid overthetop antics.  Bernie Mac has one funny line which was given away in the trailers but I still found funny.  Bernie's a great comic with great potential who simply has to find the right outlet.  He hasn't been in too many movies and if he ever decides to commit himself to a career in film this is not the way to do it.There's so many other talents that I failed to mention  Larry Miller Glenne Headly Ana Gasteyer William Fichtner.  Speaking of good ol' Bill Fichtner who thought his characterthe flamboyant detective dressed like Crockett from Miami Vicewould be funny?  Crazy it is.  But funnynot! And who thought that scene where Martin Lawrence and John Leguizamo pretend to be Arabstalking in a gibberish dialectwould be funny?  This movie tries and tries and tries to be quirky but it never succeeds in the comedy department.I have to say that chick who played Martin's love interest is really really hot!  I hope to see her in more movies!  Also that chick who plays DeVito's mistress.I was totally bored during the majority of this flat lamebrained comedy and I hope every actor in the cast regret making this crappy movie and cross it off their resumes.  I'd love to see DeVito and Lawrence is a movie togetherI think they have great potential as a comedy teambut make sure the script is FUNNY!My score  3 out of 10".

Lawrence is bad  unfunny and stupid  but the real criminal is the screenwriter. Whoever adapted this one should have his typing fingers amputated and be forced to work in public access for the rest of his career.  How anybody could take a mediocre but wellplotted and screenready novel and turn it into this festering headshaking mess of a movie is completely beyond me.

Also a great supporting part by William Fichtner as the dogloving Detective Alex Tardio a mustsee for any fans of his. The rest of the cast is great too as is the soundtrack. DeVito and Lawrence are a great pair and the way they battle with witty comments makes this movie 10 times better as if it wasn't funny enough already. What's The Worst That Could Happen? is definitely watchable again and again. One of my very favorites. Love it!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "People rag on What's The Worst That Could Happen all the time. Let em and screw em while we're at it. Implausible? Yes. Silly? Yup. Ridiculous? Oh yes. Funny? You bet your ass. It's one of those lighthearted Martin Lawrence comedies like Blue Streak or National Security tripping along an alleyway of lowbrow humour and bawdy antics that you just can't stay mad at like a friend who does something really dumb and follows up with something that cracks a grin on your face. Lawrence also has the luck to be paired with Danny Devito here who is funny even when he isn't trying to be. Lawrence plays Kevin a cocky cat burglar who bungles the wrong dude when he breaks into the not so vacant summer home of sleazy billionaire Max Fairbanks Devito. Max catches him red handed holds him at gunpoint and convinces the cops that a family heirloom ring on Kevin's finger is part of the stolen goods adding insult to arrest. That dick move launches an ego fuelled battle of wills as these two morons find more and more elaborate ways to incite each other's wrath. They each have a little armada who back them up when they aren't questioning their every idiotic movie. Kevin has his gorgeous girlfriend Carmen Ejogo has sadly made a career of being underused his partner Berger John Leguizamo plays around with accents like you ain't never seen who is the Dumber to his Dumb and his sassy handler Bernie Mac. Max is hounded by his witchy wife Nora Dunn shunned by his much abused attorney a dry delightful Richard Schiff pawned over by his mistress Glenne Headly and secretly lusted for by his chief of security you haven't lived until you've seen Larry Miller do his thang here. Max and Kevin are engaging arch enemies with Lawrence mugging for face time a tad too much and Devito perfectly settled into his shtick as always. I must make note of probably the best performance of the film from William Fichtner as a flamboyantly gay police detective who hounds all parties involved. He's one part frightening with a side of classy charm subverting his usual weirdo tough guy image for something even weirder and totally out there. Watch for Lenny Clarke and Siobhan Hogan as as pair of squabbling fellow burglars and work from Cam Neely Kevin Chapman and Garry Shandling as well. It's a screwball caper. I love it. Many don't. They can suck it. Check 'er out and make up your own mind.".

No it wouldn't because you've still got that pesky detail of the script. One last thing.  Were I AfricanAmerican or Latino I'd find the film beyond unfunny into offensive.  In the reality of this film anyone of color is also obviously a thief or conman.

He also has to give his lucky ring to Max as he says that it belongs to him to the police. Now Kevin's aim is to get his ring back. Because it was given to him by his girl friend. Unbelievably she gives the ring to him in the very first day they meet. Why is this absurd you may ask? Well because her father gives the ring to her for good luck. She must be hating her father then! As if this is not enough he also tells her that he is a thief and making his living by robbing people. The girl is absolutely fine with it. Well I don't know but if there is a survey only less than 1 of women would be that brave to fall for him ESPECIALLY at the first date. Well film is full with that sort of nonsense. Such a shame that John Leguziamo and Danny DeVito get a negative mark on their CV for Martin Lawrence it is quite okay as his CV is not that brilliant for me. The film was supposed to be a comedy but I don't recall myself even smiling. Such a waste of money!! From now what's the worst that could happen?? Making a sequel of it!!!  out of ".

He is solid comedic genius that brings a great amount of comedy and presence that will leave everyone smiling.Leguizamo has a true niche for comedy as he proves in What's The Worst That Can Happen?

Leguizamo was a great compliment to Lawrence and his brand of humor.

The games set up by the writers were incredible fun to watch since each scene skillfully crafted.Also the audience received a bonus when the writer added action and suspense. Though What's The Worst That Can Happen? succeeds mostly with comedy it also entertains with action and suspense.I knew with scenes like Kevin's taunts to Max over his cellphone while he was in a senate subcommittee What's The Worst That Can Happen? will entertain every single person who buys a ticket for this movie. I could not ask for anything more from the writers of What's The Worst That Could Happen because watching this story play out is a thing of beauty.One solid guarantee I can make to potential viewers of this movie What's The Worst That Could Happen will leave you laughing until it hurts.

The addition of these actors is evidence that What's The Worst That Can Happen? is a sure hit with all ages.Lawrence wears two hats in What's The Worst That Can Happen? as producer and star and he has success in both capacities. Furthermore he was a true asset as an actor in What's The Worst That Can Happen? because he brought a unique brand of humor.His style is one to be proud of because he truly makes the comedy enjoyable and the humor so funny you'll be laughing so hard it will hurt. I appreciate his comedic ability and acting talent.DeVito adds credibility to one truly fun comedy. I couldn't have asked for a better actor to portray Max Fairbanks. There is not a lot to say about DeVito because his lengthy and steady body of work speaks for him. With so many great films under his belt I knew I was going to be watching a true master at work.In addition to credibility DeVito has presence and humor in that made me smile from ear to ear and start to finish. He is solid comedic genius that brings a great amount of comedy and presence that will leave everyone smiling.Leguizamo has a true niche for comedy as he proves in What's The Worst That Can Happen? I wasn't sure how to gage Leguizamo because I have only seen one other film with him so I was surprised to learn he was one of funniest and talented actors in the movie.The chemistry between Lawrence and Leguizamo was perfect because they seemed to work so well together. Leguizamo was a great compliment to Lawrence and his brand of humor. I enjoyed every minute they shared the screen because I knew I was going to laugh.Ejogo was a true pleasure to watch because she brought excitement and charisma to the movie. I relished each scene she was in because I got the opportunity to see a true natural at work. Mac was a true surprise because I didn't expect him to turn in a good performance.The writing in this movie is excellent as it compliments Lawrence's comedy and DeVito's humor. The games set up by the writers were incredible fun to watch since each scene skillfully crafted.Also the audience received a bonus when the writer added action and suspense. Though What's The Worst That Can Happen? succeeds mostly with comedy it also entertains with action and suspense.I knew with scenes like Kevin's taunts to Max over his cellphone while he was in a senate subcommittee What's The Worst That Can Happen? will entertain every single person who buys a ticket for this movie. I could not ask for anything more from the writers of What's The Worst That Could Happen because watching this story play out is a thing of beauty.One solid guarantee I can make to potential viewers of this movie What's The Worst That Could Happen will leave you laughing until it hurts. Lawrence and DeVito are a lethal comedic team that fills the screen with laughter suspense and action. What's The Worst That Can Happen? is one of the most entertaining films I've seen.I hope everyone gets the chance to see how great these two talents come together and create one of the funniest movies this year.";

By the time I had watched it for about my six viewing it had become one of my favorite comedies and definitely my favorite Martin Lawrence or Danny Devito film.

	schema:reviewBody "The High and the Mighty the granddaddy of air disaster movies often falls into almost campy melodrama but under the direction of the legendary 'Wild Bill' Wellman and punctuated by one of Dimitri Tiomkin's most bombastic yet exciting scores earning him an Oscar the film maintains such a level of intensity that it remains constantly entertaining. With John Wayne heading an ensemble cast including several costars from the past as well as personal friends it is certainly an essential for any 'Duke' film library.Produced by WayneFellows Productions and 'owned' eventually by the Wayne family's Batjac Productions along with Hondo McLintock! and Island in the Sky the film was a BIG hit when released and offered one of Wayne's better performances then gained even greater stature as it was unseen for a generation. I've always held the belief that the family planned to release the entire quartet of films in 2007 to mark the centennial of Duke's birth but two events changed the plan first an unauthorized 'remixed' VHS version of McLintock! was released with rumors that a version of Hondo was also in the works forcing Michael Wayne then President of Batjac to release authorized VHS versions of the two films rather than have the market glutted with bad copies second with Michael's death in 2003 the Wayne family rethought the master plan deciding to release the entire collection on DVD earlier. For whatever reason seeing The High and the Mighty again is a cause to celebrate! Based on Ernest K. Gann's bestseller which would inspire Arthur Hailey's later novel Airport the story centers around a routine commercial flight between Honolulu and San Francisco which becomes a lifeanddeath drama when one engine explodes just beyond the 'Point of No Return'. With limited fuel in deteriorating weather the crisis brings out the best and worst in both passengers and crew.Wayne as the copilot is quite good playing a character older than he actually was the role had been written for Spencer Tracy who pulled out just prior to filming Robert Stack almost foreshadows his character in Airplane! as the nononsense pilot who goes ballistic when stressed. For cockpit 'overacting' however the award has to go to Wally Brown as the navigator with his buggedout eyes visions of his shrewish wife and WILDLY unruly hair...While the passengers are all stereotypes several actors are quite good in their roles with standout performances by Claire Trevor and Jan Sterling both Oscarnominated Robert Newton Paul Kelly and Paul Fix. While Phil Harris attempts to inject humor into his role it only works sporadically and Ann Doran as his wife plays 'hysterical' so convincingly that you want to STRANGLE her! Laraine Day thirdbilled and with Trevor a previous Wayne leading lady is remarkably unlikable as a rich wife with a 'bought' husband John Howard Sidney Blackmer plays the 'mandatory' unbalanced type and veteran character actor John Qualen adds another 'ethnic' portrayal to his long list as a Latin family man with a Norwegian accent! A bit of trivia The young boy on board was portrayed by director Wellman's son! Almost as fascinating as the story is seeing how much has changed since the film was released the plane's 'tail' is controlled by pulleys and wires in a rear compartment the sole flight attendant is a stewardess and everyone smokes especially in the cockpit. On a more somber note there is NO security and one passenger boards easily carrying a gun. It is sadly a wiser world today...While no one would ever accuse The High and the Mighty of being a film classic it's role in creating the 'airplane disaster' genre can't be denied and it continues to be a vastly enjoyable John Wayne feature.It's great to have it back!".

	schema:headline " A MISSING JOHN WAYNE CLASSIC";
	schema:reviewBody "It's sad that THE HIGH AND MIGHTY has vanished into thin air.  The Ernest Gann novel was translated into a starfilled drama of the highest degree. This was the first movie I attended upon my return from Korea in l954 and the memory of this movie is still vivid  as is THE QUIET MAN which was one of the last movies I viewed  before leaving for Korea.  As you can see I am an unabashed fan of the Duke and in these two movies he displayed an acting range that had been barely recognized  by the average moviegoer. THE HIGH AND MIGHTY is unique because almost all of the action is inside a stricken luxury airliner and the directorWilliam Wellmanhad the nerve to photograph this action in a widescreen process.  But Wayne as the first officerDan Romanis not the only outstanding character although it is Roman's steadfast belief in his skills and the aircraft that brings the passengers to safety. Robert Stack as the Captain Paul Fix as an aging passenger Phil Harris as a jokester who has just endured a painful vacation in Hawaii with his wife John Howard and Lorraine Day as an atodds married couple David BrianMrD.A. as a man suspected by Sidney Blackmer of being the gentleman in whom Blackmer's wife is having an affair and Doe Avedon as the flight attendant all play major roles in this dated but still relevant movie. But the ladies Claire Trevor and Jan Sterling as hardened women of the evening also bring to us a mix of pathos self doubt and humor.  John Qualen a fixture in a number of John Wayne moviesplays a patented role as a simple fisherman on his way home to his rather large family. Paul Kelly plays a disillustioned scientist. The story of THE HIGH AND MIGHTY written by Ernest Gann is simple A fourengined aircraft bound for San Francisco from Hawaii has an engine explode and hang at a precarious angle from the wing.  The fates  of the passengers are  in the hands of the flight crew headed by Robert Stack. The Wayne character Dan Romanis a  veteran pilot who lost his wife and son in a crash of an airliner he was piloting years before.While the drama is unfolding in the cockpit the passengers review their lives and most make promises to change if they survive. Wayne's character has to convince the captain that they can make  it to the mainland.  The action inside the aircraft is electric  and more exciting that any of the aircraft disaster movies that followed.  Of course John Wayne prevails and the passengers walk off into a rainy San Francisco night to return to the lives they had known before they made their promises.  Dimitri Tiomkin's score is highlighted by threading the familiar HIGH AND MIGHTY theme throughout the movie.  The closing scene is classic Wayne walking with a limp into the foggy evening and whistling the theme. Ernest Gann's novel rings true because of his firsthand knowledge of aviation.  As the author of several flying novels most notably FATE IS THE HUNTER Gann is able to make us understand that flying in those days was a mixture of wisdom experience and a feeling in the seatofthepants.  I give this adaptation the highest marks although the story is dated the characters  are of another age and the formula is now triedandtrue.  But the story does emphasis that there are unseen heroes that walk among us and come forth when needed.How many times did John Wayne portray this character?".

	schema:headline " Fine Characters WellActed Most Realistic Airplane Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Several younger reviewers posing as critics have projected their post1994 angst onto The High and the Mighty. They have tried to make its virtues into defects I suggest because they have failed to understand the normative nonsurreal selfresponsibility requirements that individuals in the 1950s tacitly accepted as their price for exercising U.S. rights under regulation. They also do not understand apparently that this flight was being undertaken as a verylong flight and barely seven years after the end of WWII. One complained that there was talk of disaster from the beginning I found none except some fear on the part of one neurotic passenger. And there is something else that needs to be said about the film. It was directed by William Wellman aviation's greatest champion in Hollywood history. That may be one reason why the resulting film is in my judgment the most realistic portrayal of a 1950s airport airplane crew airplane flight and airplane disasternear disaster film in historyto this day... I flew on prop planes in 1950 this is the real thing. As for the emotional belief that it is corny' its script telegraphs some of its punches concerning passengers' ideas but only the surreal philosophy of statistpostmodernist thinkers could see in this beautifully thoughtout film as anything but what most viewers believe it to bethe very entertaining fictional account of a distrusted loner saving an entire planeload of interesting passengers from a physical disaster to whose impending happening each reacts in his own individual way. The film opens at Honolulu Airport as flight 420 is being readied for takeoff. A succession of passengers come to the desk manned by an airline official and the flight's stewardess so the viewer is thus cleverly allowed to discover a good bit about each one at the same time as do the refreshingly judgmental pair of officers. At the same time we are told the story of niceguy Dan Roman played by John Wayne he was the pilot of a plane that once ran into wind shear the rear of that plane was destroyed on impact. he survived the death of his wife and son to fly again. The list of those aboard is long and fascinating. In addition to cynical young crewman William Campbell uxorious navigator Wally Brown uptight young Robert Stack and Wayne we meet Sidney Blackmer overwrought and insistent ebullient Phil Harris and his wife Ann Doran sensible and prolific Johna Qualen intelligent Claire Trevor Jan Sterling as an aging beauty queen worried about meeting her new mailcontact fiance handsome couple John Smith and Karen Sharpe as newlyweds Paul Fix who is elderly and unflappable Dorothy Chen John Howard flightfearing Robert Newton and his loyal wife lovely Julie Bishop secretkeeping Paul Kelly and dynamic David Brian and a little boy among others. The story develops as the great airplane shudders in midair gradually a crisis develops with an engine losing power. Then it is hit by a bullet and a fire disables it and must be extinguished. The exact number of gallons of highoctane fuel aboard then becomes critical. The threat of a disaster is told in five partsthe inception examinations and worsenings the potential of having to ditch is faced Wayne forces Stack to try for the coast instead of ditching and the final climax plays out as the onshore wind gives them their last chance to make one try at the runwaywith ultimately only 30 gallons of fuel left. As the potential problem develops the passengers and crew must deal with the film's plotthemetaking charge of one's own life one man pulls a gun on the man he suspects of having made love to his wife others have to be stopped from screaming others face issues long put aside others express regrets hopes or fears others demand or ask for information and the crew face their own problems as well. Uniting the whole taut drama is the towering experience calm and underplaying by Wayne and the thinvoice maturity intelligence and normalcy of Doe Avedon as the chief stewardess. The other unusual feature of the film is Wellman's use of extended flashbacks for a number of persons which is a feature that indicates to viewers information as well as passage of time. Here it is used in several innovative waysto indicate character to reinforce dramatic points and to strengthen the presentation of values such as a nuclear scientist's reasons for quitting his job etc. The script for the novel was written by the author of the original novel The High and the Mighty aviation fiction expert Ernest K. Gann. The cinematography was done by Archie J. Stout and the music which uses Wayne whistling the main theme among other presentations was done by Dimitri Tiomkin coauthor of the famous and popular title song which was a hit both with and without lyrics. Among the solid cast also one should note Regis Toomey Laraine Day Douglas Kennedy and Gonzales Gonzales. Among the main characters Wayne David Brian Sindey Blackmer Claire Trevor John Howard Julie Bishop Robert Newton Phil Harris John Qualen and Robert Stack all do standout work. The scene where luggage is jettisoned to lighten the plane the gradual revelation of the aircraft's problems the dialogue sequences and the entire atmosphere of the filmas well as the gripping climactic approach to San Franciscoare all memorable.achievements in my view. Watch for Wayne's explanation that they will probably have to ditch addressed to all the passengers. This is a nearlygreat and unarguably a deservedly popular film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The release of The High and the Mighty coincidentally came out at the same time I Love Lucy shifted it's locale from New York to Hollywood and star crazy Lucy Ricardo was stalking all the big film stars of the day. I still remember when Lucy stole John Wayne's footprints outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre and that never to be forgotten line she said to him about his latest film quoted above.I think a lot of people felt that way about The High and the Mighty. I was lucky to see it when it was broadcast in 1979 the week of the Duke's demise. I had seen it earlier but it has not been broadcast since. And that's a pity because this film is a four star winner in every respect.This was produced by John Wayne as well as starring him and it is the second work he did with director William Wellman. In fact Ernest K. Gann wrote the novel this was based on and he also wrote the book that the WayneWellman combination tackled in their first endeavor Island in the Sky. That too has not been broadcast for years but I've seen it also. In fact if you look at the credits all the Wellman behind the camera crew is virtually the same. One big addition for The High and the Mighty is Dimitri Tiomkin writer of so many wonderful film scores for the Duke and others. Previous to this Tiomkin had done that outstanding score for Red River for Wayne another milestone picture for him. The only Oscar the film won was for it's score. It's one of the great movie themes of all time and not too many people know this but there were lyrics by Ned Washington. The theme was also in the Best Song award category but lost to Secret Love. Probably because I can't recall a vocal recording done of it. Lots of instrumentals though a big seller.In this Grand Hotel cast actresses Claire Trevor and Jan Sterling both got nominated in The Best Supporting Actress category but lost to Eva Marie Saint. It's almost a shame that those two performances got singled out because the whole cast was brilliant. It's always the mark of a good film that even the most minute character roles are fully developed and remembered. Case in point In The High and the Mighty Douglas Fowley as a ground attendant at the beginning of the movie and Pedro GonzalezGonzalez as a ship's radio operator have tiny parts but you will remember both.The plot concerns a flight from Honolulu to San Francisco which develops engine problems and a fuel loss. After that the suspense doesn't let up for one microsecond of film. Lots of flashbacks are well integrated into the plot. Flashbacks about the crew and the passengers. All of their lives are laid bare in brief vignettes. Two passenger performances I liked besides Trevor and Sterling were Paul Kelly as the cynical scientist and Robert Newton as the jaded Broadway producer. The crew of course is headed by Robert Stack as pilot and John Wayne as copilot. In his memoirs Stack said the role of Sullivan was one of his favorites and he paid a heartfelt tribute to producercostar John Wayne. Wayne was a controversial guy most of his costars liked to work with him a few didn't. Stack was one of his biggest boosters as a performer and his tribute to the Duke should be read by all John Wayne fans.Thank the Deity that a new generation of cinema fans will finally get to see John Wayne at his very best as Dan Roman. The unavailability of Island in the Sky and The High and the Mighty have not been good for fans and critics discussing John Wayne's work. His work with both John Ford and Howard Hawks has been rehashed time and again but no one ever talks about his three films with William Wellman which in my book renders all discussions about him as an actor up to now quite pointless. Why he was overlooked in the Oscar sweepstakes that year is a mystery.Wayne had one of the best faces for closeups ever in screen history. Top directors like Ford Hawks and Wellman knew that and used him to best advantage. Both in Island in the Sky and The High and the Mighty Bill Wellman caught a lot of the anguish and determination in closeups that said more than a page of dialog. Both as Dooley in Island in the Sky and as Dan Roman here Wayne plays a character who is not battling bad guys but a bad situation. In both he's the leader of a group of people who's lives are in his hands and he can't show weakness. None of the usual screen fights are in either of his Wellman roles. It's the elements and fear that are the bad guys that have to be licked.It's a pity they didn't do more actordirector classics like these two films Wellman and Wayne. They did work together on Blood Alley but it doesn't hold a candle to the first two films. Bill Wellman actually did work for the Duke once again in a film Wayne produced but did not star in called Goodbye My Lady in 1956. Wellman retired two years later.The High and the Mighty represents an artistic triumph and a commercial one. When it came out John Wayne was at the height of his career in the midst of a string of years as number one at the box office. Catch this film by all means if you can. With it coming out on DVD maybe it will finally be broadcast again on AMC or TCM.".

Dimitri Tiomkin knew exactly how to write for this picture and how to move the audience for without his classic and at times choralaccentuated theme and the rousing orchestral cues throughout this would have been merely a good film rather than the neargreat film that it is. Had it been made this year for example using a contemporary film composer I believe THTM wouldn't carry it off.There doesn't seem to be a replacement for Tiomkin on the horizon and we couldn't afford to lose him. The best lines belong to Jan Sterling that cosmetics scene is still gripping Robert Newton and lovely Claire Trevor and there's a great lowkeyed anticlimactic finale. A Nine from me.".

The widely heterogeneous group of passengers which include a disgruntled man who believes his wife had an affair with one of the other passengers a female who is hoping her man will love her despite her age a couple on the brink of divorce and others have to make the best of their situation and hope its not the last moments they will spend alive. Very good film that took forever to get to DVD but seems to be worth it. Excellent performances by all and Tiomkin's score is excellent and so memorable you'll be whistling or humming it for days. The film like many air disaster epics seems to run a bit too long but there is a lot of emotion to be played out here. Rating 8.".

I know they are waiting for the time when they can squeeze the maximum number of dollars out of it but if they aren't careful they will wait too long and the world will have moved so far beyond the ideas concepts and technology of the 50's that the film will not appeal to the younger generation of purchasers of movies.It's more than just Wayne's performance that is being withheld from the public.  I am also a great admirer of the work of the great British actor Robert Newton and he turned in a marvelous performance here.  So did Jan Sterling Claire Trevor Paul Fix Lorraine Day and all the rest of the cast.  Their fans deserve to see these actors in this film too.  The only actor I could live without is Robert Stack.  He has never done a thing for me.  But the film as a whole is wonderful and should be released...ASAP".

You can't compare movies of that era with this era. If you want movies without clichs then the director screenwriters and actors would have to have much more freedom than was allowed in the 1950s. The censorship boards of that time would not allow certain language in those days. Also remember that movies of that age where much more plot and character driven than today's Special Effects Bonanzas.To me the thing about this movie that made it enjoyable was that there was a certain amount of tension. The script took time to give us some character studies of the passengers. We actually care for some of the passengers at the end of the movie. Any movie that puts you on the end of you seat worrying about the fate of the characters has done its job.So for those of you who nit pick about clichs unbelievable situations melodrama etc. This film was produced as entertainment not as a treatise on believability in movie stories.The main question.....Did this movie entertain.

It was a nice mix of old faces and faces that were new at the time.The High and Mighty is dated now but that's what makes it as interesting today as it was popular in its time. Someday no one will remember that you used to be able to smoke on planes that people waited outside the terminal as the plane landed that your loved ones could accompany you to the gate to see you off and that services on a plane were so personalized.Wayne plays pilot Dan Roman who lost his family in an air disaster where he was at the helm he is second in command to John Robert Stack. The plane is populated with honeymooners John Smith and Karen Sharpe a couple returning from a disastrous vacation Ann Doran and Phil Harris a blonde Jan Sterling who's been around the block going to meet a man she's been corresponding with William Hopper an unhappily married couple Laraine Day and John Howard a child of divorce going to visit his mother a successful businessman David Brian a lonely woman Claire Trevor a frail old man Paul Fix  an assortment of people. In the beginning there are subtle signs that the plane has a malfunction but it later becomes apparent that the plane may have to land in the ocean.Unlike some disaster movies like the recent horror Poseidon we get to know and have feelings for many of these characters as they interact and we learn their stories. Among the most striking performances are those of the women  Sterling Trevor and Day who looks beautiful though her movie star days are past. Sterling has one of the stronger stories  she's 8 years older than the photo she sent the man she's about to meet and she's terrified that he'll reject her. In a stunning moment she removes all of her makeup and says that she will meet him as she is.Even in death John Wayne remains in the top ten box office stars an astounding accomplishment. A controversial figure to say the least he had something that still speaks to the public. I've personally always preferred him out of a cowboy outfit as he is here. There's a solidity about Wayne a nononsense honest delivery tinged with warmth and humor most vividly seen here when he is talking to the passengers about a possible crash landing.For me the film was overly long with possibly the most distracting musical score I've ever heard. The movie also has some slow patches. But it's easy to see why it's so beloved and its downbeat ending is unforgettable. I saw this movie as a child and remembered none of it except the very end.It's a shame that over the years Hollywood has lost the art of the buildup and of storytelling. In a disaster movie the disasters happen much earlier today and the films mostly give us stereotyped characters so we can get right to the special effects. Filmmakers and writers should go back to The High and the Mighty to see how it was done and done well if not perfectly. They had stories and people then.".

Much of what is made today doesn't even stand up against today's low standards.The High and the Mighty actually has a STORY and characters who have conflicts hopes fears and loves.I was a young boy of about six when our family flew the first United Airlines DC7 flight from Honolulu to San Francisco. I can remember what it was like to hang high above the Pacific for many hours with four massive radial engines roaring outside the cabin. This movie captures the realism of such a flight.This movie also brings back memories of how passengers DRESSED UP to fly in those days. The sloppy appearance of today's airline passengers is in marked contrast to the class exhibited by airline passengers of the fifties.I even remember the Honolulu Airport of the early fifties and the look of the counters and can remember the fragrance of fresh flower leis as we walked through the airport. I remember how we walked out into the sunshine to board the plane by climbing steps to the cabin door.Yes this movie is a different world. It's Hawaii as a U.S. Territory as when I lived there. It's a throwback to a time when pilots were fresh from a World War. Men acted more like gentlemen then as they do in this movie and ladies had a lot more class before our modern age made it acceptable for both sexes to be so crass.The writing may seem archaic by modern Hollywood standards but it fit perfectly the era in which it was made and gives us a wonderful glimpse of the beginning of the golden age of commercial aviation.This movie captures all of this brilliantly and provides a complex mix of characters living an ominous threat to their survival.I loved it as a boy and love it now. I bought the Special Edition DVD just recently and love it immensely.It has a lengthy series of featurettes and will surely please lovers of John Wayne and the rest of the cast and of this movie in particular.As an additional footnote I want to add the following In the late 1970's after I received my own private pilot's license and after reading one of Ernest K. Gann's other books I wrote a fan letter to Mr. Gann with my comments about sharing his love of flying. It was simply addressed to him at San Juan Island Washington. I was overjoyed to receive a very nice personal reply from this talented writer of the book and screenplay The High and the Mighty. He was a brilliant writer and his writing really captured the essence of flying in those golden years.".

The 2year best seller written by Ernest K Gann blasts to the screen with every kind of love  thrills  and intrigue .

Wellman however overrode his producer and chose Stack for the part loses his nerve but copilot named Dan Roman John Wayne gets to bring the plane in safely . Meanwhile  the passengers are helped by a flight attendant named Lydia Rice Laraine Day but suffer every range of problems and remember by means of flashbacks  such as May Holst Claire Trevor  Clara Joseph Ann Doran  Jose Locota John Qualen  Frank Briscoe Paul Fix  Gustave Pardee Robert Newton Ed Joseph Phil Harris and Sally McKee Jan Sterling reportedly shaved her eyebrows for her role in the film and they never grew back  among others . The airplane heading to San Francisco from Hawaii has a dangerous journey . The picture contains drama  suspense  moderate tension and is quite entertaining although with some flaws and gaps . Plastic acting and stock characters detailing a hectic flight . The film is detailing hectic flighty piloted by a nervous pilot and the relationship among passengers . All clichd and stock roles with regurgitation of all usual stereotypical situations from disaster films . John Wayne's role was first offered to Spencer Tracy. However Tracy a liberal Democrat who fiercely opposed the blacklisting of alleged subversives in Hollywood that was rampant at the time wanted nothing to do with Wayne an archconservative Republican who strongly supported blacklisting and whose Batjac company was producing the film and turned the part down. Filmmaker Wellman was an expert pilot  as during his World War I service as an aviator and shooting various pictures about aviation theme such as Wings The young eagles Central airport  Island in the Sky and Lafayette Escadrille . In the 1950s Wellman's best later films starred John Wayne including this influential aviation picture for which he achieved his third and last best director Oscar nomination . Colourful cinematography and final film of veteran cinematographer Archie Stout  furthermore cameraman helper William Clothier  being John Wayne's first film in CinemaScope. Emotive as well as unforgettable musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin  the lyrics to the famed title song are only heard at the very end are sung by a large choral group. This oldfashioned motion picture was professionally directed by William A Wellman . He was called Wild Bill during his World War I service as a pilot  a nickname that persisted in Hollywood due to his largerthanlife personality and lifestyle . Wellman was an expert in all kind of genres as Gangster drama  Film Noir  Western and adept at comedy as he was at macho material  helming the original  A star is born 1937 for which he won his only Oscar for best original story and the biting satire Nothing sacred 1937  both of which starred Fredric March for producer David O. Selznick . Both movies were dissections of the fame game as was his satire Roxie Hart 1942 which reportedly was one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films. During World War Two Wellman continued to make outstanding films including OxBow incident 1943 and Story of G.I.Joe1945 and after the war he turned out another war classic Battleground 1949. His final film hearkened back to his World War One service The Lafayette squadron 1958 which featured the unit in which Wellman had flown . He retired as a director after making the film reportedly enraged at Warner Bros.' postproduction tampering with a movie that meant so much to him .".

However Tracy a liberal Democrat who fiercely opposed the blacklisting of alleged subversives in Hollywood that was rampant at the time wanted nothing to do with Wayne an archconservative Republican who strongly supported blacklisting and whose Batjac company was producing the film and turned the part down. Filmmaker Wellman was an expert pilot  as during his World War I service as an aviator and shooting various pictures about aviation theme such as Wings The young eagles Central airport  Island in the Sky and Lafayette Escadrille . In the 1950s Wellman's best later films starred John Wayne including this influential aviation picture for which he achieved his third and last best director Oscar nomination . Colourful cinematography and final film of veteran cinematographer Archie Stout  furthermore cameraman helper William Clothier  being John Wayne's first film in CinemaScope. Emotive as well as unforgettable musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin  the lyrics to the famed title song are only heard at the very end are sung by a large choral group. This oldfashioned motion picture was professionally directed by William A Wellman . He was called Wild Bill during his World War I service as a pilot  a nickname that persisted in Hollywood due to his largerthanlife personality and lifestyle . Wellman was an expert in all kind of genres as Gangster drama  Film Noir  Western and adept at comedy as he was at macho material  helming the original  A star is born 1937 for which he won his only Oscar for best original story and the biting satire Nothing sacred 1937  both of which starred Fredric March for producer David O. Selznick . Both movies were dissections of the fame game as was his satire Roxie Hart 1942 which reportedly was one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films. During World War Two Wellman continued to make outstanding films including OxBow incident 1943 and Story of G.I.Joe1945 and after the war he turned out another war classic Battleground 1949. His final film hearkened back to his World War One service The Lafayette squadron 1958 which featured the unit in which Wellman had flown . He retired as a director after making the film reportedly enraged at Warner Bros.' postproduction tampering with a movie that meant so much to him .";

SHAME ON THEM!!!!They are hiding a priceless treasure from all of us. THIS IS JOHN WAYNES FINEST FILM EVER!!!!He won an Academy Award for True Grit and should have won one for his portrayal of Dan Roman in this film. In 1988 they rereleased The Manchurian Candidate so that a whole new generation of film goers could enjoy its greatness. They should do the same to this film. They should get the finest film technicians available to do a restoration of it and release it so that people today could see what a great film is.

	schema:reviewBody "I went to the DVD premiere screening of THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY tonight 12 June 2005 at Paramount studios. It was a big redcarpet event and I saw a number of people associated with the film there though there are a scant handful of the cast still surviving. Pedro GonzalezGonzalez William Campbell and Robert Easton were there and from bits of applause during the screening I suspect that a few others were there as well. Of course all of the major character players are gone Wayne Stack Trevor Day Sterling Harris Newton Brian Kelly Blackmer and Qualen. Other than Karen Sharpe and William Schallert I'm not certain whether anyone yet unmentioned is still alive. Doe Avedon probably is she was really lovely as the flight attendant.As some have speculated there's no way for this film to live up to the hype that has grown up because of its nearforty year unavailability. It's been beautifully restored. The picture quality seems to my uneducated eye to be impeccable and the sound is really magnificent. And there are some moments of nice performance particularly by Wayne Robert Stack Jan Sterling and John Qualen. But as much as I would love to say this is a resurrected masterpiece it simply isn't possible for me to do so honestly. After AIRPLANE! I'm not sure it's reasonable to expect people to take a Fifties airliner disaster movie seriously. But the level of corn and hokum and treacle and syrup in which the film wallows especially in the primary sections dealing with the passengers rather than the crew is simply intolerable in today's world. I'm not referring to the fact that it's a different practical world now one in which it would be ludicrous to show a passenger pulling a gun on another passenger on an airliner of today. I'm referring rather to the simple unbelievability of the human behavior exhibited. I'm willing to accept a passenger getting aboard a transPacific airliner with a gun in his pocket in 1954. I'm not willing to accept him pulling that gun threatening other passengers with it having it taken from him and later having it handed back to him just because he says I'm all right now I've calmed down. Phil Harris fifty at the time and looking sixty plays a 38yearold and 43yearold Ann Doran plays his 30yearold wife. Laraine Day berates her husband and demands a divorce and good ol' Phil says to the husband You think you got problems? and proceeds to tell him about how rain and crummy hotels ruined his vacation and the husband John Howard thus sees his own life in a new perspective. Every clich imaginable comes into play and rarely is there a moment that can be easily swallowed even with Herculean efforts to place oneself mentally in the zeitgeist of the film.Only in the cockpit are things comparatively realistic and believable and even there big pills must be swallowed. One of the reasons John Wayne comes off so well in this film is he has relatively little to say. It's probably the lowest linecount of any of Wayne's leading roles and thus unsaddled with the maudlinities and sappiness of the dialog the passengers are stuck with he comes off better than anyone in the picture. Spencer Tracy was supposed to play Wayne's role but turned it down according to various stories either because he thought the script was lousy or he didn't want to work for taskmaster William Wellman. I'm betting on the former reason.There are still things to like in THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY Dimitri Tiomkin's Oscarwinning score among them but an awful lot of people have been waiting forty years to see this masterwork again and an awful lot of them are going to be either seriously disappointed or forced to convince themselves that it's not as bad as it seems.".

It is a pity that his talents were not more appreciated but then most people think that anyone can whistle a sonorous tune. Far from it! Very few people could whistle in orchestral color and range which is what this man did for Dimitri Tiomkin's wonderful score which well deserved the 1955 Academy Award for Best Music and Scoring. Yes John Wayne did indeed make the film his own and turned in a multilayered performance and yes this is the granddaddy of the 'disaster films' which has never been surpassed in quality but its distinction is not the primacy nor the casting nor even the story by a professional pilot but the distinctive music  distinctly rendered  which one may not notice at first but which imbues this nonepic with the caliber of stardom.I can remember when I was in high school in the '60s some ten years after the movie was released I have never seen it since and Mr. Marcellino was a guest at one of our assemblies and demonstrated his amazing versatility at whistling and even performed the letters of the alphabet as an example of how he had mastered his craft. His range was phenomenal as he portrayed the instruments of the orchestra and then performed the entire Rhapsody in Blue as well as popular works all by whistling without accompaniment but admitted that the theme for THTM was his proudest achievement. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has never recognized the contributions of all musical forms to the success of pictures as gauged from their mention in passing at the annual telecast Oscar ceremonies but if they had this singular performance would have been guaranteed a Special Oscar. Truly once it is heard neither it nor the film can ever be forgotten but will haunt one for years to come! This classic film is the fitting epitaph for Messrs. Wayne Tiomkin and Marcellino.

	schema:reviewBody "William A. Wellman's The High  The Mighty 1954 might very well be called the 'Grand Hotel' of the wild blue yonder. For it stacks a commercial airliner with an all star crew and passenger list then forces everyone to interact when a midair malfunction puts everyone's life in peril. Top billed is legendary hero John Wayne as copilot Dan Roman. Seems Roman is living with demons of a fiery plane crash lurking just beneath the surface. The pilot John Sullivan Robert Stack is a stoic troubled and neurotic mess who eventually has a complete melt down  forcing Roman to rise to the occasion take over and land the plane safely. Ah but will he? The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of forgotten or nearly forgotten character actors including Sidney Blackmere Laraine Day Phil Harris and Claire Trevor. Despite being one of the most sought after titles requested by DVD consumers the film is really little more than a sensationalist precursor to the highly popular 70s disaster series Airport. The one curiosity of this disc is that it is a Warner Brothers film presented by Paramount DVD. Apparently a rights issue has allowed the copyright to lapse in the latter's favor.Advertised as meticulously restored the transfer represented on this disc is something of a disappointment to the expectation of pristine image quality. Although the DVD starts out relatively strong with a very bright and strongly contrasted print element it quickly degrades into various levels of quality  the worst being near the end of the film when the plane makes its emergency landing in Frisco. In those final reels the image is overly soft exhibits some minor edge enhancement and even has a touch of color bleeding. Throughout flesh tones are not very accurate at all an inherent flaw of all WarnerColor film stock of the period they're either excessively pink or a flat orange. Most of the color spectrum tends to mute along a greenish gray hazy brown balance. At times contrast levels can seem a tad pasty. Blacks are rarely deep or solid. Whites are bluish or yellowish but never a true white. Transitions between scenes exhibit the inherent flaw of all early Cinemascope transfers with momentary blooming of excessive film grain. Yes compared to the way this film has looked on television this disc is a resounding improvement. But it does not come anywhere near to the level of quality one would expect from a disc advertised as 'restored and remastered.' The audio is a 5.1 attempt at recapturing the original six track stereo but it's generally strident and not very natural sounding at all. Extras are too numerous to go into any great detail. There's an overkill of featurettes and newly created documentaries a bunch of vintage material stills gallery and theatrical trailers comprehensive to say the very least.".

	schema:headline " That Majestic Theme Song";
	schema:reviewBody "Has there ever been a more majestic film score? Slightly melancholy and beautifully haunting Dimitri Tiomkin's Academy Award winning music gives us a grand and expansive auditory experience comparable perhaps to what a soaring eagle must feel in its own way as it glides high above a landscape of the mundane and the mediocre.In the early 50s people were just getting used to the idea that they could climb aboard a big manmade eagle and soar above cars buses and trains. It was a thrilling but scary idea not unlike traveling on the Titanic. And so with The High And The Mighty Hollywood created the first big budget movie that conveyed the idea of risk in commercial air travel. Throughout the film the overriding emotion is insecurity not only among passengers but among the crew as well. Since the film was a cinematic prototype I can see how its nervewracking story would appeal to moviegoers of that era. The film's angelic theme music thus provided inspiration to help viewers overcome their fear of something new and different something potentially life threatening.Since the early 50s air travel has lost its sense of adventure. The film to us seems quaint and dated. What seemed odd to me for example was the ticket counter. The pace was leisurely and the attention was very personal. Then on board the plane the stewardess made sure that the passengers got personalized attention. At one point even the captain upon request reassured a nervous passenger. Those were the days.First time viewers also need to be aware that this film is talky and dreamily melodramatic. The emphasis is on story and acting not special effects or highpowered action. And then there is that final Act. It is different perhaps from what most of us probably would expect. But again we must take into account the era in which the film was made.Fifty years after its release The High And The Mighty as a film cannot compete with its own theme music. The sweeping orchestration like music generally transcends time and spans the generations. By contrast technology and mankind's reaction to technology changes. The film's story thus has a different meaning to us than it did to the original moviegoers. If you can place the film in its proper historic context you have a better chance of appreciating the film for what it was then not for what it is now.".

Slightly melancholy and beautifully haunting Dimitri Tiomkin's Academy Award winning music gives us a grand and expansive auditory experience comparable perhaps to what a soaring eagle must feel in its own way as it glides high above a landscape of the mundane and the mediocre.In the early 50s people were just getting used to the idea that they could climb aboard a big manmade eagle and soar above cars buses and trains. It was a thrilling but scary idea not unlike traveling on the Titanic. And so with The High And The Mighty Hollywood created the first big budget movie that conveyed the idea of risk in commercial air travel. Throughout the film the overriding emotion is insecurity not only among passengers but among the crew as well.

The recent DVD release remedies that and presents this near classic fully restored and uncut. I say near classic because although the film is an exciting and well acted drama it is nonetheless a little dated and predictable.The story involves the flight of a plane load of passengers from Honolulu to San Francisco. Along the way one of the engines fail and it becomes questionable as to whether the plane will make to San Francisco or have to be ditched in the open sea. The crux of the film is how the crew and the passengers react and interact with each other in dealing with the emergency.Climbing aboard are the crew Pilot John Sullivan Robert Stack Copilot Dan Roman John Wayne Second Officer Wheeler William Campbell Navigator Lenny Wilby Wally Brown and Stewardess Miss Spalding Doe Avedon. Sullivan is a capable pilot but can he handle the emergency he faces? Roman is an experienced pilot who was involved in a plane crash from which only he survived and where he lost his wife and child.The passenger list includes Claire Trevor as May Holst a past her prime actress David Brian as Ken Childs a womanizing executive who is attracted to May. Sidney Blackmer plays Agnew who has a score to settle with Childs. John Qualen plays Lacota who keeps an eye on Agnew. Jan Sterling is Sally McKee an aging former beauty queen who is going to meet her pen pal lover William Hopper but is unsure of how he will perceive her.Laraine Day and John Howard play Lydia and Howard Rice she an heiress and he the husband trying to make it on his own terms. Phil Harris and Ann Doran are the hapless Ed and Clara Joseph returning from a disastrous second honeymoon Robert Newton and Julie Bishop as the Pardees he a self centered theatrical man and she his skeptical wife. John Smith and Karen Sharpe are the newlywed Milo and Nell Buck and Paul Fix is Frank Briscoe a man preparing to die until he meets the quiet and unassuming Dorothy Chen Joy Kim with whom he strikes up a new friendship. Young Michael Wellman the son of Director William Wellman rounds out the passenger list as Toby Field a little boy on his way to meet his mother.Others in the rather large cast are Pedro GonzolesGonzoles as a ship board radio operator George Chandler as an airport mechanic Douglas Fowley as a ticket agent Regis Toomey William Schallert Douglas Kennedy and Robert Easton as various airport officials Carl Alfalfa Switzer as a Coast Guard Copilot Walter Reed as the young boy's father and Phil Van Zandt and Dorothy Ford as the annoying couple who ruin the Joseph's holiday.This film was one of the early Cinemascope features. Director William Wellman uses the entire frame effectively and avoids close ups as much as possible. He keeps the story moving and provides us with several subplots among the characters. It was one of the first airline disaster movies and certainly the first in Cinemascope and color.The DVD contains several behind the scenes documentaries hosted by Leonard Maltin and an interesting feature commentary with Maltin and William Wellman Jr. with contributions from cast members Karen Sharpe and Pedro GonzolesGonzoles.".

It's not terrible but there aren't even pretensions here of greatness beyond the title. John Wayne? He's fun to see without a cowboy hat and he's got great presence but don't expect much from him either.This is a classic ship of fools story that has an early Hollywood example in the 1939 Stagecoach which featured Wayne and another costar here Claire Trevor. In that fashion which involves each character being defined and contrasted to the others in a moment of crisis the story is one about psychology more than survival. Who will be strong who will be the threat and what skeletons will come from which closets?Or that's the general idea of these kinds of plots. Here nothing much will turn up on any of these fronts. In the sad decline of Hollywood through the 1950s as writers left for t.v. and money grew thin stories like these and filming decisions like shooting a whole movie inside a plane cheap and effective throw some limitations in our face. Director William Wellman is one of the stalwarts of Old Hollywood and he's done a competent job herethe pacing and the overall feel of things is reasonable if not special. The producers include Wayne himself and it's got to be tricky when the money for the director and crew is coming from the leading actor. Both cast and crew were miserable about shooting conditions cold outside cramped inside. And the cinematographer struggled to make the widescreen shooting work in the tight space.So why watch this? Why indeed! The movie has some fans but even praise is usually mixed with misgivings. The movie did undergo an expensive restoration Wayne as producerowner of the film had kept the original himself and it was damaged in storage. The score by Tiomkin is overbearing but it won an Oscar all the same. You can look for Robert Stack as pilot and recall that he revisited that role in the spoof Airplane!You might even remember the source and inspiration for Airplane! as the forgotten 1957 Zero Hour! note they even kept the exclamation point which is also a flawed but certainly more exciting film than The High and the Mighty.

It's an ensemble cast of stereotypes the faded beauty the young couple the Asian immigrant the bloviated Englishman the unflappable stewardess the shrewish wife etc. To fill time I guess we get waaaay to many details into all their private lives. Phil Harris reliving his ruined Hawaiian vacation of a lifetime is particularly worthless. Others have rightly pointed out how one passenger fires his pistol at another  and nothing is done about it! Another passenger takes the gun then later gives it back?? But this flying soap opera is only part of the problem. Potemkin hammers overly dramatic melodies at every opportunity. The angle of a sailor on a ship relaying message is totally unnecessary. It seems like the whole West Coast scrambles when the plane issues a mayday  accompanied by more dramatic tunes.Perhaps the worst part is the handling of the emergency itself. The passengers remain totally calm and cooperative. There's little actual drama to it. Endless shots of the plane flying through stormy skies  and yet none while flying over San Francisco?? 1950s aviation may have been different but I cannot believe it was solely the pilot's discretion to keep flying right over a major city with a crippled aircraft that by their own calculation was already out of fuel! There's hardly any communication with the tower on this. But they'll make it because well because John Wayne knows they will. His If we can just make it for 30 more seconds. utterance tells you how poorly the sense of suspense was handled.The epilogue sums it up how bad this film was. The plane taxis right up to the terminal like nothing happened. Each passenger dramatically exits onebyone as the score blares away breezing through the press and marching off to a better and brighter future. Even the little boy who slept through it all. How about waking him up to handle the expected crash landing? The one ?! airline official stoically puffs his stogie. The crew finally exits spiffed up like it'd been a normal flight. No reports? No debrief? No nothing? Nope just an I'll call you. The best that can be said about this film is that it was the original airplane disaster film. Fans of Airplane! should definitely watch as it borrowed heavily from this particularly the overlydramatic utterances of Stack aka Rex Kramer.I want these 2.5 hours of my life back.".

The head stewardess not being chauvinistic  they were called stewardessess back then mentioned that they'd be flying around 67 thousand feet. That's accurate as the DC4 had no pressurization. Since the DC6 which was pressurized and could fly higher was introduced in '48 it was very commonplace by '54. My theory is that the airlines and Douglas Aircraft lobbied 20th Century Fox to use an old plane lest the flying public worry that the current DC6s were subject to such failure.

When Sid Blackmer shot his gun and the engine caught fire why was he not roped and gagged? When the plane finally did land why was he not turned in and then arrested?

The kidnappers demand a fifty million euro ransom. In order to prove they are serious they cut off one of his fingers. What follows is a terrifying sparring match between kidnappers police and the board of the company of which Graff is the director. The main question for the board is a human life worth more than fifty million euros? Will they be able to get that amount of money together in time anyway? While they decide this he degenerates physically and mentally in imprisonment. In the meantime the press dredges up the businessman's past with revelations that are especially painful for his wife.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Belgianborn Lucas Belvaux who began his career by running away to Paris and becoming an actor has over 45 TV and film acting credits and is in the cast most recently of Robert Gudiguian's Army of Crime. As a director he's best known for his Trilogy three films with interlocking stories and characters each filmed in a different genre. CavaleOn the Run is a 'policier' or thriller 'Un couple patant''A Terrific Couple' is a comedy 'Aprs la vie''After Life' is a melodrama. For this nowfamous project Belvaux won the Prix LouisDelluc in 2003.'Rapt' is a thriller and an elegantlooking and beautifully made one that is both breathtaking and thoughtprovoking. It stars a riveting Yvan Attal a hot actor this year who also stars in another highenergy 2010 RendezVous with French Cinema film Cdric Kahn's amour fou tale 'Regrets.' Through the course of 'Rapt' one is drawn into a closer and closer identification with Attal's character and his complex disturbing very modern fate.The English word 'rapt' of the title used for this Frenchlanguage film carries with it a hint of shock. It's meant in its basic sense of transported carried away. It sounds like raped. It's more arresting and harsh than the French word for kidnapping 'enlev.' The subject is just that the kidnapping of a rich and powerful corporate head so high up he deals directly with officials of the French government on a daytoday basis. At first the movie promises to be a conventional thriller rich guy held for ransom bargaining tension threats  and the diminutive swarthy Attal doesn't seem totally convincing as Stanislas Graff a mover and shaker of the French establishment. What's he running around about? The rapid sequence of opening scenes also fails to define fully who exactly Graff is whether government or business. His being constantly called Prsident throughout may confuse us as American viewers. But it doesn't hurt the film too much for his identity to be somewhat generic.This is because once Graff is captured things become much more convincing and spoiler! after he's released things become interesting and surprising. 'Rapt' is another stunning example like Guillaume Canet's 2006 starstudded version of the Harlen Coben novel 'Tell No One' that the French now can do American thrillers better than Hollywood giving a spin to them that's both classic and fresh. Belvaux's ingenious film succeeds very economically  without money wasted on explosions or special effects  both as an intense nailbiter and as a tale that reaches for the philosophical and heroic. He's very high up very powerful but he's also someone those closest to him hardly know. The kidnapping of Stnaslas Graff is seen as a primal trauma that alters his life and his family's company's perhaps his culture's equilibrium irrevocably. Nothing can be done to go back and nothing can ever be the same in Graff's world again.Graff's chauffeurdriven car is stopped he's carried away and he's very rapidly hidden away terrified humiliated hurt and mutilated. A finger is sent off to prove the kidnappers really have him. The confinement goes through stages. At first he's continually masked and not allowed to look in the face of the also masked guardians and he must hover in a tiny tent inside some vast abandoned prison complex or factory. Later he's moved elsewhere fed properly talked to pleasantly allowed to move around in a cell and his chief kidnapper still masked lets him look. Meanwhile frantic activity goes on in Paris. The ransom demanded is 50 million euros. His family can't access his money. His company agrees to advance a sum no more then 20 million. Later it goes higher.The police enter the picture massively but against the wishes of the company and Graff's attorney an elegant black man Matre Walser Alex Descas of '35 Shots of Rum' also in 'The Limits of Control'. The rest is a story of warring forces and shifting loyalties with female family members Anne Consigny Franoise Fabian Sarah Messens as loyal mother and reproachful wife and daughter tested by revelations of Graff's secret life his gambling debuts at poker and the casino his mistresses and posh glass hideaway above Paris. All this is now published in the magazines and tabloids. It's even suggested by people in the company and the police that Graff could have contrived the kidnapping to settle his debts. His influence at the company is seriously dented and during the two months of his confinement the interim CEO gains power. When it's all over Graff has only his red setter to love him and to love. And yet there is a rebirth. But it may be illusory.'Rapt' carries its story beyond the conventional climax into a kind of heroic struggle for identity and power a drama of the essential loneliness of man and the dominance of image in the modern world. Some of the speeches in the last segment might come from a contemporary version of Corneille or Racine. Attal is remarkable suffering Christlike in confinement also resembling the death mask of Marcel Proust then reborn fiery but surrounded by confining police protectors and intimate betrayers of trust so his freedom seems anything but that and the real brutality may be in release the real prisons wealth power and fame. But it's not that simple Rapt isn't preachy or tendentious it supplies you with a damn good time but leaves you pondering. It may be a better film than it seems or even than its makers realized. In his famous Trilogy Belvaux played with genres. Here he uses a single genre to transcend genre. Like Cantet's Tell No One this plays very well as a mainstream film but is much more.'Rapt' opened in Paris November 18 2009 to very good reviews shown at the RendezVous with French Cinema at Walter Reade Theater and IFC Center New York March 2010.".

Compared to American Hollywood kidnapping scenarios that Mel Gibson movie comes to mind this makes the Hollywood versions ridiculous. But at least the Hollywood intention to entertain to create high drama is fulfilled. Here in Rapt we are not actually ever rapt that is suspended in some kind of riveted attention. If you sort of know this isn't your kind of movie I'd skip it. If you do like very realistic crime films that are made with great attention and lots of empty spaces at least psychically then you might well really like this. In the details I found the conversations between the family and cops trying to rescue him really dull and not quite believable and I found the scenes where the hostage takers were roughing up the hostage too prolonged and unnecessary. This alone dragged the whole experience down. For me.It's worth noting that the movie scored many awards in France and that the Rotten Tomatoes rating is really high for it. The IMDb rating seems more in line to me for now about 6.7 at the time of this writing.".

In the details I found the conversations between the family and cops trying to rescue him really dull and not quite believable and I found the scenes where the hostage takers were roughing up the hostage too prolonged and unnecessary. This alone dragged the whole experience down. For me.It's worth noting that the movie scored many awards in France and that the Rotten Tomatoes rating is really high for it. The IMDb rating seems more in line to me for now about 6.7 at the time of this writing.";

Did you miss the part at the end where his attorney told him several times how rich he was. The guy didn't GIVE his stock to the company...He SOLD the stock to them. So he surely could still pay the ransom.Whether he paid the ransom or not and if he did pay it did that leave him completely broke? ....is unknown..But I think the ransom amount 20million to be paid at calypso was exactly how much he was worth...The end point is that he basically lost everything  his job his wife his reputation...and assuming he paid the ransom  his wealth as well... So he was left with nothing other than himself alive...And probably feeling quite lucky to have that. It's all we really ever have for sure until we die...All the other stuff is just a bonus.".

It is based on the true story of the 1978 kidnapping of French industrialist EdouardJean Empain a millionaire playboy who is abducted and held for ransom for 60 days. Though it is a very fine thriller of the kidnappingransom genre this film is far more than that. It is an exploration of the lives of men of wealth who allow their moneyed status to be able to buy anything behave in any way they wish and trample lives of family and friends in the process. Is it a pretty picture to follow? No certainly not but it is a revealing fact that a crime of kidnapping can be secondary to a life of greed and consumption of power and money that feeds into lives such as the main character of this film and the governmental agencies to respond differently to these moneyed moguls.Stanislaff Graff Yvan Attal in a mesmerizing role is the wealthy industrialist married to the beautiful and wise Franoise Anne Consigny and also has a lover. He is kidnapped brutally from his limousine on the eve of his visit to China as part of the entourage of the French president. The kidnappers treat Graff cruelly keeping him blindfolded and tied in a tiny tent in a dungeon of a basement they demand a fifty million euro ransom. As an acct of proving their serious plot they cut off one of his fingers. What follows is a terrifying sparring match between kidnappers police and the board of the company of which Graff is the director. The main question for the board is a human life worth more than fifty million euros? Will they be able to get that amount of money together in time anyway? While they decide this he degenerates physically and mentally in imprisonment. After sixty days Graff is released to a world now cognizant of his secret life of gambling and escapades and secret apartments that the press dredges up revelations that are especially painful for his wife. Paying his ransom won't bury his secrets.This film was written and directed by Lucas Belvaux who presents his story with more emphasis on subterfuge and the psychological aspects of the affair that may make the film seem slow moving 125 minutes but at film's end we realize that the true crime is not so much that of the kidnapransom but the abuse of power and money when so many in the world are suffering from homelessness and hunger and foreclosures etc. The drama is significantly heightened by the work of cinematographer Pierre Milon and the moody musical score by Riccardo Del Fra. This is a demanding film but an important one and the acting of everyone in the large cast is on the highest level  especially the stunning performances by Yvan Attal and Anne Consigny. Grady Harp".

Not the sort of example of humanity that is gratifying to see however.The main character's kidnapping and two months in captive isolation are essentially a metaphor for his own solitary confinement in his cold narcissism. He is no less his own prisoner than if he had contrived the kidnapping himself as the police have reason to suspect.When his wife and daughters seek some sort of contact and contrition from him for the fact that his betrayals are now a matter of public disgrace he quite coldly declares that it is himself alone who deserves pity and solace and that he will explain to no one. His faithful dog is treated with more affection and care.You would naively think that his ordeal would effect some sort of transformation of his personality. Sorry personalities especially this kind do not change so easily. He loses one of his fingers but otherwise is intact. Want some cheap symbolism? The finger is gone but he easily lights up that big cigar of selfindulgence. He knows and we know that the kidnappers have left him with a means not just to satisfy them with his money but to do the right thing in preventing the further violent mayhem they threaten. Innocents will be killed at random. He does have the money his shares of the company have been sold and his lawyer congratulates him for how extremely wealthy he still is. The kidnappers want their full 50 million.The film ends perfectly I think. He sits alone in his palatial room on a regal chair with his cigar. His wife is divorcing him his daughters have been distanced by his coldness and empty claim of love. The Calypso message arrives. He sits.

Equally Stan's daughters played by Julie Kaye and Sarah Messens show themselves to be more concerned with their mother or themselves.Stan's business associates and socalled friends also bring similar attitudes to bear. When things get tough for them as they try to keep the company running while Stan is held to ransom the financial aspects of the company and its survival gradually predominate. Add to that mix are the revelations about Stan's infidelities and gambling debts that begin to surface in the press.All in all the film is therefore a study of what type of character lies beneath all the facades when emotions needs and tensions run amok. Ironically one of the most sympathetic characters is the kidnapperincharge  the only person who tries to make Stan's ordeal less terrifying that it could have been although it's terrifying enough for most viewers.As expected the production is classy faultless wellpaced although some will disagree appropriately suspenseful and thoroughly entertaining. The scenes containing the police action reaction replanning and shadowing of kidnappers attempting to pick up the ransom are riveting.It's the ending though that will puzzle many enrage others or like myself raise the possibility of an entirely different interpretation to the one that seems to be the case. Watching and listening carefully to what is done and said will reveal for you I think what truly happened. If you see the movie you'll know what I mean.Like Anthony Zimmer 2005 in which Yvan Attal also starred Rapt is another excellent thriller with twists that match and perhaps surpass the former. So do yourself a favor and wrap your mind around Rapt. And let us all hope that neither Hollywood nor others try to produce another take.Give this a nine for sure.June 7 2012".

After breakfast with his wife Franoise Anne Consigny and teenaged daughters Stan is kidnapped on his way to work in broad daylight and his misfortune holds him his family and his businessRapt. Belgian writerdirector Lucas Belvaux latest isn't the typical thriller one might expect. Stan may occupy and move in elevated social circles but when he's snatched from his everyday life those who interact with him every day find that they didn't really know him at all. Business and personal relationships shift and slide and when Stan finally comes homea shell of his former self the old adage about dog being man's best friend is proved once again. All these shifting loyalties are what make Rapt so compelling. After his highprofile kidnapping the media uncovers his playboy lifestyleand his wife Franoise Graff is shown the apartment where he met his girls on the side. There's an acknowledgement that she knew something of this before but being the wife of such a man she couldn't bring herself to do anything about it at least not while the money was still good Something the film implies in one of its only attempts to understand the workings and motivations of its characters.

After breakfast with his wife Franoise Anne Consigny and teenaged daughters Stan is kidnapped on his way to work in broad daylight and his misfortune holds him his family and his businessRapt. Belgian writerdirector Lucas Belvaux latest isn't the typical thriller one might expect. Stan may occupy and move in elevated social circles but when he's snatched from his everyday life those who interact with him every day find that they didn't really know him at all. Business and personal relationships shift and slide and when Stan finally comes homea shell of his former self the old adage about dog being man's best friend is proved once again. All these shifting loyalties are what make Rapt so compelling. After his highprofile kidnapping the media uncovers his playboy lifestyleand his wife Franoise Graff is shown the apartment where he met his girls on the side. There's an acknowledgement that she knew something of this before but being the wife of such a man she couldn't bring herself to do anything about it at least not while the money was still good Something the film implies in one of its only attempts to understand the workings and motivations of its characters.

That does not mean American North American that is audiences won't 'get it' but it does imply many of you reading this review may be disappointed by the movie if what you were hoping to watch was another kidnapping for ransom movie as advertised that it simply is not.In my opinion the film is a work of art in the way the characters are brought to the audience one thin layer at the time there are many layers peeled away during the kidnapping for ransom in progress. Like the movie Proof of Life the story takes place over a long period of time compared to most all other ransom movies that is the first of many elements that make the picture feel so real. In order to achieve its goal the real drama experienced by the key characters the pace has to be slow at times so we can focus on the players. I could swear the director has studied magic who knows I did not bother to check.The movie ends most abruptly if you are not peeking at your watch. I felt shortchanged for a minute after the movie ended before I realized the point of the movie was not at all what I had fooled myself in believing. Yes it's true many French movies like this one dare to make you think even after the movie is over. What you get is not what you see but what you look for. A celebrated French author wrote long ago Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add but when there is nothing left to take away and this movie says a whole lot with relatively speaking very little fanfare.At the end of the movie I cursed it for a few seconds then rewinding it at warp speed in my mind played it back in much the same manner over a nice cup of coffee I concluded it was brilliant. Yvan Attal delivers as usual a flawless performance it is not easy to capture both the sympathy and contempt of the viewer in the same movie but he did here. What few action scenes are needed for the kidnapping story to unfold the movie did not quibble and delivered. The way the movie ends will have you conjuring up several more scenes to suit your idea of what should have been the better ending but there isn't a better more purposeful ending that sort of thing reminded me of a style more popular in French movies of a few generations ago but it is still effective today. Enough said you know by now if it is the kind of movie for you.".

I live in a town where football is the main local religion. Nick Hornby's novel was a delight to read and really gave me some sense of the psychology as well as the anthropology of being a fan. I rented the movie because I wanted to SEE the novel the stadium the terraces the colors the craziness Hornby describes. Youtube and Wikipedia could tell me some about Alan Smith Highbury the Hillsborough tragedy but not enough. The movie came through. Actual footage of games and scenes inside the stadium gave a powerful sense of what it's all about. The final sequence in which various characters Paul's fandom has touched watch a championship game was wonderfully moving. The plot has three charactersPaul the young fan Paul the adult fan and Sarah the outsider who is repelled by the irrationality the loud and sweary masculinity of it all. The plot exists to allow Paul to expose stubbornly as a child and articulately as an adult what it means to be a fan. Sarah is there to force him into talking and thinking a bit about it.

I live in a town where football is the main local religion. Nick Hornby's novel was a delight to read and really gave me some sense of the psychology as well as the anthropology of being a fan. I rented the movie because I wanted to SEE the novel the stadium the terraces the colors the craziness Hornby describes. Youtube and Wikipedia could tell me some about Alan Smith Highbury the Hillsborough tragedy but not enough. The movie came through. Actual footage of games and scenes inside the stadium gave a powerful sense of what it's all about. The final sequence in which various characters Paul's fandom has touched watch a championship game was wonderfully moving. The plot has three charactersPaul the young fan Paul the adult fan and Sarah the outsider who is repelled by the irrationality the loud and sweary masculinity of it all. The plot exists to allow Paul to expose stubbornly as a child and articulately as an adult what it means to be a fan. Sarah is there to force him into talking and thinking a bit about it. Both Pauls are marvelous. Colin Firth is amazing. His physical attractiveness is essential to the plotit gets him into Sarah's bed so they can start talking about Arsenal and that simple fact leaves him huge amounts of room to be boyish goofy moody clueless innocent and cruel.";

I had just seen his Hope Springs which I had to turn off just didn't like the story line and even his gorgeousness could not keep me there.

It is so hilarious how serious his character Paul took football and how hard it seemed for his new girlfriend to relate to his seriousness.

I was surprised to find its US release under New Arrivals at my video store and being a fan of Firth I decided to give it a try. It's a very human story and it is welldone. Nick Hornby's script is excellent and he actually managed to pull me a nonrabid fan of football into understanding a little of what his character was going through. The inclusion of the childhood scenes was great for setting up why the character is still human though he initially appears insane when taken in the greater context of human existence. He was portrayed very effectively by Firth whose previous standout performance as Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice contrasts so sharply with the character that he plays in this film that I found myself almost cringing at the immaturity and madness portrayed by him...until the character grew on me and I felt more than just pity for him. Ruth Gemmell did a fine job of portraying Sarah a woman who was frustratingly in love with a man who loved a sport. I liked watching the growth of both of their characters throughout the film. The thing that struck me about this film was the reality and humanness of it. I could see such a thing happening in actual life and I appreciated the portrayal of the everyday struggles of learning to refocus your priorities and commit to loving someone.".

Of course the predictable happens.What is unpredictable is the painful growth of Colin's character and his slow progress in being able to give up his team just enough to make room for an even greater and more important love the teacher next door.What I love best about this film is that Colin Firth here is NOT Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy would NEVER let his Lizzie see him in his Fire Engine RED and white Arsenal Boxer Shorts!Here Mr. Firth is roughedged and scruffy.  A man who prefers to hang out with his mates drinking beer and holding a fatalistic view that his beloved Arsenal will NEVER win the Championship.The charm of the film lies in the growth of this manchild and the patience and understanding of the woman who loves him and their slow but certain progress from attraction to real lasting LOVE!See it!!  I happen to love soccer.  All my children played it and now my grandchildren play it.

	schema:reviewBody "For those not familiar with English football Arsenal is a very old wellrespected club with a proud tradition and has done much to progress the game at all levels. They have enjoyed an unrivalled run of seasons in the topflight and because of this are envied by almost all other clubs. Outside of Manchester United it has probably the largest fan base in the UK as well as a growing international following following the success and attractive style of play brought about by manager Arsene Wenger. The club is shortly moving to a brandnew 60000seat stateoftheart stadium to help accommodate it's growing army of supporters. It is likely demand for tickets will still far exceed supply although this depends to some extent on their ability to retain the world's greatest players who bring with them a whole new dedicated following. So now you know a little about the club you will understand why this movie was made. Hornby is a lifelong fan Arsenal fans are affectionately known as 'Gooners' and the season during which the film is based is arguably one of the most dramatic the English Championship has ever witnessed. The film briefly touches on the tragedy of Hillsborough which was a turningpoint in the game. Because of the loss of so many innocent lives all UK stadia were redeveloped to ensure they were the safest most fanfriendly in the world. The club most deeply affected by the disaster was Liverpool  favourites to win the Championship that year. Liverpool are probably the second most famous club in the country hugely successful in the 1980s. Arsenal  always unpredictable  could only take the title if they beat Liverpool 20 at Anfield Liverpool's ground. Almost all neutrals were hoping Liverpool would win the title because of the tragic losses amongst their fans  generally regarded as being some of the most devoted in the game. Almost everyone believed they would win and with less than a minute to play in the Championshipdeciding game Arsenal were a goal shy. It was at this point on the night that I turned off the TV and slunk off to the pub to drown my sorrows. When I arrived the place was buzzing and the rest is history. This is precisely what this movie is all about  anything else is just filler to broaden it's appeal. Anyone who is not a Gooner could not possibly understand this movie but it does work on different levels for those not involved.As I am involved I can't possibly see beyond the facts. Enjoy the scenes the drama and the famous old Highbury stadium  which is as I write is hosting it's very last competitive match. The stadium is probably unique in location surrounded by leafy north London backstreets. This film is more important historically than as a piece of dramatic art but it's nice to know some people appreciate it as a movie. If some of those people learn to appreciate the club it's history and  sadly doomed  stadium then that is a bonus. Those years can never be repeated but they will never be forgotten.".

The stadium is probably unique in location surrounded by leafy north London backstreets. This film is more important historically than as a piece of dramatic art but it's nice to know some people appreciate it as a movie. If some of those people learn to appreciate the club it's history and  sadly doomed  stadium then that is a bonus. Those years can never be repeated but they will never be forgotten.";

The relationship between the main character and his on and off girlfriend plays a central role in the film which differs from the book. The book is definitely worth a read for anyone who enjoys the film.Fever Pitch does a brilliant job of portraying all the emotions a football fan goes through how it can affect every aspect of your life and how non football fans don't understand it. Therefore even people with no interest in football could also relate to this film and enjoy it. The whole cast were great in their respective roles and all brought a realistic element to it which is what I love about British films. I liked seeing Colin Firth in this role as it was an early film of his and probably not something most people would expect to see him in. I thought the whole atmosphere created in the scenes at matches was really authentic and it was also interesting to see how football has changed in certain ways. I can't pretend I would enjoy this film as much if it was about another team but I still think people shouldn't write it off because it's about Arsenal or football even. This film is about a prominent aspect of British culture and therefore worth a watch for anyone.".

I saw the American Fever Pitch before I discovered it was a Nick Hornby story and I thought that movie was pretty tepid so I got the British version starring Colin Firth. I thought I would be in for a treat but the movie was seriously lacking.I mainly felt that the two main characters were both thoroughly unlikable. I could not see any reason why these two people fell in love. We were given few I'm hard pressed to remember even one scene in which they were not bickering nagging or generally disrespecting each other. There was no chemistry between the two of them and neither character's personality seemed to benefit from contact with the other person. It seemed absolutely false to me. Paul seemed to have no capacity to enjoy life at all even when Arsenal was doing well. Sarah ceaselessly nagged Paul about aspects of his personality that she was well aware of before they got together. They were both uninteresting and charmless. I normally like Colin Firth but his big soulful eyes were not enough to carry this character.It also felt as though the movie had been cut down from a longer runtime. There were awkward progressions from scene to scene and elements that were partially developed then abandoned. In a montage near the end Paul and Sarah are seen frolicking together but it happens in the midst of a time when they are separated. Indeed the very next time Paul encounters Sarah at school he coldly greets her with a perfunctory Ms. Hughes. It doesn't make sense.The film cheaps out on the football action  I can't think of a single shot of pro football that was filmed for this movie. The only time we see actual football apart from the kids games and an amateur match are on TV. There were times when I expected the camera to cut to the onfield action but it never did. The net result is that the movie feels cheap and underimagined.Hornby is credited with writing the screenplay for this film and I don't think he did a particularly good job of adapting his talents to the medium. I also think the directing was mediocre. A good director could have helped the production overcome the problems this film suffers from but the direction here seemed limited to a workmanlike effort to cover the action and nothing more.I guess I'll have to read the book to get a good experience with this story.

I believed his passion for Arsenal and furthermore I totally understand it. The Spanish have a lot of respect for the UK fans because they are so nutty about the game.I also learned a bit about the history of the Premier League. What a season that must have been! Here it's been Bara or Real Madrid mostly Bara lately winning almost everything.";

The fan played by Colin Firth in goodhumour mode is brought by his usually absent Dad Neil Pearson to a match as a twelve year old and is instantly hooked. He grows up if that's the right phrase to become an English teacher in a London comprehensive school and coach of the first XI soccer team but he's still an ardent Arsenal fan a team that hasn't as of 1988 won a championship. He falls in love with a fellow teacher Ruth Gemmell but she finds life with a sports addict hard to take. Will he get the girl and his team Arsenal the championship? Stay tuned! This is a nice fuzzy warm sort of movie which gives the viewer lots of quiet chuckles. There is a somewhat understanding headmaster Ken Stott pleasantly cheeky children and lots of likeminded fans. There is certainly lots of solidarity. How sane adults can become sports addicts I find impossible to understand fully but a large part of it seems to be the buzz you get from a sense of belonging to something bigger than you  a substitution for religion perhaps.".

The second thing you will see is the appreciation the film has of all emotions relating to the beautiful game and how it affects beliefs life and so forth.Being a fan of British cinema I let the sleepy beginning slide and sat back to watch the film grow into this intriguing reflection on the football side of life and how Colin Firth brandished out on his typecast lover's role for once and created a remarkable shot at a man lost in a world of sport.Bridget Jones Pride and Prejudice Mamma Mia and Love Actually. The common factor is? You're right they're all awful. But they are all also romantic comedies and star Mr Firth as a brandished eye candy for the female viewers. I've never personally been his biggest fan and like Hugh Grant in About a Boy it is good to see him brandish away from the Prince Charming perception and dive more into drama. This hard nosed football fanatic is a glorious exploration of obsession with no way of real world understanding and having seen many of his films he to me has never bettered this. But with A Single Man due next year critics are suggesting it's his time for an Oscar.Sadly we can never fully escape his typecast and we see a love interest inserted to balance out the good and bad of his football obsession. This is almost as ridiculous as Love Actually there was a brief laugh and then they're snogging having argued previously in the week. Her jealousy and animosity completely contradicts what is to follow it and Ruth Gemmell in all honesty brings little but negative vibes to the film.As a fan of football I found the representation quite an accurate depiction of the way the football world used to be and how we as neutrals watched with eager anticipation to see our favourite players march onto the field to the cheers and plaudits of the crowd. Now in a world where we see players selling perfume with their wives Beckham and more stories off field than on manager sackings etc it has been quite a while since the game has really been viewed as a game of sport and not of tabloid tales. This film however looks beyond the press and sees it as purely a fan's perspective which benefits it.The scene in the stadium that introduces Ruth Gemmell to the game is a great collaboration of fan's passion and youthful exuberance.The final game we see is a title decider and whether you support Arsenal or not you will be gripped with the fans on screen to see the outcome. Despite major flaws with flashbacks narration and love interests David Evans has created a good intended drama that is a good reflection of fans emotions to the game.".

Its typical teen comedydrama in the same vein as TEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU' and SHE'S ALL THAT' but if you like that kind of film then this will in no way disappoint you. Hart and Grenier play polar opposite next door neighbours who hook up as a sham couple to try and win back the attention of their dates who dump them on the eve of the schools centenary bash. It doesn't take a genius to guess what happens but its all pretty harmless and a lot of fun. Well worth and hour and a half of your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you don't like teen comedydrama films then don't bother seeing this film you're going to hate it.  There is nothing terribly original or spectacular about this film compared to similar films but it's still got some good stuff.  There really isn't a whole lot of comedy in the film so I'd be much more inclined to classify this film as a teen drama so don't watch this film expecting a hilarious movie.The cast is surprisingly good in the film.  Melissa Joan Hart does a great job in her first starring role and puts on a pretty good show for the most part.  She also looks very attractive throughout the film.  The other main character Chase played by Adrian Grenier is a new face to me but does a good job with his role.  Ali Larter looks very nice in the film as well and does a fine job in her role.  Stephen Collins was another familiar face to me and does a good job although his role is rather minor.  Susan May Pratt caught my eye in 10 Things I Hate About You and pulls off another good job in this film as well.  Keri Lynn Pratt I wonder if they're related is another new face to me but I will definitely keep my eyes open for her future work after seeing her in this film.  She is also quite easy on the eyes.  The rest of the cast did a good job as well.  Nothing to complain about in that respect.Most of the characters were actually rather interesting.  I really liked the characters of Ray and Dave they both seemed like very likeable people and quite the underdogs gotta root for the underdogs.  I also really liked that even the jocks in this film were not really made out to be idiots and jerks of course one of them in particular was...Eddie.  The character Brad was the most important jockcharacter and he wasn't made out to be a bad person or unlikeable person at all just a guy that Nicole Melissa Joan Hart was head over heels for...and then wasn't.Another thing this film really had going for it was that it stayed away from all the grossout stupid comedy that is so abundant in most teen movies these days.  I can really appreciate a film that doesn't resort to that...sure sometime it's really funny but most of the time it's just unneeded.If you are the kind of person that likes teen comedydrama films then give this one a chance you just might like it.  Other than that I would recommend you spend your money and time elsewhere.  If you do see the film I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for readingChris".

Melissa cooks up a compromise. If Chase will pretend to be her guy to make the basketball star jealous she will do the same for him and his ex. But first Melissa insists on giving Chase a makeover.

I'm usually the one in my group who likes the crappy movies. So to anyone who feels like this film was good..your entitled to your opinion but I for one disagree. If you wanna see a really crappy film...rent it but I wouldn't waste my money on this. So what's the deal with this movie? Why did it suck so bad? The world may never know.";

	schema:reviewBody "Oh no another shamefully predictable romantic comedy. Drive Me Crazy' can be compared to candy floss in many ways. Once you bite into the fluffy sugar there's a hollow core that's in desperate need of being filled. It is in no way big and complex and there's only about two or three artificial ingredients. They both heavily rely on artificial preservatives to keep it from going stale too quickly in the movies case clichs. Finally it's not good for you and there's nothing fresh in it's many layers no substance whatsoever. While there is an unwritten rule that romantic comedies are predictable they still have a certain amount of potential to be witty andor remotely funny. Drive Me Crazy' is completely devoid of these positives. What's even worse is the fact that it doesn't even attempt at humour. It's one of those movies that's branded as a romcom only because the material present isn't heavy enough to consider as a fullscale romance. The division of charm over wit is never in equal proportions. There's nothing that the film has that's bad but there are plenty of elements that it's missing. Then again if you like mindless charming paintbynumbers teen movies this is probably the film for you. The acting is flat and onedimensional while the characters are shallow stereotypes. Melissa Joan Hart was great in Sabrina the Teenage Witch' in the title role. It's evident that her appearance in the movie is just an excuse to get rid of her girlnextdoor image. Ironically she plays that exact character and does little to show that she's gone past that stage. Adrian Grenier doesn't jump off the screen for any particular reason and does little with his part as the boynextdoor counterpart. Supporting performances are all pretty much the same. Directing styles art direction etc. are average but the script is the real problem. Even I could write a screenplay better than this. If you want to see something original radical totally out of this world give Drive Me Crazy' a miss. My IMDb rating 4.510.".

The rest is predictable with every teen movie clich available. Director John Schultz does his best while some set pieces provide amusement but that doesn't save an absolutely recycled storyline. Hart and Grenier are going by the motions and nothing they do sparks anything interesting. It goes without saying that their bedroom windows are speaking distance away. This is a lame plot device that totally makes everything convenient for lazy writers. Stephen Collins of 7th Heaven fame makes an appearance but it isn't likely one that will be remembered upon any career retrospective. Ali Larter also shows up to wade through material traveled by hundreds of others before her. This is all totally recycled crap that is likely to drive you crazy. Score 3  10".
