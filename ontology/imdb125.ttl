That's why despite the fact that this movie has pretty obvious CGI it doesn't matter as much as the obvious CGI in The Hulk it's so fantastic it helps that it doesn't seem real.Too bad it just won't get the marketing or the attention it deserves probably ever.

	schema:reviewBody "Title Mirrormask 2005 Director Dave McKean Cast Stephanie Leonidas Gina McKee Rob Brydon Jason Barry Dora Bryan Review Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman have partnered up in the past to write some visually astounding children's books. McKean would take care of the artwork and Gaiman would take care of the story. This time around they have joined forces to create a film that very closely resembles their previous colaborations. Only this time around the images move and actors say the words in this way helping to bring McKeans art and Gaimans words to vibrant life.The story in Mirrormask is about a young girl called Helena. Her parents run a circus and she has been brought up in the circus environment but lately shes been feeling like shes not really cut up for circus life. Helena and her mother have a fight about her not wanting to be in the circus anymore and she wishes her mother would die. On that same day her mother falls ill and ends up in the hospital and Helenas conscience begins to bother her after all she did wish her mother was dead. And now she is close to dying. So once Helena falls as sleep thinking about all these things she enters her imaginary dreamworld where everything has a representation of what she knows from real life.This is a very visual film. McKean fills the screen with his lush imagery. If you've seen McKeans artwork and know how beautiful it is then you know how incredible it is to see his pictures come to life on this film. This movie is eye candy and for those of you out there who love art and love films that give their utter most importance to their visual aspect then you will love this movie. McKean fills the screen with really outlandish strange weird and dreamlike situations. Nothing is what you would expect.Some people might feel that this type of movie is all style and art and no substance simply because its such a visual film. But I sincerely think that this is not the case with Mirrormask. With a writer like Neil Gaiman in charge well you can almost tell that the movie is going to have some deep psychological themes going on for it. And it does. Every character every situation every word spoken in Helenas dream world means something in Helenas real life. So be on the look out for those comparisons.The movie has some truly astounding sequences that left me breathless and my jaw was dropping. First there was the giants orbiting sequence with these huge stone giants floating in the air and then there's this sequence in which Helena gets transformed into a dark princess that is simply amazing. They really did a good job of mixing music with visuals in that sequence. You'll just have to wait and see it to understand how beautiful it is.This movie wears its influences on its sleaves and has no problems in showing that. There's many similarities between this movie and Labyrinth Legend and most of all The Never Ending Story. Its the only thing I didn't love about this movie. It felt like they remade The Never Ending Story with elements from Labyrinth and Legend. Take all those movies shake em together add a little bit of psychological depth and incredible visuals and you've got Mirrormask. So if there's anything bad to say its that in its narrative its similar to a few other films. But on a visual level its a whole other thing so that sort of balances its self out.I liked the fact that Helena wasn't a dumb little girl. She was very head strong and very smart. She wasn't a dumb little girl stumbling across a strange landscape. She was quick and witty and she realizes the situation in which she is in quickly and I liked that about her character which was very well played by Stephanie Leonides.So in conclusion this film will blow you away with both its visuals and its story. Its a mixed bag of other films you've seen before story wise but on a visual level the film will be like nothing you've ever seen before.Rating 5 out of 5".

Other films in this vein are Alice in Wonderland Paperhouseand Labrynth. The film was produced by Henson Studios and is presented like their other features but rather than puppets and elaborate sets animation replaces those elements.Visually I found it stunning. I am familiar with McKean's work and I found this to be amongst his best. It was distinctly McKean's style. The use of color was phenomenal as well as surreal composition. I was enthralled seeing his creations in literal motion rather than the usual implied motion. I personally thought there were a number of visual references to other great films but I'll leave that to your opinion. I thought the direction clearly demonstrated his grasp of composition.The writing was true to Gaiman's tradition of offbeat fairy tales. The pacing was dreamlike flowing between slow moments of beauty and exposition to frenetic moments of fierce action. Humor dark and otherwise punctuated the film. The dialogue was very strong.I was also very fond of the use of sound. One scene is a frightening and beautiful music video that can be lifted out of the film completely and carry itself. It fits better in the film but doesn't need to.The film fits extremely well with all of the previous Henson Productions. I suggest having seen Dark Crystal Labrynth and Jim Henson's The Storyteller before viewing this. The piece fits very well with these.".

	schema:headline " I thought it was unwatchable.... is there something wrong with me?";
	schema:reviewBody "So many people loved this movie yet there are a few of us IMDb reviewers who found Mirrormask excruciatingly uncomfortable to watch and arseclenchingly boring. I fall into the latter of these two camps and I will try to explain what it was that made my toenails curl so unpleasantly.Firstly to set the record straight  I like Neil Gaiman's books. I sometimes find his knowing sarcastic 'wry asides' humour a little geeky and I actually prefer his work when he is playing it straight and leaving the jokes alone  but even with his occasional lapses into crap 'dad' gags I find his creativity and imagination to be something a bit special.Interestingly one of Gaiman's strongest works is Coraline a Gothic fairy story for kids that is very low on jokes and high on tension and creepiness. His latest novel Anansi Boys overdoes the funnies and tends to read at times like Terry Pratchett does the Sisters of Mercy not the nuns but the band. Mirrormask inhabits similar territory to Coraline and when I saw the stunning visuals in the trailer I got a bit excited that somebody had managed to transfer Gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination to the screen.In praise of the film some sequences do look stunning. However the visual effects are occasionally ruined by CGI animation that looks like a Media Studies student project. Backgrounds and scenery are often incredible but some of the character animation looks clumsy amateur and cheap. In an early dream sequence the spider is animated beautifully but the bookeating catbeast looks poorly rendered and very 'computer generated'. Compared with the standard of animation found in productions such as 'The Corpse Bride' Mirrormask occasionally looks very amateur indeed. However in Mirrormask's defence the budget was tiny for such a grand vision and a few creaks in the effects can be understood and forgiven.What cannot be forgiven is the stilted stagy cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. The actors struggle desperately with the dialogue  and there is so much of it that they are constantly hampered and stumbling over it. Conversation is rendered completely unnatural the jokes fall flat time and time again and the turgid speeches appear to be the writer's only method of plot exposition. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen which always adds an element of 'Phantom Menace'  this renders the film almost unwatchable. In such an unreal setting the actors need to work twice as hard to be believed and in the main they fail terribly. The girl who plays the lead role puts in a valiant struggle against the impossible stageschool dialogue and occasionally shows real promise but it is never enough. The godawful cod'Oirish' of the Valentine character with whom she is forced to spend an inordinate amount of screen time puts paid to any chance of this young actress rising above the material. It appears to be Valentine's job to explain the plot to younger viewers and to add a bit of light relief. Personally I wouldn't want him anywhere near my 15 year old daughter.What else is wrong with this film? Answer....Rob Brydon. What's annoying for us Brits anyway is we know Rob Brydon can act! We've seen him hold the screen for halfanhour on his own doing those 'Marion  Geoff' monologues and in the first 'real world' bit of the film he is fine. However stick him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and turns into the worst amdramham I've seen in years. A real shame.What else is wrong? Answer... the wanky slapbassing subCourtney Pine saxing and unlistenable toohighinthemix soundtrack that never shuts up. God the music is incessant loud distracting irrelevant and if that isn't enough has wanky slap bass wanking all over it. It makes the dialogue very hard to hear but that could be a blessing in disguise.What else is wrong with it? Answer.... The whistling mime artist. In modern society there should be no place for mime apart from certain secret places in France. Every moment the camera lingers on the gurning whistling mossjuggling yogurtweaving idiot I understand why the Edinburgh locals get a bit anxious and fractious when Festival time comes round again.My final criticism is that the film is pretty dull. Surrealism often is dull  it either requires its audience to slip into a dreamlike Zen accepting state or for the audience be constantly wowed by bigger and grander surprises. A story with a bit of pace involving characters that we could believe in and care about would have gone a long way to giving this film the emotional centre that it sadly lacked whilst stopping the eyelids from drooping.Finally apologies to all those who found depth meaning and wonder in this film. You have managed to suspend your disbelief you have seen past the creaky CGI ignored the crappy dialogue and the abysmal performances that resulted and understood the maker's grand imaginative vision. I wanted to but I couldn't see past the realworld failings that dragged it down.I hope Neil Gaiman gets it right next time if he gets or even wants the opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "MirrorMask is like the crack baby of Labyrinth and Alice in Wonderlandbut this baby is more stylized modern and incredibly beautiful.I am a huge fan of both Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman's work. I consider myself lucky because I was able to meet Neil at the Salt Lake Public Library a couple of years ago and I was treated to a sneak preview of MirrorMask at the San Diego Comic Convention in 2004. And amazingly enough I got to see the film at the Sundance Film Festival on January 29th and Neil and Dave were there again. So I've felt attached to this project for a while.This is a film that children and adults will adore. The humor is great and the characters are immediately enjoyable and identifiable. Helena the main character possesses the kind of wideeyed wonderment and tenacious attitude that all viewers will find believably endearing. The other characters range from strangely beautiful and frightening as in the Black Queen to comical and seemingly ordinary as in the sardonic juggler Valentine. The background characters are beautifully rendered and reflect McKean's style perfectly. The costume design is particularly outstandingdetails are not overlooked. One could view the film a dozen times and still see new surprises.Like Labyrinth the film follows Helena through a journey of selfdiscovery where she ultimately begins to understand the importance of her herself and her familyand of the ultimate power of hope. As a child I was captivated by Labyrinth's Sarah character and I think younger generations will latch onto Helena just as quickly. Helena is more believable though than Sarahand her role is a positive one. She is a strong intelligent and inquisitive girl just on the verge of womanhood.The entire film floored meI feel so lucky to have seen it. If any of you have a chance to see it do so immediately. Hopefully the film will be released to theaters around the country this would be an especially wise move as I'm sure it will become a classic fantasy film for all ages.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have just returned from seeing this wonderful little film. From the summary it is obvious to most that not only is this for the most part a children's film but it borrows from the classic girl trapped in another world as a metaphor for growing up. We're even treated to a brief shot of a man juggling glass balls a la David Bowie in Labirynth. The obvious Alice in Wonderlandesquire story makes things a bit predictable since we've seen it several times but if one were to sit back and enjoy the magic and the characters then enjoyment is practically guaranteed. It is a very familyfriendly movie because of this.At the same time the art crowd will instantly recognize the names of Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean. Gaiman is the author of such novels as American Gods and Neverwhere and also is a comic writer that reached fame with his metaphysical masterpiece series The Sandman. McKean likewise is a famed graphic designer and also worked with Gaiman on Sandman. They have both collaborated on children's books as well. McKean's brilliant design work and Gaiman's delightful characters are evident throughout. Those seeking more cerebral movies will not be displeased.The only negatives of this movie is that it slows a bit in some places and the effects are sometimes too pretty and might be a distraction. These are only two small drawbacks in what is otherwise a great film. I know I will not be the only one hopeful that this will be the first in many movies that will be involved in the Jim Henson Company's comeback.".

The obvious Alice in Wonderlandesquire story makes things a bit predictable since we've seen it several times but if one were to sit back and enjoy the magic and the characters then enjoyment is practically guaranteed. It is a very familyfriendly movie because of this.At the same time the art crowd will instantly recognize the names of Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean. Gaiman is the author of such novels as American Gods and Neverwhere and also is a comic writer that reached fame with his metaphysical masterpiece series The Sandman. McKean likewise is a famed graphic designer and also worked with Gaiman on Sandman. They have both collaborated on children's books as well. McKean's brilliant design work and Gaiman's delightful characters are evident throughout. Those seeking more cerebral movies will not be displeased.The only negatives of this movie is that it slows a bit in some places and the effects are sometimes too pretty and might be a distraction. These are only two small drawbacks in what is otherwise a great film. I know I will not be the only one hopeful that this will be the first in many movies that will be involved in the Jim Henson Company's comeback.";

I was willing to trust the two gentleman that I went with knowledgable comic buffs that the visuals would be out of the ordinary and so they were. Unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict. Though this is a comment that could be made of many artists whose work is transferred to screen and who are given charge of direction. The pace of the story is lost as the camera lovingly dwells on the pretty pictures.I would not have gone at all without that reassurance that the style of the film would be worth seeing. I have tried with Neil Gaiman's work but am always left with the emperor's new clothes feeling. I live in hope but last night was no exception.I do not think I can continue with an analysis of Gaiman's work without losing the will to live. Read the rest of the comments and all his faults are eloquently described. I cannot comprehend however how he imagined that he had any understanding of the mind of a fifteen year old girl Nor that what he had to say added anything to the sum total of human knowledge on growing up and assuming adult responsibility or the changing relationship that a girl might have with her mother. These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination. All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.".

McKean is constantly aware of the camera and how best to use it to draw the audience into the world he and Neil Gaiman have created.The story is a fascinating examination of the self and issues of duality through the lens of the carnivalesque. The film references the mythologies of various cultures to create one of its own. There are some clear links back to Lewis Carroll and Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass and it shares the dark twisted sense of humour seen in earlier Henson Company films like Labyrinth and Dark Crystal.The whole film is captivating and visually gorgeous. Within each frame there is so much to see that I would guess even upon dozens of viewings you'd be seeing new things. The visuals alone would have been enough to make this film nearly perfect but coupled with the frenetic and wacky music it's made even more amazing.

At closer inspection I read 2 important names Neil Gaiman of Sandman comics fame and the late Jim Henson. So needless to say I quickly grabbed it and checked out as fast as I came in. With these 2 big names displayed on MIRRORMASKs casing I was sure to be blessed with a magical story full of bizarre concepts dark yet beautiful imagery and some very interesting characters and possibly even some of that puppetry that Hensons company is so well known for.Instead I was subjected to a meaningless mess of poor CGI boring lead characters and a plot and storyline weve all seen before. Come to find out its just another fairytale about a spoiled brat 15 year old girl who gets lost in this world that is basically made up of her own wild imagination much like Hensons LABYRYNTH but instead of her head being in the books our character is lost in a world inhabited by her drawings.This movie brings nothing new to the genre and seems just like one big stew of every Henson flick ever made minus the mesmerizing puppetry and then ontop of it looks like a big gross load of Neil Gaimans pretentiousgothyart spunk splattered all over it so much so that the focus on the story 9which is not that interesting anyway is lost in the overwhelming mind fck that are the special effects.I was really psyched to watch this film and maybe I just talked it up in my head so much that I disappointed myself. But no matter what the case this awardwinning fairy tale is again nothing new. It tries so hard to stimulate the eye that it comes off most pretentious. There are some parts here and there that do work but they are too far and few between and are almost stolen right out of the other great fantasy films look for the scene where our lead character Helena is brainwashed dressed and made up in black by the dark queens minions almost exactly like the scene in LEGEND.Snore factor is way too high on this film. Sure its probably a kids flick but so was LABYRYNTH and DARK CRYSTAL and MIRRORMASK will never compare to those timeless and ageless classics.5 out of 10.".

The story from Neil Gaiman is unfortunately exactly what Gaiman has been giving us ever since he ripped off Clive Barker for the first time a pseudomythic overblown dreamscape populated by characters which have Titles in All Capital Letters rather than names. Everything is allegory to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama emotion or empathy from anyone involved. People make pithy postulations speaking in riddles which bring to mind what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead might have sounded like if Tom Stoppard had suffered a debilitating stroke halfway through its composition. Really Gaiman get over yourself. You're not a prophet. You're a poser.McKean's directing doesn't help  his pacing is poor taking fully half an hour to actually rev himself up for the main picaresque plot and then simply providing a disconnected sequence of events none of them given any weight. The monsters don't menace because they're not foreshadowed simply thrown at the screen. The plot doesn't engage because we don't really care about the rancid little protagonists. Half the dialogue muttered into into shirt fronts and ubiquitous masks is unintelligible.Some of the visuals are pretty and I'm sure the fanboys will lick it up. Pity.

Since it was meant to be a children's movie some viewers will forgive the familiar scenes but it is a strike against it for all of us who were jarred out of our suspension of disbelief by what seemed more like borrowed ideas than an homage. I just couldn't get into it. The Neverending Story Labyrinth and Legend in particular seemed almost to be sources for the story. I was disappointed because I am a big Gaiman fan  except for Coraline which also creeped me out. He is usually a very original writer.But I would still have enjoyed the film if it weren't for the aesthetics. Artistically and creatively it's impressive and I can understand why it has the beginnings of a cult following Mirror Mask is better than Labyrinth a similar Jim Henson Company movie in a lot of ways. It's more mature with a better heroine a decent plot and thoughtful underlying themes. But to me DM's art seemed bizarre and disturbing  not for children. This is not a lighthearted pretty movie. I doubt it would appeal to most fans of the familiar fantasy genre. The script was thoughtful and sometimes fun but the visuals were insane and scary. I'm surprised I didn't have nightmares after watching it.So it's not mature enough for most adults but too old for most kids. Who is going to love this movie? Probably mostly artists and film students. Just my opinion.".

Amongst the highlights the completely bizarre segments from 'Andy's Gang' the wacko kids show hosted by actor Andy Devine the shockingly insensitive Bufferin commercials that no longer exist except as part of this film and the hilarious and carefully selected scenes from 1959's JD epic Speed Crazy. Any complaints are minor the film leans a little too heavily on Albert Zugsmith's College Confidential though its integration with Nixon's Checkers Speech is brilliant and at only 4 12 hours in length I yearned to see the original 7 hours plus version. Regardless if you ever have an opportunity to see The Movie Orgy you simply must take advantage of it. Shockingly the Roxie was no more than half full for what will probably be a once in a lifetime opportunity. Don't make the same mistake hundreds of thousands of Bay Area residents made!".

He convinces Jack to drop by and take a look at the girl. Saulsbourg isn't happy about this and does what he can to get rid of Dr. Jack. He almost succeeds until an escaped maniac comes their way. How Dr. Jack actually uses this to his advantage is something you'll just have to see for yourself in this cute flick. After all it runs at about 60 minutes so you haven't much to lose!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my favourites Harold Lloyd films and it contains a really memorable ending. The lovely Mildred Davis is once again the girl the SickLittleWellGirl but this time this girl is basically not having a life the only things she knows is the medicines and the more medicines that the Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg Eric Mayne gives to her. If you watch this doctor you watch a man who knows that he can do anything since he seems to be really professional for the father of the girl John T. Prince who really trusts in him. Basically the Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg understands the situation and he is acting like a professional always thinking in a new possible solution. That the girl has being his patient since long time ago and that he still can't help her is not an impediment for him since and like I just write the father of the girl still believes that his daughter will be cure by him. In the other hand we have the character that Harold Lloyd plays and he is a really great character and is absolutely hilarious to watch him doing his job basically he will help anyone who asks him. I loved one of the first scenes in which we watch Dr. Jackson doing his job he comes to check a kid who's mother is really worry due to his health however as soon as Dr. Jack arrives the theater of the kid is over. So the doctor made his duty and of course was fair and will be fair if the mother gives a lesson to her kid. Dr. Jack is a unique doctor and is hilarious to watch him saving the kid from some painful smacks on the bottom at first the kid did not understood but as soon as he realized that Dr. Jack was helping him he began his very good acting to complete the trick to his mother. So by the end of this duty Dr. Jack ended just fine with both the kid and his mother and it was really funny. So we have the good and the bad with Dr. Jack and Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg and it will be matter of time to watch both together but not before we watch more of the great methods that Dr. Jack uses to cure his patients. Is marvelous to watch Dr. Jack curing his patients by returning the concept of family to them or just helping sane persons with a problem for example a girl who needs the money that her father is beating with his pals a very funny act by Lloyd. Certainly everybody who knows this doctor has a good opinion about him and the son of one of his patients will be the one who will take Dr. Jack with the patient of Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg. Before that Dr. Jack and the girl had an encounter and now for Dr. Jack was kind of easy to detect the problem of the girl but things won't be that easy when the father of the girl thinks that Dr. Jack's only interest is to be with his daughter that is true but what the father doesn't know us that love is something that can give a little of life to his daughter. I mentioned very soon that this film contains a really memorable ending just because I really loved it. The girl just needs to feel that she is alive and Dr. Jack will make amazing things to help her and thanks to the announcement that a burglar may be there Dr. Jack will have a chance to do that he will be the burglar! This is a great sequence showing the ability of Dr. Jack he really did something great for the girl and of course in the end his worked but at one point the girl understood everything and thanks to that she was convinced that Dr. Jack was just helping her and even she helped him in his plan by dressing also as the burglar that Dr. Jack created. At the end is the smile on the face of the girl what convinces her father that now things will be better. Then I loved this film and I think is all I have to write about it.".

The lovely Mildred Davis is once again the girl the SickLittleWellGirl but this time this girl is basically not having a life the only things she knows is the medicines and the more medicines that the Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg Eric Mayne gives to her. If you watch this doctor you watch a man who knows that he can do anything since he seems to be really professional for the father of the girl John T. Prince who really trusts in him. Basically the Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg understands the situation and he is acting like a professional always thinking in a new possible solution. That the girl has being his patient since long time ago and that he still can't help her is not an impediment for him since and like I just write the father of the girl still believes that his daughter will be cure by him.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Fred Newmeyer with a story cowritten by the great Hal Roach this Harold Lloyd silent teams the comedian with his future wife actress Mildred Davis. Davis plays the daughter of a wealthy man John T. Prince whose doctor Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg Eric Mayne lives off him handsomely by telling him that his daughter is sick so that he can treat her. Lloyd is titled character actually Dr. Jackson a country doctor who believes that positive thinking in lieu of drugs is the best medicine.Lloyd is an excellent physical comedian whose antics frequently involve transportation automobile or a motorcycle gags as well as stunts in and around a multilevel building or home. In this film his character uses both an automobile and a motorcycle as well as a bicycle to get to a patient. A couple of times the doctor actually jumps out of the car and runs alongside it e.g. to move some cows out of his way before reentering the vehicle. He rescues a little girl's doll from a well and catches a little boy pretending to be sick to avoid school he also helps said boy avoid a spanking. He then cures several seemingly ill patients by involving them in some happy activity to distract them from their woes. He also assists a girl by getting her father out of a card game before he spends his entire week's paycheck. Eventually he comes to the attention of the SickLittleWell Girl's lawyer  C. Norman Hammond who has figured out Dr. Saulsbourg's scam.As is typical Lloyd's character is smitten with the lead female character. However her father is not amused with Dr. Jack's infatuation and forbids him to see her again. Not from around there he is permitted to stay the night during which a shot is heard and some men report than an Asylum inmate has escaped and is on the loose in the area. This gives Dr. Jack and idea to dress up as the escapee in order to scare Dr. Saulsbourg from the home.Several hilarious sequences follow with Lloyd doing quick changes such that the others in the home believe he's chasing the escaped inmate a talented dog a pit bull? is utilized in many of the scenes. Of course everything goes as planned and the boy gets the girl in the end I hope I didn't spoil it for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aside from 'The Freshman' which was excellent I seem to enjoy Lloyd more when he's not playing the whimpy character so Dr Jack was a welcome change in that regard. A lot of his mannerisms are still the same but here he is a playing a doctor who cures patients with emotional therapy rather than medicine. An old ladies cure is a visit from her son organised by Jack while a young boys is false news that the school burnt down and he won't have to attend. The idea seems to be that sick people are mistaking or faking their life's miseries for their bodies. No doubt it is true for some in this world but equally for others it would not be and for a film high on sentiment it is fairly cynical stuff and would set a dangerous precedent if it weren't in the name of comedy. Being somewhat conflicted about the idea then I wasn't overly fond of the jokes and there wasn't a huge amount of laughs. That being said it did pick up in the second half where he was called to use his 'unusual methods' to cure a pretty woman Mildred Davis  parodying Mary Pickford's 'Poor Little Rich Girl'. The two fall for each other which seems to do wonders for Davis but the father is not happy about it and gives Jack his packing orders. Dressing up in costume Jack then pretends to be an escaped murderer to 'prove' to the family that this kind of 'excitement' is exactly what Davis needs to recover. Well it didn't prove anything to me you would have to be a pretty light judge to consider that evidence enough of a cure which is exactly what most of the characters seem to be but it was somewhat amusing seeing the costumed Jack terrify all the guests and charming that it was in the name of love although of course Davis like most female leads in silent comedies was just a token beauty and without any real character development it is a fairly skin deep version of love. The switching of costumes between Jack the doctor and the Jack the murderer to fight with each other and to fool the guests would be mimicked 4 years later by Charley Chase in 'Mighty Like A Moose'. I saw that film before this one so was already aware of the gag and in my opinion that film did it slightly better though as far as I'm aware Lloyd was the first to do it so kudos for that.".

Dr. Jack 1922 Harold Lloyd is introduced as he makes his rounds Reviving a ragdoll that has fallen down a well reuniting a lonely old woman with her workaholic son and rescuing a boy from his angry mother when he's caught playing hooky. At the home of the SickLittleWellGirl Mildred Davis the good doctor observes his unhappy new patient the drugs isolation repressed activity and treats her with sunlight fresh air and peppermint sticks. When he sees she is only starved for excitement he disguises himself as an escaped lunatic and goes on a wild nighttime rampage through the house to prove his diagnosis.Our Gang kids Mickey Daniels and Jackie Condon make a brief but mischievous appearance a favor returned when Lloyd appeared in Dogs of War .

	schema:reviewBody "Made by Harold Lloyd just as he was coming into his own as silent cinema's most popular clown Dr. Jack failed so consistently to engage or entertain that it left me feeling not just perplexed but a bit crestfallen.Dr. Jackson Lloyd is the kind of doctor who gets paid in smiles and old pocket knives while helping those who think they are sick but really just need friendly attention. This includes the Sick LittleWellGirl Mildred Davis suffering not from any malady but the heavyhanded ministrations of Dr. von Saulsbourg Eric Mayne who is less interested in his patient than his paycheck. Does Dr. Jack have the cure for what ails her?Lloyd and his frequent collaborator director Fred C. Newmeyer enjoyed success with their prior two features which mixed solid stories involving sentiment and clever gags. Perhaps the pair thought they simply needed to reuse the same ingredients without worrying too much about the proportions. That's my theory anyway.The story kicks off by introducing the benevolent Dr. J and then running him through his paces which include performing CPR on a dolly with a rolling pin riding a cow backwards and helping a boy escape punishment for feigning sickness. Lloyd has a solidly amusing introductory sequence trying to crank his car and eat his breakfast simultaneously. After that and some fun stuntwork involving cows and his car the usual elegant leanness one gets from early Lloyd becomes sorely missed.Dr. Jack's ministrations include handing out sheet music to a horn playing invalid and boxing another frail fellow into robust health. People grin like maniacs as he passes by just so you know he's a swell guy. He fools a businessman into paying a visit to his aged mother apparently by convincing him the woman's at death's door. As she jumps into his arms and kisses him Jack grins and sticks out his chin You're the medicine  It's you that she needs!Even more heavyhanded is the handling of the SickLittleWellGirl story. Dr. von Saulsbourg bans sunlight flowers and music from the girl's bedside. At one point we watch the doctor make a point by pounding his fist on a table crushing a flower in the process. An iris effect closes in on the crushed flower. We also get many close ups of a teary Davis. An actress best known for marrying Lloyd Davis had her moments in the shorts she made with him. Here she never connects as a character swinging from gravely depressed to hyperhappy. Calling out any actor for giving less than their best work is unfair here. The gags are thin repetitive and labored. The girl meets Dr. Jack at a restaurant Chicken Dinner  30 cents reads a sign on the wall where Jack upsets her evil doctor by feeding a dog under the table. A protracted sequence involving an illicit poker game takes us out of the main story before it develops where the gag involves Jack feeding various players aces in order to break up the game and save one of the players from losing his house. This has nothing to do with the main story and it's not funny on its own but it fills time.It's true that Lloyd frequently employed sentiment and quite well better than Chaplin I think. Usually he knew when to pull back to employ comedy when things got too emotionally sticky or conversely introduce an element of pathos when things got too silly. Perhaps that's one way to look at Dr. Jack as Lloyd testing the boundaries of this approach.It may have worked too. Even though Dr. Jack was a major box office success it seemed he never did get as carried away again in his silent period as he did here. Maybe he understood better than his audience what worked this might account for why so many of his films have stood the test of time far better than Dr. Jack.".

	schema:reviewBody "Salt Of The Earth is best known as a blacklisted film made by many of the artists whose lives were destroyed by HUAC and the complicity of the film industry.  While the film's very exsistance is a tribute to the determination of the artists to do the right thing and not be silenced it is much more than that.  It is also a moving film tribute to the underclass of America who suffer greatly due to injustice and inequality.  The film portrays the strike of Chicano mine workers in New Mexico.  Their demands which the company took 15 months to meet included such outrages as safety equality and indoor plumbing.  The most interesting aspect of the film is the way in which the women of the community are forced to take a leading role.  By linking the oppression of the workers to the workers' oppression of their wives the film becomes not only a prounion film but also a feminist one.  The story is stirring and the scenes where the women are attacked for standing by their men are unforgetable.  Salt of the Earth probably has more to do with everyday American lives than 99 percent of Hollywood films.  Its humane portrayal of regular people fighting for their rights cannot help but awaken the common elements in us all.".

Salt of the Earth is almost fifty years old. It illustrates inequality between whites  Chicanos male  female and rich  poor.  Is it possible that fifty years later nothing has changed?  We've achieved nothing as a human race.  Sadly this lack of achievement is what allows this film to have great meaning to modernday viewers like myself.

	schema:reviewBody "There are times when it's important to throw away your formalist baggage and celebrate a film for what it is.  SALT OF THE EARTH is so inspirational so brave so winning yet so forthright and angry that you forgive it any faults.  The period from the late 1940s to the mid1950s is the darkest in American history the closest the country has ever come to fascism.  In the name of 'America' panic was spread throughout the country not unlike the early years of Nazi Germany where communists liberals and general noncowards were smeared and demonised.  Of course there were no concentration camps but many lives and careers wre ruined people forced abroad for succour and their livelihood lies became truths all with the collusion of Hollywood and the media.  Anything not fitting a narrow conformist terrified social desire was deemed 'UnAmerican' a gross Orwellian perversion of the term.Most filmmakers went along with this state of affairs some prosecuting others dobbing in their former friends and colleagues.  Any director wanting to be critical  eg Sirk Ray  had to do so covertly sublimating their protest through genre form or allegory.  What is so heartening and jolting about this film is that it dares to say out loud what it means.  This is not surprising as all the key crew members had been blacklisted and director Biberman had served six months for not cooperating with the HUAC.  It is not negative but celebratory.  It is as the dedication implies a most American film a light of liberty in a very unAmerican darkness.  Of course it was banned the production undermined by the government the FBI and local vigilantes while Rosaura Revueltas the Mexican actress in the lead was repatriated never to work again.SALT OF THE EARTH tells the story of Esperanza hope a poor NewMexican housewife living in impoverished insanitary conditons whose husband Ramon works in salt mines once owned by her grandfather now exploited by vicious American capitalists.  Conditions in the mines are appalling and after a fatality due to deliberately lousy safety measures the men go on a strike which stretches out for months intimidating incoming scabs.  When the corrupt sheriff slaps a court order on them their wives take up striking duty.Of course the film is a riposte not only to latterday 'America' but also the Hollywood that served it.  Demonised as red propaganda it is anything but  propaganda is an attempt by the ruling class to brainwash its subjects through lies and false promises this beautiful film is a statement from an embattled peoples with no voice in the mainstream media.  This film breaks all the rules for once one can say this and actually believe it!.  Its subject matter is work the working classes the right to work.  It features no Hollywood stars indeed many of the actors as in an Italian neorealism film are locals no racist melting pot aspirations but genuine ethnic people with their own culture and customs.  In a reversal of current Hollywood practice it is the white man who is marginalised and demonised.What is remarkable about the film which is essentially a plea for help is how politically sophisticated it is.  It would have been perfectly understandable for the filmmakers to simplify their message in the current political climate but they hearteningly refuse to do so.  Although the fascist mineowners and lawmen are clearly villains the film explores the tensions within the very patriarchal NewMexican community itself.  The union links workers' rights with racial equality but the men do not extend this to women.  But this is the story of a woman a meek housewife who is transformed into an active worker a full woman someone with a voice and a very powerful role in society.  Like a Hollywood film SALT does dramatise its social subject matter around one main couple but this crystallises rather than dilutes the issues.  The men see the increasing power of the women as further humiliation of their power but divided by gender the NewMexicans have no power they are despondent starving at the mercy of sadistic  capitalists.  Together they have extraordinary power culminating in the remarkable evicition scene a rare celebration of group power in the American cinema  one of that cinema's most powerful scenes.Esperanza moves from a position of having no voice in society no public arena like the men in which to speak indeed barely a space in her own home where her dreams and desires are transferred to a radio playing other people's songs to a political activist someone who does not limit her life to housework and children indeed demands her husband does his share and this is represented by her narration her power to tell and control a story to speak authoratively for a people to translate for us their language.The 'emasculation' of the men provides the film with some of its funniest scenes but there is a darker side to NewMexican masculinity  the implied wifebeating for example.  In one of the most heartbreaking sequences despondantly humiliated they see a magazine picture of their enemy about to go out hunting 'a man of distinction' and they decide to imitate him erasing themselves their pride and responsibilities.  It is their lowest ebb.Like I say the film has its flaws.  There is a naivete to the neorealist model that allows for a protohippy idealism that is not always convincing. The strongly political form of the film sometimes slips into the drama making certain scenes seem didactic and unreal.  Sometimes you wonder what a Bunuel might have done with the material.  But this is an honorable treasure in the American cinema which should always be shown to remind us that we do not always have to cow to tyranny.".

The plot is deceptively simple. Mexican American men along with a few whites Anglos in the Mexicans' parlance decide that their job in the mine is too dangerous and that they are treated unfairly compared to Anglo workers. They strike putting their families through terrible hardships. While this film certainly has an agenda it thankfully becomes more complex than just a Labor vs Management dispute. Perhaps an even more important theme is the relationship between the men and their women wives mothers sisters. At one point the TaftHartley Act is enacted of course I mention the name because of recent events and the miners can no longer picket legally. Their wives who are asked according to the local mores to be silent dare to pick up the duties of the strike. Not only is Salt of the Earth a brave champion of the worker and minorities it has the audacity in 1954! to back women's rights. No wonder this was the only American film to be blacklisted.".

Its banning says far more about what was wrong with America at that time than anything about the movie itself.Rosuara Revueltas gives an amazing performance as the miner's wife. She was deported to Mexico for starring in this film and not only did she never make another movie in the U.S. she didn't act again in Mexico until 1976.".

She was deported to Mexico for starring in this film and not only did she never make another movie in the U.S. she didn't act again in Mexico until 1976.";

Another movie of similar courage and artistic accomplishment is Storm Center 1956 which also seems to have been banned because it's never shown and is not on video let alone DVD.".

This is not a film that would get people rushing to Blockbuster but as the only film in America that was blacklisted itself it is important for that reason and for the story it tells.It is not an impressive film for the directing or the acting Will Geer who many remember as Granpa Walton is a major star. but for the story it tells of the greed and corruption of American business and more importantly it is a major statement of feminist power. This was 1954 long before bra burning and the feminist movement but the role of the women in this film and the eventual triumph of the miners the film was based on an actual strike in New Mexico with their help is one that stirs the heart.As prejudice against MexicanAmericans is played out again today it is worth it to remember that this is nothing new. It is also worth it to remember that there were many women who fought for equality long before it became popular to do so. And while Kentucky is passing mine safety regulations in the face of recent deaths this again is not a new issue and many miners have died in the face of an uncaring government.I wish all would take the time to see this film. It is only 94 minutes and is available for free on Internet Archive. If you want a quality copy you can go to Ironweed Films for a copy. In fact you may want to join Ironweed Films so you can get your own copies of important works that are hard to find or unavailable elsewhere.".

I'm not talking about the unlawful action of the two cops in the back of the car but of the original stance of the police from the beginning at the picket line. That it just seems natural that they acted the way they did is a fault in you and me. Further many will look at the movie in disgust as it shows the big mean corporation as the villain.

Management today is more sophisticated with its use of public relations but essentially the same now as then.Finally to readers of a more conservative view I ask. If the strikers are guilty of disrespect of the property rights of the owners by picketing would you not feel that the company was criminally culpable of injuring the miner who was carried out of the mine?I have not seen a more realistic portrayal of the subject matter in any film made at any time. Still many people cannot see this movie as their prejudice blinds them to the subject. That only makes the movie greater in my opinion.Finally the actress who so skillfully portrayed Esperanza was deported back to Mexico and never played another role in a film in the US. At a time when Nixon was over in the USSR showing how much better the American way was than the communist way we were acting no more open to ideas than than they were behind the iron curtain.

Their subsequent crime? Salt of the Earth a 1954 film which documents a strike by MexicanAmerican zinc miners in New Mexico against their AngloAmerican management. The film was banned and kept out of American theatres until 1965 as it was deemed seditious and subversive. In many ways Salt of the Earth anticipates the works of Ken Loach particularly Bread and Roses.Unusually gritty for an American independent production during this period Salt and Earth delves headlong into the lives of the miners documenting their struggles for labour rights safety sanitation and economic justice. Like Loach's films during the 60s and 70s our roughfaced band of workers take their complaints to Union heads and bosses but their protests are quelled at every turn. More interesting though is the way the film documents the fights for equality WITHIN the bands of protesters the MexicanAmerican womenfolk must break down the shackles of Hispanic machismo must break through a kind of low level ethnospecific patriarchy achieving marital and communal equality within their own community and with their own spouses even as they struggle against their white bosses. What you eventually end up with is one of the first calculated works of feminism on screen and a fairly sophisticated leftist tract certainly more nuanced than your typical liberal message movie churned out by Stanley Kramer even if it is dated and naive in some minor respects.The film was funded by Unions and blacklisted artists and uses many neorealist touches which can be traced to the French Poetic Realists of the 30s and the Italian Neorealists of the 40s with real miners and Mexicans dotting the cast and the real President of the International Union of Mine Mill and Smelter Workers playing an onscreen union president. The film is much less crowd pleasing and sentimental than John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath  a great film in its own right despite Darryl Zanuck's footprints and despite Ford's Irish conservatism being at odds with his film's message  and more strongly resembles fare like Vidas Secas Barren Lives and Los Olvidados The Forgotten Ones other Western postwar leftist ie socialist tracts. Bizarrely though Steinbeck's 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath was slandered for being socialist and communist Ford's film released a year later was wildly embraced. It was only in the post War communist witchhunt years that such political leanings began to be viewed as being symptomatic of deviancy.8.510  Worth one viewing.

As a result the directing acting special effects and social attitudes of a specific era can live on in celluloid and seem hokey or even offensive today. Its not always easy to realize this I can't help but giggle when I witness the special effects in 1940's Thief of Bagdad but in the case of Salt of the Earth Herbert J. Biberman's masterpiece still remains ahead of its time.The story based on true events takes place in a small mining town in New Mexico. The Quintero family live in a small hobble with no running water and a tightening budget. As the patriarch Juan Chacon slaves away underground Esperanza his wife Rosaura Revueltas anxiously awaits the birth of yet another child. After a workplace accident facilitated by a questionable company policy the miners walk off the job. What starts out as a small organic labor strike soon turns into an engrossing drama about racial and gender politics.Everything is told from the pointofview of Esperanza who over the course of the film becomes more deeply involved with the labor union. Her along with a few key organizers help unite the splintered groups men and women Mexican and white miners. This of course is done with the stern disapproval of her husband and many of the men in town.Behind grainy resolution and cheap sets lies unbridled confidence both behind and infront of the camera. Rosaura Revueltas's voiceover evokes immediate sympathy to the character and her sunkissed natural beauty shines a bright light in some of the darker moments. Juan Chacon in his first and only film performance also does a fine job. He may not have the acting chops of a seasoned veteran but he nevertheless has a commanding stage presence that is not easily taught. The real treat however is Herbert J. Biberman's direction which brings to mind the best of Jean Renoir's American films but with a touch of Godard. In one intense scene he smashcuts between two pivotal moments creating a palpable tension that sent my heart fluttering.At the height of the Red Scare this unabashedly prounion film became a source of much controversy when it was released comprising of many progressive and blacklisted actors writers and producers. Produced on a minimal budget the film was only exhibited once before being blackballed for over a decade finally finding an audience within the burgeoning counterculture. In today's social and political climate Salt of the Earth remains as salient as ever. Occupy Wall Street could learn a lesson from Esperanza. We all could.httptheyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com".

This of course is done with the stern disapproval of her husband and many of the men in town.Behind grainy resolution and cheap sets lies unbridled confidence both behind and infront of the camera. Rosaura Revueltas's voiceover evokes immediate sympathy to the character and her sunkissed natural beauty shines a bright light in some of the darker moments. Juan Chacon in his first and only film performance also does a fine job. He may not have the acting chops of a seasoned veteran but he nevertheless has a commanding stage presence that is not easily taught. The real treat however is Herbert J. Biberman's direction which brings to mind the best of Jean Renoir's American films but with a touch of Godard. In one intense scene he smashcuts between two pivotal moments creating a palpable tension that sent my heart fluttering.At the height of the Red Scare this unabashedly prounion film became a source of much controversy when it was released comprising of many progressive and blacklisted actors writers and producers. Produced on a minimal budget the film was only exhibited once before being blackballed for over a decade finally finding an audience within the burgeoning counterculture. In today's social and political climate Salt of the Earth remains as salient as ever. Occupy Wall Street could learn a lesson from Esperanza. We all could.httptheyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com";

It's amazing really as the film is NOT procommunist at least not overtly and has to do with problems people of all political persuasions would agree are wrong. While this might have been controversial in its day today the film just seems very inspiring and well worth seeing.Salt of the Earth is set in the small town of San Marcosa community in New Mexico inhabited by HispanicAmericans who work in the mineand is based on an actual strike. It's very unusual in that it's told more from the point of view of the workers' wivesand it's narrated by her 'Esperanza'Rosaura Revueltas. Much of film is in Spanish but enough is in English that viewers should have no trouble understanding.The film focuses on a group of workers who have had enoughparticularly in regard to serious safety problems in the mines. In addition company stores poor sanitation and general discrimination against Hispanics all resulted in this walkout strike. Once this strike began it became obvious that the police were in the pockets of the owners and were used as instruments to try to intimidate and break up the union. In particular the beating of Ramon and birth of child is very compelling scene that illustrates this alliance.After many months the strike has continued and the women begin to assert themselves. While the husbands are very traditional and sexist the women begin demanding better sanitation and even begin to walk the picket lines once the men are courtordered to stop picketing. Will these folks be able to wait out the mine owners? The film is an incredibly sensitive and compelling film that humanizes the workers and familiarizes the viewer with their plight. I was not surprised to see Will Geer in a role as the sheriff as he had a long history of union and leftist politicsthis is not a criticismjust an observation. Overall an incredibly wellmade film considering that it mostly uses normal folks and not actors. It also is one of the most profeminist films of the eraand very compelling throughout. Well worth seeing...and this is coming from a guy who politically is relatively far to the right on many issues. A great portrait of some very brave Americans.".

The events are based on a true labor dispute halfway the twentieth century between American miners and the trust that controls their mine among many others. It is docudrama using realism and consequently what you get is what you see. This seems a good choice considering that there are already too much ambiguous films about trade unions for example On the Waterfront or the various Hoffa interpretations. There is little action and the film shots are sober but the suffering of the people guarantees that you remain focused if you have empathy. Interestingly a part of the characters play themselves. The miners feel that their wages are unfair and decide to strike with support of their union. The situation is particularly tense since the miners are of LatinAmerican origin and are discriminated by the mining company. Naturally the miners form a picket line in order to stop scabs and they succeed in this intention. The company decides to begin a war of attrition and the miners have a hard time in particular since the local sheriff takes side with the bosses. If we may believe the film story the police officers are not too lazy to harass the strikers and lock them up. It seems as thought the strike is lost when the court rules that the picket line is illegal. But then the wives of the miners step in and take over the picketing. After many months the trust finally caves in. At last a strike with a happy ending!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Salt of the Earth which came out in 1954 paints an almost too real picture of how migrant workers were treated before the civil rights movement. It is easy to see why the United States government which was going through The Red Scare during this time blacklisted this film. The film touches on and provokes many issues that were very sensitive during this era. Issues such as racism equality and feminism are the key themes in the movie. Racism was still very apparent in the United States during the 1950's namely because the civil rights movement had not happened yet. The film pits the whites or Anglos against the Mexican workers. However not all the whites in the film are depicted as evil. There are a few Caucasian workers who side themselves with the Mexicans. This gives the film a much more real atmosphere to it because it doesn't allude to one race being good and the other evil. Instead of simply having the whites be the antagonist the film sets the leader of the mining company up to be the antagonist. Despite having a few whites on the side of the Mexican workers the film clearly sympathizes with the Mexicans. The film controls the in a way so the audience will undoubtedly root with the workers. The Mexican workers have poor safety requirements which constantly lead to accidents on the site. This is all so the company can save money. When the Mexicans complain of this they are threatened with being replaced with an American worker by the foreman. The film does a good job of painting the leaders of the mining company as evil. There is a scene in the beginning where the foreman tells the workers to get back to work right after one of the workers is nearly killed in an explosion. This shows that the leaders have no compassion for the workers and that they are only in the business for the money with no care of the well being of the Mexicans. Also the scene where they capture Ramon Quintero and beat him is very powerful and really makes you sympathize with that character. Another issue the film tries to push is feminism. The film starts off early with the Mexican workers acting very sexist toward their wives. Ramon is very controlling of his wife Esperanza. There is an early scene where Ramon tells Esperanza to stop crying and wasting her time listening to the radio. This scene alone sets up the fact that sexism is an issue in this town. Another scene that depicts this fact is when all the women are trying to convince Esperanza to take part in a picket line. One of the wives complains that she works very hard and is still treated as though she is useless by her husband. However once the men are not allowed to take part in the picket line the women become very involved. The men begin to understand that the wives can help with the strike. The film came out in 1954. The United States was in a false sense of calm during this time. The economy was booming. This lead to the growth of materialism and the country was becoming vastly capitalist. With the exception of the cold war and the communist scare the country was going through a very calm time. Salt of the Earth acts as a sort of a wake up call. It pushes all of these unseen issues to the light so people can become aware that there are still injustices going on inside the country. The main point of the film is equality. The film's conflict is a struggle for the races and sexes to become equal in the eyes of the government. Salt of the Earth was clearly ahead of it's time.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the early 1950's film studios were under attack from two directions. Small screen TV had put a big dent in theatre attendance while the Mc Carthyite cold war had put a big chill in the cultural milieu. A formerly lucrative industry found itself suddenly reeling with a future no longer very certain. In short the commercial winds had changed and Hollywood needed an overhaul. To meet TV's challenge studio moguls introduced big screen Cinerama biblical spectaculars and fullcleavage romance goddesses to please congressional investigators they fired unrepentant leftwingers and blackballed them from future employment. Social commentary never much of a staple disappeared entirely while the escapism of Westerns Tennessee Williams and bedroom innuendo took over. The 50's had arrived with a vengeance. Against this backdrop Salt of the Earth appears to have parachuted in from another planet. In retrospect the film's look feel and values plus use of nonactors represent an anti Hollywood aesthetic in just about about its purest form. Instead of the usual ersatz there are company shacks a desolate land and real workers sometimes speaking a foreign tongue about hot water and labor solidarity. This was and is about as far removed from the fabled dream factory as any commercial film before or since. To my knowledge Salt is the only professional movie made in America by known communists. And though I've seen it a number of times I've yet to detect a theme that any conscionable liberal would disagree with. The emphasis throughout is on reform not revolution. So why was the movie so thoroughly ostracized. Aside from the obvious negatives there are two aspects that challenge patriotic assumptions about the power of the individual. The strikers win because of their solidarity that is their capacity to overcome internal divisions in pursuit of common goals. But more importantly theirs is a leaderless solidarity. Unlike so many other labor films no one person arises in Salt to take charge or direct the actions of the others. No single iconic personality dominates. Community of labor is the real agent of change and victor here while no one individual can be pointed to as indispensable. Second through the pivotal role of Esperanza a professional actress the individual is shown as flowering amidst the common effort. Far from being submerged in a faceless mass she discovers through participation a heightened sense of individualness and a wealth of hidden talents. Moreover a stronger more confident Esperanza means a stronger more confident strike effort. In short it's not individuality versus the group but individuality from within the group. I don't know how subversive these ideas ultimately are but I do know they challenge decades of iconic filmmaking in which the omnipotent movie star a John Wayne or a Sylvester Stallone is transformed into a demigod and exalted above the common folk. Against this grain Salt seeks to empower its audience not disempower. There are many fine touches in the film. I'm glad the workers are not romanticized nor are the bosses or their lawenforcement allies caricatured. Instead the hardscrabble families are treated as ordinary people able nevertheless to act intelligently beyond the cultural limits placed upon them. Ordinarily the viewer would expect a heavy hand with such politically charged material however the producers have the good sense to hew to a lighter approach that features unexpected deposits of humor as when the men whine about being forced to hang out the wash. This furnishes both a good laugh and an incisive piece of social commentary. In fact most of the movie's considerable humor comes from its strong feminist subtext certainly a striking exception to the Ozzie and Harriet stereotypes of the period. Despite an obvious appeal to cultural historians Salt is much more than a mere artifact. There is of course no more Mc Carthyled purge and miners' wives have long since gotten hot water and indoor plumbing thanks to labor militancy. Nevertheless the film's social themes continue to reach beyond that longago period. Women continue to strive for equality just as the workers' wives in Salt struggled as domestics against the chauvinism of their husbands. Moreover the need for racial equality remains as pressing now as it was in Michael Wilson's prescient screenplay. And of course there's labor's ongoing battle to get something like a fair share of the wealth it produces. Far from being a dead artifact the power of this suppressed treasure along with the courage of the men and women who made it continues to echo across the decades furnishing inspiration to generations to come.".

Especially since James Purefoy is wonderful in it. After his performance in Vanity Fair a serious and heartbreaking dramatic role it's nice to know that he is just as capable of making a funny lighthearted film as well. Everyone else is grand as well except for Patrick Swayze who just sort of walked through his role. Even the simple scaleddown fairy tale type dialogue just sounded awful falling out of his mouth like clumps of halfchewed food. Of course the CGI dragons aren't exactly as slick as you'd like them to be in 2005 but the cinematography is beautiful and the editing is fast and keeps the pace rolling along at a good clip.Did I mention that James Purefoy is wonderful? And the outtakes at the end are great!".

James Purefoy and Piper Perabo were wonderful  and had a good chemistry. Piper was absolutely delectable as a spunky confident woman. Certainly not 'period' at all but then the really good princesses never are.James Purefoy was equally enjoyable  he seems very much the natural whether on horseback wielding a sword or doing a classic doubletake. He makes every scene his own with great charm.Michael Clarke Duncan while having a small role was enjoyable and would have liked to see have seen his character more fully developed.Patrick Swayze was very very weak  he didn't seem interested in what he was doing unless it was a fight scene. An English accent wouldn't have killed him either.But I had fun with the movie  I laughed out loud more than once and really really enjoyed the jokes. I thought that they kept the tongueincheek quality at just the right level.".

	schema:reviewBody "Returning from the crusades our hero George wants nothing else than to get a piece of land and to settle down. Soon he finds himself on a quest to find a lost princess. A princess who turns out to have quite a big secret.George and the Dragon is a simple and light medieval comedy that takes on the story of StGeorge and the dragon. But foremost it is a traditional knightrescuingprincess story with a dragon a king some bandits an evil guy and a few good fights. It would probably fare well amongst the younger movie viewers.Michael Clarc Duncan is far from convincing as a moor with that wide American accent but that does not matter. The filmmakers seem to have focused more on having fun than trying to outdo the LOTRseries. And if you still were in doubt you will be convinced by the clumsy thatcher falling in the town scene. The movie is pleasantly free from overbearing Hollywood clich humor that most simple comedies are contaminated with.The story is very simple and quite skittish first this happens then he did that then they did this. No quirky explanations or long winded story and there are really no surprises you could not figure out far ahead. Nothing for the movie buff but perhaps just the thing for a younger audience. Especially since the violence is quite harmless and of course there is a happy ending. My only complaint is how the Picts scots? are depicted no pun intended as simple grunting savages. But hey! I guess SOMEONE had to play that part.George James Purefoy is charming as the hero and the princess Piper Perabo is willful and strong although she feels like a college sweetheart at some points. The role of Garth seemed made for Patric Swayze and the rest of the cast are quite likable as well.If you are looking to be dazzled with a good story sparkling action and mesmerizing effects. Look elsewhere or be disappointed. If you accept this as a simple happygolucky knights tale you'll be better off. Perhaps not worth the movie admissions but should be great on TV or as a rental for the kids. Who knows it might turn out to become a childhood classic just as The Princess Bride.".

I heard he did want to plain villains but he still looks best as romantic hero by his manners and thus he fits well for this role since his character is quite ambiguous not romantic not sensitive eager for power and fame but he does show the qualities of a strong chief and he's also drawing sympathies as a deft and humorous warrior. Almost until the end I was hoping they would still end up friends with George as they started out being naturally attracted to one another as two of a kind but the end roughly outlines the core difference between them  purity of the heart even still showing their similarities.Well the bottom line  that's not a piece of art but a very good entertainment perfect for kids. Simple nice and romantic plot a classical fairytale story with right moral accents. Very good set of actors the characters are almost all hilarious what of the Father Bernard played by JeanPierre Castaldi or George's best friend out of Crusades  Tarik the Moor played by Michael Clarke Duncan! None of good guys in the film actually is too good  they're not white and noble but they are good at heart! And thus we have a moral too to judge people by their hearts and actions not just their manners. And the plot is not without a knot  quite a nice  kind upside down view of a famous Christian legend of George the Dragon slayer!".

Well I guess I'm no different.I saw this movie listed on my You might like this list at one of the DVD websites and after scoffing at it here and there wondering what kid of film would have such unimpressive DVD cover art technically very good but nothing unique for a title I'd never heard of? After a while I became curious dismissed it then became curious again until I finally broke down a bought a copy.It was pleasantly enjoyable for what it was. The sets costumes and even the acting were respectable and entertaining. The truth is this is a kids' flick so you can't really expect truetohistory swordsmanship and all that went with it. It's meant to tell a tale of knights and chivalry to youngsters who are into that sort of thing. And the film does so successfully.I have no great love for the film but I appreciate it for what it is and even then I think it's A quality flick in terms of historic children's' fair. Respectably shot though somewhat skidding a rough gray area of prosaic and inspired lensing the film achieves a certain artistry that might be compared to some of the black and white classics in terms of shot composition. But maybe that's getting too high falutin' for film meant for younger ages.There's some contemporary pop culture references and the acting is a little over done but again it's all aimed at younger audiences.The one interesting aspect was to see Patrick Swayze in a historicfantasy film. One is so used to seeing him in films dipped in Americana that it almost almost seemed out of place for a middle aged Texan to be donning chain mail and strapping on a sword. But he's an actor. That's his job. He can be anybody. Does he succeed? He sure does. He's in the same thespian league as the rest of the cast.It's an entertaining little film that should put grins on young boys and girls alike on a lazy weekend. If my adult side had a serious criticism well I'll just keep those to myself Not a big favorite of mine but something that shows that a film in this genre can succeed. It's a film that despite being aimed at younger viewers shows that there's more than enough story material that can be eeked out of a period that's very unfamiliar to most people. In fact this film didn't need all the theatrics and SFX had it been aimed at an older crowd. It shows how this kind of stuff is truly interesting to people... dragons or no.With that in mind give it a chance.Enjoy with the family ".

The sets costumes and even the acting were respectable and entertaining. The truth is this is a kids' flick so you can't really expect truetohistory swordsmanship and all that went with it. It's meant to tell a tale of knights and chivalry to youngsters who are into that sort of thing.

I quickly realized this was the George and the Dragon movie I'd been wanting to see. However I didn't have very high expectations.But ultimately it's not that bad. It has some major problems. The plot becomes a bit incoherent at times. The editing is NOT good. The special effects are NOT good and I'm not really that picky about such things. However the actors lift it slightly above mediocrity. James Purefoy is fun to watch as the warweary knight who just wants an acre and two head of cows and finds himself on a rather odd journey. Piper Perabo is cute as the spunky princess though they never adequately explain why she is so obsessed with dragons. Their relationship follows the usual path of such movies antagonism followed by mutual attraction. The supporting players are pretty good as well.Keep your expectations low and you'll enjoy the movie. It could have been a lot better but it's pretty high quality for the Sci Fi Channel.".

The entire cast was splendid especially the parts of the skateboarding priest! The only character that was slightly disappointing was Patrick Swayze's character. I had not seen Patrick in a film for a long time and I was slightly disappointed with him in this. He didn't seem to really become the character he was playing. He seemed awkward throughout the film. Like the character did not really suit him. But aside from that I loved the film. It was so nice to see a movie where the whole family can sit down and watch it. There was no cussing no sex no gore. It was an action packed romantic wholesome family movie. On a little side note and responding to a review I had read earlier this movie is in fact based on a children's book. It is titled Saint George and the Dragon and is by Margaret Hodges. I used to love this book when I was little and having seen it come to life on the big screen made the movie all the more special.

Yes it is a bit geared more for a younger audience but as I don't watch rated R movies myself this suited me just fine. Anyone who has seen the Princess Bride can't miss the blatant reference. Still a good movie and as for Purefoy fans it's one of his best. The really great things is he gets the limelight and he actually plays the good guy. Please don't let the discouraging reviews keep you from watching this movie. I thought it was wonderful. Not too much gore not too much cursing if there were any. It's the perfect family movie just enough action to keep the boys interested and just enough romance to keep the girls interested. The best part there's a happy ending.".

The princess is great that perfect mix of sass and feminity a' la' Princess Leia and she can take on three large picts without having to boot to the groin! I never knew bowling was originally done by hanging people upside down and using their head as the ball. Then the movie gets boring. The story keeps rolling along with the good guys trying to protect a dragon egg the last of the dragons. The humor stops completely. The story much less the boring drab sets is just not strong enough to hold interest. They spent the 32 million budget on a few actors and a few nice camera shots and the dragon all 3 or 4 scenes. The battle scene at the end doesn't do anything to grab your interest back. Micheal Clark Duncan's reappearance can't save it. If you fall asleep during this one don't worry all the fun was at the beginning.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike the title suggest this movie hardly features any dragons and the movie should perhaps had been titled George and the Dragon Egg.Still the movie further more features all of the adventures ingredients you would expect. Swordfights princesses traveling villains. The movie is a fairly good adventure family for the entire family. The movie features some violence but the fun musical score by Gast Waltzing makes sure that the movie remains always light and fun to watch no matter how serious or scary the movie ever gets.The story is rather weak and simple and the way it is told makes things even worse. Everything is told so formulaic and predictable that nothing ever comes as a surprise or across as well written. It makes everything that happens in the movie feel disjointed and also quite messy. The character treatment is poor and at least halve of the characters that are introduced seems to be redundant for the movie. Tom Reeve obviously is not a very experienced director yet and I'm not too sure if the real talent for it is present. He often works as a producer or second unit director of Baction movies. The kind of stuff Dolph Lundgren Rutger Hauer and Christopher Lambert star in. This production is definitely a stepup from those movies but Tom Reeve didn't handled this opportunity very well.Appearantly the movie cost 32000000 to make but it doesn't really show in the movie. Sure the sets and costumes all do look nice but what the movie lacks are some truly impressive and large scale sequences or even some spectacular action sequences. It makes the movie really low budget looking. Looks like they spend most of the budget on the cast.The cast is surprisingly enough filled with some big names but yet the casting gets no thumbs up from me. James Purefoy is a good actor and he mostly showed that in the HBO miniseries Rome but he's not good and charismatic enough to play the main heroic character of this movie. The supporting cast is far more impressive with actors like Patrick Swayze Piper Perabo Michael Clarke Duncan and Val Kilmer in a small cameo. But unfortunately for most of them also goes that they're miscast in their roles. Piper Perabo plays her character with an overdone English accents that doesn't suit her. It makes you wonder why didn't cast a real English and good actress instead. Also Patrick Swayze feels really out of place in this movie but he at least seemed to be enjoying himself playing in this movie. The highlight of the movie is perhaps the Val Kilmer cameo.Still the movie entertains enough to consider this a watchable enough at least if your expectations for it aren't too high. The movie does have its good and adventurous moments but it all is not quite good and impressive enough to consider this a real truly great genre movie.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Director Marchent achieved in Nine cutthroats possibly his best work of a modest career  with some memorable scenes  shockingly violent and good camera movement  as he creates a strange Western that manages to be both scary  tragic and skilfully made . This in a 1972 Spanish Western whose brutality and gore quotient led it to be marketed as a horror film during its original U.S. release with terror masks given out to ticket buyers . It turns out to be a rare spaghetti Western  as you can bone up on the bloodier side of that genre  including rape  bloody killing  cannibalism  nightmares with zombiealike and many other things . It relies heavily on a complex narrative  modern narration full of flashbacks  stopframes and an uneven screenplay written by both  Santiago Moncada and the same director Joaqin Romero Marchent . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely horrifying to the bizarre along with eerie and amazing frames . It packs a high bodycount  it is sometimes slow moving and claustrophobic  in spite of setting on outdoors . It's a thrilling western with spectacular scenarios and breathtaking confrontation among protagonists . This interesting but depressing film contains nasty characters  ambition  human drama  passion  tragical events  complemented with a colorful cinematography and moving musical score . These elements provide the setting for this piece of dramatic deeds  giving it its own special quality and ambient  making a strong description about a drama of survival and greedy . The musician Carmelo Bernaola composes a nice soundtrack  well conducted  this turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie as it's full of thrilling sounds and haunting musical background . Nice cinematography  though being necessary a right remastering  photography in Panoramic and Eastmancolor filmed by excellent cameraman Luis Cuadrado on locations in Spanish Pyrenees from Huesca  including gorgeous snowy outdoors  good sets by Cubero and Jose Luis Galicia who carried out most production design on Western shot in Spain.The motion picture was compellingly directed and in personal style by Joaquin Luis Romero Marchent at his best . He began directing two films for producer Ignacio F. Iquino such as Juzgado Permanente and Sor Anqelica . Marchent replaced Mexican director Fernando Soler filming El Coyote and the sequel titled Revenge of Coyote  both of them shot in Mexico . These successes along with The shadow of Zorro and Revenge of Zorro became a notorious writer and director of good Western . He went go directing Paella Western as  Riding to death   Adventures in the West  Three good men Sabor Venganza   Fedra West and of course Condenados a Vivir .

CutThroats Nine belongs to that small variety that brought horror sensibilities to the genre like Sartana Django the Bastard and others but it also took it one step further. Whereas other westerns were content to be dark and brooding in an atmospheric kind of way CutThroats is as violent and graphic as any Italian horror movie from the 70's.The plot is minimal but quite good. For better or for worse the director doesn't go for the psychological angle between captor and captives like Anthony Mann's The Naked Spur did but instead focuses on the violence and nihilism that is the logical conclusion when nine ugly dangerous criminals chained to each other are transported through the barren desolate terrain to a nearby fort.On the western front CutThroats is as bleak and unforgiving as the gritty works of Sergio Corbucci minus the finesse and style of that great cinematician. The feeling is there though. The snowy rocky landscape the nihilistic unredeemable characters the grit and the violence. There are no heroes and cowboys with white hats here. If John Wayne were to set foot in the western universe CutThroats portrays he would sooner pack his things and find a new hobby like sewing. Much like Hitchcock's Psycho the person closer to what we could identify as the hero is burnt to a crisp 30 minutes in. That's where the movie ultimately succeeds. By being deprived of all certainty you're left hanging there in the snow with a bunch of ugly cutthroats. Speaking of cutting throats there's more people get stabbed intestines pour out others are burnt alive beaten mercilessly nailed to hooks get their brains blown out corpses are burnt legs are cut off. And with all the same graphic detail one would expect from a gruesome Italian horror from the likes of Fulci or Lenzi. Coupled with the general takenoprisoners meanspirited air that permeates every minute CutThroats is more likely to appeal to exploitation fans than the traditional western crowd.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cutthroats Nine one heck of a bleak movie. Coming out in 1972 spaghetti westerns were no longer at the height of their hype as most of them became terrible parodies of themselves. Then came along this ultra violent movie by Joanquin Romero Marchent. I for one woulden't call this the most original spaghetti western or paella western since it's Spanish but that don't mean it has to be bad. The scenery of where the movie is set is beautiful which helps the film have a bigger feeling of a claustrophobic tension. Claustrophobic? Why i say that? Because despite it being set outdoors for most of the time our nine main characters are cut off from the rest of the world and they only depend on each other in order to survive. Essentially speaking you don't really see any good characters and even though Spain were not completely fascist during the second world war you could tell that elements of fascism found it's way in it's script. As stated earlier this movie has a claustrophobic vibe throughout the film and making the situation our nine titular characters are involved in even worse are most of the gruesome killings that take place throughout the film including to the main character played by Robert Hundar. Spoiler alert but seeing his character dying early on the film by being burned to death leaving his daughter played by Emma Cohen distraught and alone and that part right there deeply affected and it made me realise These guys have no future. Overall the film has good performances although the dubbing is what one would say as amateur. The soundtrack is chilling although it does get a little repetitive sometimes and it would have been great if this was way longer then the 90 minutes and make it into an epic 3 hour movie. I know Tarantino is influenced by this movie but it don't really affect the storyline that much. Great and unknown movie to watch.".

A band of really bad military prisoners are being transported to a new location.

Your expectations of who is who and what is what shifts around during its running time so rarely are you on solid ground about what is happening and who you can root for. Its a kick in the pants for anyone looking for a typical heroic western spaghetti or otherwise.I don't think the film is perfect. It meanders a bit too much and on some level I think it thinks its more important than it is but there is no denying that the film packs a wallop in the unremittingly ugly department.If you want to see a dog eat dog western with no good guys see this film.

	schema:reviewBody "CutThroats 9 is frequently named as the most violent eurowestern ever made but even though this is a righteous and welldeserved reputation it shouldn't be the only reason why genre lovers have to see it! This film primarily tells an engaging story which describes itself best as a variation on the 'survival of the strongest'theme blend with Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians and makes excellent use of its depressing filming locations. The film opens quite atmospherically with the introduction of seven tough and feared convicts that are being escorted from one prison to another. After a clumsy holdup they have to continue their journey on foot chained to each other and guided by only one remaining prison guard and his gorgeous daughter. Ingenious plottwists follow pretty soon and even though it's no real spoiler I prefer not to mention them here already because they're well worth checking out yourself! Don't immediately assume that CutThroats 9 is a nonstop series of bloodshed and gratuitous violence though. The murders are indeed shown very graphically and the nature of this violence is truly meanspirited yet director Joaqun Luis Romero Marchent nice name by the way never at one point loses his focus on the compelling storyline. This is one of those very rare flicks in which really none of the characters can count on your sympathy since even the supposed 'good guys' are greedy and egocentric bastards. Admittedly there are a couple of tedious moments to struggle yourself through and the acting often comes across as rather amateurish. The music however is great and the abrupt nihilistic ending excellently fits the overall disturbing tone of the movie. There's few to no sleaze but the extreme and downright sick violence widely makes up for this. Definitely recommended IF your stomach can take it".

	onyx:emotionText "CutThroats 9 is frequently named as the most violent eurowestern ever made but even though this is a righteous and welldeserved reputation it shouldn't be the only reason why genre lovers have to see it! This film primarily tells an engaging story which describes itself best as a variation on the 'survival of the strongest'theme blend with Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians and makes excellent use of its depressing filming locations. The film opens quite atmospherically with the introduction of seven tough and feared convicts that are being escorted from one prison to another. After a clumsy holdup they have to continue their journey on foot chained to each other and guided by only one remaining prison guard and his gorgeous daughter. Ingenious plottwists follow pretty soon and even though it's no real spoiler I prefer not to mention them here already because they're well worth checking out yourself! Don't immediately assume that CutThroats 9 is a nonstop series of bloodshed and gratuitous violence though. The murders are indeed shown very graphically and the nature of this violence is truly meanspirited yet director Joaqun Luis Romero Marchent nice name by the way never at one point loses his focus on the compelling storyline.

	schema:headline " CutThroats Nine A very peculiar film";
	schema:reviewBody "I am going to start of by saying that yes this film was indeed very gory most especially the upclose disembowelment being the goriest scene in the film in my opinion. And for 1972 I was highly impressed with the realism of the gore and all of the other special effects for that matter. The gore is what this film advertised as it's main selling point however when I saw this film I was quite pleasantly surprised by many of the other great features the film also contained.I very much enjoyed the directing from a shot perspective the composition of scenes such as the flashback hanging scene looked really cool and sinister. And the unsettling reversed collapsing house in the hallucination sequence was in my opinion genius.And not forgetting the story. It is quite a depressing and bleak story in which ultimately no one has what they want to happen. To me most of the film seemed like nothing much was happening. So for the first part of the film I was kind of looking for a story line as it got past the intro. That was until I realised that I was beginning to feel rather uneasy as the film progressed. It was slowly but surely building a dark tension that kept me watching with suspense. And I won't reveal it in detail but I was impressed to an surprising amount with the twist in the end which I did not expect at all. It did not only shock me but also brought everything together that didn't make sense before in a nice and tidy way. From that perspective I loved it but as I'm not a fan of bleak and depressing stories it didn't enjoy me as much as it could have.The acting is something I cannot fault either. Although it was an English dubbed version I watched it did not distract me from the performances given.But the main point I must say about this film is that it is very peculiar. It's a Spanishmade Western. But it's not just a Western it's a Crime Thriller gorefest that had a very Horror feel to it thanks to the fabulously eerie directing of Marchent. Indeed a very strange selection of genres to put together but it worked! Overall I was quite surprised how it exceeded my expectations! Personally I am rating it 7.510 it's not a masterpiece but it is definitely a very enjoyable film that that didn't bore me. The reason my star rating is 1010 is because I feel it needs to be higher on the overall IMDb rating yes I know that's not how I'm supposed to do it and that rating probably won't make any difference!".

I don't know what these reviewers are griping over name another American or Eurowestern so gory and violent together? The Wild Bunch violent yes not gory. The story is good and to me well written it grasps your attention from beginning to end and unravels a subplot of why the Sgt. had these particular men selected to be escorted 400 miles to Fort. Green. I also thought it was clever how they made the chains out of gold disguising them as ordinary chains from the gold mine to Ft. Green to fool the bandits as well as the prisoners. It seems there has been quite a few mixed emotions about this later SW but lets face it the genre was fading out fast most ideas where out played and director Marchent gives us a breath of fresh air with the ingredients of mixing the cold terrain with violence and gore and fresh new story ideas made a fantastic little movie. I was very impressed with Robert Hundar's acting as well as Emma Cohen who played his daughter. The best of the bad guys was Dandy Tom Alberto Dalbeswho was sensational. The music was good with eerie whistles and sounds. I don't know what there is to dislike about this movie but SW fans well like the ending and should understand why the Sgt's daughter did what she did. in her frame of mind to lose everything why go on living family lover and dignity.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a really riveting film. I found it to be somewhat hit and miss but it's good points definitely outweigh the bad points.The best part of the movie is the story itself. The plot is quite original. Although it involves both gold and revenge it is not your typical quest for gold or revenge tale and things don't happen the way you think they are going to. The movie really draws you in as the motivations interactions and relationships between nine very violent individuals unfold as they make their perilous trek across the wintery landscape.I think the splatter aspect of this movie has been overemphasized in descriptions of the film. It is quite violent and it has some gore but it's not The Texas Chainsaw Massacre by any means. Don't watch it expecting a horror movie because it's really just a western with a gory violent streak. There is a really cool scene where one of the criminals thinks he sees a ghost. It would have been even better if they had made the ghost real instead of just a figment of his imagination.There is some really good camera work and interesting use of flashback scenes that add a touch of surrealism to the movie although a couple of the flashback scenes involve the gambler murdering a woman from his past and have absolutely nothing to do with the story. Those particular scenes should have been left out because they only serve to confuse.The biggest disappointment here is the music score. I know this is a Spanish western but I would have liked it to have a more spaghetti sounding score. Instead it sounds like a very good Hollywood style score which puts it several notches below the average spaghetti western score in my book.This is still a great movie overall. It doesn't have as many stylistic touches as a lot of other Eurowesterns but this incredible story will keep you glued to the edge of your seat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Conedandos a vivir 1972 was and is marketed purely as a violent exploitation film. Viewers approach it that way and either find it terribly vacant and crude or enjoy those aspects of the movie that are hyped up by hucksters. As the eurowestern was widely marketed as violent and cynical this advertising tactic that often blinds viewers to what is actually occurring onscreen. This is unfortunate as this movie is actually a well thought out and decently executed western that provides the nihilistic capstone to an interesting series of Spanish westerns made in the midtolate 1960s and early 1970s. Viewed in that tradition as the terminal point in a genre narrative that began much earlier in films like Joaquin Marchent's own El Sabor de la venganza 1963 it is a moving and fascinating movie.Contrary to the reputation of the Mediterranean westerns made in Italy and Spain in the 1960s and 70s these movies are not simply absurd and extreme distortions of the original American genre somewhat like Red River 1948 or Rio Bravo 1959 projected into a hall of mirrors. Instead of warped conventions without significance these movies contained their own views of society and morality. Many of the westerns written or directed by Spaniards have a very interesting perspective of the nature of violence that is central to plot and character. Violence is a contagion that consumes everything and everyone in it's vicinity. In movies like El Hombre que mat a Billy el Nio 1967 El Sabor de la venganza 1963 or Garringo 1969 victims are transformed into victimizers through the alchemy of good intentions in a corrupt society. There is always a character who has a close personal relationship with the victimturnedvictimizer who both opposes the political corruption and also it's products including their friend or brotherson. Outlaws are portrayed in bestial terms a pack dominated by the most brutal one. These movies always end with an ambiguous sacrifice to necessity.With Condenados a vivir this formula reaches it's fullest development. Isolated in the wilderness there is nothing to stall the corrosive assault of brutality. Every member of the group is degraded and virtually every onscreen character is dead by the final credits. Sarah Brown Emma Cohen is the only character who opposes this effect in any way though her response is ambiguous as it involves a hopeless and absolute nihilism. In this series of movies the typical genre ending of a shootout in the street or synonymous act becomes endlessly complicated. The exorcism of violence by violence must according to the logic of these narratives only perpetuate the contagion  an inescapable circularity.This movie has a sort of resurrection of the dead hero in the manner of the Italian brand of western but here it occurs in the delusions of an insane fugitive. However whereas in the Italian movies this returnfromthegrave is followed by a sort of liberation of a community in this movie this is only a guiltridden and confused hallucination.As in most of these Spanish movies the technical execution lags far behind the narrative sophistication. The goreeffects will strike you as laughable if you are in the right mood. However allinall this movie is a successful and sincere bmovie and as such I recommend it. With El Sabor de la venganza this is Joaquin Marchent's best western.Top spaghetti western list httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849907Average SWs httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849889For fanatics only bottom of the barrel httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849890".

	schema:reviewBody "CutThroats Nine 1972  12 out of 4Spanish Spaghetti Western has a large cult following but in the end I was pretty much letdown after reading all the hype. Seven hardened criminals are heading to a prison camp being led there by a man Claudio Undari who is also taking his daughter Emma Cohen along for the trip. Soon the seven men bust free and of course set their eyes on freedom and the daughter. This film has a somewhat legendary following due to some gore that is sparkled throughout the film. This gore is certainly the highlight of the movie but it also somewhat takes away from any atmosphere or plotting. I think the biggest problem I had with the film was its story which I found to have an interesting concept but the final payoff really wasn't there. I also thought the dialogue was rather weak and since there are all sorts of dialogue scenes this just made the film slow down and at times drag. I think the biggest goof in the plot is the fact that this man would take his daughter with him on a trip that contained seven deadly men as well as incredibly bad weather. This plot point might not bother most but it got on my nerves as it meant the daughter was just there for some nudity and to be attacked. Even with all that said the film is still somewhat entertaining due to a strange and surreal tone that runs from start to finish. The film has a really low budget and I think this also helps things well. The performances are also rather good and I really enjoyed Undari as the father.".

	schema:headline " Strong and awful Western exploitation";
	schema:reviewBody "Spanish director Joaquin Luis Romero Marchent is responsible for this violent 1972 Euro western which according to some sources is also an Italian coproduction. That is believable when the first scenes of gratuitous bloodletting take place on screen as this is also mentioned to be the most violent Euro Western ever made! Was it? Well definitely not the most violent in the word's most serious sense as real disturbing and effective violence is NOT just blood and gore thrown on screen as in this film but at least the goriest most exploitative and among the very worst too.A bunch of sadistic criminals killers and rapists are transported through difficult circumstances to another prisongold mine through snowy and cold mountains somewhere where nature is much more beautiful than men. Something goes wrong and their horses and carriage falls and breaks forcing the men to continue their journey by foot in the freezing and white forest that surrounds them. There's a guard who is supposed to take them to the destination as well as his beautiful daughter Emma Cohen who naturally attracts the convicts. So the guard and the daughter are at the mercy of the convicts and they all are at the mercy of nature.. Sounds like a pretty effective and potential premise and that also made me interest in this film alongside its extreme reputation but unfortunately the film has many flaws and concentrates only on one thing violence and gore.Some good things in the piece are the nasty hallucinations at the end during which neither the viewer nor the characters know anymore what is true and what is not. The backwards explosion comes very unexpected and is also even surreal which is a very positive merit. Also the beautiful white setting would give plenty to the visual look of the film as well as contrast to the evil characters if used as effectively as in Sergio Corbucci's masterful Il Grande Silenzio 1968 Italy but now it all leaves just to the starting point in Condenados a Vivir. The film's US title Cutthroats Nine definitely tells what was the main interest among the producers with this film.There is no real camerawork the music is very annoying and useless the actors are often irritating and just too boring to look at as none of them develops to anything and the film is also awfully too long and boring as there are prolonged scenes of walking and talking with hyper slow speed. The film runs approximately 90 minutes in NTSC but that feels like watching someone's hand held unfocused amateurish holiday video for two hours.The graphic violence and nastiness is indeed quite strong and the film looks pretty much like Lucio Fulci and Giannetto De Rossi whose Italian work is filled with similar blood flowing close ups and other hellish gore carnage. When someone gets hit or otherwise hurt in Condenados a Vivir they always show the result without hiding anything so violence could not be any more gratuitous and also flat than it is in this film. It doesn't have any kind of impact on those who have seen more films of course this is shocking for the squeamish and unexperienced with several scenes of bloodletting limb hacking etc. but cinema is just for so much more than this. The ending is also quite pessimistic and nihilistic but since everything before it was nothing even the ending seems just gratuitous without are real intentions to say something about human nature or how men can change in certain situations for example. Condenados a Vivir is perhaps the worst Euro Western I've seen so far but since it's quite rare and has this questionable reputation among the enthusiasts of obscure cinema I'm glad I saw it as a fan of B cinema and exploitation cinema but still I would have expected much more. But fortunately we have names like Sergio Leone Corbucci Sollima and Alejandro Jodorowsky among others. These are the names that have made real movies out of the skeleton of Condenados a Vivir. 210".

	schema:reviewBody "Joaqun Romero Marchent's Condenados A Vivir aka. CutThroats Nine is a raw and uncompromising film about survival hate and violence that has the reputation of being the most violent Eurowestern. And for good reasons  The most violent or not it certainly is the goriest Eurowestern out there I'm not calling it a Spaghetti Western since the film is Spanish and Claudio Undari is the only Ialian actor involved in it and the movie is full of entirely despicable characters and a constant atmosphere of hate greed and brutality.Sgt. Brown Claudio Undari is to escort a bunch of dangerous criminals through a mountain wasteland in a cold winter. The Seargant's beautiful daughter Emma Cohen is also traveling with her father and the prisoners who are chained together. Convinced that it transports gold a gang ambushes the coach in the middle of nowhere and the Seargant his daughter and the seven murderous bloodthirsty prisoners are forced to walk...CutThroats Nine is a gruesome Eurowestern that is in some aspects atypical for the Western genre. There is not too much gunplay for example. Gorefans will be pleased to hear that there is a lot of more explicit violence such as cutting burning and stabbing instead. The welldeserved reputation as the goriest Eurowestern is not the only reason to watch his film that not only Spaghetti Western enthusiasts like myself should enjoy. Any fan of brutal uncompromising pessimistic cinema should be pleased by this heroless movie in which almost every character is a real bastard. The bleak winter mountain setting reminds of Sergio Corbucci's masterpiece The Great Silence of 1968 although the locations and photography are of course not nearly as impressive here.Condenados A Vivir may not be everybody's taste but it is definitely a film experience that one is not likely to forget. Uncompromising brutal and not for the fainthearted CutThroats Nine is highly recommended to any fan of Eurowesterns and Goreflicks!".

The day has gone badly enough and now Sgt. Brown has to get these guys to the nearest town while they sing a song about how they are going to kill him the moment he turns his back! For a change this Western doesn't take place in a sandy desert but up on a snowy mountain which adds to the already grim situation. To make things even worse the bandits discover that Sgt Brown might be travelling with more than prisoners!It's basically one of those 'people trapped in the wilderness' films like Four Rode Out  Leslie Neilson as a bad guy!. I'm guessing it probably had some sort of influence on Tarantino's Hateful Eight although it'll be about 2034 by the time I get round to watching that. This film is probably more famous for its exploitation elements rather than being a Western. Often described as the most violent gory Western ever made it does deliver on the goods  as long as you understand it's very gory by Western standards not horror standards. People have their throats slit get graphically shot in the face burned alive disembowelled and such like but it's not a constant gore fest either. Luckily it's also got a story to tell as well all filmed in an almost cinema verite fashion I think that's French for 'delibarately half arsed'. It's also a film where you shouldn't get too attached to any particular character and even throws in some kind of hallucinogenic zombie attack! Grim stuff all the way through.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was marketed is the goriest western ever made. It has been categorized as a horror film. It is not and it's all the better for it. CutThroats Nine is indeed gory but that is not the primary focus of the film. It has a great story to go along with it full of intriguing characters and great visuals.But before we get off the subject of gore let's talk about it. The gore in this film is great and it's very welldone. It's fun and exciting and gross when it should be but not overly revolting as may be suggested by the terror mask required for all viewers per early advertisements. It's hard for me to say just how realistic the violence in this movie is as I'm not an expert in that sort of thing and don't know how much a person's real life guts might look like a tin of spaghetti but the effects are very masterfully done look great on the screen and get the desired reaction and then some. But the film isn't constantly violent. The bloodshed comes and goes from scene to scene. Some scenes have it and some don't and sometimes we follow the story for a long time without any violence. It is never forced into the story for its own sake and that's what is good about it. I almost get the impression that the idea to market this film based on its gore was an afterthought not planned for before shooting the film and possibly only decided on when the filmmakers realized how truly well the effects had been accomplished.Moving on to the story it's nothing that's never been done before. We've got some convicts in the old west some bandits and a man out to avenge his murdered wife. But at the same time the way it's all put together it still feels fresh enough to keep the viewer engaged. And the best part about the story is how it's told. It's very well stylized but not overly so. I love how we get a glimpse into each character's past seeing flashes of their memories at pivotal moments. We only linger there for a few seconds and never get the whole story but we get just enough. Sometimes we don't even see anything that directly advanced the story but it always tells us something about the character. But the way that it's donealong with the opening narration and a few other aspects of the filmat first make it seem a bit corny until you realize that the director knew exactly what he was doing and everything works together for the overall effect of the film.The one primary drawback for me was the film's setting. A group of convicts navigates its way through the harsh wintry mountains and they spend a good deal of the film in those mountains. It looks like much of it was shot on the same acre of land using different angles to make it seem like they were going places. This sort of thing normally wouldn't bother me but in an adventure movie with characters moving from place to place I would like a little bit more variety.I saw the VHS cut of this film which clocks in at 83 minutes. Much more might have felt too long given the stale environment but at that length it maintains a great pace and would be easy to watch again and again and to share with friends.I wouldn't suggest everyone rush out to find this movie as soon as possible and a goodquality copy seems impossible to find but it's worth viewing if you get the chance. I recommend CutThroats Nine to anyone who is in the mood for a good fun midnight western and doesn't want to think too much. Just don't forget your terror mask!".

	schema:reviewBody "If you can find this film and can take slowmoving cinema definitely pick it up. I came to it via Spirit of the Beehive Victor Erice's first film made in 1973. This film was his third made nearly twenty years later. It's somewhat sad that such a marvelous artist as Erice has only produced three films in almost thirty years now but I think Quince Tree of the Sun works in one way as a forgiveness for that fact. This film teaches nothing if not patience not only in the viewer but in the artist. It is a documentary about a painter who spends September through December painting a quince tree. Not a picture of one mind you or even one he has memorized. He sets up an elaborate system so that he can paint the tree as it exists before him. We see him working well at first with the sun hitting the tree and its fruit exactly how the painter wishes. But then the weather becomes uncooperative for a long period of time. It's cloudy or rainy and the sun is not working the way that it's supposed to. By the time it becomes sunny again the Earth has moved and all hope of painting it in the way he originally intedended is squandered. Of course he can't just wait until the next year. The fruit and leaves will be different.During the film there are several discussions about art and life. All are interesting. Too bad the subtitles on the Facets video are kind of hard to read at times. There is a lot to get out of it surely more than I did in one viewing. A second viewing is definitely in order if I have time before I have to return the video. It is one of those films that suggests that there is a ton more under the surface that will take just a tiny bit of digging. Of course this film would bore the socks off of 99 or more of the population. I definitely suggest it to fans of Spirit of the Beehive. Also fans of Andrei Tarkovsky should check it out this and Spirit of the Beehive. I generally think of Tarkovsky as the most original of all film artists but Erice may be the most similar. He's a very good auteur for Tarkovsky fans because he is similar but he has a remarkable essence all his own. Perhaps I would consider him above Tarkovsky if only Erice would make more films. But as this film has delicately taught me an artist must work at his own pace. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Caution Some spoiler content.This film feels like a documentaryno highs and no lowsbut is executed like a fiction. At the end of the film for example the director somewhat blurred the line between documentary reality and fiction. The tone of the movie is very flat and very monochromatic but I like the way it captures the creative process and struggle of the artist. The artist's philosophy of doing painting is very technical and rigidly methodical. The dialogue is mundane uncoached and true to real life but I think this films works because the formal compactness and control of the subject matter.The artist is committed to capture the reality of the quince tree under the sun although the weather is not always at his side. His method of painting is somewhat different from other painters as pointed out by one visitor the Chinese lady where she tells him that many painters paint their objects from photo. To this the artist replies that he feels closer to the tree when done that way that is by drawing the tree from the real source.As time goes by the artist is realising no way can he captures the truth about the quince tree in the way he wants it to be. In fact we are shown some of difficulties faced by the artist. For example we are being shown the windy day thus distorting the stable and rigid position of the leaves. The final blow comes when he sees in one morning the dead quince on the ground. The artist gives up in his mission at the end and to my surprise he let himself to become the object of art. This time with him laying on the bed and the film shows the almost finished painting which is presumably done by his wife. In one scene the painting and his actual lying on the bed is somewhat close to each other in reality that there is a sense that there's no difference between reality and the created objects. The artist falls asleep when his wife is making some final touch on the painting or is he dead?. Realising this the wife leaves him. I got the impression that the artist has given up his work and his life too.This film is particularly good at portraying the artist at work without pushing the ups and the downs of the artistic process. There are few memorable scenes for example when his old friend visits him and they sing together while the old friend is trying to keep the leave stable and the artist draws it. One scene is good too where the Chinese lady and the interpreter discuss with the artist about his work. All these scenesin fact almost all the scenesare done with no ups and downs of human life found in narrativedriven films.Because of the style of Erice's presentation of the subject matter this film is open to many interpretations. I think Erice seems to suggest that we love to capture everything into what we call art but we can never capture the truth of the stuff. The film also suggests filmmaking is also working under the same principal with painting and hence is defeated in the same manner. To illustrate it shows film camera with no operator but replacing the artist's standing point capturing the quince tree at night with the helps of artificial lighting. This is very interesting. We are being shown the artists in the artistic process. Then we are shown although somewhat suggestively the filmmakers in similar process. It's like saying making films and making a drawing is voyeuristic in nature.Two things happen simultaneously although the film focuses more on the artist. Erice is very restrained and reserved about making clear about the two events that they almost go unnoticed although I think this is justifiable. The effect is not something that calls for itself. Neither it is selfconscious. It is very lowkey. It is like nothing happens during my viewing of the film. I realised something only when I was done with the film. Consider some of these thingsThe processes 1. The artist is working on the painting on the quince tree. The film actually shows in quite detail some of the process. 2. At the same time three workers are renovating the artist's house. The film shows they are doing it in the passing.The first results 1. The artist didn't finish the work. 2. The three workers managed to finish their works. The second results 1. When the artist decides to stop drawing the quince tree he plucks the quinces and keeps three of them in his studio together with the two unfinished stuff a drawing and a painting of the quince tree 2. After the workers are finished with the work one of them plucks the quince and together they eat the quince.What are these facts about if they have meaning at all in the film? What the heck is Erice trying to suggest? Is Erice saying that artist's work is always unfinished or to be finished. Or is Erice saying the artists and the nonartists have different ideas what the objects are supposed to mean in real world? Or whatever he means is Erice saying we cannot take it very seriously because he just wants to show that the way it is?I think Erice wants to make a distinction between seeing and looking at. Two differences between seeing and looking away. 1 Seeing e.g. artists philosophers etc seeing the world in order to know what it is out there and seeing things as they are in reality. Seeing is like penetrating to extract the truth about the objects seen. By contrast 2 Looking away e.g. ordinary people Looking away from the world and things no matter how beautiful and however real or true they are if any different at all. The quince for example can be selfuseful to people like the workers and the artist's wife because the quince can be used for many purposes like eating making into jam etc. I think the artist belongs to the former while the workers the latter.This film recalls a natural comparison to Rivette's La Belle Nouseise another story about the artist's struggle to finish his artistic work. Both rely on a very lowkey presentation. Both shows in detail the artistic process. In Rivette's film the artist is struggling to capture the essence of the human body. Erice's film shows the artist trying to contain the truth about natural objects. The ending is somewhat different though. The artist in Rivette's film decides not to show the finished work to anyone and this is almost anticlimatic in a good sense of course because all the materials point to his desire to finish his onceabandoned masterpiece. In Erice's world the artist does not finish his work and we know that the artist feels somewhat upset about this. Another disturbing thing about El Sol del Membrillo is that his wife and his children know in the passing that the artist does not finish the painting and the drawing but Erice is not concerned to show any dramatic revelation about this thing as though there's no big deal about it.  El Sol del Membrillo is one of 1990s' most underrated films. Highly recommended.".

Where is the spectacle the excitement the redemption in this painters seeming failure? I on the other hand found it very moving because it is for me not about ideas of art and genius at all but concerns more basic human values and experiences such as love affection and loss.Possible SPOILER ahead This production is no salutary celebration of art or of the work of Lpez himself. It progresses in a linear fashion as it follows the creation of a single artistic project a painter's attempt to capture the autumn light on the quince tree in his back garden.Part written by Erice and the painter Lpez it is not a documentary in the strictest sense but a revelatory meditation on looking representation memory and the passage of time. The reason it feels so demanding to the film viewer is because it requires of them to slow their way of looking to that of the painter a profession which is often laborious and banal despite its associations of glamour.At this pace we begin to notice the subtleties of the natural environment here the play of light on a fruit tree. The impossibility and futility of freezing a moment of pleasure as a representation is the overriding theme in what is a very gentle kind of tragedy.Lopez's endeavours thwarted by changes in seasons weather and light are only symptomatic of the very basic human need to stop time to carry mementos of happiness and to be close to the objects of our affection. If the viewer is alive to the films undercurrents you can see this sense appear in almost every scene.With repeated viewings the film's humour and real humanism become apparent.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the exact type of extremely difficult to review because its content and subject exists on such an ephemeral and visual production of engagement that words are illfit for describing or justifying its nonlinguistic elements. This is a story of an artist at the end of his life but is neither biography nor a retroactive of his artwork but focuses more on the process of the artist and what is lost when his life comes to an end and his work becomes unfinished.The artist is Spanish painter Antonio Lopez Garcia and the director Victor Erice. Garcia's paintings at least portrayed in this movie I am unfortunately unfamiliar with the wider body of Garcia's work are formal stilllifes that Garcia approaches by careful and involving breaking down of natural elements into immaculately structured space while he agonizes over shifting natural light. Erice I'm more familiar with due to his other two movies El Sur and The Spirit of the Beehive all movies he's currently made being rigorously composed and ephemerally lit which makes him the perfect director to take this subject on. The two artists seem though one is on screen and one is invisible in perfect and transcendent dialog throughout the entire movie. It's very hard to explain how a movie that is essentially about a man standing in place and painting giving up restarting failing restarting almost finishing and then noticing that the tree he's painting has changed completely as winter bears down and he starts to lose hope can be so immediate beautiful and interesting for two and a half hours. It's the exact type of movie you want to run out to the streets and tell everyone to see but when asked what it's about are stopped short by trying to figure out how to explain how awesome it is to almost literally watch paint dry for two hours. But believe me when I say it's awesome.It's not that inactive and static. Other characters come and talk to the artist about his work one of the most important ones being a contemporary who at times helps and at times criticizes Garcia's work. The photography and the camera movements in this movie are amazing and expertly draw the eye to a beautiful and welllit world struggling with the idea of beauty and light. Garcia's work style is fascinating and the way Erice presents it even more so. The best part is that Erice keeps close to Garcia in most situations and observes his movements and style from afar then cuts to insert shots of the details that make it so appealing but then upon showing those details the camera detaches and starts roving around the area far from the artists habitude and into the world itself. It's like Garcia's small details send Erice spinning searching for similar examples of beauty in the wider world. Erice has this thing about trains that I'm not exactly sure what the exact fascination is though cinema and trains have a very close Industrial era relationship quite often presented in cinema and at the height of each of Erice's excitements features a train rolling by.The movie starts to get suspenseful too as the quinces start falling. This is after all the story of a man at the end of his lifeset in fall racing against the coming winter musing on memories of his life and wondering what it all comes to realizing the wisdom he's gained etc. It becomes tragic as the man who you observe building every piece of his art from scratch including the canvas with a strict and ordered craftsmanship developed over years of practice and career finally finds himself unfit to do it all as the world starts moving faster than he can including the everchanging weight of the quinces on the trees. Erice on the other hand has more alacrity and resourcefulness in his artistic craft and where the previous artist eventually fails to complete his painting Erice sets up lights and a camera on screen mind you making the movie selfaware and uses it to describe not only the artist but his untapped dreams.PolarisDiB".

	schema:reviewBody "A documentary of a painter painting Dream of Light is at the same time a work of fiction. That's how it seems to go whenever a documentary takes narrative form even the most straightforward story can only come about by shaping and where you have shaping fiction will get in like dust  you can't keep it out. You might as well welcome it fiction that is not dust so much consider it a feature not a bug.As you watch the artist in Victor Erice's film set up his painting apparatus you may wonder where all his meticulousness is to lead. He is painting en plein air but no Impressionist he he carries Academic studio practice out of doors and the lengths he goes to might give even some Academicians the quivers. The more you see of his method the more there is to question but given no explanation all you can do is watch and wait.The time is summer the subject is a quince tree in the garden. The painter an elderly gent goes about his work without hesitation or hurry his confidence is palpable it seems he knows what he's doing. The garden where he sets up is tiny cramped between the wall to the street and the wall of his house. He starts by constructing a box like frame around his tree. He puts dabs of white paint then more and more of them on branch and twig leaf and fruit a constellation of dots. A taut white string traverses and segments his field of vision and a plumbline defining the vertical segments it again. He locks and marks the position of his easel's legs and the height of the rail on which his canvas rests. When he takes up his stance to paint he drives nails into the ground marking where his feet go. His purpose with all this marking and measuring is to find his place over the course of the work  each day to find the exact place where he left off the previous day despite all the changes brought on by weather accident or growth of the tree. He's in it for the long haul you can almost hear him saying I mean to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.Given the artist's structural architectural setup you might think when he finally addressed himself to his canvas he'd first reach to the structure of his subject that his brush in a stroke or two would find the spine in the quince's mottled trunk or the essential geometry in its tangle of limbs. Or alternatively that he'd lay on areas of color or of light and dark to establish his picture's space then work to refine it toward completion. What you wouldn't guess is that he'd begin as he does with cautious abruptly punctuated strokes to draw in ghost gray a short segment of a branch as it presents itself to him near front and center of his tree  with a stubby bit of twig extending up from it and a forlorn little leaf halffolded back upon itself. More like something from the margin of a sketchbook this botanical detail floats alone in the middle of his blank white canvas floats there for days it seems as he works at an inchworm crawl with rubbing and corrections to get the bark ridges just right the texture. This is drawing and please sir when will we have painting?Are we even supposed to ask? Whether the artist ever used this method before and whether it proved successful we can't know. Has he set himself up to fail? Erice quiets us with the sensual calm that holds the scene and all in it. And the very definiteness of the old man's activity wants to persuade us that all will be well. So does his whole demeanor he wears such a livedin face and is too absorbed in what he's doing to put on a show for us. Visitors drop by conversation is desultory a bit of reminiscence mixed in the tiptap of workers' hammers somewhere off. Summer seems endless though it's passing away. The camera like a patient naturalist observes does not interrogate  and the artistsubject being asked no questions answers none but simply goes about his business.".

What you wouldn't guess is that he'd begin as he does with cautious abruptly punctuated strokes to draw in ghost gray a short segment of a branch as it presents itself to him near front and center of his tree  with a stubby bit of twig extending up from it and a forlorn little leaf halffolded back upon itself. More like something from the margin of a sketchbook this botanical detail floats alone in the middle of his blank white canvas floats there for days it seems as he works at an inchworm crawl with rubbing and corrections to get the bark ridges just right the texture. This is drawing and please sir when will we have painting?Are we even supposed to ask? Whether the artist ever used this method before and whether it proved successful we can't know. Has he set himself up to fail? Erice quiets us with the sensual calm that holds the scene and all in it. And the very definiteness of the old man's activity wants to persuade us that all will be well. So does his whole demeanor he wears such a livedin face and is too absorbed in what he's doing to put on a show for us. Visitors drop by conversation is desultory a bit of reminiscence mixed in the tiptap of workers' hammers somewhere off. Summer seems endless though it's passing away. The camera like a patient naturalist observes does not interrogate  and the artistsubject being asked no questions answers none but simply goes about his business.";

Something dark and twisted that only the most pompous of critics could ever heap praise upon and when I say heap I mean heap.The film I speak of correction the abomination I speak of is The Quince Tree Sun by Victor Erice. What! I sense you thinking. I've never heard of that film. To which I reply Thank heaven for small mercies for those of you who have been spared the 138 minutes of sheer boredom are the lucky ones.Yet I also sense a murmuring of ticking cogs which grind out the thought But didn't he make The Spirit of the Beehive? And the answer is Yeshe did. So how does one man create a masterpiece only to tear it down at his next venture? The answer is simple. Victor Erice is actually kinda crap.No doubt the original concept was to explore the pains of creating art and painful it is. Watching the movie's main protagonist Antonio Lopez Garcia playing himself slave away over light positions angles colouration's and any other banal necessity that goes into painting a tree is soul destroying. Yeah you heard that right this ain't the Sistine Chapel although Michelangelo does get a name check emphasising the depths of pretension Evrice is willing to fathom.The guy's painting a tree. A tree he repaints every year in the hope he'll be able to capture one moment of perfect beauty. Do you know what that is? Madness pure and simple. Was it not Einstein that said  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results? So there you have it. The Quince Tree Sun is not the pure homage to creating art that Evrice would have us believe. It is something far worse something far more horrific than any slasher movie or thriller could concoct. It's a devilish portrayal of a man spiralling out of control into madness. This is The Shining times ten This is King Barker Lovecraft and Poe all mixed together to create a stunning shade of 'is it over yet?' that's smeared across the screen like Garcia smears his paint over canvas. With every masterstroke another victory for tedium.Obviously there are some truly abhorrent films out there such as Humanoids from the deep with it's misogynistic ideology and Salmon People. Or the depravity of A Serbian Film and maybe it seems harsh to judge The Quince Tree Sun with such disdain. But in many ways it's crimes upon humanity outweigh those of any lowbrow nonsense. In my opinion The Quince Tree Sun's greatest crime isn't it's snails pace or lack of dynamics but to praise itself as a love affair with art about art by artists..And I can't help feelingWhat a load of rubbish.".

It seemed to be created with one purpose in mind to make art so completely monotonous that it sucks every last trace of enjoyment out of it and discourages anyone who watches it from ever considering art as either a profession or a hobby.To be honest I was at first intrigued. Antonio Lpez went about the familiar task of assembling a frame and stretching a canvas during the opening credits. My mind was open and cynicism was not my objective. Lpez continued about his business setting up his canvas and location to paint. My interest was still relatively high as he set up a plumbbob and started graphing lines onto his canvas...it began to seem more as though he was getting ready to graph a geometry problem than create a painting. Finally after installing foot placemarkers and marking the places of all the leaves and pieces of fruit with paint he was finished setting up his scene and was ready to begin painting. I chalked these idiosyncrasies up to the fact that all artists have quirks.My mind was still open and I was ready to see what this man could produce. About a month later in the documentary and a seemingly endless amount of time in reality he had created an incomplete painting which he decided to give up on. He then decided to use the same scene to create a drawing. Another month later upon reaching a similar level of incompletion this too was shelved and he decided to turn to filming the rotting fruit that had fallen from the tree onto the ground. This was probably his most successful endeavor although I'm assuming that watching the footage of the fruit might possibly be even more innocuous than the documentary itself but not by a very great margin. The fruit eventually rotted but not before my brain began to chew its way through my skull.Altogether Lpez made art seem more like a rigid set of imperialistic rules than about expression escapism or even gasp! enjoyment. As soon as his subject lost data the sun no longer being in the right position or a piece of fruit falling from the tree or shifting position he would alter the painting to record this new set of data. This made no sense at all because if he were by some miracle able to finish his painting it would continue to lose data and therefore his painting would technically have to be updated. He could have literally spent the rest of his life painting the same fruit tree.If art is simply about recording every minute detail of reality why should one bother at all? If you end up with a painting of a fruit tree that looks identical to the one standing in your yard why bother painting it? You might as well walk outside and see the real thing.As far as I see it I've lost a little more than two hours of my life that I will never be able to regain. For this I blame Victor Erice.".

	schema:reviewBody "The sixteen yearold Les Anderson Corey Haim has a crush on his schoolmate Mercedes Lane Heather Graham but he is shy and she has a boyfriend Paolo M.A. Nickles who has a fancy car. Les and his twin sister Natalie Anderson Nina Siemaszko are preparing to the driving test and while Natalie studies the questions he does not pay attention to them. Les fails the test but is not brave enough to tell neither to his father Mr. Anderson Richard Masur nor to his pregnant mother Mrs. Anderson Carol Kane and his best friends Dean Corey Feldman and the clumsy Charles Michael Manasseri. When Mercedes has an argument with Paolo she invites Les to date her to make Paolo jealous. Meanwhile Les' parents discover that he has flunked his driver's test and they ground him. However when Mercedes calls him asking if they are not going to date Les sneaks away from his house and drives his grandfather's Cadillac that is parked in the garage to date Mercedes in the beginning of a nightmarish night of adventures.License to Drive is a comedy from the 80's still very funny after almost thirty years. This is one of the best roles of Corey Haim in the top of his career immediately after the cult Lost Boys and Lucas and the debut of Heather Graham. The plot would be considered politically incorrect in the present days but fortunately it was not a problem in 1988. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Sem Licena para Dirigir Without License to DriveNote On 12 October 2018 I saw this film again.".

	schema:reviewBody "When most people think of the seminal 80's teenage actors and films the first thing that comes to mind are the 'brat pack' films. Sure those were excellent films and very talented actors but with all the focus on those actors sometimes the gems get overlooked. License to Drive is surely on of those gems.License To Drive one of only a few films that stars both Corey Haim and Corey Feldman is a perfect 80's teen comedy. Shot at the height of both of the Coreys careers while they were both still in high school the film captures their youthful spirit perfectly. License to Drive is hilarious and outrageous while still remaining simple and easy to follow.Haim plays Les Anderson who like every high school kid has nothing but girls and cars on his mind. But this isn't just any girl. Les has his eye on the most beautiful girl in school. The bombshell is played by a very young and beautiful Heather Graham. When Les is lucky enough to score a date with the bombshell the only obstacle he must overcome is his pending drivers license test so that he can take his fathers car to pick her up in.Like most high school students Les slept through drivers education class and when the time comes he fails his drivers test. But the fun has just begun. Les isn't going to let this stop him. He takes the car anyways. Uh oh... this never turns out right. The night takes a turn for the worse when Les's best friend Corey Feldman shows up with 'a plan.' Another bad sign. Well the night just gets wilder and wilder and ends up with Heather Graham drunk as a skunk locked in the trunk of a car police roadblocks crazed militants running the streets and some really mean and angry drag racers to boot.License To Drive really has it all. It's a perfect 80's teenage comedy. The DVD has loads of extra goodies including interviews with the stars and tons of deleted footage.Fasten your seat belts you're in for one totally awesome ride!!!".

Nice to see a young Heather Graham in one of her first decent roles as the out of reach babe Haim falls for. The film is also complimented by the great soundtrack featuring eighties greats Billy Ocean Belinda Carlisle and many others. Look out for a great cameo from Uncle Phil from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air who plays Les' driving instructor. The Scene with the drunk driver is especially funny. This film is made even more hilarious by the fact that Corey Haim drove round LA without a real driving license for many years when he was in his wild child years. They Rock.".

It's a decent comedy nonstop action and centering on beating fear by facing its worst nightmares. It succeeds in every each way it goes with fascinating sense of creativity.How can any comedy be smarter ? See for instance the character of the father apart the way he celebrates his son's faultier as a driver and why his scenes with the abouttogivebirth wife and his threatening speech near the end. Just unforgettable. The thing about this movie is that it knows its characters and their lives then could mix that with a lovely touch of craziness where everything you don't expect happens. So it wins at being truthful and lively. This is one way to be a classic. Not by the heaviest amount of toilet humor !Despite being not highly charismatic Corey Haim was wonderful as the perturbed aghast and eager teen. Heather Graham was fabulous in pink being every teen's dream back then and look closer to her name Mercedes Lane !. Loved her performance as alwayshappy unconscious drunk. The minor parts were done no less than excellent even the drunken old driver. Then the best credit must go to that incredible climax now the teen gets his full chance to drive outrageously by the approval of his parents winning the recognition he dreamed of achieving rescuing his mom and her baby on the nick of time yet that itself was done in one outrageous piece of cinema. Again this script is smart smashing smart !It evoked many similar themes and atmospheres from the same era  the suburban teen who wants to challenge his fear a ride of a lifetime in the city John Hughes's Ferris Bueller's Day Off 1986 a hellish night of accumulative misunderstanding and funny circumstance Adventures in Babysitting 1987. My conclusion  Is the 1980s cute or what ?Remember the moment in which the lead lives a cassette tape crises where the thin brown strip explodes. Ahh this is something only the audience born before the 1990s knows well suffered from and laughs about. With CDs and else more advanced devises now plus teen comedies that have become all about obscenity you must think does more development mean more degeneration ? or when things grow less complicated other things grow more ugly ?Anyway this is a teen comedy and decent classic. Now the 4 words don't meet together in one sentence at all !".

License to Drive is a fastpaced original Comedy which is probably my favorite HaimFeldman movie.The most embarrassing part of a teens life is being driven to a party or school by their parents. The parents are the ultimate antagonist when caught dropping their kids off because that means the teen doesn't have a driver's license. I'm sure it will be like that when I reach High School.Les Anderson Corey Haim the slacker type crashes the computer on accident in anger after failing his driver's test. His teacher can't find the score to his test which leads him to take the driving portion of his test coached by a certain uncle from a certain Will Smith show.He passes that test but the teacher recovers his score realizing he failed rips up his driver's license leaving Les to be driven by his parents. He then unwillingly takes out his grandfather's prized Cadillac to take out his new girlfriend Mercedes Lane Heather Graham who gets drunk and passes out on their date. He goes to his friend Dean's Corey Feldman house. Les Dean and their geeky friend Charles Michael Manasseri embark on a journey to a drag racing competition in Les' uncle's Cadillac.I have always had a weakness for 80s Comedies that depict the life of true teenagers most of which are John Hughes movies. This Sixteen Candles The Breakfast Club Ferris Bueller's Days Off Career Opportunities and so many others deal with real conflicts that teenagers have consistently. Though I have to feel bad that this one is overlooked and almost like it is never spoken about anymore seeing as it's very touching and funny.Perhaps one of the best 80s Comedies I have seen License to Drive delivers heavily and keeps the laughs coming.Starring Corey Haim Corey Feldman Heather Graham and Michael Manasseri.

Despite his having flunked his driver's test he's not about to let anything stop him from being with Mercedes Heather Graham in her first substantial movie role the girl he adores. So he makes off with his grandfather's prized Cadillac for one incredible long night of misadventures. Now admittedly some viewers can find certain elements objectionable  the protracted sequence with the drunk driver or the fact that Mercedes gets herself drunk  but this movie still provides lively zany entertainment for a very well paced 90 minutes. It resonates with so many of us who saw that driver's license as one of our first steps towards freedom and maturity seeing all the possibilities before us for good times. Les just couldn't have predicted the kind of stuff that happens to him and his buds Deano a priceless Corey Feldman and Charles Michael Manasseri. The aforementioned problem with the drunk driver Harvey Miller is just one of them. The highly quotable dialogue includes such gems as I'm so dead they're going to have to bury me twice.. The movie gets off to a fine start with its hilarious opening sequence and the supporting cast is full of familiar and reliable actors starting with a delightful Carol Kane as Les's pregnant mom and the always solid Richard Masur as his flustered dad. Graham looks great and is perfectly cast. Nina Siemaszko is a hoot as Les's uptight sister as is Grant Heslov as her boyfriend. Other amusing contributions are made by Grant Goodeve as the most relaxed driving tester on Earth and James Avery as a far more intimidating one Michael Ensign in a dual role as the bus driver  driver's ed teacher and Helen Hanft as the scary Miss Hellberg of the DMV. License to Drive just breezes along it certainly would out pace a street sweeper coming up with some irresistible gags and suffice it to say that poor Caddy takes a lot of abuse before the movie is over. It wouldn't be inaccurate to regard this movie as perhaps the ultimate teaming of the two Coreys it's definitely a career highlight for both. Eight out of 10.".

Director Greg Beeman working from a smart and witty script by Neil Tolkin relates the eventful and entertaining story at a zippy pace maintains an amiable goodnatured tone throughout and adroitly milks the funny sense of inspired zany humor for loads of major laughs the final gag concerning Les' grandpa in particular is a gutbusting corker!. Moreover this movie deserves extra praise for having actual teenagers portraying adolescents. The lively acting from the able cast helps matters a whole lot The strong and appealing chemistry between the two Coreys keeps the picture humming with sturdy support from Richard Masur as Les' easygoing father Carol Kane as Les' wacky pregnant mother Nina Siemaszko as Les' stuckup snob sister Natalie James Avery as Les' hardnosed DMV examiner Helen Hanft as formidable DMV head honcho Miss Hellberg and in an especially bravura uncredited turn Henry Alan Miller as a raucous drunk driver. Jay Ferguson's rousing score and the spirited rocking soundtrack both hit the stirring spot. The polished cinematography by Bruce Surtees gives the picture a pleasing bright look. A total blast.".

Director Greg Beeman working from a smart and witty script by Neil Tolkin relates the eventful and entertaining story at a zippy pace maintains an amiable goodnatured tone throughout and adroitly milks the funny sense of inspired zany humor for loads of major laughs the final gag concerning Les' grandpa in particular is a gutbusting corker!. Moreover this movie deserves extra praise for having actual teenagers portraying adolescents. The lively acting from the able cast helps matters a whole lot The strong and appealing chemistry between the two Coreys keeps the picture humming with sturdy support from Richard Masur as Les' easygoing father Carol Kane as Les' wacky pregnant mother Nina Siemaszko as Les' stuckup snob sister Natalie James Avery as Les' hardnosed DMV examiner Helen Hanft as formidable DMV head honcho Miss Hellberg and in an especially bravura uncredited turn Henry Alan Miller as a raucous drunk driver. Jay Ferguson's rousing score and the spirited rocking soundtrack both hit the stirring spot. The polished cinematography by Bruce Surtees gives the picture a pleasing bright look. A total blast.";

This movie is just about your average teen trying to pass his driving test and getting his license along with his ultra bright and nerdy twin sister. He also gets to go out on a date with a very attractive lady as well named Mercedes played by Heather Grahme. Well for some reason he does not do so well on the computer quiz portion of the driving test but thanks to some luck the test results are wiped out and he is given the chance to take the driving portion of the test. Which of course is highly unlikely no matter how well his sister scored. Well he somehow manages to pass the driving portion despite having a driving instructor from hell while his sister gets the guy everyone should want during this part. In the end though they find his score and no license. Well through a series of strange events he gets his grampa's car and takes the hot girl out as she proceeds to get drunk and pass out. He then picks up his friends as they try to get to this cool hangout. Lets just say a lot of stuff happens and that car takes some hits. I especially found the drunk guy funny. In the end I found the end a bit much but then most comedies I find have a weak spot in their armor. However this was a rather funny comedy that passes the test.".

	schema:reviewBody "Years ago while living in another state I was bored and went to the local mom and pop video store to find something to pass the time. The proprietor asked me what type of movie I preferred. I responded that I like movies that are good stories about people relationships friendships etc.He recommended Bagdad Cafe.A few years later the video store was driven out of business by the larger chains. It is too bad really because I doubt that I would ever have stumbled upon this little gem of a movie at one of the huge mega video marts that are popping up all over the planet like unwanted zits but I digress.I owe that person a huge Thank you! for introducing me to what has become one of my all time favorite movies. I was strangely pulled into the movie right from the beginning. For me it was like a great book that you just can't put down and that you want to read over and over again to see if you missed anything or merely to recapture the warm feeling you got the first time through.What is also unusual is that after more than 10 years have passed I recently was able to talk my 25yearold son into watching it with me. His comment about midway through was I am strangely drawn to this movie. At the end he said it was Great! and asked me if it had won any awards. I found this perspective amazing coming from someone who regularly feeds on a diet of movies such as Lord of the Rings Matrix and Kill Bill. Go figure. From my limited observation of those who appreciate this movie like me I have come to the conclusion that this is a movie that works without being able to explain why. When asked to describe in one word what this movie is about the best response I can come up with is friendship. However that is such a lame description because there is so much more to the movie than just that. Yet on the surface one could get the mistaken impression that there is not really much going on Bagdad Cafe. There are no car chases love scenes murders suicides explosions deaths births weddings or funerals. The movie just is. It is a slice of midlife for two women Jasmine  Brenda when their paths cross. These two are women who are trying to cope with their respective lots in life which from external appearances seem to be quite diverse. However at the heart they are really the same. Both are in ruts looking for change for something better in the middle of nowhere when they find each other. Once the rockhard exterior melts away and they reach a common ground their blossoming friendship transforms both.The character of Jasmine is the glue that brings the story together. In Bagdad Cafe she gives new meaning to the old saying making lemonade out of lemons and in the process she also brings magic and new energy into the life of Brenda and her family. The subtlety of the revelation of Jasmine's real character is one of the best examples of a human metamorphosis ever captured on the screen.If you are looking for a movie with special effects of epic proportions or new adventures in creative violence this movie might not be for you. However if you are looking for a story about humanity love and friendship done with a light touch then pop the popcorn and put on Bagdad Cafe and enjoy.Oh and to the owner of the little video store who recommended this movie to me where ever you are thank you for bringing the magic of Bagdad Cafe into my life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Out of Rosenheim is a film about how the kind Jasmin touches the lives of other people that at first disdain her. In fact Jasmin is an angel that happens to come to the help of the poor people at the seedy motel and cafe because she perceives beauty where there is ugliness hope where there was despair and turns everyone around to appreciate her for what she contributes to enhance their lives.Percy Adlon who is an original filmmaker scored a big success with this simple film that judging by some negative responses to this forum can either make the viewer love it for its subtle charm or just be perplexed because there is no action. Yet Mr. Adlon writing with his wife Eleonor and Christopher Doherty created a film that will stay in the viewer's mind for some time to come. As the film opens we watch Jasmin and her husband taking a break in their journey through the desert. As they quarrel Jasmin decides to leave him and gets her suitcase out of the trunk to walk along the solitary highway to find a place where to rest. Before that we have seen a strange sort of mirage in the desert horizon where two surreal lights are seen through some mist. Those lights seem to guide Jasmin as to what route to take in order to continue her journey or maybe she is just an angel with a mission as the film continues.As Jasmin arrives at the seedy cafe that is next to the motel she encounters a hostile Brenda a black woman who is struggling to make the cafe and motel work with little success. Jasmin is given a room but being suspicious Brenda calls the local sheriff to investigate what is she doing at her place but since there is nothing wrong Brenda can't do anything.Jasmin upon discovering the cleaning tools in her room gets an inspiration to continue to straighten the rest of the place. She goes and cleans Brenda's office which is in a state of chaos. When Brenda gets back she is horrified watching the confusion she left behind has been turned into a neater place where to conduct business. She can't concede the fact to Jasmin who she still considers an unwelcome guest that has overstayed and has committed the ultimate sin of making Brenda aware of the messy state of her place and her life.When Jasmin discovers in her husband's suitcase a kit about learning magic she begins to practice the different tricks that she shows the others in the cafe. Rudi Cox the strange man living in a trailer in the property is a painter he decides he wants to paint Jasmin and little by little he discovers the beauty of his subject who seems to radiate it from inside her soul.The film owes a great deal of gratitude to Marianne Sagebrecht one of the most accomplished actresses from Germany who is an asset to anything where she is cast. Ms. Sagebrecht steals the film because of the luminosity she projects she seems to cast an aura that others see and are instantly won over by her kindness and her generosity.CCH Pounder makes a good contribution to the film. Her Brenda is at the beginning harsh curt and just plain nasty because the way life has treated her. Jack Palance doesn't have much of a role to play but his chemistry with Ms. Sagebrecht makes a sweet distraction for the movie.Out of Rosenheim is a film in which nothing seems to happen yet it is packed with a powerful message that comes across as one watches it. Percy Adlon and his star Marianne Sagebrecht made a timeless film that will survive the passage of time.".

She has a suitcase of men's clothes and no car.  Her appearance raises the eyebrows of the owner whose husband just left her as well as some of the permanent residents of the Cafe.  Jack Palance for one is a painter who finds Jasmin mesmerizing and wants desperately to paint her.  The owner Brenda has a son who plays classic piano that no one cares to hear until this woman who later performs magic comes along.By the end of the movie things are jumping attitudes have disappeared and the camaraderie among the cafe staff is unbelievable.  This is truly a feel good movie that picks up long after it's slow beginning.  It took me to a place in my heart that was filled with emotion song and dance.  Bob Telson won an Oscar for best song Calling You for this movie in 1989.  The song was also mesmerizing and would win again in 2003 if it were up for an award.  The owner played by CCH Pounder played the role of a lifetime. She should have gotten an award for her performance as well.  There's a lot to be learned at the Bagdad Cafe.".

This is truly a feel good movie that picks up long after it's slow beginning.  It took me to a place in my heart that was filled with emotion song and dance.  Bob Telson won an Oscar for best song Calling You for this movie in 1989.  The song was also mesmerizing and would win again in 2003 if it were up for an award.  The owner played by CCH Pounder played the role of a lifetime. She should have gotten an award for her performance as well.  There's a lot to be learned at the Bagdad Cafe.";

The boomerang suggests that what one puts forth emotionally comes back to them. Many visual clues serve to connect the incidents'the coffee maker the painting in the motel room the box of magic tricks a finger tracing dirt on the desk in Brenda's office'.  This is a film that is better on the second and the third viewing when the directorial skills of Percy Adlon become more evident.  He achieves a remarkable nonjudgmental attitude in a nearly plotless story. Marianne Sgebrecht is superb as Jasmin Jack Palance gives a wonderful performance as a retired Hollywood setpainter whose lust for Sgebrecht constantly boils humorously below the surface.  CCH Pounder as Brenda holds back just enough in her performance to make her transformation unquestioned and acceptable.  This is not a film of sex or violence it is instead a film about people we might have encountered the nature of being human and the pleasures of being alive.".

But I stayed with it and by the end was so taken by the characters and locale of this film that I immediately added it to my library and have watched it at least once a year ever since.  Watching it is now like visiting old friends once again.  One person commented below that they wished Bagdad Cafe really existed.  While the characters in Bagdad Cafe may be fictional the cafe really does exist. It is located in Newberry Springs CA about 20 miles east of the desert town of Barstow.  Though it was originally called The Sidewinder Cafe due to the following of this film it is now called Badgad Cafe.  I have had lunch there several times and each visit is a completely surreal experience. The cafe looks much the same as it did in the film and you can sit at the table right by the door where Jasmine used to sit and have her coffee.  If you're ever passing by on Interstate 40 don't forget to visit.  In the meantime check out this special film.  The memorable performances will keep you involved even if the first 30 minutes have you wondering what and why you are watching but hang in there.  You won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Out of Rosenheim' aka 'Bagdad Cafe' is a simply executed film. There are no lavish sets no heavy special effects and the story is just as simple. But the experience of watching this movie is magical. The film takes place in an isolated motel in desertlike Bagdad not Iraq's capital city in California. A young mother and grandmother struggles to run her motel and keep her family together. Enter an enigmatic German lady into the motel and there is magic in everyone's life.In a way 'Out of Rosenheim' can be described as a mood piece. The visuals are beautiful very detailed and symbolic. The colourful characters are very likable. The enigmatic song 'Calling to You' appears every now and then as though Jasmine receives her calling. The background score is just as effective. Adlon makes good use of light and climate. How the heat seemingly irritates the characters in the beginning but gradually as the characters get accustomed or as 'life gets better' the heat is no bother.Yet 'Out of Rosenheim' is not just a mood piece. There is a solid story but it's not easy to describe what it's about. At the centre of it lies the friendship between Jasmine and Brenda. However there is just so much more going on. Both ladies are coping with their daily lives. Jasmine finally takes some measure and consequently comes to Bagdad where she meets all these strange characters and as a friendliness develops she brings colour not only into their lives but also her own. Adlon beautifully unfolds the mystery of her character by revealing that she's a magician at heart. There are so many beautiful and endearing scenes but it all feels genuine and authentic rather than syrupy. In a way the film reminded me of the classic 'Mary Poppins' and the unique and subtle presentation of 'Out Of Rosenheim' makes it more real in contrast to the fairy tale of 'Mary Poppins'.Just like everything else the acting is great. Marianne Sgebrecht and CCH Pounder clearly own the movie. Sgebrecht unfolds her character's layers with skill and ease. She brings a gentleness and calmness to Jasmine that excellently contrasts Pounder's Brenda. Likewise Pounder too demonstrates her talent as the chaotic and verbally aggressive mother who's trying to keep it together. The rest of the cast perform well.Overall 'Out of Rosenheim' is a cinematic treat. I would love to visit this film over and over again to see if I missed anything because of the detail but also the heartfelt story and characters warrant an invitation to watch again.".

The basic theme we're all weird and we all need somewhere to fit in is nothing new but the approach here makes it delightful and fresh.The original 15 minute longer 'director's cut' available on European DVDs does add some nice details moments and filling out of characters. The film works fine in its shorter US version and the Italian DVD of the director's cut I got was frustrating in that it had a a weaker visual transfer than the US DVD and there were Italian subtitles you couldn't turn off but I was glad to see it and overall it's an even stronger film with the original material added back in.".

	schema:reviewBody "I discovered Bagdad Cafe by accident. The film I'd set out to see was sold out so having schlepped into London I reluctantly settled for something I'd never heard of showing on another screen. It was Bagdad Cafe. Subsequently I bought the VHS lent it to someone  You MUST see this movie!  and never got it back. I bought the DVD lent it to someone else same result. I bought a second DVD and I am NEVER lending it out. Never ever.This is a spellbinding film and like many of the reviewers here I can't quite work out what the spell is. It's a simple story a German tourist finds herself dumped in the Nevada desert by her obnoxious husband and makes her way to an isolated rundown motel and service station  the eponymous Bagdad Cafe. She makes friends with the people there. That's it. The isolation of the motel reflects the isolation of the motley collection of characters living there. Life seems to have passed them by just as the trucks on the highway pass them by. They are in the middle of nowhere going nowhere cast up on the edge of the flow like human flotsam. Each is lost in solitude and quiet desperation stuck trying to make the best of things. Jasmin Marianne Sagebrecht's character is also stranded by the abrupt and brutal breakup of her marriage. In a black irony she has grabbed not her own suitcase but her husband's which contains his clothes and surreally a teachyourselfmagic kit. With a vulnerable valiant and soulwrenching dignity Jasmin sets about making the most of her bleak situation a stranger in a very strange land. She rolls up her sleeves and cleans the place. She makes proper coffee strong. Alone in her room she starts teaching herself magic tricks from the kit as milelong trains trundle by in the night.One by one the other characters begin to thaw around her. Jasmin is the catalyst that brings them together. Artist and former Hollywood setpainter Rudi Cox Jack Palance in lizardskin cowboy boots as reptilian as his eyes falls helplessly in lust then love with this voluptuous Teuton who has appeared out of the desert like a perspiring valkyrie. The caf owner Brenda CCH Pounder a world of helpless pain in her face slowly lets go of the rage that is tearing her apart. She learns to smile again. Brenda's grownup children the Bachworshipping son and the wayward daughter are won over. The oncedeserted caf starts to attract a clientle. Why? It's magic as Jasmin says blue eyes glinting prestidigitating eggs coins and ribbons from the ears of laughing customers. Magic indeed. The film weaves an indefinable spell under skies cascading with colour against a soundtrack that includes Bob Telson's Oscarnominated 'Calling You'. Love friendship and fellowship bloom in the desert. Hope blossoms in the sand. Director Percy Adlon the screenplay was written by his wife Eleonore has created a gentle haunting humanist jewel. And no you can't borrow my copy.".

In my still in progress search for on the road movies I bumped into this curious piece of cinema not a road picture properly since no physical journey happens but certainly more than an inner journey develops. It involves the lives of some odd characters especially Jasmin and Brenda whose lives so distant but so similar come to meet at the Bagdad Caf located on a desert road from Vegas to nowhere quotation from the wonderful leading song Calling you. At the beginning it is a shabby dirty anonymous place where people only pass by run by a hysterical and melancholic Brenda whose encounter with the impeccable deutsche Jasmin will turn the caf into an amusing and happy place and will renew both lives radically. They will become friends besides suspicion and fear by teaching mutually how to enjoy life again. And it will turn out very difficult almost impossible to leave this magic place. The cast is outstanding the two female protagonists are perfect in their parts but also Jack Palance with his mixture of past glory and present melancholy leaves the mark.The very good photography some settings captured at sunset are really effective together with the deeply involving and enigmatic music contribute to a significant emotional impact on the viewer and also some very funny moments are to be enjoyed.

	schema:reviewBody "Percy Adlon's culthit Bagdad Caf sets the tone the strangest way. Marianne Sgebrecht Jasmin a Bavarian tourist stuck in the middle of the Californian desert with an abrasive husband she mutters names like Disneyland and Las Vegas but what we get from their body language is that a they're lost b they're not exactly in their element and c she's at the verge of breaking down.And bingo Jasmin finally snaps she takes her luggage and walks away from the car. I like it when a movie features exactly the amount of exposition needed who needs backstory when you see an overweight frau in typical German clothes walking eagerly across the Mojave Desert and even refusing a ride you know there's more than traveling.Meanwhile in a remote and shabby transport caf with an adjacent hotel an infuriated Brenda played by CCH Pounder keeps raging at her husband for having forgotten the percolator while being in town. No need to backstory again the husband is fed up with his woman's tantrums and leaves her alone. She's the boss of the Bagdad Caf now and it's a matter of time before the coming of a strange visitor.And as different as they were Jasmin and Brenda were at crucial times of their lives seemingly deadend that could be turned into crossroads. To use a hackneyed term some people are just meant to meet each other. Speaking of that when I was a kidBagdad Cafhas always been an enigma I hadn't seen the film but I knew about its most defining image of the two women embracing with that 'Calling You' song in the background. And this image was stuck in my mind for years and years before I finally saw it.Cinema is all about imagery and music and I guess the film offers both without trying too much and it's genuinely good. Now there's no particular reason for this gem to stand higher than the others but no reason for the opposite either. Maybe it's because the film has the most unlikely setting protagonists and 'story' as far as the storyline goes that at the end it's impossible to compare it to any other movie it's something that could have belonged to the 'New Hollywood' period one of these 'slice of life' movies like The Last Picture Show without the depressing 'endofan era' theme.Only what could have been a rather bleak and depressing material is handled with good heart and sweetness Jasmin incarnates a certain openness to new cultures or environments typical of European mindset and she manages to change the people around her meeting more hostility than defensive resistance from the hottempered and bossy Brenda. But there's never a moment when you feel that the dynamics are forced Jasmin marks her territory in the smoothest way as if our sympathy wasn't taken for granted. But who can resist for that generous woman and that actress who in any other typical Hollywood or mainstream commercial European film would only be given foil roles.As Jasmin she wins our hearts as the poor German stranger estranged from everyone who discovers a shabby sleazy untidy place but still better than the one she left. She knows she must put that in order but she starts well by putting her own house i.e. room in order. Her atypical behavior catches the attention of the motel occupants Brenda's son a gifted pianist and her daughter who's delighted to see the monotony of the motel being broken for once truck drivers a tattooartist and a set painter played by Jack Palance. His presence his oldhippie fashion the fascinated look he constantly directs toward Jasmin is one of these details that make Bagdad Caf such a special movie.Today there would have been some sexual undertones the film would have been a comedy a robbery would happen or a subplot involving the daughter being a drug addict or raped anything for cheap thrills because no director would believe it possible to maintain such plot absence for a while. And the most dramatic thing is that he would be right because our ambitions in filmmaking became so high that we don't realize they're reversely low. That the film was a boxoffice hit in Europe and a cult classic in France shows that the 80's also belong to a time where miracles were possible where it was still possible to reach the hearts of people with simple stories.And maybe 'simple' stories are the most difficult to make because there's nothing to hook our mind on we just have to witness human relationships going on and trying to find how some scenes speak to us. And maybe it's the film's very particular setting in the middle of nowhere that allows it to speak universal statements to everyone. This is a true 'alien' in both meaning of the world as a foreigner and as a person alienated from her own world but at the end she's the one who proves that every occupant of the hotel was alienated by boredom routine and the stress of their bossy owner something that was progressively destroying their lives until the place is resurrected and Jasmin herself both singer and magician becomes a sort of moneybringing attraction.And I guess this is the meaning of that defining image of that magnificent moment where the two women embrace you know what they say about images speaking thousand words. This image one of the most iconic from the 80's show two women who had more things in common than they thought two women who met at the most difficult time of their life show a friendship that finally blossomed over distrust and misunderstanding and two persons that could finally take a new more optimistic path for their life. It's a mutual Thank You behind these friendly smiles. Thank you for putting my house in order literally for one symbolically for the other.".

You'll meet some very unusual characters here and you'll enjoy it.  Jack Palance nearly steals the show with his wonderfully underplayed role but the ladies are the stars of the show  CCH Pounder and Marianne Sagebrecht are as opposite as they can be but both just wonderful.  Never mind the setting and plot  it's the characters that shine.  The only people to whom this wouldn't appeal are diehard action fans because the pacing is methodical.  So many touching moments and surprises even a few laughs along the way  definitely one of the more unusual films you'll see.  Some hauntingly beautiful music completes the picture.  Don't bother with the remake  the original is the best by far.".

I was totally unprepared for this unusual sometime bizarre bit of movie making.I liked the quirky characters and the subsequent character development. Marianne Sagebrecht was very good as the German haus frau. Palance did a very nice turn as the eccentric painter and Apensanahkwat was great in a small role as Sheriff Arnie.This film began bizarre and I was never sure where it was going to head next. The opening was reminiscent of the Last Picture Show  desert desolation and desperate lives of the people trying to eke out a living. The use of amber lens the constant background howl of the wind and the ethereal theme song lend themselves very nicely to the overall mood of the film.One particularly moving scene has the German tourist Jasmine arriving at the gas station and using a handkerchief to wipe the sweat from her face after a long walk in the hot sun following an argument with her husband juxtapositioned with the Cafe owner Brenda wiping the tears from her eyes after an argument with her husband. The development of the relationship between these two is the backbone of the film.The film is likeable despite some shaky acting from CCH Pounder. Her character goes through unbelievable character shifts  she was over the top by the end of the film in a scene where the movie degenerates into a weird musical number that is best described as out of character and out of context.Still this is a quirky enjoyable and at times moving film. The title song will stay with you a long long time. Take your next opportunity to see it.".

I've introduced the film to many people and most of them now share my passion for its quirky offbeat tone and inexplicable cinematography its otherworldly soundscape its motley crew of disappointed women and defeated men and its gradual ascent towards a sublime musical climax as the characters realise and embrace their passions. The deepening friendship between Brenda CCH Pounder and Jasmine Marianne Sgebrecht is achingly tender and rich. I now own the Australian release DVD but found it to be a disappointment. It contains additional footage not seen in the theatrical release and for good reason as it only serves to drag the pace of the film particularly the climactic magic show musical number which as it drags on grows increasingly tedious. The adage less is more should have been applied here. Ultimately it adds nothing and spoils an otherwise perfect film. Brenda. Oh Brenda.".

	schema:reviewBody "Digging the pile of low budget horror I happened to find this piece of pure gold that shines even today. I knew Fred Olen Ray for an actor but with this one Ray totally grabbed me in. I now salute him for his directorial abilities that gave us this masterpiece. The year is 1983 and like many others who praise the glory of the golden age of untamed slashers most precisely the early 80s I am going to sing my praises for 'Scalps'. Despite being a B flick 'Scalps' is heavy on atmosphere and gore. The atmosphere is creepy and the nostalgic tune that plays during the run time is fairly engaging and makes one feel desolate. It goes along seamlessly with the striking visuals of the desert. People will say that deserts offer no scope for the urban horror where we usually have a killer who wears a mean nifty hat muffler and a drenched raincoat murdering the hapless victims to secure their body parts as the trophies of victory. NO! This one is surely different and a twist of supernatural combined with some good locations and a fully functional storyline make 'Scalps' unique among the other entries. The director drags us to the desert locale and shows the enormous amount of horror that is trapped there. Analyze 'Scalps' in the light of Wes Craven's classic 'The Hills Have Eyes' or Alexander Aja's remake of the same film and you'll certainly understand my point. Deserts are cruel locations and those who have been pampered in the cities will have to learn to live again from the very scratch. Well here our actors aren't just freaked out by the tortures of nature there is 'something' very strange in the air that's manipulating some of them to murder others and that 'something' doesn't just cease to exist as it has remained there for more than a century.'Scalps' begins with an old man with a shovel heading towards the Californian desert. Perhaps a gold digger the old man falls prey to a possessed Indian artifact that somehow kills him. Now there is a team of 6 archaeologists. They decide to go to the Californian wasteland to dig up a few Indian artifacts. The project guide and museum curator Professor Machen Kirk Alyn is assigned a task to submit the inventory of historical artifacts he has in his museum and fails to join the others. As the Californian law prohibits the archaeologists to dig anything from an ancient Indian burial ground aboriginal heritage Machen asks the team members to dig the area secretively without letting anyone know. He also advises them to tell others that they are officially going on a field trip. Now a nostalgic and disturbing tune begins to play as we find the team members looking out at the silent dark brown hills that hold a sinister enigma within. We come across some striking visuals from the desert. The wasteland is vast and spooky the hills seem to be looking at the unfortunate victimstobe and the vegetation speaks a lot about its lowly and mean nature that doesn't have anything to offer to the detoured individuals. The members embark onto their journey and finally reach near the burial ground. One of the team members DJ JoAnn Robinson receives a psychic vision and tells her mates that they are in great danger. She tells them that they are in the domain of Black Claw the infamous native Indian black magician who was buried there a century ago. She further tells that by digging the burial grounds the team has earned the wrath and curse of Black Claw. Unable to deduce her visions the others take her for a daydreamer. Unfortunately the mystery deepens for everyone when they hear drums playing several feet under the ground. They also hear tribal ceremonial music and vocals. A team member Randy Richard Hench along with his girlfriend decides to find the source of music and gets closer to the burial ground where he and his girlfriend witness a ceremonial fire that has no heat. The ceremonial fire belongs to the Black Claw who possesses Randy. Randy goes on a killing spree and begins to murder the other team members with neolithic tools. How the others race against time to save their necks forms the rest of the story.'Scalps' has ample gore and a few squirmy murder scenes so it may be a fortune cookie for the gore freaks. The murder scenes are disturbing and dark. Some of the scenes are shot in dark but that's the point Ray wants to make. They couldn't have brought the dark and abysmal side of the desert both natural and supernatural so brilliantly If they had used artificial lighting. 'Scalps' is interesting and has some amount of hypnotic quality as well. 'Scalps' has a genuinely creepy and hypnotic score that will live with you for a very long time. Also the tribal music that plays near the burial ground is hypnotic. The visuals are such that they would throw you in the early 80s and you'll be forced to recall those olden days when things used to be so raw natural and wild. The only drawback here is the editing. Viewers may find it difficult to understand why the day randomly switches to morning evening and night. Overall 'Scalps' has a strong message behind it. It simply negates the concept of 'The White Man's Burden' showing that there is still something far more advanced than the White Men or the civilized world has ever witnessed. 'Scalps' has impressed me every time I have watched it so I give it 810 for the horror gore atmosphere dark humor and plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "The overall problem with this movie from what I can see was just a sheer lack of funds to be able to turn this into a real horror movie gem.The story is great. Sure there are plenty of horror flicks out there that in some way revolve around native American burial grounds or mysticism but for me this is the first movie I can recall seeing that has the spirit of an actual native American tribal chief getting his vengeance on those who are after fortune in lieu of respect.The story is of a team of young archaeology students out on a dig who ignore local warnings of where not to dig and unearth a whole heap of trouble in an effort to bring back some rare finds to help further their chance of a career. This angers the spirit of the former tribal chief Black Claw who in turn possesses one of the team and sets about killing the rest. As they're out in the middle of nowhere and miles from help there's a real sense of dread throughout the movie. Also Black Claw appeared quite merciless as he even killed the professor of the students when he turns up at the end to check on their progress.I particularly liked the fact that this movie didn't involve the car suddenly running off the road or being forced off the road it didn't involve religious hillbilly zealots or anything that was the result of 1950's nuclear testing.As I said before the movie suffers a lot from a lack of budget and also from what appears to be timeconstraints to do several takes on some scenes as certain scenes seem rushed. The acting is not all that good and the special effects are pedestrian as does the editing between the night time or dusk shots taken on location and those that were done in a studio however there are some genuine gruesome scenes in this movie that have been fully restored if you're lucky enough to get a copy of the rereleased DVD to make this worth watching if only for a chance to see a different story line.".

The film starts off a little dull but starts to get better as the group make their way into the mountains. The atmosphere is quite creepy in a lowbudget kind of way and reminded me slightly of The Evil Dead plus the location is similar to The Hills Have Eyes. I love the shot of the rotting skeleton when the car goes past but no one sees it.Once they have set up camp the group hear mysterious drumming see strange faces in campfires and so on. There are some hilarious lines such as I broke a fingernail! and also when the girl says that the drumming is coming from hell. The scalping scene is probably the highlight of the film and is brilliantly done  it really surprised me. When the girls throat is cut she writhes around in agony and it looks realistic. Also the part where he removes her scalp is really cool. There's another good gore scene when a mans head is chopped off but it's not quite as impressive.Overall Scalps is worth a watch if you can tolerate low budget horror. It's nothing amazing but does have a low budget charm about it.".

The six starsbeing very judicious with that appellationappear to be right out of a high school play.  The only plusses any of them have is that the ladies especially the gal playing Ellen Corman have wonderful visual assets.  The special effects are a big joke as nothing looks real or scary in any way.  A puppet is occasionally popping up here and there to show us the disembodied spirit of Black Claw.  Night and day readily change.  One moment the players are at a campfire in blackness another moment on a rock as the sun falls and then back to the darkness all in the same evening.  Black Claw is one hell of an Indian if he can manipulate time and space to make that happen! This film falls in the so bad it's entertaining category.

	schema:headline " Extremely underrated slasher from Fred Olen Ray...";
	schema:reviewBody "Looking back that whole videonasty thing was really just a big anti climax. Kind of like sharing a bed with Angelina Jolie and finding out that she'd just given her vow to a nunnery. In the UK films like Pranks and Madhouse were reputed to be so vile and depraved that the thought of sitting through one of them felt like stealing your next door neighbor's car and going banger racing round the neighborhood. But when they finally hit shelves some twenty years later it was like Oh was that really what all the fuss was about? That's why it's nice to come across a title that someway lives up to its exaggerated reputation. Scalps certainly delivers on the gore score and includes one or two grisly scenes that somewhat exceed the expectations of the shoestring budget. The Grim Reaper and Mystery in Rome also boasted extreme gore scenarios but still couldn't lift themselves above mediocrity. I hoped that Scalps could support the bloody stuff with a few decent shocks and surprises.Six bizarrely spaced out anthropology students head out to the Californian Desert to dig up Indian artifacts. Despite a crazy Ralphstyle ominous warning from an old Indian named Billy Iron Wing they continue their journey deep into the vastly uninhabited wasteland. Whilst digging in the blistering sun the troupe unwittingly evoke the wraith of Black Claw the spirit of an evil renegade who died one hundred years earlier. Before long he has possessed one of the gang members and begins to slaughter the rest of them one by one. Stranded in the remote wilderness the remaining students realize that they have to fight to survive the Renegade's murderous intentions Fred Olen Ray tells us on the very informative DVD commentary track that the original distributors of Scalps took the liberty of editing the movie themselves in an attempt to make it more appealing for the commercial market. Unfortunately what they did was pretty much make a mishmash of a film that would have probably been a damn site more intelligible if they had just released it as the director had originally intended. That explains why we see images of the killer roaming the hills before he has even taken possession of the body that he uses to stalk his victims. Despite these unintentional blunders Olen Ray's slasher entry is actually a worthwhile addition to anyone's horror collection. Yes it's easy to mock the amateurish dramatics unfocused photography and choppy editing. I'm very sure that any intelligent film critique could quite rightly rip the production standards to shreds. But when you consider the fact that this is probably THE most poorlyfinanced of the early eighties genre additions then you have to give credit for the fact that it actually manages to do what many bigger budgeted efforts from the time couldn't come close to. Because for all its shoestring and money skimping short cuts you just cannot deny that Scalps is still one hell of an unsettling movie experience.The director wisely chose to mimic John Carpenter's method of creating an eerie soundtrack and keeping it playing continuously throughout the runtime. It helped to build a credibly creepy and extremely desolate feeling that remains morbid right up until the closing credits. The pace is slow in places but you're always aware that something is going to happen soon and when the shocks finally arrive they certainly live up to the grim reputation. The notorious rape sequence feels all the more mean spirited because the victim then has her throat messily slashed before being scalped moments later. There's also a pretty effective decapitation that shows a plausible flair for the macabre from the director. Not many horror films can create the gloomy and isolated feeling that Scalps carries so effortlessly and that's why this movie in its uncut form is so severely underrated.Unfortunately all this credibility doesn't come without it's fair share of problems. The lighting is no less than awful in places. One minute the characters will be sitting round and a camp fire in total darkness and then the next scene will look like it was filmed at around 6 o'clock in the evening. It's obvious that any early eighties miniscule slasher production isn't going to have the best lighting rig in Hollywood. But when it boils down to a handful of candles and two flashlights questions seriously do need to be asked. Perhaps Olen Ray would've done better to shoot all the action in the afternoon light instead of trying to outgrow his finances. As I said earlier the acting is as blocklike as an antique timber yard and some of the camera operators look to have turned up on set after a 24hour private meeting with Jim Bean and Jack Daniels. It's also worth noting that the bemusing tag lines on most VHS releases make this sound like some type of Zombie flick. Don't be fooled. This is 100 stalk and slash and it looks like the person responsible for the cover blurb didn't even bother watching the movie.But despite the above blemishes Scalps is still mean and creepy enough to earn a decent 610 star rating. It may well be cheap nasty and ever so poorly produced. But when you consider the fact that drivel like Hospital Massacre cost almost three times as much to make then you have to say that this is a pretty decent chunk of slasher memorabilia. It certainly has the potential to be updated and remade there just hasn't been enough crazy Indian killers! Certainly worth a look".

One minute the characters will be sitting round and a camp fire in total darkness and then the next scene will look like it was filmed at around 6 o'clock in the evening. It's obvious that any early eighties miniscule slasher production isn't going to have the best lighting rig in Hollywood. But when it boils down to a handful of candles and two flashlights questions seriously do need to be asked. Perhaps Olen Ray would've done better to shoot all the action in the afternoon light instead of trying to outgrow his finances. As I said earlier the acting is as blocklike as an antique timber yard and some of the camera operators look to have turned up on set after a 24hour private meeting with Jim Bean and Jack Daniels. It's also worth noting that the bemusing tag lines on most VHS releases make this sound like some type of Zombie flick. Don't be fooled. This is 100 stalk and slash and it looks like the person responsible for the cover blurb didn't even bother watching the movie.But despite the above blemishes Scalps is still mean and creepy enough to earn a decent 610 star rating. It may well be cheap nasty and ever so poorly produced. But when you consider the fact that drivel like Hospital Massacre cost almost three times as much to make then you have to say that this is a pretty decent chunk of slasher memorabilia. It certainly has the potential to be updated and remade there just hasn't been enough crazy Indian killers! Certainly worth a look";

	schema:reviewBody "If you want a fine example of 'bare bones horror filmmaking' Scalps is just as fine as any example. Not that it's a fine film mind you. Everything about it is rudimentary. Like if it was made by a brute. It looks like the editing was done with an axe first having the film chopped to pieces and then glued together with Pattex superglue. The camera work is limited to pointing it where the actor is when he speaks his lines or when he does something. The audio work was limited to making sure it was at least recorded. This makes up for background noises being very inconsistent during simple conversations when the camera switches angles. In an attempt to cover up the sloppy sound you get many scenes where the musical score continues to play throughout several scenes where it doesn't even belong. While this becomes ridiculous too often the score itself does have its moments. It's minimalistic and electronic and at times manages to enhance the desert landscapes with an ominous atmosphere.Essentially Scalps plays out like mixing an ordinary slasher flick with an Evil Deadish 'vengeful spirits'theme set in a desert  la The Hills Have Eyes at one point it even seems Fred copied the exact same 'passing through a tunnel with a car'scene from the first Evil Dead. A group of young archaeologists set out to excavate an Indian burial ground. We all know you should stay away from such sites when you're starring in a horror movie. One directed by Fred Olen Ray no less so thankfully that also means naked boobs and gore... The boobs at display are fine the attempted rapescene too yes the spirits they awaken are not only angry but also horny. The gore at display while being raw and not of a high technical standard is pretty cool too heads being decapitated  scalped throats being cut.... It's bloody but very basic yet not without charm. You can include notsoeffective 'possessed' makeup effects in the gamma and one incredibly puzzling appearance of a ghostly demon dude with an animatronic lion's head. A great source of incomprehensible laughter but afterwards I learned that this was testfootage Fred never intended to edit into the movie. His producers decided otherwise. Another highlight in the SFX department is the exploding ghostly Indian head. Its evil floating influence is felt  seen numerous times throughout the movie not sure if that was intended either but at one point it makes the stupid mistake to appear amidst a crispy campfire. Boom! Bye bye ghostly Indian head. Good stuff.The film's pace is pretty damn slow obviously as we're dealing with an early 80's slasher here. The performances aren't very convincing as to be expected but the young cast does manage to say things with a straight face. And that in itself is an accomplishment as most of the dialogues are clichddriven moronic drap. However one girl manages to utter the most memorable line from the whole film Defiling the graves of the dead will only anger their souls!. Upon hearing it it spontaneously evokes the viewer's urge to repeat it with a more firm lowpitched threatening voice. And so we did. Hilarity ensued.I think that sums up about everything there is to say about Fred Olen Ray's Scalps. He does try to make a serioustoned supernatural slasher but delivers an inept piece of bare bones filmmaking. It's notable for the rudimentary gore effects and the occasionally atmospheric soundtrack. But as so it goes with most of his other 80's horrorscifi outings it's advisable to watch it with friends. That way you can have more fun with the 'bad movie qualities' it has. Make this film better and share the laughter. And then go right ahead and watch his honesttogod Alien cashin Deep Space too. By then 1988 Fred had already learned to pick up the pace of a film understood that his films needed more slimy tentacles  grotesque monster action and very well gained the budgetary means to hire The Great Charles Napier I've got a mouth that can open sideways too! to spearhead the cast. It's the one film that proudly managed to put him on my Bmovie map in my early days. If you really need to see one Fred Olen Ray film then watch Deep Space.".

The film kicks off in high gear as we see a decapitation right off the bat and you get ready to see this type of thing throughout the 88minute running time but it doesn't happen again for quite a while. The entire middle section of this picture is downright boring as the characters do nothing but talk about what we've already seen them do and talk about what we're about to see them do.The horror elements finally kick in and that's when we get some more fun gory violence but it takes a very long time to get there and by the time it does come it's just too late. I will say that the film has some charm if you're a fan of these types of movies. The cast range from poor to okay but you do get Forrest J. Ackerman playing a small role.".

After watching however so many of his movies I think this is his approach to take a completely trite excuse for a story that anyone who has ever seen a horror movie could recite in their sleep and then suck it of any of the life and possibility of interest it ever could have had. His movies are usually short barely clocking in at over an hour and that entire first hour will be characters wandering around doing absolutely nothing of interest and certainly nothing that will invest them with a personality or give you any reason whatsoever to care about them at all. After he has lulled you to sleep better than your grandmother could when you were six months old he'll start deploying with the actual horror movie stuff ie. gore but as I said you'll be asleep or perhaps even comatose by this point.In the first hour of a Fred Olen Ray movie he carefully constructs as many barriers between you and caring about his movie as he can. In the last ten or fifteen minutes he throws the things you probably watched the movie hoping to see at you ie. the blood and guts but you probably gave up at barrier 3 or 4 and have long since stopped paying attention to the movie and started doing something else.Scalps has a few extra barriers between you and it aside from its most sturdy ie. the tedium of it. These are the picture quality and the sound. The movie looks like it was filmed through mud. You can barely make out what you are seeing anyway so even if it wasn't boring and pointless you wouldn't be able to see it.The sound was obviously all recorded in post production making it stick out like a sore thumb and sound entirely unnatural and distracting throughout the entire movie. It makes you want to watch the characters lips at the beginning at least knowing it's probably totally out of sync but then you realise that you can't really see their lips  remember? The movie was filmed through mud.The plot is something to do with college students I guess going to stay in an Indian burial ground. They wander around doing nothing and saying nothing of interest for an hour until they are killed in a variety of admittedly gruesome ways. One is clubbed from behind by something that looks like a topless Dame Edna Everidge. In the movie's most noteworthy scene of violence a woman is indeed actually scalped so at least there was a reason for the title other than the racist exploitation of Native American myths the movie engages in.The scalping scene may not look all that realistic but it must have cost some actual money. If they could afford to do that why couldn't they have come up with a plot for this mess a boom mic and a camera lens that wasn't covered in sludge?".

All the scenes shot at night are virtually impossible to watch you literally cannot see anything and the sound quality is very poor. It could be argued that this is just my copy of the movie but then how do you explain the totally incoherent narrative? It makes no sense whatsoever. Where did the monsters come from? Why are they attacking the kids? Why did the people in town know about this if no one returns alive?At the end of the day I think that this makes the film virtually unwatchable and not endearing like The Beyond of Lost highway as the questions raised by those films are not suppossed to be answered.".

It could be argued that this is just my copy of the movie but then how do you explain the totally incoherent narrative? It makes no sense whatsoever. Where did the monsters come from? Why are they attacking the kids? Why did the people in town know about this if no one returns alive?At the end of the day I think that this makes the film virtually unwatchable and not endearing like The Beyond of Lost highway as the questions raised by those films are not suppossed to be answered.";

Why Fred gives away the decapitation in the beginning is still an unsolved question because it almost the best part of this flick. What's weirder is the fact that before the begin credits you have only a score combined with the images. Once they start talking you're in for bad sound and bad editing. Some parts were filmed without extra light which gives you too dark images. Some parts of this flick is filmed on bad reel other parts are better it's just like they used different reels to add it on the DVD. The effects are sometimes ridiculous like the pop up of the Indian ghost with white eyes but others are done well. The scalping is done really good and the beheading is also okay. But overall you have to take a lot of talking before the movie really starts going. It reminded me a bit of the story of Evil Dead here they use some Indian sticks to wake up old spirits and they get possessed by them killing their friends. This is a pure example of what Drivein is all about. It's watchable still today if you're looking for old horrors but don't expect too much of it.".

JoAnn Robinson Randy Richard Hench Kershaw Ellerbe Roger Maycock Ben Murphy Frank McDonald Louise Landon Carol Sue Flockhart and Ellen Corman Barbara Magnusson prepare for a field trip assignment. Using local maps they try to locate a burial ground that contained Native American remains for them to study. Finding the proposed site to study they come across an old Indian legend concerning the movement of artifacts and bones from their graves would unleash the spirit of a warrior from it's resting place. As they manage to get the bones out of the ground they suddenly find a series of strange events befall them and come to the realization that the stories were right and are now being stalking by a maniacal killer who could be one of the students possessed.The Good News This one here does have a couple of rather nice areas that work. One of the main ones is that this one decides to forgo the usual matter of having it be an Indian burial ground and instead uses the storyline of making the artifacts removed from their land bring about the curse. That offers up a little amount of ingenuity and makes for some really tense moments when the group begins digging up the grounds knowing full well that it will lead to them getting killed off. Those are quite fun and do have some nice amounts of tension to them. The kills themselves aren't terrible and do offer up some pretty gory moments. One is whacked in the head with a tomahawk another has an arrow shot into their eye at close range another has their throat slit before being scalped all done in extreme closeup and another has a slew of arrows shot into their back and legs among others. These here do spill a lot more blood than expected which allows them to have some appeal to the gorehounds out there. The final halfhour which is where ninetyfive percent of the action takes place is a lot of fun. It's fastpaced contains all the best scenes and kills and is something that allows for plenty of fun to be had. The other good part is all of the popup scare tactics where the head of a deformed Indian head appears out of nowhere to offer up a few nice scenes. The firepit is the best one since it's the best outofnowhere gag among them and really works nicely. These here make the film watchable.The Bad News This one isn't that bad but it does have a couple of rather important flaws to it. The first one is the fact that this one takes so long to get going. After the opening murder this one takes until the fortyfive minute mark to knock off another and that is just way too long for the film. That leaves unending scenes of them complaining to no end about the seriousness of what they're doing and how it will come back to hurt them. Those scenes are just irritating no less as the heroine is the one complaining about it and rather than trying to take the obvious route or reasoning with the others this one decides to have them focus on just ranting out a long series of statements that are supposed to get the viewer to side with the heroine as they're arguing for the right cause but this is done in such the wrong way that it finally gets too much and those scenes are annoying to watch and just make the film a chore to sit through when they're on. Those also hurt the film due to it's length as this one could've really been stretched out a little longer. The fact that it doesn't even make eighty minutes is something of concern as there's a little more that could've been done to make the film a little longer without it feeling stretched out at all. The confusing way it ends is something else and when viewed it will be obvious what is being criticized since it's easy to spot and makes for a rather headscratching moment. These few areas here are what keep the film down.The Final Verdict While this one isn't that terrible as far as slashers go the incredibly long period of time in between activity is what hurts this one the most. See this one only if you're a hardcore slasher fanatic or have a need to see trashy films otherwise there's much better ones out there to see rather than this one.Rated R Graphic Violence Language Brief Nudity and Rape".

Ray through great trouble has tried to assemble a film in it's entirety using what materials were present but Scalps..sent to numerous foreign distributors who themselves edited footage out and into Scalps he admits is still an improper version of what he set out to accomplish.

The photography..Ray proclaims that he at least worked with 7 or 8 DP'sis often really ugly and the cast doesn't help the director out. From start to finish the film is a trial to sit through. The pacing drags at a snail's pace and the dialogue can make your ears bleed but perhaps the writing is hampered by those who say the words. The Black Claw spirit carries the facial features of a grotesque witch you might find in a Grimm Fairy Tale storybook. The gore often delivers the goods specifically the scalping scene and slit throat which gushes blood. There's also an impressive oozing bullet wound to the forehead as well. There's an unpleasant rape scene where Richard Hench's possessed Randy throws his girlfriend down ripping her shirt and bra while forcing penetration as she cries out in horror. Ray mentions in the audio commentary that he didn't want to create such a scene but wanted to distribute this film into theaters and that the guys in New York demanded nudity during the rape. I thought Forrest J Ackerman's cameo plugging his MOnsters mag was shameless and inappropriate..and it was clear that Olen Ray doesn't exactly condone it in retrospect. Carroll Borland..the vampire protg of Lugosi's Count in Browning's MARK OF THE VAMPIREhas a minor scene as a college dean furious with anthropology professor..played by former Superman Kirk Alynfor breaking certain rules regarding artifacts he possibly confiscated illegally. My favorite scenes in the film feature skeletal remains left burning in the sun as either a rat or desert tarantula crawl about over it. The history behind this film is far better than the product presented but Scalps is a definite example of what can happen when a directors work is butchered by others.

I saw a few people post about the soundtrack...It's the same damn music looped over and over and over and over get the point? for the first 30 minutes of the film. It actually becomes comical at one point  then it becomes really annoying. SCALPS isn't even in the So Bad It's Good category...It belongs in the same category as LUCKER THE NECROPHAGOUS as an It's So Boring I'm HalfAsleep film. I'm not gonna spend too much time on this mess of a film...so here goes...A bunch of dumbass's dig around on some Indian land  a bunch of boring stuff happens then there are a few decent kill scenes. THE END...I like schlock and goofy films but I don't think anything happened of any interest in the first fifty minutes of this film. No I take that back there's some weird guy in a lion tiger leopard whatever... outfit that I never really understood in the beginning and some old guy cuts his own throat with a knife because he's possessed or some such sh!t...after that you have a bunch of boring nonsense about guys with bad beards and girls with bad hair hanging out in the desert somewhere. When things FINALLY start to happen there are actually 2 or 3 decent and by decent I mean there's at least some blood and an aboveaverage throatslashing...kill scenes and I think all of one set of tits in a scene that is so dark that even if they DO look good you can barely see them. This one was just way too dull for my taste and can only recommend this to real Zgrade schlock fans or people that might wanna pull a MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000style commentary through the film. 310".

I saw a few people post about the soundtrack...It's the same damn music looped over and over and over and over get the point? for the first 30 minutes of the film. It actually becomes comical at one point  then it becomes really annoying. SCALPS isn't even in the So Bad It's Good category...It belongs in the same category as LUCKER THE NECROPHAGOUS as an It's So Boring I'm HalfAsleep film. I'm not gonna spend too much time on this mess of a film...so here goes...A bunch of dumbass's dig around on some Indian land  a bunch of boring stuff happens then there are a few decent kill scenes. THE END...I like schlock and goofy films but I don't think anything happened of any interest in the first fifty minutes of this film. No I take that back there's some weird guy in a lion tiger leopard whatever... outfit that I never really understood in the beginning and some old guy cuts his own throat with a knife because he's possessed or some such sh!t...after that you have a bunch of boring nonsense about guys with bad beards and girls with bad hair hanging out in the desert somewhere. When things FINALLY start to happen there are actually 2 or 3 decent and by decent I mean there's at least some blood and an aboveaverage throatslashing...kill scenes and I think all of one set of tits in a scene that is so dark that even if they DO look good you can barely see them. This one was just way too dull for my taste and can only recommend this to real Zgrade schlock fans or people that might wanna pull a MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000style commentary through the film. 310";

Indigenous peoples apply body paint whole villages dance. The film moves to destruction of nature via logging blasting and strip mining. Images of poverty rapid urban life and factories give way to war concentration camps and mass graves. Ancient ruins come into view and then a sacred river where pilgrims bathe and funeral pyres burn. Prayer and nature return. A monk rings a huge bell stars wheel across the sky.";

	schema:headline " A Sensual and Spiritual Experience";
	schema:reviewBody "Baraka is an ancient Sufi word translated as a blessing or as the essence of life from which the evolutionary process unfolds. With the theme of man's diversity and his impact upon the environment Baraka is a documentary photographed on six continents in 24 countries including Tanzania China Brazil Japan Nepal the U.S. and Europe. It has no story and no dialogue yet transcends geography and language to provide a sensual and spiritual experience that enables the viewer to look at the world in a totally different way.When the film opens a lone snow monkey sits in the middle of a hot spring biding its time. The expression on its face is one of deep reflection and weariness. When it looks up at the stars then closes its eyes shutting itself off from its surroundings I sensed my own inner longing for the infinite. As the film progresses we see the edge of a volcano in Hawaii the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem the RyoanJi temple in Kyoto Lake Natron in Tanzania and the fire plains of Kuwait their oil fires burning after the 1991 Gulf War. Through Fricke's camera we glimpse various forms of religious expression from the chanting of monks to tribal celebrations in Africa and Brazil. Baraka is almost like an updated version of Godfrey Reggio's 1983 film Koyaanisqatsi. Using speededup images of hectic big city life with its homelessness and deprivation interspersed with mountain vistas and forests it depicts the mechanical nature of modern life as contrasted with the beauty of the natural world. This film allowed me to see things I never knew existed and to glimpse patterns of interconnectedness and a sense of balance and proportion in the world I was barely aware of. I was moved to simply look into people's faces and have them look back at me allowing me to connect with the universality of the human spirit. Fricke has said that Baraka was intended to be a journey of rediscovery that plunges into nature into history into the human spirit and finally into the realm of the infinite. Unique in its beauty sensitivity and perception Baraka succeeded in the course of 90 minutes in moving me from the humdrum of everyday reality to a calmer and more spiritual space".

For those that seek it out at the proper time 'Baraka' can act as a milestone of revelation. What the viewer takes from this film will solely be determined by the life experience they bring to it. 'Baraka' is unique in that it actually requires a commitment of time and concentration. This is a film that communicates its message without utilizing standard film language. Those that try to make the images conform to the conventional notions of Hollywood story telling are likely to give up in frustration. For a film with no plotcharacters or dialog it communicates an astonishing number of profound themes. Those who are familiar with National Geographic or the works of David Attenbourough will have little trouble in identifying the fascinating locals and tribes but be forewarned there are reasons that there are no subtitles or text on screen. Personal discovery is at the heart of the filmmaker's intentions. The ambient soundtrack by Michael Sterns weaves the images together on a separate plain producing a hypnotic pathway for the images to flow. Once you allow yourself to be pulled along by this current of sound the images will link themselves together and the true revelations hidden within 'Baraka' will make themselves apparent. You may find as I did that your subconscious will be at work on 'Baraka' for many weeks after the experience unlocking doors to a greater understanding.".

Steal it if you have to. 2 The biggest clearest TV you can find and 5.1 surround. 3 A fabulouslyrolled spleefer as long as your arm. 4 Phones off the hook and an empty house with the lights out. 5 A recliner with a seat belt. 6 96 minutes of your time.I am 30 year old factory worker who loves NASCAR and Hockey and own 3 carbureted cars  1 parked in my backyard that hasn't ran in 2 years AND I could probably pass for the guy who might spit as I offer you confusing directions if you stopped to ask but I have never seen anything anywhere remotely close to this masterpiece. It's so good that it runs through my head while I'm slugging away at work covered in factory germs. The Burgan oil fires the fire we possess to the Australian steel workers our ongoing need to keep the fire going to the Auschwitz gas ovens what we choose to do with it is pure cinematic genius. For me the Whirling Dervishes forward is my favorite scene. Where it slides from the mosque in Mecca to the cathedral ceiling at the Vatican is absolutely mindbending. I feel like crying every time I watch it yet I'm not all that religious.Aside from all this film brings with it it's not for everyone and I can understand that. I was 17 when it came out and probably could have cared less. But for a bluecollar hick in need of a shave like me I'd take this movie to prison if I was allowed.When you see it for the first time don't ask questions. Turn the volume up as loud as you can and just watch it. Baraka will provide you with everything you need. 10 thumbs out of 10 and not just up but way up. Can't wait for the sequel.".

The two films are similarly structured both sans dialog both a collage of video images set to nontraditional music.Baraka is without a doubt the more visually beautiful of the two. Many of the images here are almost literally poetry in motion others are among the most aweinspiring I've seen anywhere.On the other hand the complaints of some of the other reviewers about the editing are not without foundation. Whereas initially the central themes seem to be the wonders of the natural world and the various manners of worship of societies around the world we are somewhat surprised to find segments showing an egg production facility Taiwanese prostitutes and scavengers at a Calcutta landfill. We are left wondering about relevance and suspect that the editor unwisely indulged an urge to make a quick and nonetoosubtle political point.Equally importantly the images in Baraka often depict quite exceptional scenes or placesthe gas chambers at Auschwitz say or the pilgrims at Mecca or various other religious monuments. Thus Baraka more or less forfeits any claim to be about ordinary life or somesuch.Koyaanisqatsi on the other hand hewed to ordinary images from moreorless ordinary life pretty much from beginning to end one exception may have been the dynamiting of a housing project and of course there is the final image of the rocket disintegrating. But for nearly its entire length it stuck to a central theme contrasting man's world with the natural world. Thus it carries meaning precisely by virtue of its rather more ordinary but nonetheless often quite beautiful images whereas Baraka seems to have largely forsaken deeper meaning in the pursuit of stunning visuals.So there you have it. Both are very valuable works but in rather different ways. Baraka is not entirely bereft of meaning of course but what meaning there is derives from the individual images and not from the film as a whole.".

Its truly wonderful cinema. No mention of the ritual itself celebrating the scarring closed of pudendal lips after circumcision. There's a nice scene of an Australian marking his face with color.

That already shows in the way the beginning is edited shots aren't fully finished before they cut to the next shot it almost feels ironically enough like he's got too little time to show everything he wants to.It's interesting that Ron Fricke was director of photography of Koyaanisqatsi which was released about 9 years earlier. Koyaanisqatsi same IMDB user rating! does have that coherence that strong opinion which you can't get around while watching it. All means style music editing etc. are used to serve this one purpose to let the spectator experience this overpopulated overstressed world.In my opinion Fricke should have focused on less different subjects and connect them by a much stronger and clearer message. That would have turned Baraka into a master piece. I wonder why I see so many people on the credits who worked on Koyanisqatsi too except for one person Godfrey Reggio the director.

The superb early scenes of the mountain primates apart Baraka provides entertainment and viewer satisfaction that is simply overshadowed by the philosophical and structural brilliance of the Reggio trilogy. I wonder why Reggio did not use Fricke in the last two works in the trilogy.Fricke's eye for visuals is commendable. But Baraka misses the spirituality of Reggio it merely strives to copy Reggio's work. Probably Reggio's years of solitude and prayer as he prepared to be a monk gave him the philosophical edge over Fricke's obvious craftsmanship. While I am not devaluing the obvious merits of Baraka I really wish Fricke Reggio and glass team up again to make another film to relive the magic of Koyaanisqatsi.".

With lots of slow pans which dwell on the mystery and beauty of exotic cultures and countries and a 96 minute run there's not sufficient time to do the planet justice. Nonetheless Baraka is a worthy and ambitious project which will likely have limited appeal among the general filmgoing public.

With lots of slow pans which dwell on the mystery and beauty of exotic cultures and countries and a 96 minute run there's not sufficient time to do the planet justice. Nonetheless Baraka is a worthy and ambitious project which will likely have limited appeal among the general filmgoing public. Kudos to Fricke for showing us places not seen much outside the pages of National Geographic.";

It is simply an emotional connection with some of the more remarkable features of Earth and humanity in the late 20th Century. Some of it is beautiful some of it is sad some of it is awesome some of it is messed up. If we had to send a documentary about our planet to an alien race without the use of language Baraka would be perfect. This film will not stroke your ego or give you some action adventure hero to identify with.

	schema:reviewBody "Red Heat is a surprisingly good movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi have good chemistry in this Russian copcop buddy film. In this film at least it makes sense for Arnie to have an accent. There is some good lines and the back and forth between these two is pretty funny sometimes. When Jim Belushi plays a cop he puts on this irreverant I don't like the rules but I get things done style. It is this style combined with Arnold's complete objective at all costs style that makes this film work. The footage that was shot in Red Square is breathtaking and overall the movie manages to take a basic plot and make it entertaining. On a side note the holdout gun used by the villian Ed O'Ross in the movie is pretty damn cool if you're into that kind of thing. Bottom Line This is worth getting or you can rent it every once and awhile if you can only take Arnold for so long.".

	onyx:emotionText "Red Heat is a surprisingly good movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi have good chemistry in this Russian copcop buddy film. In this film at least it makes sense for Arnie to have an accent. There is some good lines and the back and forth between these two is pretty funny sometimes. When Jim Belushi plays a cop he puts on this irreverant I don't like the rules but I get things done style. It is this style combined with Arnold's complete objective at all costs style that makes this film work.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is a very good and stylish action but such movies are not appreciated in comparison with the recent action movies which is pretty strange. For example even the rating of awful Transporter 3 is higher than Red Heat. You probably know that critics hate Schwarzenegger Stallone and Van Damme also they hate action genre probably so according to them Schwarzenegger is an untalented muscle mass who can impress only children and his movies are shame. Schwarzenegger is not a Jack Lemmon or Sean Penn or Brad Pitt but he has a pulling power and is great acting necessary for action movies? I ask this already asked question. By the way I think that his performance in The Terminator 2 was outstanding. And as an action star he is much better than new action stars. He made very bad movies yes but everyone does that doesn't? One of the criticisms of the critics is that he kills people so the movie supports individual justice killing criminals instead of imprisoning etc. Well most of action movies are like that but they do not object when it comes Tarantino movies or David Cronenberg movies like A History of Violence. Red Heat does not include a lot of action scenes or action scenes are not 'big' but it is very stylish thanks to Walter Hill one of my all time favorite directors and fun. There is a key scene when I was a child I used to become Arnold Schwarzenegger and do what he does in the scene. He was one of my childhood heroes. Those days and his films are pleasant memories for me. Returning to Red Heat it is from Schwarzenegger's golden period. Today they cannot make action movies like Red Heat.".

Where there were two cops totally incompatible with each other having or being forced to work together. The movie is more like a clash of political philosophies Capitalism Vrs Communism then anything else.We get to see Moscow police captain Ivan Danko Governor Arnold Schwarzennegger flex his bulging muscles when he goes into a bathhouse looking for a gang of Georgain drug dealers. In no time at all Danko turns he entire place into a wild and crazy free for all taking out a number of muscle men in and out of he bathhouse. Danko gets the information that he was looking for on where the gang leader Victor Rosta Ed O'Rossis to be found in the Durzhba Caf in the little Georgia section of Moscow.Later Danko and his partner Yuri OgarkovOleg Vidov confronts the Georgian drug dealers and their boss Rosta where there a a wild shootout where Yuri is killed and Rosta and a number of is gang escapes. It's later when the Moscow PD gets the news that Rosta was arrested for a minor traffic violation in of all places Chicago that Danko is sent to the United States to expedite him back to the Soviet Union. Danko is told by his superiors not to mentions a word to the US and Chicago law enforcement officials to what Rosta is wanted for. The Soviet leaders don't want it to get out that they like the US have a serious and home grown drug problem.Danko looking stiff an a bit uncomfortable at the Chicago O'Hare Airport is assigned Chicago Det. Art Ridzik James Belushito show him around the city until he finally gets all the papers in order to take Rosta back to the USSR. Everything goes according to plan until Rosta is rescued with Danko almost losing his life in the shooting by this notorious black Chicago drug gang called the Shaveheads whom Rosta was working with. The movie then really starts to pick up with Danko now not only in trouble with the Chicago PD for his very unMarandalike police tactics but also with his Soviet police superiors for letting Rosta get away.Top rate police action thriller with Danko and Ridzik turning the city of Chicago upside down in trying to find the fugitive Rosta who's involved in a major drug deal with the Shaveheads that's about to go down at a city bus depot. Danko shows that he's as mentally smart as he's physically powerful by him figuring out what Rosta  Co are up to by renting Rosta's former hotel room 302 knowing that he left evidence of his drug dealings there. Danko wisely putting down on the hotel register a wrong number 303 to trick Rosa and his boys who later blast into room 303 thinking that Danko was there and ending up getting wasted by him in the resulting shootout.Rosta turns out to be as ruthless and deceptive as he ever was back in the Soviet Union. Doublecrossing his allies the Shaveheads by taking the money he was to give them for the drugs that they were to supply him with. Rosta even having his American wife that he paid 10000.00 to marry him so he can be a US citizen parttime aerobics instructor and fulltime hooker Cat Manzetti Gina Gershon murdered together with one of his Georgian Confederates after he felt that they were no longer of any use to him.Danko now completely out of control with Det. Ridzik now fully supporting him Ridzik by now saw that Danko's way of doing things was far better then that of the Chicago PD has it out with Rosta in a mad and dangerous bus chase and demolition derby game. This wild and insane action almost causes as much damage to the city of Chicago as the great fire of 1871 did with Rosta finally being put down and out in a High Noon western style shootout. Just as good if not better as most of Arnold's more popular films it's in Red Heat that he finally puts it all together not just in the actions sequences but in his comical interacting with his American police partner James Belushi playing Det. Ridzik. With all the shooting and destruction over and Danko about to fly back home to Moscow he it's traditional among departing friends he tells him hand over his very expensivelooking watch to Ridzik who gladly give him his thinking that he got the best of the bargain. It turns out that Danko had a cheap 20.00 EastGerman made watch when Ridzik in exchange gave him and expensive 1000.00 USSwiss made one! The anticapitalistic Soviet Ivan Danko learned how to be a capitalist a lot faster and better then the procapitalistic American Art Ridzik did.".

Even James Horner's score is kind of middleground neither good nor terrible.There's no real problem or fault with Red Heat except that is just doesn't offer an exhilarating amount of what it sets up.

	schema:headline " That was a fcking Chicago landmark. Decent enough 80's action thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "Red Heat starts in Russia where drug baron Viktor 'Rosta' Rostavili Ed O'Ross is busted by cop Captain Ivan Danko Arnold Schwarzenegger but he manages to escape shooting  killing Danko's partner  friend Yuri Oleg Vidow on the run Viktor then flees to Chicago  starts to set up a huge drug deal with a local gang but is arrested on a minor traffic charge. Russia wants Viktor back  sends Captain Danko to Chicago to take custody of Viktor  escort him back home however Viktor's people manage to bust him out in a shootout in which Chicago cop Detective Sergeant Tom Gallagher Richard Bright is killed. With the Russian's humiliated a Chicago cop killed  Viktor free again Captain Danko teams up with Gallager's partner Art Ridzik James Belushi to bring Viktor to justice...Cowritten coproduced  directed by Walter Hill this buddy buddy mismatched cop action thriller is not too dissimilar to his earlier film 48 Hrs. 1982 as an overblown late 80's Hollywood action film Red Heat is watchable  entertaining but not outstanding. I think that if you were to ask anyone to name one Schwarzenegger film from the 80's nobody would say Red Heat this is minor Arnie that doesn't particularly distinguish itself but is still a decent watch all the same. The script is a fairly routine rehash of the genre clichs the two opposing character's who have to overcome a personality clash  other differences to take down some bad guy one goes by the book while the other is a loose cannon on the edge cop who cracks lots of oneliners there's the blatant disregard for credibility as a police commander actually lets this Russian  one of his cops run around with guns there's either an action scene or shootout at regular intervals to take your mind off the wobbly story that is rather predictable  feels wholly routine  the inevitable ending where the two mismatched partners actually realise they can work together  develop a new found respect for each other despite their differences. To be fair for what it is  what it sets out to do basically be an entertaining buddy buddy mismatched cop action thriller Red Heat passes the time harmlessly enough  if it wasn't for the fact that it does feel a little generic it would probably be quite highly thought of amongst 80's action film junkies. The dialogue is quite snappy  amusing at times especially Belushi's foul mouthed wise cracking cop. There's nothing wrong with Red Heat as it were but at the same time it's not a film that really stands out still perfectly watchable though.Director Hill does alright the production team was actually refused permission to film is Russia although they sneaked Arnie in  filmed him in Red Square while noone was looking... The action scenes are well shot  edited you can clearly see what's going on  there's none of that modern shaky handheld camera movement or ultra quick cut editing which makes it impossible to see what's going on. This is the way an action film should be shot. Most of the setpieces consist of shootouts  fights until the end when there's a pretty cool bus chase through Chicago some of which was later edited into the rubbish killer Cockroach film They Crawl 2001. Probably one of the few big budget Hollywood action flicks where nothing explodes or gets blown up. The film is dedicated to experienced stunt coordinator Bennie Dobbins who died on set on February 5th 1988 in Vienna while staging the opening scene of the fight in the snow. I must admit that I actually found the opening titles really annoying  the way that the 'R's  'N's in people's names were reversed I don't know why I just found it highly irritating to read. Also one has to mention the overthetop sound effects which can sound really silly at times just check out the sound effects at the start as Arnie beats the guy up in the snow to hear what I mean.Technically the film is good it has good production values  is well made. The cast is pretty good Arnie is rather wooden Belushi is fun Gina Gershon is alright in a small role Ed O'Ross makes for a good villain although I'm not sure about his accent while Laurence Fishburne does OK in an early role before he hit the big time with The Matrix trilogy.Red Heat is a film that you can't really say much about it's a fairly generic buddy buddy mismatched cop action thriller although taken for what it is it's above average for the genre. I liked it  I am sure most action fans will too.".

Russia wants Viktor back  sends Captain Danko to Chicago to take custody of Viktor  escort him back home however Viktor's people manage to bust him out in a shootout in which Chicago cop Detective Sergeant Tom Gallagher Richard Bright is killed. With the Russian's humiliated a Chicago cop killed  Viktor free again Captain Danko teams up with Gallager's partner Art Ridzik James Belushi to bring Viktor to justice...Cowritten coproduced  directed by Walter Hill this buddy buddy mismatched cop action thriller is not too dissimilar to his earlier film 48 Hrs. 1982 as an overblown late 80's Hollywood action film Red Heat is watchable  entertaining but not outstanding. I think that if you were to ask anyone to name one Schwarzenegger film from the 80's nobody would say Red Heat this is minor Arnie that doesn't particularly distinguish itself but is still a decent watch all the same. The script is a fairly routine rehash of the genre clichs the two opposing character's who have to overcome a personality clash  other differences to take down some bad guy one goes by the book while the other is a loose cannon on the edge cop who cracks lots of oneliners there's the blatant disregard for credibility as a police commander actually lets this Russian  one of his cops run around with guns there's either an action scene or shootout at regular intervals to take your mind off the wobbly story that is rather predictable  feels wholly routine  the inevitable ending where the two mismatched partners actually realise they can work together  develop a new found respect for each other despite their differences. To be fair for what it is  what it sets out to do basically be an entertaining buddy buddy mismatched cop action thriller Red Heat passes the time harmlessly enough  if it wasn't for the fact that it does feel a little generic it would probably be quite highly thought of amongst 80's action film junkies. The dialogue is quite snappy  amusing at times especially Belushi's foul mouthed wise cracking cop. There's nothing wrong with Red Heat as it were but at the same time it's not a film that really stands out still perfectly watchable though.Director Hill does alright the production team was actually refused permission to film is Russia although they sneaked Arnie in  filmed him in Red Square while noone was looking... The action scenes are well shot  edited you can clearly see what's going on  there's none of that modern shaky handheld camera movement or ultra quick cut editing which makes it impossible to see what's going on. This is the way an action film should be shot. Most of the setpieces consist of shootouts  fights until the end when there's a pretty cool bus chase through Chicago some of which was later edited into the rubbish killer Cockroach film They Crawl 2001. Probably one of the few big budget Hollywood action flicks where nothing explodes or gets blown up. The film is dedicated to experienced stunt coordinator Bennie Dobbins who died on set on February 5th 1988 in Vienna while staging the opening scene of the fight in the snow. I must admit that I actually found the opening titles really annoying  the way that the 'R's  'N's in people's names were reversed I don't know why I just found it highly irritating to read. Also one has to mention the overthetop sound effects which can sound really silly at times just check out the sound effects at the start as Arnie beats the guy up in the snow to hear what I mean.Technically the film is good it has good production values  is well made. The cast is pretty good Arnie is rather wooden Belushi is fun Gina Gershon is alright in a small role Ed O'Ross makes for a good villain although I'm not sure about his accent while Laurence Fishburne does OK in an early role before he hit the big time with The Matrix trilogy.Red Heat is a film that you can't really say much about it's a fairly generic buddy buddy mismatched cop action thriller although taken for what it is it's above average for the genre. I liked it  I am sure most action fans will too.";

But I guess everyone has their different tastes. See I had absolutely no problem with Arnold he did everything he was supposed to do but it was his chemistry with Belushi it didn't really work since Belushi is more annoying than funny. Belushi just ruined the chemistry they could have had to make this a memorable buddy cop film.Ivan is from Russia he goes to Chicago Illinois to find a villain who is slowly turning Russia into the next Miami. Well Ivan must work with Art Ridzik a cop from Chicago when the villain gets away. Together they must find out how to capture him but Art is going to have a hard time with the iron jawed soldier who likes to do things his own way. Not to mention Ivan with Art who has to stick by the American book of police brutality.Red Heat isn't a bad movie it was cool seeing one of Gina Gershon's first roles in film she actually did a decent job in Red Heat it wasn't a surprise that she made it big afterwards. Arnold did a good job as well I loved how monotone his lines were he was great.

Absurd violent overthetop and downright entertaining this is a fun and funny thriller playing the old copbuddy formula so good the film is very fun even if it's been used before whether good LETHAL WEAPON or bad THE PRESIDIO. RED HEAT stands out as one of the good ones.Arnold Schwarzenegger is hilarious as he wears a furry hat as a soviet police officer sent to America to track down a Russian drug lord Ed O'Ross who is also responsible for the death of his partner. He is then partnered to a wacky Chicago cop named Art Ridzik Jim Belushi in search of the drug tycoon and his thugs in Chicago. Although dark and violent director Hill manages to inject as much humor as possible. Schwarzenegger is a weak actor but he's funny in this film. Belushi is a hoot as the crazy police partner.The action is impressive from car chases fastpaced shootouts and even trains crashing on buses. But it's the humor that really gets to you more here and there's a lot. Since buddycop movies are pretty common 80's attraction this one is delivered with style and a whole lot of wit.Rating  out of 5.".

I loved this when it first came out but its not up to the standard of some of Arnolds other 80's films like The Terminator and Predator it is however superior to The Running Man and Raw Deal. Arnolds dead pan delivery makes his performance as close to The Terminator as its possible to be. James Belushi is quite a good actor but seems to live in the shadow of his late great brother John. His most famous film outwith this one is probably K9 which actually is terrible. He is funny in a small role in Trading Places though. The action scenes are pretty over the top in Red Heat especially the opening scene where Arnie has a fight which starts in a sauna and ends up in the snow. Entertaining stuff look out for Laurence Fishbourne of The Matrix fame in a earlyish role. 610".

Arnhuld does little better with Ivan Danko a character you might call onedimensional if he were that complex.The film is one of constant contradictions. The brief nudity and frequent bad language work against the MOR buddy cop comedy. The settings are lowkey and squalid yet directed with a brash mainstream feel. There are good actors such as Laurence Fishburne yet wasted on severely underwritten lines sloppy editing and indifferent direction. All the items commonly associated with halfassed low brow actioners are present hysterically screaming halfdressed women characters yelling with comic effect as a vehicle goes out of control and flies through the air plus police chiefs that threaten you'll be back to a desk job on Monday.The cold war politics are dealt with in a childishly patronising way while the plot is a series of perfunctory set pieces loosely strung together. There doesn't even appear to be three full acts the climax drawing short and having little emotional resonance. Yet it's impossible to really slate the film as it was really just one in a long line of seemed good at the time weak star vehicles for then upandcoming Arnie. It might not be any good but he does get to take his shirt off shoot a few people and get into fights. Well that's all right then. 410.".

	schema:reviewBody "Writer  director Walter Hill did what all good filmmakers have done at some point in their careers. He recycled some situations from his earlier works and his postCold War thriller Red Heat constitutes the result. This police procedural buddy picture borrows notions from earlier Hill movies such as The Driver starring Ryan O'Neal and 48 HRS costarring Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy. Basically musclebound bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger is appropriately cast as a hardboiled Soviet cop Captain Ivan Danko who is dispatched by his Moscow superiors to retrieve a Russian citizen who has been arrested for running a red light in Chicago Illinois. The irony is the wicked Viktor Rostavili has struck a deal to purchase five million dollars in heroin and smuggle the narcotics back to Mother Russia. This part of the screenplay by Hill along with Bullitt scribe Harry Kleiner and Kelly's Heroes scripter Troy Martin Kennedy relies on the standardissue plot about one cop being sent to a faraway place to retrieve a prisoner and escort the felon back to his jurisdiction. Don Siegel's Coogan's Bluff put Clint Eastwood in a similar situation while the John Wayne thriller Brannigan put the Duke in an extradition fueled plot.Eventually our 'fishoutofwater' hero Captain Danko Arnold Schwarzenegger 0f The Terminator teams up with a tenacious but troubleprone Windy City cop Detective Sergeant Art Ridzik James Belushi who yearns for payback. Not only did Danko lose a partner back in Soviet Union during his pursuit of Vicktor but also Ridzik loses his own partner Detective Sergeant Gallagher Richard Bright of The Getaway as Danko is poised to board the plane with Rostavili. Out of nowhere a group of bald AfricanAmericans know as 'clean heads' disguised as armored car guards surprise Danko beat him into submission and release Vicktor. They murder Gallagher during this sudden blitz encounter. Meantime Danko discovers a key that Rostavili had to a bus station locker. Danko musters his strength after the ambush to drag himself across the floor and seize the key. Like a similar key in The Driver Vicktor's key opens a bus station locker that contains his loot. Diagnosed with a concussion Danko doesn't let his cracked skull or two obnoxious Soviet diplomats spook him about his loss of Rostavili. Of course Danko shouldn't have been packing iron but he brought along a piece anyway and got it through customs in the diplomatic immunity bag. Ridnzik and he set out to find the evil Rostavili and they talk to a woman Cat Manzetti Gina Gershon of Showgirls who married Victor for 10 thousand. Manzetti has a bad habit of turning up at the wrong time in their investigation. She is in the Chicago Hospital where one of Vicktor's gunsels is being treated for serious gunshot wounds inflicted by Ridzik. Vicktor dispatches a man dressed as a nurse to inject a bubble into the wounded man to kill him. Our heroes blast this illfated nurse into the next world and Danko lets Manzetti escape. Danko has to relinquish his automatic but Ridzik loans him a .44 Magnum revolver.Director Walter Hill has fashioned one of the best testosteroneladen guy movies with Red Heat. Neither Danko nor Vicktor is willing to back down from each other. The shootout in the Garvin Hotel when Vicktor sends the 'Cleanhead' gangsters into the wrong room after Danko is bloody. The outrageous finale when Danko and Rostvavili charge each other in passenger buses makes for a spectacular slambang showdown. Danko is the ultimate irrepressible hardboiled cop. Nothing stops Danko from nailing Vicktor and Vicktor is a thoroughgoing dastard. Ed O'Ross makes a memorable villain. Incidentally the initial confrontation between Vicktor and Danko reminded me of Nick Nolte's Texas Ranger in Extreme Prejudice meeting the potgrowing rednecks at the bar. Red Heat lives up to its name.".

Her son's wife wants her out of the house as she is driving her mad. Mam Cora tries to help but unfortunately everything she does she does it wrongly.The family goes through lots of trouble trying to solve what to do with Mam Cora. While all this happens a confusion makes the family believe she dies and that leads to the funniest scenes of the comedy although the whole movie is hilarious.If want to rent a good comedy I strongly recommend you to go for Esperando la Carroza. Not to mention the outstanding performances of actors like China Zorrilla Betiana Blum and Luis Brandoni among others.My score 1010. Excellent movie.".

They talk and talk at dizzying speed I doubt very much that the translation can really catch up with the double entendre of half of the overlapping dialogue for most of the time ALL of them are screaming at the top of their voices and simultaneously.All actors grasp the screwball comedy style of this director Alejandro Doria beautifully. Subtlety is not even remotely connected with this outrageous comedy.Mnica Villa Susana is outstandingly good as the longsuffering housewife always on the verge of an earth shaking nervous breakdown looking like a wet mouse. One wonders if the actress didn't really break down! So authentic is her performance full of passion and vital detail Bette Davies would have killed for this role. Her mother in law Mam Cora Antonio Gasella in drag is driving her nuts with her fullfledge Alzheimer. Gasella does an excellent interpretation of this dizzy old lady loosing all her bearings but I don't get it Why was he chosen to play this role when towards the end appears a real old lady A friend of Mam Cora that comes to the house that could have been THE perfect Mam Cora I think that Gasella must have been a popular comic at the time and maybe he made that character popular I guess.Betiana Blum Nora excellent In very broad and obvious acting terms as the flashy nouveauriche wife of one of the three brothers in the story and the only pretty female in the cast.China Zorrilla a very well known and loved actress in Argentina that even now 22 years later is still going strong and is very convincing within the limits of her overheated and theatrical school of acting.Daro Grandinetti I failed to notice him in this old movie maybe because he was too young then.All performances are uniformly good. The director conventional but very efficient since with his ear for tempo keeps everything firmly under control and makes it fun to watch although it is blatant and flashy in a very heavyhanded way.Only to be seen when you long for a Marx Brothers film but don't have one handy.".

	schema:headline " One of Schumachers better ones";
	schema:reviewBody "I recall seeing this movie three times first in the early 90s then 00s and now I just saw it again and each time I've grown more fond of it. There is something in Schumachers style that drags me into it. The story is OK nothing really remarkable. It's one part ghost story one part medical thriller one part love triangle.What really makes this movie worthwhile is Schumachers direction. He's got a very good eye for this Gothic style. One might wonder why the school was so poorly lit or what exactly was the place they did their experiments at but it's all for the mood it's all style. Sometimes style does go over substance but in this case they work hand in hand. The Gothic architecture and gloomy late autumnal Chicago are just what this movie needed. Just like The Lost Boys IS small town sunny California. Schumacher should've stuck to this style which clearly is his forte but sadly he has since had a very varying career with only occasional hits.The cast is great all of the stars have gone a long way since. Makes one only wonder what could've become of William Baldwin had he made better career moves. He is very good in this movie. I've always liked Kiefer Sutherland as a movie actor and he does a remarkable job here too. I really would've rather seen him as a full time movie actor rather than going for TV.There is only one thing that bothers me in this movie and it's the story in all it's simplicity. If people have had near death experiences before and have come back to tell what new did this crew try to achieve? If not only have personal experience of death but I got the idea most of them were in it for the science. Why risk brain damage and gamble with life for something you will not get any proof anyway. Especially given that they are medical students the story is not 100  believable but like I stated earlier watch this movie more for the mood. I'm glad it's already been so long since the 90s so one can start appreciate the movies of this decade again without getting caught on the hairdos and such.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been intending to write a review of this film for some time but only now have I actually managed to get my thoughts down for the perusal of others.I never had the pleasure of seeing this film on the big screen' which is a shame as it is often visually stunning but I have revisited it on video numerous times over the years enjoying it immensely every time.  It definitely is on my personal list of favorite movies and for more than just starring Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon two of my actors to watch.'Perhaps I appreciate this film so much because it appeals to my slightly offkilter taste in entertainment.  I like my movies a bit left of center  unpredictable and fresh.  And whether or not you believe' the story line of the film you have to admit it is different!Everyone has different tastes and opinions but my impression of some of the negative reviews of this movie is that the viewers never really saw past the surface level of this film.  They got caught up in technicalities Why would there be green lighting in a subway?' or Why would medical students pull such a stupid stunt?' and failed to see the artistry and psychological depth of the piece.Yes there are some medical and technical aspects that do not make logical sense but if you are willing to suspend disbelief just a tad this can be a very engaging film.First a note about the artistic quality of the movie.  Some have complained about the murky lighting and the illogical nature of the sets  but for me the use of innovating lighting techniques the plastic and sheet draped sets the unusual settings in old buildings and dank dripping tunnels the use of statuary rain and billowing curtains  all add a poetic flavor to this film a haunting beauty that suits the dark nature of the questions being asked about life death and forgiveness.I will focus on just two examples in an alley scene a change in lighting allows for certain elements of the set to come dramatically into focus then to fade away once lighting returns to normal.  It is an innovative means of conveying a shift in the reality' of the moment and works beautifully. We are also allowed to see the interior of the character's apartments  contrast the warm wood bright colors golden lighting and cluttered comfort of Labraccio's rooms with the stark white void of Nelson's.  Both are reflective of the characters themselves.  Nelson's lack of objects' reflect our lack of knowledge about his past. and his carefully constructed mask that keeps his companions at a distance.  His past we come to learn is one of chaos and conflict.  He has determined to leave that behind in favor of an uncluttered emptiness. unfortunately the emptiness is also reflective of his relationships with others a realization he comes to along his personal journey of selfdiscovery in this film.Flatliners is not your typical horror film.  Nor is a typical drama or suspense movie.it is rather more of an amalgamation of all having the best elements of all genres intertwined in a complex suspenseful plot.This is an ensemble piece and the cast does an excellent job of breathing life into their individual characters.  Your immediate impression is that the characters are each representative of a wellestablished stereotype' The female ice queen the slightly neurotic 'physician' the playboy and the socially conscious nice guy' etc.  However as the film progresses and the characters are further fleshed out they take on multiple dimensions and depth.Most interesting of all is Sutherland's character of Nelson.  Nelson is not a character that is easy to like  indeed he is a bit of a btard a master manipulator who definitely places selfinterest above all else.  Yet Sutherland plays him with a hint of insecurity that lends him a certain appeal.  As events unfold you come to realize that much of Nelson's unpleasant personality is a smokescreen a protective mask behind which hides a very uncertain and vulnerable young man burdened by a terrible secret.By revealing bits and pieces of Nelson's complex personality throughout the film the writers directors and cast gradually lead you towards a greater understanding of and sympathy for him.  The character who started out as a jerk' becomes important and valued in his own right  as you learn to forgive' his previous behavior in light of new information.  Your journey of discovery with Nelson reflects the characters own journeys towards selfunderstanding as they too come to realize that everyone has value and everything we do matters.'Which leads to my final comment.  Although many of the posters here have picked up upon the theme of defying death.. few seem to have touched upon what I see as the main premise of the movie  the importance of forgiveness and the need to be cognizant of all you do because it does matter.'".

	schema:headline " A vaguely original horror idea";
	schema:reviewBody "The basic premise of Flatliners is fairly simple. Several medical students put themselves at the point of death in order to find out exactly what the brain does during the fact. It sounds like something a mob of bored students would do for a joke but it forms the basis of some very creepy substories. In today's world where Hollywood has to mine foreign markets for the ideas to make a horror film Flatliners is one of those rare gems that show Hollywood can make something different when it tries hard enough.What separates Flatliners from a lot of films based on this premise that would come out today is that it does not stoop to being condescending or arrogant. Flatliners recognises that people go to films to be entertained not moralised to. In this kind of supernatural thriller the difference this restraint makes is really incredible. What's even more incredible is that Julia Roberts appears without being annoying or demonstrating that she can only play Julia Roberts. The theory of obscurity that performing artists do their best work with the smallest audience is in force here.The subplots concerning what the characters find during their loss of pretty much everything that makes them alive and how it comes back to intrude on their present time are done surprisingly well. The moments when William Baldwin's character finds his personal videotape collection coming back to haunt him are especially intriguing. That William Baldwin seems so perfectly cast in the role says a lot either about the script or the direction. I am not sure which.Kiefer Sutherland on the other hand really shines as the lead. One really feels for him as the mystery of what past experience is intruding on the present and why unfolds. As Kevin Bacon's character goes to find an old school pier whose life he made hell and tell her how sorry he is it becomes clearer what the film is about. We can try to change the past as much as we like but it's what we do with the present that matters most.Another good aspect of Flatliners is how it achieves an atmosphere without the use of expensive elaborate visual effects. Quite unusually for what is essentially a horror film Flatliners did not expend its budget in places where it did not need to. Much of what we see during the more surreal sequences is a case of professional pretending simple trick photography or stock footage. Sometimes the simplest things are the best.If there is a problem with the film it's that it feels about ten minutes too short. The ending seems more perfunctory than conclusive as if someone in the studio asked the director to wrap the film up so they can bring it out at a certain market time. Of course many films have been left with sore spots for this very reason so Flatliners shouldn't really need to be any different. The hundred and fifteen minutes we do get is highly satisfactory though not overly brilliant.I gave Flatliners a seven out of ten. It works well as a date flick or a kind of latenight popcorn film. That aside it makes a good reminder that lowbudget horror shows weren't always sad pieces of garbage.".

Kiefer Sutherland shines in his egotistical medstudent role.The cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain which is what I love about Schumacher his use of light and location create images that stick. A disturbing nightmarish atmosphere is created which unsettles you while you watch the film and haunts you when you go to bed  reminded me of The Lost Boys.This is a film that takes an awesome premise  curious students want to find out what's after death and successfully follows it through into a scary gripping tale of redemption.

	schema:reviewBody "Countless TV displays and the memorable appearances from 4 of today's megastarsplus Hope Davis's screen debut keep Flatliners still in prudence. The plot is about a nonacademic research of five medicine undergrads pursuing one's crazy idea on discovering the secret of death and learn what's after death then come back to life again. Yet the storyline hasn't been designed as fascinating as the idea of the plot.There are popular stereotypes to develop a regular teenslasher script in Flatliners. There is Nelson who creates the idea of decoding death pretty but introverted Rachel David who cuts the Gordian knot on luckily not to be dismissed from the school ladies' man Joe and finally the smart guy RandyI did not come to medical school to murder my class mates no matter how deranged they might be. They join hands altogether in an experiment where Nelson's heart will be stopped and rerythmed. Then they decide to continue this experiment in strict confidence at night times in the campus. Not long after Nelson's experience everyone starts a race over having the wildest and the longest death experience risking their lives one by one. Yet soon they realize their daily life becomes affected from those experiences they had. The visits to the afterlife brings back their delinquent feelings from their childhood memories. Depolarizing their deep subconscious watchfulness they begin having somatic delusions and visual hallucinations.When the point comes where the explanation of subconscious director Joel Schumacher skips that every humankind has a subconscious personality which they are not aware of. This inner personality keeps one from altering into identity loss. If you lose or if you depolarize this subconscious personality you certainly lose your identity instead of refreshing childhood memories. I wanted to add this as a movie mistake which already has been mentioned via movie critics in the earlier 90s'. Obviously here in this movie Schumacher made the actors have it least affected. Then why do they hesitate continuing on the experiment after learning their lesson as if death is designed indiscoverable by God? David had been introduced as an Atheist now he turned out to believe in God when he recalled a flashback from his childhood. After witnessing this 180 degreed change in David it's clear to see that Schumacher's film was so conservative and lilylivered that's ultimately why it's never classified as a work of science fiction. Alas! It had a good potential. It even tried to tell the unconscious maturation from having a death experience beginning to believe that death is so simply natural and it's only a part of a human's life.More than what's in the movie it was also memorable to recall what's with the movie. Jan de Bont as the cinematographer who had worked almost every time with Schumacher creates an dreamy atmosphere like it's being an Gothic horror movie. The blue color schemes all over the walls reflecting into the actors' faces deliver first class of lighting that suits perfectly with the film. The closeup shots of the gargoyle statues in the campus buildings Catholic frescoes in the walls stopmotion cameras and the dynamic camera speeds were all belong to Bont's skills.Flatliners became a cult movie in time with its sociological penportrait of the Xgeneration juvenile especially via its futuristic editing style with storyboard connection sequences like being part of a video music clip so much aesthetically. Those were the times where fastpaced and multisequenced video music clips were on rise. This style was very rare to come across in those years after its pioneer Tony Scott's The Hunger1983.".

As a young medical school student his research into life after death draws his friends into dangerous situations and a great finale. The medical school did seem a little substandard though I will admit. Kevin Bacon is great in Flatliners as is one of my favorite sarcastic actors Oliver Platt. William Baldwin's also a cutie and did okay and though I'm not a Julia Roberts fan so did she. The plot will draw you in and keep you on the edge of your seat and there's an interesting dark atmosphere pervaded by a lot of red and blue for emotional impact. A good movie.. I'd give it at least an 8 out of 10".

Four fellow students join in the plan taking turns with their explorations competing with one another to see who can stay under the longest. What will the consequences of this dangerous game be? Without a doubt the premise of Flatliners is intriguing. I can't speak for the medical veracity of the ideaI'm sure it's ridiculousbut it doesn't need to be realistic to provide fodder for a good film. Unfortunately this isn't a good film. It's not quite failure but it's damn close. It's as if somewhere along the line the film was brought back from the dead but with severe brain damage.One of the primary problems that director Joel Schumacher does not overcome is that these actors just do not seem like medical students and the setting just doesn't seem like a medical school. In addition to Sutherland the other students are Julia Roberts Kevin Bacon William Baldwin and Oliver Platt. With the exception of Platt the other four seem more like models who got lost on their way back from a Vogue shoot. Platt seems like an overacting fussbudget who got lost on his way to a Steven Spielberg set. Writer Peter Filardi gives them more modellike dialogue except when they're flatly reciting the medical terms they've memorized.The school for some bizarre reason is an old churchmonastery filled with Gothic statuary and modern construction accoutrements such as scaffolding and those thick transparent plastic sheets they hang in doorways. It does look cool but it's difficult to buy the set as a medical school.That might not usually be a problem for meI love absurdism after all but the plot seems to hinge on the verisimilitude of the characters and their setting. What we're left with are actors going through medical student ritual movements and speech as they work their way through a formulaic series of events. Formulaic because much of the film consists of the same scene over and over our cast of pretty boys and a beautiful girl simply take turns around the chair of honor a bit like they're square dancing. The first time when Nelson goes under it may be pretty exciting but by the fifth time it's just more ritualthere is little suspense.The genre listing claims that Flatliners is a combination of horror thriller and scifi. None of those seem to fit the film very well although superficially it makes some sense. But the scenarios are really just drama heavily imbued with symbolism and metaphor. The fantasy elements are intriguing enough at that but the gist of the film consists of characters having to adjust their karmic balances. They're trying to right various wrongs or at least perceived wrongs towards persons from their pasts. It's fairly overt there isn't much subtext here. The karmic imbalance material is the best of the film but in a case of life reflecting art Schumacher has a karmic imbalance himselfthere is far too much empty ritual in the film and not enough meaty material.".

Given that I have to say the film has merit but it is certainly not the merit of a sound plot.The acting however is superb and every cast member should be applauded for their ability to rise to the occasion in this somewhat palatable horror film.Kiefer's ability to maintain his character's persona is exceptional breaking at just the right moment in the film.Julia Roberts certainly gives us a performance rivaling her work in previous films as well as adding an interesting perspective to the idea of guilt and redemption.Kevin Bacon is the glue than binds this band together with his ability to maintain the focus of the five on the problems they are facing.Oliver Platt provides an interesting sort of comic relief and William Baldwin brings his boyish demeanor into play with his particular sin although you have to wonder how that character ever got into medical school.The sets really give us the horror feeling and you have to give Joel Schumacher his props for his camera angles and framing of the these spooky rooms and buildings.Rated R for violence sexual references and scenes and language definitely not one for the younger set.

The casting on this film was excellent and all the actors play a important part in the film. Since watching this movie I have found myself wondering if there is anyone out there that would like to take part in such a experiment and if there is any doctors that would take part as well. Such a great film which makes you think about allot of things. I would love to find out whats after death. Sounds strange but I would love to become a flatliner.".

I left this film feeling it had no real substance or potential and just a couple of scarey cheap thrills which weren't very well done at all.

Joel Schumaker is one of those directors I hold largely responsible for the cultural dumbening to borrow a 'word' from Lisa Simpson of the US. His films so perfectly embody the very attributes that make stereotypic 'American Movies' the symbolism is heavyhanded the actors are weak the effects are big and the technology is misunderstood but overused! This man should have been stopped long ago but I understand that people want to see this kind of popcorn chow garbage. Garbage like that has given freakofnature Julia Roberts her entire career which now seems thankfully pretty well over. This woman overacts every line she's been given chewing up the scenery with that gaping maw of hers and overemoting every scene. This film joins these two paragons of modern cinema for a bland and nearly unbearable journey to the other side. Only Joel Schumacher could've taken such a large and all things being relative promising young cast and made it into a subBmovie schlockfest like this. Don't get me wrong I REALLY don't like Oliver Platt can barely stand looking at SonofSkeletor Kevin Bacon and think Keifer Sutherland has been typecast to DEATH. That said I still think a film like this shouldn't happen to a cast like this. I mean I just don't like these guys but I'm not saying they don't have their place Kevin Bacon's supposed to be great in 'The Woodsman' and Keifer may be typecast but he does make a fun villain. A movie like this shouldn't happen to a DOG! The strange thing about 'Flatliners' is that it's not a bad idea it just goes SO horribly wrong. The writer clearly had a very slim grasp of religious belief and the lack thereof and an even slimmer one of medical technology EEG ECG who cares?. And of course Schumacher's not happy unless you KNOW he's there! Movies can be overdirected Joel. Back off once in a while. The only reason to see this movie is for nostalgia it is SO dated looking and from a time Schumacher must've been a fan of Michael Mann or for a loved one. In my case it was for a loved one's nostalgia my wife had fond memories of this movie from her teen years but by the end even she was irritated by this pile of dung. I rated this movie at a 2 though because at least it's not 'Manos The Hands of Fate.'".

While there are exceptions to this rule it's hard to justify owning a DVD of Krull regardless of how many insightful the director's commentary may be. But stay sharp Gen XY'ers because the dozens of disappointments dominating your trip down memory lane might stop you from stumbling across one worth revisiting.One surprise film worth another look is Joel Schumacher's Flatliners the supernatural thriller starring 80's popcorn heavyweights Keifer Sutherland Kevin Bacon Julia Roberts and Billy Baldwin. You would think that a stew comprised of this cast the flamboyant flair of Schumacher and the ber slick eye of cinematographer Jan De Bont would result in something sickeningly stodgy but calories aside... Flatliners ain't half bad. Even though it's production design is inexplicably overthetop and the photography is achingly over stylized replete with neon soaked streets spewing endless billows of steam Flatliners still manages to be an effectively dark and compelling thriller. If there's an explanation why Flatliners was forgotten it might be because 1990 saw the release of another far superior supernatural thriller Jacob's Ladder.Had Flatliners been released a year or two after Jacob's Ladder it's likely Schumacher's flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a toned down commercialized ripoff of Adrian Lyne's nightmarish masterpiece. But with these films being released in the same year Flatliners enjoyed a different fate tripling JL's take at the box office despite being a watered down version of a similar premise. The passage of time hasn't been as kind to Flatliners it has been lost atop a dated heap of throwaway 80's Brat Pack dreck while JL has cemented its reputation as a timeless classic. Fates aside JL is seamlessly terrifying and it manages to keep audiences guessing right up until the last frame whereas Flatliners falls victim to over simplification and Hollywood conveniences that drag down the final act into a predictably tidy denouement. Comparisons between the two movies is unfair and ultimately overlooks Flatliners ability to represent the 80's at its quintessential best. Released at the end of a decade of shallow excess Flatliners will always be dated by its hairstyles and clothing styles but in fairness it should also be remembered as a well executed movie at or at least near the top of its particular heap of dreck. For intents and purposes it's an entertaining walk down memory lane.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only thing more full of holes than this movie's premise is its script. Flatliners is the ideal showcase for Joel Schumacher's glorious flamboyant brazen lack of talent. The plot is totally illogical but super fakeponderous and everything is artdirected within an inch of its life in the most clichd overheated way. I love how the med school autopsy room is a cavernous vaulted marble mausoleum lowlit in red with huge Rembrandt paintings hanging from the walls. I love how Keifer Sutherland drives a canvasbacked army jeep. No one in Joel Schumacher's movies lives in an uneccentric manner. It's always an alternate universe where everyone is young and painfully hip but hip strictly and obsessively according to an outoftouch middleaged billionaire manchild's idea of hip. And holy crap! The part where Baldwin brother 16 dies and comes back to life and then is haunted by all the women he's slept with who intone I'll call you and I just need some space is the funniest friggin' thing in the whole universe!!!! What kind of a world do we live in where Joel Schumacher gets to keep having people throw money at him? Flatliners made me want to review the man's entire oeuvre solely for the kind of highquality yuks contained therein.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must start out with an apology usually I'm a sucker for all movies and on those rare occasions I don't like something I usually won't say anything about it. But this movie warrants an exception.A group of Yuppie medical students who've lived unbelievably bland lives fall all over themselves to take turns killing each other and getting resuscitated just so they can study death and presumably write a peer reviewed article about it which will naturally win them the Nobel Peace Prize for stupidity. The problem they have all committed Politically Correct sins and their PC demons return with them and force them to experience hell on earth.The greatest sin Kevin Bacon's character has ever committed is that when he was a boy he...teased a black girl melodramatic gasp!. This is absolute worst thing he ever did in his life  he never hurt an adorable looking animal a PC felony stole anything cheated on a test played doctor as a child with neighborhood girls or hurt anyone in any manner. For this sin he has hypnagogic hallucinations of her teasing him until he redeems himself by tracking her down she's now a woman and apologizes.The attitude of women is particularly patronizing women are portrayed as childlike innocents who are incapable of sinning or complex thought. The absolute worst thing the Julia Roberts character ever did in her entire life is open a door she wasn't supposed to when she was very young which naturally caused her father to kill himself because she was about to see him shooting heroin. William Baldwin's character is almost looked upon as a pedophile and he's tormented not because he's a serial fornicator but because he lies to get into the pants of gullible women who were evidently too stupid to consent to the sexual act. Also he videotapes every performance for his own personal use and the women are so enraptured with the experience they don't notice him mugging for the camera they could have made it more interesting by having him review the tapes with some likeminded pervert friends I guess it was too early to post to the internet. Given the mindset of the writer the age of consent for women should jump from 18 to 90.Keifer Southerland's character is the only one with a moderately interesting past as a child he bullied a kid who climbed a tree then after throwing a few rocks that kid manages to die instantly after falling less than 10 feet. The kid's dispossessed spirit stalks and attacks him throughout the movie providing some intense scenes that were a welcome relief in this otherwise tedious movie. When the kid attacks him in his hypnoidal state he has physical manifestations of the violence when he wakes up.The PC goddess Hillary Clinton? doesn't allow for moral diminished capacity punishing adults as if they should have known better when they were children. Hospital patients are for some reason stuffed into a museum and when they die due to the substandard care they're presumably cut up by the medical students. This film could have used some zombies that inadvertently escaped from hell by following them back through the portal from the afterlife.I'm giving this a very generous 210".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sessions is a sensitive and poignant film with an outstanding performance by John Hawkes as poet Mark O'Brien a childhood victim of polio that left him paralyzed from the neck down and dependent on personal attendants and an iron lung that enables him to survive the nights without suffocating. In voice and facial expression he manages to perfectly capture the life of a severely disabled man who likes to push against boundaries and retains a sense of humorhe tells someone that he believes in God because he needs to blame someone. This role is quite a departure for Hawkes who gave terrific performances in films like Winter's Bone and Martha Marcy May Marlene where he was Jennifer Lawrence's loner brother and a deranged cult leader haunting Elizabeth Olsen. Helen Hunt is memorable as the sex surrogate to whom O'Brien turns to help him achieve his dream of sexual intimacy with a woman. A professional as well as a wife and mother she doesn't hesitate to take exception with the notion that she is some kind of prostitute and clearly she isn't. William H Macy is the local parish priest whom O'Brien a devout Catholic relies on for advice and encouragement. There's plenty of wry humor watching Macy trying to figure it all out as he knows he's in uncharted waters. Based on a magazine essay directorwriter Ben Lewin handles this unusual subject matter with great sensitivity and intelligence. This isn't some Hallmark TV movie it's a mature honest film that isn't going to insult your intelligence. Definitely worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sessions 2012  out of 4 Terrific adult drama about Mark O'Brien John Hawkes a man who has been living in an iron lung since the age of six due to polio. At the age of 38 he confides to his priest William H. Macy that he wants to know the touch of a woman so he hires a sex surrogate Helen Hunt. With a story like this there are just so many ways that it could have failed but writerdirector Ben Lewin does a terrific job as do to the leads and in the end THE SESSIONS really turns into a touching movie. I really wasn't sure what to expect going in but this actually turned out to be a terrific character study through a group of sex sessions which at first seemed like a farfetched idea until you learn that it's actually based on a real guy and on the article he wrote. What makes the film work so well is that both characters are fully formed and it's especially important when it comes to O'Brien since we're going on this journey with his as he tries to deal with his disease and the physical limitations he has. The performance from Hawkes is so remarkable because he has to act pretty much just using his head. Since the majority of the film has him in the lung or under the covers we mainly just see his face and hear his voice and the way Hawkes builds this character and his emotions is just something truly incredible to watch. It also helps that Hunt is so great in her role as she's pretty much playing the guy's teacher lover and friend. The compassion she brings to the role is certainly something special and the chemistry between the two hits on all the right marks. Macy is also excellent as the priest bringing in some needed humor. Moon Bloodgood Adam Arkin and Annika Marks are also great in their supporting parts. THE SESSIONS boils down to being a story about something with physical limitations and I'd say it's one of the better films to come from this subgenre. The movie is funny but it's also incredibly touching as these two people slowly come together over a group of sessions. This is certainly a movie for adults as there's no trickery in the story but instead it just plays out in a mature fashion.".

As the film progressed I became increasingly intrigued by how it might end but it never loses interest and the combination of a tight script good acting and very sensitive direction keeps the tension right to the end. Although a low budget production it never feels like it and is vastly more satisfying than the big name runofthemill rubbish Hollywood churns out far too often.

Slowly but surely these encounters or sessions between her and Mark produce results of feeling relaxation mind changing and comfort all before they finally approach the pleasure point! Along the way this picture is told with honesty and much of the scenes are humor mixed with blunt and brash serious feel of a man being set free toward a new feeling of pleasure freedom finally! Overall the Sessions is a film of journey and it shows how the discovery of sexual pleasure can bring out emotional freedom that's touching and memorable even though the scenes are brash with skin and memorable and educational with thought.

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. In 1997 director Jessica Yu won an Academy Award for her documentary short entitled Breathing Lessons The Life and Work of Mark O'Brien. Mr. O'Brien was a poet and journalist who attended Cal Berkeley. His story reaches the level of remarkability once you understand that he suffered the harsh effects of polio was almost entirely paralyzed and was confined to an iron lung for all but 34 hours per day. Director Ben Lewin a Polio survivor has taken a specific part of O'Brien's story and turned it into a very entertaining and intimate film that explores the challenges faced by the disabled in leading a full and sexual life.In 1990 O'Brien had an article published On Seeking a Sex Surrogate. It detailed his desire to overcome the obstacles and experience a sexual relationship. He did so by working with Cheryl Cohen Greene a Berkeley based sex surrogate ... also a wife and mother of two. This is the very touching story of how Cheryl played here by Helen Hunt worked with O'Brien played by John Hawkes to overcome his fear and anxiety. These sessions occurred after O'Brien cleared his plan with his Catholic priest William H Macy.This story is as frank and honest as you might expect and it avoids sinking into Hollywood sentimentality for the sake of the story. The truth is plenty powerful. O'Brien's caregivers are played progressively by Rusty Schwimmer Annika Marla and Moon Bloodgood. Cheryl's husband is played by Alan Arkin and Robin Weigert plays Susan the woman with whom O'Brien had a loving relationship with until his death in 1999.There are some similarities to the wonderful film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly but this story and these characters are much more accessible to the viewer. These are people with whom we care about and connect. It's a vivid reminder that living a full life regardless of one's constraints should always be the goal. Incidentally Cheryl still works as a surrogate these days ... at age 68.".

His story reaches the level of remarkability once you understand that he suffered the harsh effects of polio was almost entirely paralyzed and was confined to an iron lung for all but 34 hours per day. Director Ben Lewin a Polio survivor has taken a specific part of O'Brien's story and turned it into a very entertaining and intimate film that explores the challenges faced by the disabled in leading a full and sexual life.In 1990 O'Brien had an article published On Seeking a Sex Surrogate. It detailed his desire to overcome the obstacles and experience a sexual relationship. He did so by working with Cheryl Cohen Greene a Berkeley based sex surrogate ... also a wife and mother of two. This is the very touching story of how Cheryl played here by Helen Hunt worked with O'Brien played by John Hawkes to overcome his fear and anxiety. These sessions occurred after O'Brien cleared his plan with his Catholic priest William H Macy.This story is as frank and honest as you might expect and it avoids sinking into Hollywood sentimentality for the sake of the story. The truth is plenty powerful. O'Brien's caregivers are played progressively by Rusty Schwimmer Annika Marla and Moon Bloodgood. Cheryl's husband is played by Alan Arkin and Robin Weigert plays Susan the woman with whom O'Brien had a loving relationship with until his death in 1999.There are some similarities to the wonderful film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly but this story and these characters are much more accessible to the viewer. These are people with whom we care about and connect. It's a vivid reminder that living a full life regardless of one's constraints should always be the goal. Incidentally Cheryl still works as a surrogate these days ... at age 68.";

With just his facial expressions and dialogues Hawkes charms you throughout the movie. Helen Hunt is flawless as always and pretty comfortably gets into the shoes of a sex surrogate. William H.

His intention to lose his virginity through a sex surrogate leads him to experience love both physically and emotionally. Mark O'Brien's story proves that physicality doesn't play such a big role when it comes to affecting and attracting people in the long run intellect and charm are greater factors. He affects and attracts the lives of three beautiful women. The nudity and sex in the movie is not vulgar or erotic it's more on the emotional and intimate side.Some of the memorable dialogues from the movie include 1 I understand that even among nonbelievers the most common expression of sexual ecstasy is 'oh God'. 2 Vera Today they're working on simultaneous orgasm.  Clerk What's that?As Betsy Sharkey from Los Angeles Times aptly says In a country that embraces cinematic violence with such ease but blushingly prefers to keep sex in the shadows or under the sheets the grownup approach of 'The Sessions' is rare.".

People who have handicapped people in their families feel the subject as a delicate issue so this movie's impression may be a little different depending on the spectator's personal experiences. It's admirable to see how courageous Helen Hunt was to play such controversial character specially because she does some nude scenes in a nontraditional kind of relationship. Some scenes are unintentionally funny such as when the priest has to listen to Mark's confessions involving sex due to the fact that we all imagine fathers as very conservative people. In my opinion The Sessions is a film that followed a different way of 2004's Mar adentro which turned out to be slightly better. However some elements of the plot felt a little implausible to me and it ended with some lack of strong moments which are expected in a drama movie. Recommended movie anyways even it not flawless.".

The line is delivered by John Hawkes who plays O'Brien with both the sense of humour and the sensitivity which typifies the handling of the subject matter in 'The Sessions'.Ben Lewin whose work has been primarily in TV and documentaries brings John Hawkes together with Helen Hunt in a screen partnership that has to be one of the most intimate and trusting I have seen between two actors for some time. Hunt was up for an Oscar for her portrayal of professional sex surrogate Cheryl who takes on the task of helping Mark achieve his goal. Their encounters are beautifully played with the balance of awkwardness fear and joy well judged enough that you truly feel in the room. The scenes seem raw and real and the result of the writing is one of a film which does not snigger nor encourage sniggering at the idea of sex on screen there is a directness and explicitness about the issue which to my pleasant surprise actually manages to underscore the importance of the emotional resonance of sex and its importance in our life. It would be easy to imagine this simply becomes a dirty joke. To the contrary the sex is not sexy but rather functional the conversations they have and the depiction of Mark's struggle with his journey to manhood becomes touching. There is something in the way sex is explored that brings to mind what D H Lawrence was trying to do with his infamous classic rather than nudge and wink the story looks directly at what sex is and why it matters.Frustatingly the direction seems shy of delving into the personal relationships and history of Cheryl it also seems intent on putting the female form on full show whilst never completely exposing the male at the centre of the story. If this was an artistic choice I wonder what the aim was one would assume in fact that as the story moves forward both character would become more exposed. The film also struggles to bring a key character to life Father Brendan played by the ever reliable William H. Macy never seems complete. It is hard to pin down why because Macy does not do anything wrong but there is something in the scenes featuring Mark and the priest which despite some deftly delivered humour feel tough to buy.The heart of the film is that central relationship though. Limited to six sessions for obvious reasons we watch an unusual touching bond grow and despite the hurried nature of the story arc it makes 'The Sessions' worth your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a somber topic a 30something man confined mostly to an iron lung from having had polio back in the 1950s. That struck a chord with me as I remember attending a high school graduation in the 1950s in my small hometown where one of the students was in an iron lung from his own bout with polio. But this one is a bit different in this true story the man's mind was sharp as well as his sense of humor and a graduate of U Cal at Berkeley. He wrote poetry he learned to use his mouth and a stick to punch typewriter keys or work a push button telephone. John Hawkes has the role of the crippled man Mark  who was a hopeless romantic and seemed to fall in love with every woman that came into his life. He also wanted to experience a few things that had eluded him so far the touch of a naked woman and actual sexual intercourse. He was NOT paralyzed as he explained his muscles just didn't work so the only thing he could move was his head. Plus his erections were apparently pretty healthy!Mark happens to find out about Helen Hunt as Cheryl  who calls herself a sex surrogate. As she explains a prostitute wants your repeat business but a sex surrogate wants to see you for a maximum of six sessions. Thus the title The Sessions. From some comments in the DVD extras this seems to be a product of 1950s and 1960s and beyond sex therapists Masters and Johnson.Part of the humor in the movie is created when Mark goes to visit the new parish Priest William H. Macy as Father Brendan . Mark is a devout Catholic and worries that he might be embarking on something sinful and seeks Fr Brendan's counsel. As Mark's sex therapy advances there are some interesting and humorous discussions between the two inside the church building with the altar in the background.Helen Hunt I suppose should be considered brave to do this role because it involves more than one scene of full frontal nudity. But it isn't erotic nudity she is very convincing as a therapist. Plus she seems to be in fine form at almost 50.I also enjoyed the role Moon Bloodgood played as one of Mark's caregivers Vera. She also is very convincing and is made to wear round frame glasses in her role as a Chinese. In real life her mother is Korean and her father is IrishDutch and she is a real knock out.Overall a very interesting movie.".

I really like the earlier dialog line I am a true believer. I believe in a God with a sense of humor a wicked sense of humor who created me in His odd image. The fact that dramatization of this movie include William H. Macy's priest character just makes all the utterly hyperbolic and paradoxical nature of this movie the more weird. Yet it kind of succeeded in keeping my curiosity about it and to keep on watching. Not being a mere predictable in my opinion this movie was able to do emotion play so well that it was able to steer from a pity inducing movie at the first minutes into one with a glimmer of hope even though it's in a sense a wrong one. Helen Hunt goes all out to totality with this one in her older years of her career while John Hawkes only acted out an average performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Simply put this film disregards almost every aspect of storymaking. It feels like the writer and the director are complicit in their dastardly plot to sell a movie that functions under the guise of moral relativity and shocking content but does little to actually challenge the audience. The main thing is that there is pitiable protagonist and he hires a sex surrogate no judgment but she's really just a prostitute but you're supposed to question your policies on prostitution in order to appreciate his emotional need for affection. This is very valid but the movie does very little to hit you in the stomach with that idea. I mean it really could have hurt if they tried harder.There needs to be another character the bigshot Hollywood producer who says THIS is how you make a movie! It's a shoddy job of adapting a person's life to the silver screen and although it pretends to pull no punches fullfrontal nudity it pulls all the punches. There's no serious drama It's a comedic attempt at a tragedy. Notable in it though are John Hawkes' and Helen Hunt's performances which are the most compelling bits of emotional realism. In other scenes Hawkes is usually being sarcastic and making jokes but with a sense of humor that relies on him being seriously disabled so to say the humor isn't great but the content the fact that his life sucks makes it amenable because you're glad he's upbeat. Scenes with William H. Macy are particularly culpable of this pathetic comedy. Everything about the dialogue between the two is as natural as Macy's hairdo. Seriously look at Macy's hair it's so stupid I mean for a goshdarn priest There has never been a priest with a hairdo like that. It may seem like I'm nitpicking here but it's so absurd it angers me and I'm not usually one to notice the cosmetic aspects of movies. Everything about their conversations feels contrived in order to convey Hawkes' rosy demeanor about the whole thing and justify his buying a prostitute.All that said the actual story behind the movie is a compelling reason to see it despite everything the director writer and producer do to counteract its true appeal to human nature. And the acting by Helen Hunt and John Hawkes is moving. This could have been a great movie but it just misses on so many levels.".

To do that he gets the approval from his priest and hires a sex surrogate who will guide him in the ways of love. So far a little unusual maybe but nothing that would make you go why should I watch this?. You should for two reasons the first one is the acting starting with the criminally underrated performance of John Hawkes who gives tremendous emotional depth to his character a man prostrated for the rest of his life who manages to charm everyone around him including the audience. Everyone else involved give very lowkey realistic and heartfelt performances Helen Hunt and William H. Macy especially but also the rest of the supporting cast. The acting is so good that at one point I forgot I was watching a movie and felt like I was listening to real people going through their experiences.The second reason is the story itself. I did some research on line about the life of the real Marc O'Brien and the film is pretty accurate and consistent with the facts Marc's life is nothing short of extraordinary especially if you consider that the film is based on an article of his that he had to type with a pen in his mouth. The people he met the relationships he formed and how he formed them all that is part of a very uplifting story which truly happened and is not adorned to make it more Hollywoodesque.All of the above elements make for a very satisfying moviegoing experience which I can't recommend highly enough. Everyone I know who's seen the movie has shared my feelings and it's exactly what I'm trying to convey to you go see it and you won't regret it.".

The religiosity also put me off from the movie.I don't find John Hawkes to be charismatic and the camera simply doesn't love him. Regardless of how many takes it took to get a performance out of Marilyn Monroe it didn't ultimately matter because the camera simply loved her. She had it John Hawkes doesn't have it. I found the film predictable and boring. There is full female nudity so why isn't there full male nudity? When she shows him what he looks like in a full length mirror we ought to see his whole body.John Hawkes and Helen Hunt might get Oscar nominations but I would much rather see Judi Dench in the supporting actress category and several actors Ewan McGregor JeanLouis Trintignant just to name two in the lead actor category.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something strange going on in this film.The first time I watched it it seemed to wash over me without affecting me in anyway. Later onand I've read this in other people's comments here as well I found images and dialogue from the movie creeping into my subconscious entire dreams would take place upon the island where Anna goes missingoften in monochrome or I'd start to compare real life events to those that occur during the film. Did Antonioni plant subliminal messages within the movie? Probably not. It's more likely the masterful pace he employs here coupled with the busy deep cinematography is the cause of this. Notice how the backgrounds NEVER go out of focus no matter how much is going on within the frame. Check out the scene about an hour and ten minutes in where Sandro and the old man are talking in the middle of an extremely busy street nothing blurs or goes out of focus even when a tram comes in and out of the shot nothing loses it's perspective and as the scene ends and they walk deep into the shot we can see way past them and far far into the distance.This seems to be why the film has such a deep affect on the subconscious. The characters are deliberately shallow and are placed at the very foreground of every shot yet the backgrounds are rich tableaux bustling with life. In the scenes on the island where Anna disappears we see the main characters always in shot yet in the background there is a feeling that something strange within nature itself is going on. The darkening of the clouds the sudden mist upon the water the rocks falling to the sea even the sudden appearance of the old hermit character all give a certain unease.There's also the haunting feeling of the film as Anna's friends begin almost immediately to forget about her. Soon they don't seem to care a jot about her and neither in a sense do we. It's this feeling of loose ends and guilt on our partfor joining her so called 'friends' in forgetting about her so quickly that leaves the deepest impression. The characters in this film are so morally shallowthe ending bears this out yet they are the reason this film leaves such a strong impression on those who watch it and who become captivated by it.I cant recommend this film to everyone because I know that the Hollywood Blockbuster has reduced most modern cinemagoers attention spans to almost zero. But if you fancy a challenge or merely wish to luxuriate in classic cinema.....begin here.".

Yet they do share a common ground namely humanity's quest for love and understanding and the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that lie in the way. But whereas Bergman's film has moments of true warmth and happiness Antonioni's L'Avventura is as brutally cold as a Scandinavian winter.Plot summary is not entirely important and would spoil potential surprises suffice to say that the movie is uniquely structured and may not proceed the way you expect it to. There is a mystery and romance but not in any traditional sense. The men and women of this film stumble through a loveless desolate Italy occasionally pausing for forced wretched couplings. Alienation and the inability for humans to connect to one another have never been so painfully presented in film.While discussing the guilt felt in betraying a mutual friend a woman asks How can it be that it takes so little to change to forget? to which the man responds It takes even less. Before one of the films many desperate scenes of impersonal copulation the woman cries out in a fit of existential despair I feel as though I don't know you! to which the man responds Aren't you happy? You get to have a new fling. The film is so brutally cynical about friendship love and human interaction that it feels unreal. Strange alien landscapes magnificently filmed among the rocky islands around Italy serve to underline the insurmountably barren distances between the characters. And as they grope and fumble for some kind of connection in the darkness that surrounds them the viewer is pulled into their mire as well.When they are not desperately searching for some kind of connection with each other the characters struggle to come to terms with their own absurd existence. A man knocks over a bottle of ink destroying an art student's inprogress drawing. A woman makes faces in a mirror at herself. Another woman pretends to see a shark in the ocean she is swimming in. None of these distractions are remotely successful.By the time the film has reached its unbelievably cynical ending dependant on one of the most effective uses of a musical score in film history it becomes clear. These people have lost their way.This overwhelming bleakness seems like it would create an unbearable viewing experience but there is a truth to it all as well. Companionship is a basic human need and it can often seem impossibly difficult to form any real connection. However what is important is that it only seems that way it is not impossible. Antonioni has shown us only one possible outcome. By watching a movie filled with people slouching towards oblivion unable to form even the most basic human bond the mind rebels. There must be another way".

	schema:reviewBody "At some point in the film Monica Vitti turns to her love partner and passionately proclaims I want to see clearly!. They're standing atop a convent and saying this accidentally she tugs on a rope. Bells go off around them. A moment later from a church in the distance bells ring back an answer.Wow.And so finally I arrive at the end of my Antonioni quest going backwards in time from The Passenger back at the start. This will not be the last of his films that I see but I feel I've reached a point that enables closure. I'm where it all began in the craving mind where all the formations of life and cinema are born. I will rest from my travel here with the magnitude of this film.But L'Avventura is famously a mystery of disappearance so why do I speak in the title of this review of 'appearances'? Perhaps because in the aftermath of that disappearance Antonioni sketches for us the first appearance of desire. Romance in his later films was already stale or not allowed to blossom it appears again in Zabriskie Point under a different context but here feelings are pursued in an effort to reflect if love can be our saving grace.That appearance born in a barren rock in the middle of the sea rests on a twofold interpretation.On one level perhaps in understanding by Anna's inexplicable disappearance the precarious balance in which hangs our fleeting existence the randomly cruel laws that govern it the two partners turn to each other for solace. And perhaps more seeing deep down in their own selves how quick life can be forgotten how everything we hold to matter ultimately matters little and how this speck of life we value is merely transient and will come to pass they turn to each other to desperately defy it to prove to each other and the world that love cannot simply vanish.Antonioni frames first this realization of transience against the elements of nature the imperishable secondly he frames traps blocks within the desperate relationship mostly faces in silhouette against old medieval buildings man's folly to mimic the imperishable. This is Antonioni's spatial stroke of genius the visual vocabulary which he consistently executed for the rest of his career.But whereas in the subsequent films I was fascinated with the abstraction of human struggle here I'm also fascinated with the struggle itself of human beings fumbling in the dark. The woman cautious of love at first then allowing herself to be swept in it believing if something can make her see clearly that it should be love. The man pushing obsessively for that love then having consummated the need conquered his prey losing interest aimlessly wandering the streets. The sated beast now becomes casually destructive as we're shown in the scene where for no reason he spills ink over a young man's drawing.Antonioni fills this with portents and divinations like the woman's premonition that Anna has returned. More subtle sketch of the madness of desire is the surreal scene where a mob in the grip of sexual paroxysm gathers in the street to ogle at a beautiful woman. Monica Vitti's character later experiences the same oppressiveness of the male gaze yet doesn't feel threatened by it until her man emerges from a building at which point she runs and hides.The finale in this sense is a poignant enigma like few in cinema the smile of a Mona Lisa. The two lovers now bitterly broken by how their desire has failed them stand in a plaza with the view of a mountain in the horizon. The woman lays a hand on the man's head but is the gesture forgiveness or reproach and is she telling him to stay or absolving him to go? Rushing back through his career a chronicle emerges. Here the appearance of desire in the hope that it will liberate later the failure of that desire to liberate the willingness to not pursue it at all in L'Eclisse. Later yet the liberation from desire the realization in Deserto Rosso that we need to make ourselves whole from within the chimera of the mind in Blowup and the liberation from it the chimera of ideas in Zabriskie Point and the liberation from it until the eventual stunning to behold emergence of nirvana in The Passenger. A state of awareness where all bonds to clinging and desire are severed the illusions of ego and identity dissolved the characters now embracing their transience.This is why Antonioni matters to me. Not because Kubricks Polanskis and Peter Weirs all took from him planting seeds in the fertile ground of his cinema and not because he did more for cinema as we know it than all of them together but because his enduring legacy mastery of medium conceptual exploration of ideas all of this cannot fully account for the experience of the spiritual journey they enable. Which is to say that something elusive exists embedded in the frame a true perception that makes his films mysteriously extend into the soul.Antonioni saw further perhaps than any other director before or after.".

And perhaps more seeing deep down in their own selves how quick life can be forgotten how everything we hold to matter ultimately matters little and how this speck of life we value is merely transient and will come to pass they turn to each other to desperately defy it to prove to each other and the world that love cannot simply vanish.Antonioni frames first this realization of transience against the elements of nature the imperishable secondly he frames traps blocks within the desperate relationship mostly faces in silhouette against old medieval buildings man's folly to mimic the imperishable. This is Antonioni's spatial stroke of genius the visual vocabulary which he consistently executed for the rest of his career.But whereas in the subsequent films I was fascinated with the abstraction of human struggle here I'm also fascinated with the struggle itself of human beings fumbling in the dark. The woman cautious of love at first then allowing herself to be swept in it believing if something can make her see clearly that it should be love. The man pushing obsessively for that love then having consummated the need conquered his prey losing interest aimlessly wandering the streets. The sated beast now becomes casually destructive as we're shown in the scene where for no reason he spills ink over a young man's drawing.Antonioni fills this with portents and divinations like the woman's premonition that Anna has returned. More subtle sketch of the madness of desire is the surreal scene where a mob in the grip of sexual paroxysm gathers in the street to ogle at a beautiful woman. Monica Vitti's character later experiences the same oppressiveness of the male gaze yet doesn't feel threatened by it until her man emerges from a building at which point she runs and hides.The finale in this sense is a poignant enigma like few in cinema the smile of a Mona Lisa. The two lovers now bitterly broken by how their desire has failed them stand in a plaza with the view of a mountain in the horizon. The woman lays a hand on the man's head but is the gesture forgiveness or reproach and is she telling him to stay or absolving him to go? Rushing back through his career a chronicle emerges. Here the appearance of desire in the hope that it will liberate later the failure of that desire to liberate the willingness to not pursue it at all in L'Eclisse. Later yet the liberation from desire the realization in Deserto Rosso that we need to make ourselves whole from within the chimera of the mind in Blowup and the liberation from it the chimera of ideas in Zabriskie Point and the liberation from it until the eventual stunning to behold emergence of nirvana in The Passenger. A state of awareness where all bonds to clinging and desire are severed the illusions of ego and identity dissolved the characters now embracing their transience.This is why Antonioni matters to me. Not because Kubricks Polanskis and Peter Weirs all took from him planting seeds in the fertile ground of his cinema and not because he did more for cinema as we know it than all of them together but because his enduring legacy mastery of medium conceptual exploration of ideas all of this cannot fully account for the experience of the spiritual journey they enable. Which is to say that something elusive exists embedded in the frame a true perception that makes his films mysteriously extend into the soul.Antonioni saw further perhaps than any other director before or after.";

However later I discovered that it was one of those films that may not be entirely entertaining when it is watched initially but that comes back full force in the memory at a later time. This is true both for this film and the only other Antonioni film I have seen Blowup. Still tonight was the first time in three years that I have actually sat down to watch L'Avventura and I actually plan to rerent Blowup in the next couple of days and any other Antonioni films I might be able to find.As I have said L'Avventura has been built up by my mind ever since I saw it. Was it as good as I made myself think for the past three years? Yes. I have confirmed my suspicion L'Aventurra is one of the best films ever made.In subject this film is a lot like La Dolce Vita. Its main theme is the decadent lifestyle of the wealthy. The decadent wealthy in L'Avventura are a lot worse off though than those in La Dolce Vita. At least those who were living Fellini's version of the sweet life were having fun. Sure it was soulless fun but while watching the film this thought no matter how much I wanted to suppress it was pounding in my mind Jeeze I wish I could party with these people. Their lifestyle seems just plain fun. They may have to pay for their hedonism in some way but at least they're having fun in the meantime! L'Avventura's sweet life is the definition of l'ennui. Life to them is an unfortunate event. The script to this film as well as anything else about it is absolutely ingenious. To simplify things let us say that the first plot point in the film is Anna's disappearance. This is the initial problem that the characters have to deal with. In a film made under the classical guidelines this would have been the goal that would have to be solved by the end of the film. But as L'Avventura advances the script allows us or maybe even makes us forget about Anna. This process is very gradual and she never completely disappears from our minds especially since Claudia mentions her so explicitly near the end but it begins very quickly after she disappears with the infamous kiss between Sandro and Claudia. There are miles of interpretation and discussion left to go but it is unneccessary to continue here. This is just a beginning.The title to this film is of course ironic. There is no literal adventure. One could make the argument that the adventure is one of the mind but I do not believe this. The adventure I believe is an adventure in reinventing the cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the late 1950s and early 1960s the Italian economy had already started stabilising and moving away from the devastating consequences of WWII. The stabilisation and subsequent economic growth took place through rapid and widespread industrialisation. One can also clearly notice a shift in the sensibilities in the Italian films which were made during these years by acclaimed filmmakers like Antonioni Fellini Ermanno Olmi etc. Their films shifted away from the concerns of neorealist films of the 1940s and early 50s. In this context it is very interesting to note the dissimilarities between a typical Italian neorealist film and a postneorealist film like 'L'Avventura'. While Neorealism dealt with the economic fallout of WWII 'L'Avventura' deals with a sense of disillusionment in the midst of rapid industrialisationthe very first line of dialogue revolves around how the natural woods are being being replaced by houses. While Neorealism focused on the poor working class Italians 'L'Avventura' focuses on the privileged upper class or the bourgeois section of the Italian society.From a technical standpoint it has to be said that 'L'Avventura' is exquisitely shot. The camera movements and numerous tracking shots are executed with a distinct sophistication and methodical precision. There are a lot of complex frame compositions that take place in the interior scenes which scream perfectionism on the part of Antonioni. The overall tone for the film is one of extreme austerity. This austerity and lack of humanity to the film is clearly meant to represent the supposed lack of humanity in the midst of mindless industrialisation and consumerism. I think one thing that the viewer has to assume in order to buy into the film's plot and story elements is that the film takes place in Antonioni's own world which is a little different to the real world. This is because accepting the reaction of some of the characters to certain occurrences in the film will involve a certain amount of the suspension of disbelief.The problem I had with 'L'Avventura' is that after a while the relentless austerity started to get a little unbearable and tough to be receptive to. It's interesting because I know the austerity is absolutely deliberate and it's intended to epitomise the ennui that the characters get afflicted by along with Antonioni's own idea of the blandness and aimlessness of life in contemporary industrialised Italy of the early 60s. The first hour of the film is absolutely spectacular and rich with abstract existentialist intrigue. But once the group leaves the island and we reenter civilisation the film gets progressively less intriguing for me. I generally don't get negatively affected by the austerity of Kubrick or Bergman. But the second half of this film really started to progressively weigh me down.I don't think any acting performance in the film is particularly special. But of course Monica Vitti offers vulnerability and a sensitive touch to her character and she is the only one that the viewer can find any reason to sympathise with. But to be honest it is clear that Antonioni is in no mood to make any character singularly likable.Overall 'L'Avventura' is a film that clearly shows a master at work who clearly has a visual flair and a philosophical voice. But the austerity and lack of humanity in the film makes it tough to rewatch and revisit too often.".

As a result I did not find any of them interesting or appealing in the least. Indeed the Anna character comes across as spoiled irritable something of a prima donna Claudia only slightly less so.The film's plot is slow with long camera takes. In the film's first half a lot of time is consumed with characters walking around on an island casually searching for the missing person. In the second half the plot gets sidetracked with a sequence or two on modern art. This artistic motif has little or nothing to do with the missing person and thus conveys the impression that the film is being padded in an avantgarde sort of way to prop up the flimsy story concept.With the howling wind the crashing of waves against the shore and rocks falling into the sea the film has some impressive sound effects. The BW cinematography is rather conventional a little disappointing given the lush and exotic locales. Still the Mediterranean scenery is beautiful in its own right. With a runtime of well over two hours a thin storyline and long drawnout scenes wherein not much happens the film comes across as pretentious. This is especially true given that some viewers regard L'Avventura as revolutionary. Maybe it is in an extremely subtle artsy sort of way. On the other hand its reputation may be based more on wishful thinking than on substantive evaluation given the intellectual audience that this film seeks to impress.".

The BW cinematography is rather conventional a little disappointing given the lush and exotic locales. Still the Mediterranean scenery is beautiful in its own right. With a runtime of well over two hours a thin storyline and long drawnout scenes wherein not much happens the film comes across as pretentious. This is especially true given that some viewers regard L'Avventura as revolutionary. Maybe it is in an extremely subtle artsy sort of way. On the other hand its reputation may be based more on wishful thinking than on substantive evaluation given the intellectual audience that this film seeks to impress.";

It reveals its vision with its spaces as effectively as with its active elements. It allows us to bring much of ourselves to it by not filling up the experience wall to wall with specifics.

	schema:reviewBody "Antonioni's L'Avventura is a most curious creation... It may be because this is the first film of the director's that I have seen but I found it wilfully alienating and profuse in its indulgence.This is first and foremost a cinematographer's film absolutely astounding work here at times... there is an artist's eye to these canvases such scope and depth to the pictures it's quite beguiling. This is all said to be representative of Antonioni's vision of dislocated isolated figures within a barren icily arid Sicilian landscape. The vision is soundly perhaps too laboriously executed. Everything moves at a stubbornly staid slow pace surely meant to be symbolic of the odd inert existences of the main characters. Inertia is excellently evoked as is the emptiness of Ferzetti's character's emotions. Monica Vitti has an incredible screen presence yet too much of her character is just built around playing at being enigmatic. Antonioni's camera revels in capturing this classical beauty in her languorous glory. Yet it is the film's studied languor that really does alienate. The first 4560 minutes with the central enigma posed leave one expecting something more special in the remainder. A hope that is not fulfilled as the affair between Ferzetti and Vitti is padded out to its extremes. It's just not so interesting and involving a film once the action shifts away from the island. Everything is lingered on for perhaps inordinate lengths of time. Of course the photography bewitches but the actual dramatic matter of the film begins to grate a little after a while. There is an excellent usage of subtle background sounds to create a naturalistic slightly unnerving effect particularly in the island scenes which form the most compelling part of the film. Also the use of extras and bystanders particularly late on in the party scenes is fantastic. Very subtle glances and body language from these extras help give a sense of odd scale about things. Adds a little more ambiguity as well.There is little dialogue actually in this 145 minute film and really the lines that do occur are not always that important it is a film that rests on its photogenic lead performers and the intimidating tableaux of the photography. I did not really enjoy this film as an experience overall it disappoints perhaps because of its comparatively narrow focus and the way things are stretched out needlessly. So a film to be admired and credited with a valid vision but not one to be loved.Rating  12".

I have to see it myself. I have given it the benefit of the doubt by bothering to read several of the comments here. I'm glad there are those of you that got something special out of this film. A good editor with a sharp knife could have improved this film considerably. Even that would still not be enough for me.Certainly the cinematography was beautiful. I just returned from a trip to Sicily and that was the initial motivations for viewing this film. It turns out that even that was not enough for me.I don't mind that Antonioni's motivation for doing the film was to explore the delicacy of human relations. I do mind that he disguised his purpose for so long. Okay I get it that Anna brings it on herself to encourage Sandro's wandering eye. But Claudia's motivation is a mystery to me. Antonioni spends too little time motivating Claudia. Even the kiss on he boat is not nearly enough. Sandro didn't appear to be THAT good a kisser. Where Antonioni DID spend his time was largely wasted. The interminable search for Anna on the island. In real life real characters would certainly search thoroughly. But we don't have to see ALL of it. Other directors and editors have discovered ways to shorten the screen time and still give us the impression that a serious and thorough search was made. And Claudia's running down the hall scene ... hello? What about abandoned town of Noto scene? The deeper meaning was lost on me. If this is a part of the new language and new images everyone is talking about well I just don't like it. I spent 30 years in the movie biz and if I learned one thing it's that screen time costs money. If it doesn't have a direct bearing on the plot don't put it in. Again if Antonioni is just breaking this rule to give us a new way at looking at movies I don't like it.It's okay if it's not important to Antonioni as to what happens to Anna. But I feel that it is unfair for him to expect us to pay to see his movie and not tell us. We are regular folks and have a regular curiosity. But by the time this ponderous epic was finally at an end I really didn't care either.And as to the ending this really didn't do the women's movement any favors did it? Like the battered woman syndrome she takes him back almost immediately. Bummer.I will give it another look. So many have said you need at least two viewings. Many have also said that it helps considerablu to read what critics have said in order to completely understand it. This is just wrong on so many levels. If a film can't stand on its own it's just poorly done. I have seen many films that I have gotten more out of each time I see them but they were always films that were worth rewatching after a first viewing. I can't say that for me this is one of them.I gave it a 6 for the cinematography.".

Antonioni spends too little time motivating Claudia. Even the kiss on he boat is not nearly enough. Sandro didn't appear to be THAT good a kisser. Where Antonioni DID spend his time was largely wasted. The interminable search for Anna on the island. In real life real characters would certainly search thoroughly. But we don't have to see ALL of it. Other directors and editors have discovered ways to shorten the screen time and still give us the impression that a serious and thorough search was made. And Claudia's running down the hall scene ... hello? What about abandoned town of Noto scene? The deeper meaning was lost on me. If this is a part of the new language and new images everyone is talking about well I just don't like it. I spent 30 years in the movie biz and if I learned one thing it's that screen time costs money. If it doesn't have a direct bearing on the plot don't put it in. Again if Antonioni is just breaking this rule to give us a new way at looking at movies I don't like it.It's okay if it's not important to Antonioni as to what happens to Anna. But I feel that it is unfair for him to expect us to pay to see his movie and not tell us. We are regular folks and have a regular curiosity. But by the time this ponderous epic was finally at an end I really didn't care either.And as to the ending this really didn't do the women's movement any favors did it? Like the battered woman syndrome she takes him back almost immediately. Bummer.I will give it another look. So many have said you need at least two viewings. Many have also said that it helps considerablu to read what critics have said in order to completely understand it. This is just wrong on so many levels. If a film can't stand on its own it's just poorly done. I have seen many films that I have gotten more out of each time I see them but they were always films that were worth rewatching after a first viewing. I can't say that for me this is one of them.I gave it a 6 for the cinematography.";

I just saw a screening of it again at the Gene Siskel Film Center in Chicago as part of its summer retrospective of Antonioni and had a different enough experience from the first time that I felt a second posting was needed.I almost feel guilty at my reaction to films like L'Avventura and I'm hoping that others who have studied film will understand. On my first viewing I wanted so much to see the masterpiece that film scholars told me existed and felt obligated to worship Antonioni's brilliance. But what impressed me most about this film on a second viewing was how little I enjoyed watching it. What interest it has for me is purely academic. I appreciate its place in film history but I have no desire now to ever revisit it like I do other classics that were important but also entertaining. Watching other people try to decide whether or not life has any meaning is tiresome when you've reached an age where you've decided the answer to that question yourself.But I will say that what Antonioni has to say here he says very well. The male and female protagonists of the movie who go searching for their lover and friend when she goes missing on a yachting party battle an overwhelming sense of indifference that the movie conveys brilliantly almost too well. They have to struggle to continue caring whether or not they find the missing woman and to some extent realize that their lives would be better off if she weren't found at all. The pervading mood of their scenes together and of the movie in general is ennui but the feeling of ennui extends to the viewer as well. Just as the characters slowly begin to lose their interest in the missing person we lose our interest too in her them and the movie in general.So how do you rate a movie that you know is well made is culturally significant and changed the landscape of international cinema but which you would rather do almost anything to avoid having to ever watch again?

	schema:headline " Looking for Anna";
	schema:reviewBody "What begins as a joy cruise around Sicily becomes a nightmare for all the people aboard the pleasure yacht of rich Italians. Anna a beautiful spoiled young woman who at the start of the story is seen arguing with her father has been in a relationship with Sandro. Anna and her friend Claudia join the cruise after stopping to pick up Sandro who has a lot in his mind. As the yacht nears an isolated island Anna decides to jump in for a swim. It's reckless from her part as the others see her disappear in total disbelief. Sandro jumps in to join her. Later the whole party decide to go to the arid island for a short visit. Anna without any explanation disappears taking everyone by surprise. No matter how they comb the barren place make any difference Anna for all practical purposes has vanished and there are no easy explanations.Thus begins one of the most enigmatic films by Michelangelo Antonionni one of the best Italian directors of his generation. This film marks a departure for him in the themes he brought to the screen. Antonionni had his roots in the neorealism with this film he makes a 360 degree turn as he abandons the way of making movies as we knew in favor of more introspective account of the human soul as he saw in the Italian society of that time.L'Avventura which came out in 1960 shows an Antonionni that is concerned in exploring human relations. The director found a fertile ground in the elite classes he brought to the screen. He must have felt a fascination to see what he could get out of these idle rich. In a way the film compares with La Dolce Vita but whereas Fellini depicts life of the upper classes he concentrates on minor more earthier types. Antonionni in contrast finds the people in his film more to his liking because of the complex nature in most of them.L'Avventura was written by Tonino Guerra and Elio Bartolini with the help of Antonionni himself. It's worth noting that once Anna's disappearance is out of the way the director concentrates on the dynamic he sees in Claudia and Sandro as they embark in an love affair. It's not hard to imagine that Sandro was fed up with the fickle Anna as he turns into Claudia a woman he has desired but was never able to get his way with her because of Anna.Monica Vitti Antonionni's favorite actress makes an enormous contribution to the film. As Claudia she registers all kinds of emotions ranging from the concern she feels for Anna's disappearance to the way she doesn't seem to accept Sandro as he turns to her. There is a great moment in the film as Claudio and Sandro are seen touring a belfry and they begin pealing the bells of the monastery across the way. The ending shows Claudia with a contrite Sandro. The other interesting scene shows Claudia outside a police station waiting for Sandro and sees to her horror how suddenly she is surrounded by what seem to be all the men in town who covet her because of her beauty and for being different.Gabriele Ferzetti one of the most handsome Italian actors of his era does excellent work as Sandro. Like other men of his circle Sandro shows an ambivalence about the way he perceives love. No sooner is Anna out of the way when he turns to Claudia for consolation although one has sensed the animal attraction he feels for this beautiful woman. Then even after having Claudia Sandro has no problem making out with the eccentric woman he had seen before in Palermo.Lea Massari an interesting actress doesn't have much to do. She is Anna and once she is out of the picture we tend to forget that she was the one that triggered the chain of events that followed her disappearance. The rest of the cast does a wonderful job for the director.L'Avventura owes a great deal to Aldo Scavardo who photographed the film with a loving eye as he captures the beauty in the desolate places where he and Mr. Antonionni take us in the story. The music by Giovanni Fusco adds another dimension to the action. Michelangelo Antonionni gained international attention after this film came out and it's a tribute to his genius the film looks as gorgeous today as when it was made more than sixty years ago.".

	schema:reviewBody "...yet any viewer can see why L'Avventura in English The Adventure which is interesting considering what unfolds put him on the map in the artfilmnewwave era.  He tells a story of a group of highsociety types the kind that seem all the more empty as they are examined character wise who on a boat trip stop on an island to walk around when a woman Anna Lea Massari goes missing.  They search for her send out more people to search for her but as the film progresses it can be seen that the search for her is futile and it becomes an existentialist examination of the character played by Ferzetti and Vitti.The major flaw that I can see with L'Avventura is that it's at times a bit too assured with it's own storytelling skills and occasionally it plods along.  However the story works most of the time and it's nonformulaic structure keeps it very credible.  But what made me take notice and not nod out at all during the picture was the whole aura the atmosphere. Antonionni along with his director of photography Aldo Scavarda always have a beautiful shot up on the screen scenes which may seem of desperation are perfectly captured in the frames and any one could be freezeframed and put on a wall to view like a painting another film like this could be Raging Bull.  On that level of pure skill and movement as well as the realistic character development L'Avventura is an accomplished piece of filmmaking.  Important to be sure though some may feel turned off after a while.  Grade A".

This is closer to Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock than to a conventional mystery.Antonioni takes his characters who are volatile cyphers see their constantly shifting attitudes towards each other and also towards Anna's disappearance and places them against vivid sharply defined backgrounds. Weir's Picnic was the unsettling story of an enigma which haunted all those involved Antonioni's movie is chillingly indifferent. Anna is nowhere to be found  the two main characters move on leave the island their attempts to find Anna getting increasingly bland. The key moment happens late into the movie. Sandro an architect contemplates a beautiful vista on a baroque town. The town of Noto was destroyed by an earthquake and its rebuilding was meticulously planned with incredible attention to every detail and to the final scenic effect by a single man. Backgrounds and landscapes are the focus here not characters. In fact the last shot is more eloquent than any line of dialogue uttered by the protagonists.Like in Picnic at Hanging Rock the sexual especially homosexual subtext is explicit. There is a strong hint that Anna's disaffection for Sandro is linked to her closeness to Claudia. Frustrated by her relationship with Sandro the young woman literally vanishes into the bare magmatic landscape of the island. See how Antonioni mirrors Anna in Claudia Massari's and Vitti's facial features are strikingly alike. After Anna's disappearance Claudia uses her clothes effectively becoming her double. Sandro falls for her so the whole thing plays like a love triangle where the disappeared Anna is represented by the quest to find her. Unlike Scottie in Vertigo however Sandro doesn't try to duplicate Anna to rebuild the perfect copy of the woman he loved  he couldn't care less. He cheats on Claudia after she finally falls in love with him. See also how Anna's malaise and mysterious disappearance are foreshadowed by her pointless lie about the shark.".

To find romance with the woman he does is much too quirky to have ever happened in a Hollywood movie. Yet this film plays it perfectly. And so what makes this film so unique is that it is not so self involved and moody like most independent films can be.

	schema:reviewBody "I find it really hard to explain to people why I think Wes Anderson movies are so great. There's an air about them that's so wonderful and I always feel really great after I've watched them. When I tried to explain my friend said a bit like the Big Lebowski? and I think that's the closest you can come to describing Bottle Rocket and Wes Anderson movies as a whole they're that sort of brand of movie.Bottle Rocket is the story of three guys who live in the suburbs who are trying to become criminals and not making a very good job of it. The film starts with Anthony Luke Wilson coming out of a voluntary rehab type place and instantly joining his friend Dignan in his very poor attempts to become some sort of criminal. They are joined by their friend Bob because he has a car and start by robbing a library. The film really emerges from that moment and takes you on this up beat weird but wonderful adventure.Owen and Luke Wilson are really good together with Owen Wilson probably stealing the show as the completely useless but very endearing Dignan. Bob played by Robert Musgrave is also excellent in his role as the lovable loser. The soundtrack is perfect everything comes and goes at exactly the right moment. This was probably one of the funniest films i've seen in a while too. If you like the Big Lebowski you will love this film my favourite is probably Anthony wake up Bob's stolen his car. It also feels a lot longer than it is and whilst that's usually bad in this case it was fantastic. At 30 minutes I looked to see how long I'd been watching it for and was amazed at how engrossed I was but also how much happens but yet the film manages to feel really slow and relaxed.Though I've said Dignan was endearing I guess the movie as a whole is endearing its such a lovely film I really don't see how you couldn't like it. Some how this just misses out on being a real classic on a level with Big Lebowski maybe its because not as many people have seen it or something either way its definitely in my top ten or top five or something. A must see go and watch it!".

Boy am I glad that I did.The movie Bottle Rocket is a joy.  It is a caper comedy in one respect but also an interesting look at how the bad brother can talk the good brother into doing the wrong thing.  The second idea sets up some great comedy bits. Owen Wilson as the bad brother Dignan is absolutely hilarious.  From this point forward I will always be interested in seeing him in a movie.  His brother Luke Wilson as the good yet naive brother is also very charming. James Caan shows up in the second half of the movie and is fantastic.  The writerdirector Wes Anderson Rushmore does a great job of telling an offbeat story and gives his characters great lines to say. All in all Bottle Rocket was a pleasant surprise that I had never heard of. Thank you Martin Scorsese.".

	schema:headline " Great first feature";
	schema:reviewBody "Bottle Rocket is Wes Anderson's first feature and a remake of a short film he made with Owen Wilson as well. It bears all of the hallmarks of a Wes Anderson film quirky characters dry humor precise and orchestrated cinematography and a story about finding something beautiful in the flaws of the main characters especially Dignan Owen Wilson.The film has a simple story three friends attempting to commit a robbery and go on the run but like Wes Anderson movies it is not straightforward. The movie is not about the heist rather the relationships between the main characters and their flaws. The best of which is Owen Wilson's 75 year plan he created for himself and Luke Wilson's character describing when they would get married etc.Dignan's 75 year plan and his heist plan are themes Wes Anderson carries throughout his movies. A main character is always trying to accomplish something well beyond their means and capacity i.e. Bill Murray in Life Aquatic Max in Rushmore Owen Wilson in Darjeeling. They are always planning and scheming something greater than they can obviously achieve. This movie blends humor and drama very well. It reminds me of Fargo with its dry and occasionally dark humor. The film ends as a tragedy the tragedy of Dignan which makes us feel bad for him. But you almost feel like he will be okay. His personality makes this bad turn of fortune not seem so bad. Bottle Rocket is one of Anderson's better movies and if you enjoy any and all of his later flicks then check this one out.".

It bears all of the hallmarks of a Wes Anderson film quirky characters dry humor precise and orchestrated cinematography and a story about finding something beautiful in the flaws of the main characters especially Dignan Owen Wilson.The film has a simple story three friends attempting to commit a robbery and go on the run but like Wes Anderson movies it is not straightforward. The movie is not about the heist rather the relationships between the main characters and their flaws. The best of which is Owen Wilson's 75 year plan he created for himself and Luke Wilson's character describing when they would get married etc.Dignan's 75 year plan and his heist plan are themes Wes Anderson carries throughout his movies. A main character is always trying to accomplish something well beyond their means and capacity i.e. Bill Murray in Life Aquatic Max in Rushmore Owen Wilson in Darjeeling. They are always planning and scheming something greater than they can obviously achieve. This movie blends humor and drama very well. It reminds me of Fargo with its dry and occasionally dark humor. The film ends as a tragedy the tragedy of Dignan which makes us feel bad for him. But you almost feel like he will be okay. His personality makes this bad turn of fortune not seem so bad. Bottle Rocket is one of Anderson's better movies and if you enjoy any and all of his later flicks then check this one out.";

	schema:headline " stunning debut";
	schema:reviewBody "1996's Bottle Rocket stands out as the arresting debut of director Wes Anderson along with ongoing writing partner Owen Wilson. It immediately engages its audience in the ridiculous story of Dignan Owen Wilson and Anthony Luke Wilson two friends that aren't any good at being criminals  although they aspire to be. They work alongside their friend Bob Mapplethorpe Robert Musgrave or rather trick him into helping them due to the fact that he can finance their operations.What's so interesting about this film is the true heart that started in the script and then continued to shine through with the actors' performances. The characters were developed deeply enough for the audience to truly get a sense of who they were what they wanted and where they were going. Although the film tells the story of a group of wannabe thieves it becomes clear that the reason why they are no good at pulling off these crimes is simply because of the fact that they are actually really nice guys incapable of actually hurting anyone.The most remarkable aspect of the film would have to be in the brilliant performances featured throughout. Owen Wilson truly shines as Dignan the group's leader  desperate to pull off at least one fantastic heist. He is hottempered controlling and he often lets his emotions get the best of him. Although he may screw up a lot he is always quick to apologize. At the end of the film when he is sentenced to serve time he claims to have no hard feelings showing a real growth in his character. Another standout performance came from Luke Wilson as Dignan's best friend Anthony. It's obvious that Anthony doesn't want to be a criminal and that he simply participates because he doesn't want to make Dignan unhappy. After he falls in love with one of the maids at a motel they stay at he realizes he can't work with Dignan anymore. Wilson's performance was outstanding  he was really able to convey both his character's indifferent side and also being torn between love and friendship.Bottle Rocket was an outstanding debut achievement for director Wes Anderson marking the beginning of a series of stunning films full of character driven scripts great music and aesthetically pleasing visuals.".

Wilson the screenplay is very intelligent and shows how the screen writing duo Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson has evolved. Starring the Wilson brothers Owen and Luke Wilson this smallbudget comedy has what most large budget comedies lack a perfect mix of drama and comedy. The film about two friends that both were patients at a mental ward portrays how innocent fun can sometimes hurt people. Rocket never becomes overdramatic or slapstick in its comedy. It is clear that Anderson was experimenting with his style and would not perfect it until his next film Rushmore. The characters are clearly dysfunctional and like to take unnecessary risks at their own expense to make the script move along. This is not a fault in the script but a blessing as this keeps the comedy and serious moments perfectly balanced. The cinematography is sometimes amateur with its unnecessary closeups and wide angle panning. The soundtrack done by Mark Mothersbaugh is excellent and just proves why he has worked an all of the subsequent films with Anderson. It seems Anderson and Wilson have an enormous talent when writing dialog for unusual anomalous characters. This film is a testament to the fact that a good script and a working knowledge of film work can create an original and enjoyable film.".

If you are in the camp that prefers Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums you will find that this script feels more like those films than Anderson's more recent work.Although this movie has a smaller budget than Anderson's other films the director is able to put together a fun film. Anderson compiles one of his great soundtracks despite being unable to afford royaltyheavy songs.Perhaps not yet confident enough to take risks Anderson does not engage in the visual experimentation found in his other films. Although you might miss the liberal use of vivid colors found in all other Anderson films I think the fantastic sets and props such as the submarine or the helicopter in Life Aquatic are best left out of this simpler more realistic film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bottle Rocket's plot isn't very heavy. Doesn't need to be for Wes Anderson's first film he takes partly in theory a cue from Michael Cimino's Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. There too were the real oddball outsider characters looking for a leg up but not with the same kind of zeal of a real hardbitten criminal or neonoir. In Bottle Rocket there's an exvolunteer at an insane asylum and a guy who works for a landscaping company and the two are thick as thieves only they're not good at actually being thieves with one or two moments of exception. And yet Anderson doesn't mine for the easy parts for comic effect. His sense of humor is in the small things little character traits or a moment that pops out.It may depend on how one sees the characters and how much one is a fan of the Wilson brothers Luke and Owen. But what Anderson does capture is that innocent feeling of being unsure of life and the things that make friendships kind of awkward at times. The three criminals played by Anthony Dignan and Bob bicker and converse and do whatever like normal folk not real gangsters like say Mr Henry James Caan but they aspire to that and Dignan gets the closest. Meanwhile on the lam from a robbery of a bookstore Anthony falls for a Peruvian housemaid and Bob has his own worries with his backyard pot growth. Their appeal really is in how the interactions are based around a solid theme of loyalty and friendship and the filmmaking takes it to another level.It's hard to say if I found this a really great comedy there's a few big laughs one with a hilarious botch during a climactic robbery with a shot at someone unexpected and little ones like a PBJ just lifted off the ground or a bad encounter at a country club but it's an unusually amazing heistcharacterdrama. Well drama of sorts it's the Wes Anderson style already in full mode and it's exhilarating to watch him make 90 minutes feel a lot fuller a lot more alive than most at such a running time. I also liked the Wilson brothers with the both of them in their breakout roles completely on top with their subtle zany and quietly crazy roles. Loved the music the cinematography but most of all the emphasis on character over plot. In heist movies or just younglost20something generation movies it's rarely this good.".

If you've seen Rushmore Tenenbaums or even Life Aquatic beforehand it's certainly fine as in those films Anderson's style he is known for today hasn't quite evolved as it is now.

	schema:reviewBody "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.  John LennonThis one Bottle Rocket the first feature film of Wes Anderson is also and certainly Owen and Luke Wilson's very first feature and for a reason I had in my head that Dignan and Anthony Owen and Luke Wilson's characters respectively were brothers! After all they do were almost like brothers they were a team a team that never accomplished anything really big but that at least became a true team. Not very long time ago I watched the Woody Allen film Take the Money and Run and by watching Bottle Rocket I remembered that Allen film. So they are a team here and Dignan leader and the one with the ideas with the plans he has all planned for like the next fifty years! But once you see him in action well you will remember Woody Allen in Take the Money and Run basically Dignan during the heist to a bookstore ends talking to the manger of the bookstore with a lot of respect! But well the three now are fugitives both Dignan and Anthony and Bob the only one who has a car but is not yet a team basically one will be in love the other will be worry because of a family situation and the other is the only one who still is in the team. This film has what is probably the very best performance of Owen Wilson he is usually very funny but here he is simply superb. He plays a very strange and very memorable character Dignan is more or less like a big kid when is time for his plans and stuff he is a likable character since the very first scene of the film sometimes he takes himself very seriously Grace Anthony's little sister defines Dignan very well I do like Dignan but he's a liar. At one point these two brothers will take different roads for whatever reasons the fact is that Anthony will have a complete change in his life. We meet Anthony during his last day at a mental hospital he was there because he wanted to be there we know that is certainly a difficult time for him he is unhappy but this will change. I think the scene that sort of defines Anthony is when he is together with Inez Lumi Cavazos the housekeeper of the hotel that they were staying in in the laundry room he is just fascinated feeling something that certainly was unexpected. So the team is now the least important thing for Anthony and when he returns to home he starts a new productive routine and with that he has no time to think if Inez love him or not or in anything from the past. Dignan is back in Anthony's life certainly another plan but is Anthony in? he knows he has now something more but again is Dignan a great scene Anthony sees sort of a resume of how is Dignan's life he is in and Bob too. Very hilarious but certainly also sad the last part of the film is that as well as the entire film. Each member of the team ended very well with the others but only each member of the original team the plan turned to be a mess Dignan ended in jail with a sentence of 2 years that scene in which Dignan tries to escape but finally is arrested by the police is simply a superb one the music was great one of my favourites scenes Bob ended without most of his things but they ended as a real team after all they're not really criminals but everybody's got to have a dream. Watch this one probably my favourite Anderson film up there with The Royal Tenenbaums and hell it has James Cann as a clever swine!.PD recently I visited Roger Ebert's website and in the main page there is part of his review for the film Revolutionary Road and he wrote at the beginning the John Lennon phrase LIFE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHILE YOU'RE BUSY MAKING OTHER PLANS. I liked that phrase and I thought was right for this film. Anyway Ebert gave to Bottle Rocket only 2 stars and to Rushmore the other Anderson film that for me gets a 10 only 2 and half stars while for Martin Scorsese Bottle Rocket was the number 7 of his best films of the 1990's list from ROGER EBERT  THE MOVIES show 1426.".

	schema:headline " Yep dark and disturbing";
	schema:reviewBody "After reading about 40 of the other comments here all of whom say RETURN TO OZ is dark and disturbing I will make a different comment. In the early 80s Disney certainly were off the cash trail with a range of films each expertly produced that were box office disasters. One may recall SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES TRON THE BLACK CAULDRON ONE MAGIC Christmas and a few others that had much to offer any thinking crowdand each had special effects that were quite astonishing. Disney were in a very bleak period and the films attempting to reflect perhaps a more mature or even grown up perspective chose oh dear I have to say it a dark and disturbing theme. At the time of release every critic bleated at the grim and melancholy tone of RETURN TO OZ and sadly themselves neglected to celebrate the original book look a choice Disney execs applauded themselves for. One Exec infamously said to us theatre owners We're going for the Frank L Baum book illustrations and nothing like that 1939 vaudeville thing. Oh dear I thought at the time. You mean the world's most popular kids film? Well. 27 million dollars later in production costs returned maybe a quarter in theatre film rentals and RETURN TO OZ for all its merit and lavish production care and superb scary special effects....was consigned to the Disney dud bin. At the time I was irritated by the fixed goony expressions on Jack Pumpkinhead and the Scarecrow loved Tiktok though a fascinating and completely compelling design and movement piece This time around I didn't mind it and actually appreciated the fact that they were 'book' expressions. Viewed 20 years later on a Disney DVD of dubious quality I have to say it is a film more suited to these dark and disturbing times and if released today would certainly get a better reception and better crits...and possibly make a lot of money. I think the world is tuned into this type of family film more now than in the Flashdance 80s. The production values of RETURN TO OZ are simply breathtaking. Scene after scene perfectly realised the green walled horror of the psychiatric asylum in reel one the amazing claymation of the Gnome King and especially the glittering halls of Mombi's castle. One genuinely screamworthy scene in the hall of Heads with a headless Queen rushing about in a nightmarish vision is almost only for adults so intense is it's genuine horror. The glittering climax of a restored Emerald City is a triumph of green and silvergold set design I defy any viewer not to rewind it several times just to see each and every part. Yes nominated for 5 Oscars it won none and vanished for 20 years. The nomarquee name Fairuza Balk didn't help the public embrace no matter how exquisite she is. At least she wasn't named Soleil Moon Fry. In the same class as The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth RETURN TO OZ now deserves its place there as part of a trilogy of superbly crafted fantasy for smart kids and astonished adults. That 'vaudeville thing' it certainly isn't. But not a failure either. The DVD is lacking trailers and production material that should and could be included. Bad Disney! Good film! I also defy any viewer not to shriek with laughter at the Gnome King revealing he is wearing the ruby slippers a sly joke well presented.".

Return To Oz was I mean is better than the original because it was more based on the books whereas The Wizard Of Oz was a cross between the original book bittersweet sets and a symphony orchestra.While some disagree I believe that 'Return' was not all a weak sequel but more of a nonsequel sequel which had little to do with the original and had an exciting haunting script which worked really well.Well it's been about 10 years since I first saw Return To Oz and I still think that it's one of the best children's movies ever made however scary and it's in everyone's best interests to rent it out  even if you hated it's predacessor.".

It is actually a synthesis of the first five or so sequels to the BOOK.  This isn't a dig at the movie mind you.  If you don't like it on some level or other you can't be human.  It's just that the movie was based on the book in the respect that the characters in the movie had the same names as the characters in the book.Secondly L. Frank Baum's original printedpage OZ is quite possibly the most messed up imaginary universe ever created.  There's a land of beings who throw their own heads at you as weapons.  There's a land of sentient vegetables who raise people in their gardens think Motel Hell and you've got the idea.  To top it all off it turns out that Dorothy's buddies are really good at killing things in particular the dear heartless Tin Man who bloodies up his hatchet with unsettling apathy.What I'm trying to get at here is that Return to OZ is an OZ movie that is much more faithful to the books.  Much more THIS is how long you have to be alive! than We represent the Lullaby League.  I think it goes without saying that you'd be legally insane to show it to little kids but fantasy fans OZ enthusiasts and fans of cult movies should hunt it down as soon as possible.By the way please note that the oldschool herkyjerky puppets and claymation monsters in this movie are scary as all get out.  Compare this to the awful remake of the Haunting with it's stupid cartoonish CGI creatures and this isn't a dig at computer animation but since the technique is inheritely realist it's not scary.

	schema:reviewBody "Cherubic Dorothy Gale is catapulted back to the magical world of Oz in this enchanting but very atypical Disney Production that got released 46 years after Victor Fleming's original none of the original castmembers lived long enough to ever see this sequel!. In the story however only six months have passed since Dorothy was brought to Oz by a tornado. During some medical tests performed because she keeps talking about her unbelievable journey a mysterious girl helps Dorothy escape from the hospital and back to Oz for a new adventure! The screenplay based on two L. Frank Baum novels at once introduces a large amount of imaginative new characters that are either Dorothy's loyal friendsor malicious new enemies. It soon becomes clear that she was called back to Oz for a reason as the evil Nome King has turned everyone to stone and the mad Princess Mombi is after more human heads for her collection. Despite the presence of a talking chicken this is a frighteningly grim and obscure fantasy tale perhaps not even suitable for the typical Disneytarget groups. The events and characters in Return to Oz are often quite macabre decapitation for a hobby eerie guys on wheels and the tone of the film is heavier since there isn't any singing and dancing going on. Perhaps a little too scary for the smallest children but Return to Oz nonetheless is a compelling and spontaneous adventure highly recommended to those who like their fairytales sinister. The special effects are really terrific with stunning stopmotion animations and some very engaging mechanical machinery TicTok!. The young Fairuza Balk is an unbelievably convincing followup to Judy Garland! The talented Piper Laurie Carrie is regretfully underused though. This film along with The Dark Crystal and The Neverending Story was a huge favorite of mine when I was young and they seemly only got better with years. Good stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "Honestly I do not know how I am this sane because when I think of my childhood one of my favorite movies was Return to Oz. I absolutely adored this movie but it scared the heck out of me. I was shopping and found Return to Oz on DVD and without hesitation bought it it's always nice to go down nostalgia lane and I was thinking maybe since I was a kid I was just easily scared by silly things nope I was so wrong. This is a major mind screw of a movie. However I cannot believe that I still adore this movie I love the risks it took and that it didn't insult children's intelligence like most movies do. Don Bluth one of the greatest animators and story tellers of our time said that kids are more resilient than you would think. That's so true and Return to Oz is a wonderful magical movie that leaves you breathless.Dorothy Gale has become a melancholic child who cannot stop dreaming of the people she met in the magical world of Oz concerning Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. The two decide to take her to see Doctor Worley known for his shock therapy treatments. Before going Dorothy finds a key she believes her friends from Oz sent to her on a shooting star. Aunt Em leaves Dorothy at Dr. Worley's laboratory under the care of Nurse Wilson. As she is taken to have treatment the lab has a blackout and Dorothy is saved by a mysterious girl who reveals that some patients have been driven insane by Worley's treatment. The two escape but fall into a river. The blonde girl vanishes underwater and Dorothy returns to Oz. Upon awakening Dorothy finds her chicken who can now talk named Billina for company. The two discover the ruined Yellow Brick Road which leads them to the Emerald City now in ruins missing its emeralds and all of its citizens including the Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion turned to stone. She swears that she will restore Oz with the help of some new friends while being chased by some disturbing new villains.I remember as a kid being terrified by Princess Mumbi she has this room full of heads that she can change as she pleases and when Dorothy has to go to retrieve a potion from her cabinet with the main head she accidentally knocks over a jar and the head screams Dorothy Gail!!! and all the other heads start screaming! God that scene is still horrifying to watch! But there is an extremely touching scene that always gets me in tears Jack Pumpkinhead who Dorothy meets asks her if he could call her mom until he finds his real mother she agrees with a kind heart and as they are laying on their flying couch called The Gump he puts a scarf on her and says good night mom. I loved their relationship it was beautiful. Also she has a great relationship with Tik Tok a robot who was part of the Army of Oz and has to be wound up in order to work his personality fits so extremely well with the group since you have the silliness you need the intelligence too. The effects are still outstanding to this day in my opinion the acting is very good the sets the lighting the costumes the characters I just love Return to Oz. It's a great movie. Parents today are so afraid of showing their children movies like Return to Oz because it might give them nightmares take advice from me and Mr. Bluth your kids are a lot stronger than you think and I'm perfectly fine and I'm so glad I have this movie in my collection. It's a wonderful film not to be missed.1010".

I recently rediscovered the movie and even as an adult I still love it. Yes the movie is considerably darker the Wizard but in my opinion it is a better and more interesting story. In light of the violence in movies today I do not think it is out of the question to allow a ten year old to see it and if you are a teenager or older I would certainly recommend this film. If you found Wizard of Oz too cutesy for your taste you may be pleasantly surprised by this underrated film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Along with Hook 1991 this has got to be the best continuation  sequelesque adaptation of a classic fairy tale for kids . although this one is slightly better than Hook because it has a more reliable plot and a tighter pace . There are no words to describe how well constructed this movie is . Every part of it really shines . From the imaginative direction to the impressive sets and costumes and from the professionally constructed script and dialogue to the effectively subtle performances from all the actors live and animatronic .I will have to tell you that I am fanatically against the screenplay changes filmmakers usually conduct to a story  novel  myth  comic book  TV show when they turn it into a movie . They omit important plot elements  they mistreat important characters by underusing them  they often fail to shoot chilling scenes from the book et al due to lame direction and untalented SFX crew members hence not doing them justice like the freezing super power of SubZero in Mortal Kombat and generally they bastardize crucial thematic parts because of many changes in the atmosphere of the original . The Return to Oz script mixes elements from 2 books by L. Frank Baum and puts them in the blender with multiple variations and vital declinations from their roots . God forgive me but it is probably the best bastardization I have ever witnessed . If these words are coming out of my mouth then it is definitely a very successful film . I will brief you a little slight spoilers coming   characters from the first book which is the direct continuation of Dorothy 's adventures where Dorothy manages to find the ruby slippers and returns to see her friends  are Jack the pumpkinhead  the reindeerheaded flying sofa and Mombie the witch and NOT an aristocratic princess . Jack and the reindeer were precisely the same as in the movie  animated by the powder of life . there was also a cute wooden pony which was probably omitted because it was a silent role . Mombie however was a rather old grey haired  wannabe witch who resembled remarkably Mim !  for the uninitiated Mim is Magica De Spell 's partner in the crusade of stealing the lucky dime of uncle Scrooge . Ozma was indeed Mombie 's prisoner although she thought she was a boy in a young Jodie Foster way with dirty clothes under the name Chip ! The second book introduces us to Tic Toc who managed to drag Dorothy into the land of Oz once again . Tic Toc was indeed a golden metal robot but a bit shorter and quite thinner so he wasn 't as macho as in the film . He had more childish voice and manners  something like a juvenile version of C3PO from Star Wars . The greatest change was of course the Gnome King . Although his kingdom was under the ground of a desert he was not the ruler of stones but the king of Dwarfs he was a nasty little Oumba Loobalike himself . Nevertheless he had a powerful army and weapons and he tried to take over Oz. The Dwarves ' only weakness was the eggs . Oh  and Bileena was not Dorothy 's chicken but a native habitant chicken in Oz . The rescue mission was not for the Schiactro but for an unrelated prince the Prince of Eb under the request of his beloved Princess . Also the jewelry museum was true with the difference that the contestants had only one chance not 3. The rest of the plot 's surprises such as the wheelers  the decapitated dancers were completely the brainchildren of Walter Murch and Gill Dennis.All in all the combination of these thematic factors was wonderful . I believe that this slightly tense adaptation is a much more successful depiction of Frank Baum 's vision of the Land of Oz . Enchanting and beautiful for the eye but with hidden dangers lurking around . Who can forget the beginning sequence where Dorothy finds Oz literally wrecked ? Everybody has been transformed into a stone statue and the roads and buildings are torn apart . The direction is flawless in giving us this absolutely successful threatening but interestingly suspenseful scene . I really cannot realize why so many libels like much dark too scary etc. This has exactly the same level of violence with classic Disney cartoons where the evil step mother curses Snow White with diabolical spells in the middle of storm with frightening thunders or where Sleeping Beauty 's charming prince struggles to save her by fighting her wicked witch godmother who is transformed into a giant dragon who spits up disastrous and dreadful fireballs . A much more twisted and snicky kids film is  Willy Wonka   especially the boat scene .Anyway I don 't think Mombie 's heads or the giggling deranged wheelers can be frightening . They are graphic figures like the wicked witch of the West or the gremlins . As a matter of fact how hasn 't anyone found unsuitable and politically uncorrect the reoccurring quote of the Queen of hearts  Off with his  her  their head !   in Alice in Wonderland which keep in mind that was written by a priest . Not only Return to Oz is the near perfect followup to a well known legend  but it is also one of the best fairy tale adaptations  cinema industry has ever given us . Adequate SFX like the petrified Emerald city or the flying sofa or the earthquake scene  impressive sets Mombie 's palace or the desert and of course the unforgettable jewels museum I have seen the film several times but this scene always thrills me . As a stand alone fairy tale it is also great . Two scenes at the end standout as perfect examples Spoiler alert The celebration scene at the palace and the mirrorthrough communication between Dorothy and Ozma On top of that the glossy ruby slippers are still enchanting . What else can be said ? Mere cameos from the Tin man and the coward lion for the fans of the old cast combine with fine direction and script for a spectacular show . If only spoiler they didn 't spoil it with the doubts that it was all a dream  A classic masterpieceRETURN TO OZ                                    9.5  10".

	schema:reviewBody "In this minor dark fantasy classic we return to Oz with Dorothy Gale who has not been able to adjust to normality since her primary adventures. Her Auntie and Uncle do not know what do to with her and noone believes her amazing stories. Eventually she is sent to a psychiatric hospital and unknown to her family it is run by nearmasochists who supposedly perform terrifying experiments on children. As this is above all a kids' movie none of this is shown but the suggestion is pretty heavy and there are 'implements' all over the hospital. Jean Marsh plays Nurse Wilson who is relentlessly horrifying and pursues Dorothy through the stormy night in which Dorothy escapes. Dorothy jumps into a river and when she wakes she is in Oz with a chicken called Billina. However after some exploring it appears that Oz has been infected with some kind of evil and it is no longer the enchanting place it was but is now the place of nightmares. The Emerald city and all inhabitants including the Cowardly Lion and the TinMan have been turned to stone. After a chase by the brilliantly memorable and scary Wheelers Dorothy meets TikTok a mechanical man and they try to find the Scarecrow and work out what has happened. Soon Dorothy is taken prisoner by the wicked Princess Mombi Jean Marsh again who is obsessed with her appearance stealing the heads of beautiful young women. It seems that the Nome King has become immensely powerful turning all to stone as his personal statues. The struggle to return Oz to its glory is one which will take all of Dorothy's skill and love.This film is a definite classic for kids but beware it is dark and has many moments which will be scary. I saw this recently having not seen it in a few years and although the impact has dwindled and the faults are clear it is still a good film although should definitely be seen at a young age. There are many things to recommend it although fans of The Wizard of Oz my be disappointed by the lack of music and lighthearted fun. The acting is all top notchJean Marsh is excellent in her roles an extremely talented actress and Fairuza Balk is outstanding in her first role seeming both timid and strong and giving a good account of what may be a disturbed child. The new characters are all just as good as those in the 1939 film particularly Pumpkinhead and TikTok. The effects here are also extremely good for their time and they are still pretty good to see today. Scary moments include the Wheeler chase the final encounter with the Nome King and of course the infamous screaming heads scene which will likely stay in the memory of all who see it. If you have children with strong imaginations or with an interest in reading or fantasy then this is a film they should be shown but if they are scared easily it may not be such a good idea.7.5".

The imagery of this film lingers long after first view and its marked stylistic and thematic differences to Wizard Of Oz have a hypnotic effect on a certain type of viewer.In Return the central theme is one of deep unhappiness with reality and a wish to return to fantasy where as Wizard focuses more on the concept of there's no place like home. I admire and am still deeply effected by this film because in some ways it is braver than Wizard. It isn't afraid to deal with the conflict  that the misery of a grey Kansas is very real.It expresses a rippling dissatisfaction that seems more in keeping with Baum's original works and is all the more satisfying for it. In particular I enjoyed the parrallels between the real world and Oz for what it suggests about our world and the Nome King's conversation with Dorothy. For a children's film there is great depth in both and most of the film can be interpreted on several different levels. The implications of the corridor of heads alone is enough to send any first year pyschlit student into a whole mess of garbage.But don't be fooled.

	schema:headline " Frightening Shocking Beautiful and Imaginative! SPOILERS!";
	schema:reviewBody "I fully recommend this film. My father bought it in a second hand video shop for 1! That was when I was 9. I am now 18 and it still plays on my television. Having been brought up on the original movie as a child I never really made the link between the two. I think Disney introduced this movie not just as a sequel but an original story in its own right. You don't need to see the first to see the second. As I child I used to get spine tingling nightmares when watching this movie. Even though it frightened me it also excited me. It should not have been certified a PG more like a 12 but having said that I'm glad I watched when I was young.You cannot compare it to the likes of Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter because these films were made in a new era. The powerful combination of the music visual effects of the characters and the intricate plotline gives this  film a 5 rating in a separate film poll.Although Return To Oz is not as colourful and positive as the original Julie Garland movie it contains sinister undertones like the psychiatric hospital and the doctor attempting to give Dorothy electric shock treatment to destroy her dreams of the magical world of Oz.The original film was timeless as there was no indication of the decade or even century the film was set. In comparison the opening scenes of Return to Oz reminds the viewer that this film was set at the turn of the century 1899 at the dawn of a new era as the doctor points out to both the viewer and Dorothy Gale. This realistic theme of the film is touched upon but not elaborated. It seems all sense of time and place is lost when Dorothy enters Oz.From an adults perspective Dorothy's adventures in Oz are merely a dream. To a child they are very much a real life happening. We would all like to believe we could escape to a secret colourful bright timeless place like Oz but as we get older that secret place seems even more farther to reach.I think Walter Murch was very clever with the linkages made between the first and the second film. He has managed to make his own mark on the film as an original piece of moviemaking. However we know it is a sequel from the title. Other reminders include Dorothy's connection made between the people that enter her life in Kansas and the characters that she encounters in Oz. For example the male nurse who 'wheels' her to the operating table does not speak a word. All Dorothy can hear is the squeaking of the wheels of her moving bed. In Oz the face of the male nurse is repeated over a dozen times and reintroduced as the fastmoving squeaky mobile creatures known as the wheelers. The creature is shown as an evil one working for Mombie. This shows Dorothy was frightened of the male nurse in Kansas. Her dreams takeover and recreate this man as an evil impatient large character.Mombie another villain who challenges Dorothy was also Nurse Wilson who kept a close eye on Dorothy in the hospital. When Dorothy attempted to escape along with Ozma Wilson finds the girls and shrieks you! This is where the dreamworld and our world of reality overlaps as we discover Wilson already recognises Ozma unnamed until we enter Oz. We are also reminded towards the end of the film that Mombie was not only imprisoned for the use of her evil powers in Oz but also in the real world.During Dorothy's adventures in Oz Aunt Emily explains the hospital was destroyed in a fire. Dr. Worley who appears as the Nome King in Oz was burned to death he tried to save his machines. Ironically the Nome King was also destroyed with the help of Billina's poisonous egg. As Aunt Em talks about it she hugs Dorothy holding her in a blanket but Dorothy's eyes tell all. It's like she already knows. She is not shocked by the burning of the hospital nor is she shocked to see a coach man driving Nurse Wilson away within a coach made like a prison cell.Not once in the film does Fairuza Balk falter in her performance. Although she is a child Dorothy is required to make responsible mature adult decisions in her quest to save the land of Oz. Even Pumpkinhead calls her Mum. She feels a responsibility to look after all her friends as she is the decisionmaker the oracle. TikTok is also a good decisionmaker but his thinking falters when it runs down.Dorothy's eyes are not unlike an adults large tired aged and allknowing.All in all I rate this film 10 out of 10. The cabinets which display Mombie's different heads still haunts me to this day. As does the vision of Mombie sleeping in her bed headless but still breathing. I can remember screaming with my friends as Mombie gets up from her bed headless bellowing DOROTHY  GALE?.....Where's my powder of life?".

TikTok is also a good decisionmaker but his thinking falters when it runs down.Dorothy's eyes are not unlike an adults large tired aged and allknowing.All in all I rate this film 10 out of 10. The cabinets which display Mombie's different heads still haunts me to this day. As does the vision of Mombie sleeping in her bed headless but still breathing. I can remember screaming with my friends as Mombie gets up from her bed headless bellowing DOROTHY  GALE?.....Where's my powder of life?";

The funny parts in the movie is when TikTok took out the Wheelers and Jack Pumkinhead's head lands upside down and he asks Why are you standing on your heads?

Some people here were impressed by the fact that they made an OZ movie dark and scary but by making scary they miss the whole point of the OZ books. I don't even care as much about the stupid mistakes like making Mombi and Princess Langwidere one person. They were both villains and I don't love that but okay I accept it. I thought that the Judy Garland version butchered the OZ series as much as humanly possible until this movie came along. At least they got the mood of OZ correct. The plot is that Dorothy's aunt and uncle put her in an institution and she escapes with the help of a mysterious blonde girl. Uncle Henry and Auntie Em would never do that. Even in th Emerald City of OZ when they are going broke and extremely worried that their niece is going insane they try to shield her from all the hardship in their lives and tell her to go in the attic and dream and say that she should go to OZ while there is so much trouble. It is nuts to think that they would put her through that. They also messed up my favorite character of all time. Princess Langwidere is vain and silly but not a malicious evil character like the one portrayed. At one point she wants to swap heads with Dorothy but it is only because she forgot and is wearing her head that is impulsive and has a bad temper. Mombi was a evil but she wasn't nearly as bad as the woman portrayed. She also had absolutely no connection to the Nome King. He was also silly. He was a villain but in the books he is a fat rollypolly little man with a huge belt that turned the entire Royal Family of Ev into ornaments. Not exactly the evilest man in the world. Also one of the best parts of the series was the second book where you find out that Mombi turned Ozma into a boy and hid her that way. The mirror thing was just so silly and they took away one of the best twists ever. These books were written during the Depression as a form of escapism. It wasn't dark it was happy. You don't mess with perfection. Why did they have to butcher the series?".

The book itself scared me I definitely found it darker than the Oz I knew. This movie might have scared me more had I seen it then. I finally saw it on the Internet just now and found it underwhelming. This can serve as a sequel to the 1939 film but it's really a separate adaptation of a public domain story.The story gets darker starting with the opening in Kansas where we have scary science and Dorothy needing to break free. When she gets to Oz how I'm not sure she finds the place in ruins which may not be pleasant to those who remember the pretty place we saw in the 1939 classic but it is interesting. The creepiest part may be a woman who keeps many heads and threatens to take Dorothy's head.Still any gripping atmosphere this movie could have had is sunk by poor special effects. This may be surprising since it came 45 years after Judy Garland's movie and the Great Depression was long gone this time but the older movie looks better than this one. The most obvious comparison would be the Scarecrow who looks terribly cheap here. It goes deeper than that however. The talking rocks and Wheelers are poor effects as well. For this reason Return to Oz won't draw you into Oz in the same way The Wizard of Oz does.".

	schema:reviewBody "Return To Oz is very much like a retread of The Wizard Of Oz with most of the major events of one film repeated in the latter. About the only significant difference is that Return To Oz while wearing its origins as a Disney production on its sleeve is a little less saccharine or sugarcoated compared to its predecessor. Not so much that it could score ten out of ten from an older audience but enough so that you could show it to audiences who have more than one digit in their age and not draw protests. Unfortunately this does not necessarily make it a good film.Whereas the cast of heroes in The Wizard Of Oz were very distinct from one another the heroes of Return To Oz are fairly generic. The plot such as it is concerns itself with a Trolllike King who comes out of the stone of one mountain. Somehow he has acquired the ruby slippers from the previous film and used them to sack the city of Oz. The populace is found turned to stone and the streets patrolled by Wheelers a bunch of ugly human types who look a lot like Johnny Rotten at a rollerdisco. The Wheelers are controlled by an evil princess who collects heads to wear while she is in turn controlled by the Nome King who I've already spoken about. The plot is very simple and by the numbers as opposed to how every new location seemed natural or spontaneous in the original. In fact there are only three or four major locations in Return To Oz and most of them are passed through in the blink of an eye.Children who have yet to see The Wizard Of Oz will not notice the most major problem with this sequel. In a nutshell it is continuity. The Dorothy shown in The Wizard Of Oz was played by Judy Garland who was about seventeen years old at the time. Disney in their endless attempt to pander to a child audience decided to make Dorothy ten years old in spite of the number of references made to six months passing since the tornado hit the Gale farm. These notsosubtle continuity faults aside the story is competently told and Fairuza Balk makes a decent fist of playing the young Dorothy.Another plus in Return To Oz is that the support cast is considerably less annoying in its perpetual perkiness. TikTok has more personality than the entire cast of The Wizard Of Oz put together while Pumpkinhead manages to be dopey without seeming insulting. Something that was utterly beyond the cast of... well you get the idea. Another plus is that we are spared the agony of the cast breaking into song every ten minutes. The only point where the film falls down is when the weight of the Disney desire to claim that they are making films suitable for everyone when in reality they are only suitable for fouryearolds becomes too much for the screenplay and actors to deal with. Quite obviously this sequel was churned out in order to make a quick buck as the minor flood of spinoffs of the time showed. Still it gets a little closer to the tone of L.

	onyx:emotionText "Return To Oz is very much like a retread of The Wizard Of Oz with most of the major events of one film repeated in the latter. About the only significant difference is that Return To Oz while wearing its origins as a Disney production on its sleeve is a little less saccharine or sugarcoated compared to its predecessor. Not so much that it could score ten out of ten from an older audience but enough so that you could show it to audiences who have more than one digit in their age and not draw protests. Unfortunately this does not necessarily make it a good film.Whereas the cast of heroes in The Wizard Of Oz were very distinct from one another the heroes of Return To Oz are fairly generic. The plot such as it is concerns itself with a Trolllike King who comes out of the stone of one mountain. Somehow he has acquired the ruby slippers from the previous film and used them to sack the city of Oz. The populace is found turned to stone and the streets patrolled by Wheelers a bunch of ugly human types who look a lot like Johnny Rotten at a rollerdisco. The Wheelers are controlled by an evil princess who collects heads to wear while she is in turn controlled by the Nome King who I've already spoken about. The plot is very simple and by the numbers as opposed to how every new location seemed natural or spontaneous in the original. In fact there are only three or four major locations in Return To Oz and most of them are passed through in the blink of an eye.Children who have yet to see The Wizard Of Oz will not notice the most major problem with this sequel. In a nutshell it is continuity. The Dorothy shown in The Wizard Of Oz was played by Judy Garland who was about seventeen years old at the time. Disney in their endless attempt to pander to a child audience decided to make Dorothy ten years old in spite of the number of references made to six months passing since the tornado hit the Gale farm. These notsosubtle continuity faults aside the story is competently told and Fairuza Balk makes a decent fist of playing the young Dorothy.Another plus in Return To Oz is that the support cast is considerably less annoying in its perpetual perkiness. TikTok has more personality than the entire cast of The Wizard Of Oz put together while Pumpkinhead manages to be dopey without seeming insulting. Something that was utterly beyond the cast of... well you get the idea. Another plus is that we are spared the agony of the cast breaking into song every ten minutes. The only point where the film falls down is when the weight of the Disney desire to claim that they are making films suitable for everyone when in reality they are only suitable for fouryearolds becomes too much for the screenplay and actors to deal with. Quite obviously this sequel was churned out in order to make a quick buck as the minor flood of spinoffs of the time showed. Still it gets a little closer to the tone of L. Frank Baum's novel and that can only be a good thing.All in all I gave Return To Oz a five out of five. Unlike the everyone loves it we say so advertising that is prevalent in trying to sell The Wizard Of Oz Disney seem to have adopted a here it is take it or leave it attitude to Return To Oz. Which is the biggest improvement I can think of.";

Ben Gazzara's depiction of Capone borders on parody at times and the film's opinion of him is unclear to say the least. It gives little insight into Capone's early years and while it sometimes has characters describing him as an animal it also depicts him as a caring almost sympathetic lover of a hardliving but lusciously softbodied flapper played by Susan Blakely. The plot takes us through Capone's life from the late teens to the midforties when riddled with syphilis his mind shot he fishes at a swimming pool and raves about the Bolsheviks to people who aren't there. It probably touches all the bases  without really telling us much  but the truth of the story it relates is perhaps open to question.

	schema:reviewBody "Ahh the 1970sThe home of the weird and unprofessional bad movies! At first I said to myself this is a movie where its problem is being poor. After a while I said to myself this is a movie where its problem is its lead actor. Then I noted that the director wasn't handling the matters well or wasn't handling the matters. Maybe at one later point I accused the script too but eventually I found out that it wasn't about many problems. It was about this movie being wholly a big problem! After the success of The Godfather  1972 then The Godfather Part II  1974 there was suddenly an intensive concern about the history of mafia with the life of the American mobsters in the 20th century's first half their families mistresses enemies and their ruling Tommyguns where a wave of followers was made yet with nothing like Godfather. Just recall The Don Is Dead  1973 Dillinger  1973 or TV ones like Honor Thy Father  1973 The Virginia Hill Story  1974. Now here's Capone  1975 the movie that will give you a good reason to hate The Godfather and its success!It looks like the 70s's exploitation movies but it isn't. It's worse. The production is totally nonexistent. For instance the sets were like something I saw tenth of times at that era's TV shows the ones that take place in the 70s's days I suspect that I saw the bar of the start of the movie in one of Starsky  Hutch's episodes before!. The shots of the assassins in their cars from the scene in which Capone was getting shot in the daylight were clearly being borrowed from another movie due to shameful difference between the visual taste of them and the ones of this movie! Thanks to the IMDb I knew that these shots were edited from another movie The St. Valentine's Day Massacre  1967 which's by the way directed by Capone's producer Roger Corman or should I say Capone's stingy producer ?!. Moreover I'm sure that some suits coats cars and perhaps machineguns were reused from The Godfather's stuff.There is no direction at all. And I mean AT ALL. Unless you think that ending every scene by immersing it into red color is directing. But even if this Steve Carver didn't do anything more. At one moment there is an officer in his office threatening Capone you are going to jail and Capone tells him that he won't since he bribed them all look at the way this scene was made as simply no effort of any kind was done it was the perfect way how not to do it. And I HATED Mr. Carver's endless closeups like he didn't learn anything about shooting but that!The script is mechanic like a version of The Godfather but after cutting everything except the assassinations scenes. So don't ask too much or ever. Nevertheless the question that I can't hold till now is why Capone's righthand man played by Stallone sold him out at last ?? I bet the movie makers themselves don't know or remember anything about it in the first place! He didn't know that the man to be worry about is the one who's beside you not in front of you isn't enough motive or convincing reason. And what was the need for this imaginary girlfriend ???! I suppose she was there just to assure that Capone wasn't gay then be killed later! Generally it is at best a tasteless docudrama about Capone written by someone maybe read 2 pages summary about the man then turned them as they were into a film!Still the main painful thing is Ben Gazzara's performance. It should be taught in acting schools and ironically I'm not kidding!. This is beyond awful. Even if an actor wanted to be deliberately bad he wouldn't be as half bad as this. Gazzara seemed like a nervous 9yearold child trying to improvise Capone so seriously being truly laughable for most of the time and horrible to embarrassing extent for the rest. Just watch him saying Poison? What kind of way to kill a man is that ?!.. Purely unforgettable whether you want to laugh your heart out or watch a man contorting his face to the max! But I can't blame the guy alone surely he was entirely clueless since he was in the hands of writing and directing that didn't give a damn or didn't give anything but a damn!Oh God I can't forget the finale it's the top of this movie's creepy crappy time. So with this shitty TVish condition I don't know how they got the nerve to show this cinematically ?? Maybe because of the female nudity of it !. What kind of movie where the best of it is the performance of the young Stallone anyway ?! But Hey. Whatever. Watch it as a spoof of Al Capone it works finely this way.. But unfortunately not for all its time!Finally a question  if Capone was still alive healthy and influential when that was released.. Do you think that he might have whacked this movie's crow?!".

Actors such as Robert De Niro Rod Steiger Jason Robards and even Eric Roberts hee hee have played Al Capone but none of them can come near the accuracy and brilliance of Ben Gazzara's Al Capone. This movie was bashed by most critics who said that this was an exploited version of the Capone story and that it was too violent and too brutal. Well wasn't Al Capone himself a violent and brutal man? He was far from being a saint I guarantee that. The cast is fantastic Sylvester Stallone in one of his first roles John Cassavettes who is always terrific and Harry Guardino  a name you may not recognize but whose face you've seen in many movies. So how can you go wrong? You can't! Capone wasn't a madefortv movie that omits violence and profanity...something a true mob movie MUST have. It was a movie that was released in theatres. It had a poster I have the original one sheet and a MPAA rating of R  Restricted. It has a reasonable length 101 mins. and a wonderful story that could be told by great actors in a realistic way  without having to worry about the rules of television. It is also the only Al Capone movie to explicitly show Capone himself going insane because of Syphilis. Unfortunately this marvelous movie is out of print and hard to find so see it if you can. You'll never see a better Capone movie....I guarantee it".

Capone played by Ben Gazzara a little more convincingly than Jason Robards in the enjoyable The St. Valentine's Day Massacre is jailed and questioned after beating up two policemen to be bailed out by Frankie Yale John Cassavetes and Johnny Torio Harry Guardino who hold a growing influence over the police department. Capone is then taken under Torio's wing as they try to distribute alcohol in Prohibitionera Chicago while trying to calm the ongoing gang wars that are getting increasingly bloody.As stated earlier don't expect The Godfather. This is a gangsters tale exploitation style. The film seems to want to tell Capone's story without getting bogged down in the details and instead going for maximum entertainment value. And it does work to a certain degree  Ben Gazzara's ludicrously overthetop performance is a lot of fun and the fact that he's a genuinely very good actor adds a bit of class to the role. But I feel Corman's earlier gangster effort The St. Valentine's Day Massacre which he directed was a lot more fun. That had a lot more going on to hold the attention while the episodic nature of this film does get a bit repetitive after a while. Also the majority of this film is not just a mere spin on the truth it's outright lies.

	schema:reviewBody "Despite giving Sly Stallone second billing after Ben Gazzara and a nice big picture on my DVD cover he is not a lead actor in this movie. Ben Gazzara Harry Guardino Susan Blackeney Yes that Susan Blackeney from Lords Of Flatbush are all listed before Sly who is listed under Starring with three other actors. Sly doesn't even appear until thirty one minutes in to it and he doesn't speak a line of dialogue until ten minutes later his part does grow as the movie enters its second half. Plot In A Paragraph Set over several years this is the story of Al Capone's rise and fall in the gangster underworld. Gazzara over acts and hams it up a lot. It's almost as if he thinks he is appearing in a spoof Capone movie. Harry Guardino is great as Johnny Torrio as is Susan Blakely I think her open crotch shot must be the first one for a leading actress in a mainstream Hollywood film. Martivn Kove is very good in his supporting role. Dick Miller has an enjoyable small role as a cop on the take too. Following on from his first good role in 'Flatbush' the previous year Sly under plays it as Frank Nitti and continues his early career with another steady supporting role.Nobody can fault Capone for its effort. It covers several decades taking several liberties with the truth along the way in a short running time but it's campy B movie quality all the way as it rushes through a lot of gangster activity. It's never dull and is quite entertaining in a trashy low budget way.".

The portrayal of Al Capone by Ben Gazzara is so broad as to be farcical apparently on purpose.There is a lot of exaggerated humor and comic antics in the film that make it seem like it wasn't meant to be taken too seriously. By contrast the 1959 Al Capone with Rod Steiger had a certain gallows humor and bleak comedy but never at the expense of the historical figures being portrayed. When Rod Steiger bellows and blusters connives and threatens you believe he's Al Capone. Gazzara seems almost to play Capone as if he were in a Saturday Night Live sketch. I saw this movie in its original release to theaters with a high degree of audience involvement. An elderly gentleman who had apparently had a few too many before the show talked to characters in the movie and gave advice and pointed out things throughout the screening climaxing with a gunfight where Al Capone was ambushed by rivals and the elderly viewer stood up in the aisle pointed his cane at the screen like a tommy gun and hollered I'll help you Al! while firing his cane at the screen. This somehow seems the appropriate spirit in which to view this film.".

Director Steve Carver working from a tough nononsense script by Howard Browne relates the absorbing story at a constant brisk pace stages the thrilling shootouts with considerable muscular aplomb and maintains a suitably gritty and hardhitting tone throughout. Moreover Carver deserves extra points for his decidedly harsh and unsentimental warts'n'all evocation of the 1920's period setting and his unsparingly graphic and equally unromanticized depiction of the more seamy and vulgar aspects of the mob. Vilis Lapenicks' cinematography makes nifty occasional use of slow motion and freeze frames. David Grisman's tuneful and jaunty score also does the trick. A solid and satisfying movie.".

In old Pokemon movies usually it took seventy minutes and have a short special episodes for kids. For this movie it does not have any short special episodes. That's why it takes one hour and forty minutes long.The drawing quality of this movie is also improved  with lots of 3D graphic  especially in Battle Towers.The sound effect is good especially the ending music  Lovely Boy. It is the first happy ending song in Pokemon movie. Maybe because of it has a happy ending unlike other movies.In Japan it is the forth popular animation movie four hundreds and twenty million dollars of tickets sold out and sold number of its DVD in the first week reached 30000 the second high number in Japan.Finally we talk back about the name. I don't think that Destiny Deoxys is not a good name. At least I can't find anything related to Deoxys' destiny. For me I think the original Japanese name Polar Night Visitor is better as the movie ended with polar night.".

It gets things back on track after the underwhelming Jirachi movie.The film returns the series to the epic scope and feel of Pokmon 2000. I loved LaRousse City as the setting. It was very colorful and creative.The story is pretty interesting. Tory being afraid of all Pokemon was a neat idea even if it got a little annoying after a while. I liked Sid and Rafe as supporting characters.Deoxys makes for an awesome antagonist. He is an interesting legendary Pokmon and he is also somewhat sympathetic as he is more misunderstood than evil.This is definitely one of the most actionpacked Pokmon movies to date. From LaRousse losing its power to the gang battling multiple Deoxyses to the exhilarating battles between Deoxys and Rayquaza to the robot blocks going haywire it really delivers some excitement.The music score is once again really good and for some reason I have a soft spot for the song This Side of Paradise. The song just gives me a really good feeling.The superfluous Munchlax scenes aside this is one of the most thoroughly enjoyable entries in the series. I'd definitely say it's in my top 5 Pokmon movies but not quite top 3. This is a very underrated film that I recommend to any Pokmon fan.RATING A".

It also have great settings and the animeexclusive Larousse City is totally oneofakind just a glimpse of it already make me want to visit it someday... if only it is a real place though! What's more amazing is that the creators of this animated feature have included lots of lovable characters in this one. Deoxys the alienlike Pokmon is mysterious and its concept is certainly amazing! I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it but all the other Pokmon are also interesting in their own ways and most of them are super adorable too!Not only the human characters and Pokmon each have their distinct personalities there are some intelligent nonhuman nonPokmon characters such as Block Bots as well. My apologies if I have used words like endearing a lot for these reviews I am reviewing all Pokmon movies you can check my profile but they have various expressions like emoji and they can perform numerous tasks including security which is just so cute. So overall Destiny Deoxys 2004 is very impressive! Yes there could be some stuffs that are mind boggling but well the Pokmon Universe is essentially a fantasy based on video games so it is actually perfectly fine if you allow it! Nothing is perfect in this world but compared to the older Pokmon films it is so much better and improved in various aspects! What's matter most is that the whole experience doesn't feel flat isn't it?Therefore I am sure you will be pleasantly entertained if you give this animated feature a chance because I am quite certain that Destiny Deoxys 2004 is one of the easiesttolove Pokmon film out there!".

Out of the crater comes Deoxys an alien Pokemon with extraordinary powers who is suddenly attacked and defeated by the fiercely territorial legendary Pokemon Rayquasa. A few years later Ash Pikachu May Max and Brock arrive at the high tech Larousse City to enter a special tournament the battle pyramid. Here the gang meet many new friends one of them a boy named Tory who is mostly afraid of Pokemon thanks to a traumatic experience he had back at the North Pole. Soon enough Deoxys having fully regenerated arrives and causes mischief as he searches for something while getting rid of anyone who gets in its way. With Rayquaza once again hot on the alien's trail Ash and company must find a way to end the madness before it's too late.The antics are raised in this movie as well as the stakes. The action scenes are more intense then usual compared to many other Pokemon flicks with a lot of great moments. All the characters are interesting especially Tory who goes through a lot of character development. The story is pretty interesting and Deoxys is a fascinating character. With an expressionless face an eerie voice that I could hear all day and amazing powers this alien is truly one of a kind. Rayquaza on the other hand is an awesome beast undeniably powerful and just looks really cool.This is a welcome edition to the Pokemon franchise. Definitely check it out. Gotta catch em' all!".

It scores at the top across the board great story great battles great music great characters and great new villains  Deoxys and Rayqueza. The opening fight between Deoxys and Rayqueza always reminds me of Godzilla my other favorite Japanese export. Deoxy's infiltration of the city is impressive as is its multiplication scene. This movie is one of the darker movies of the series hearkening back to Mewtwo Strikes Back and setting the tone for the next series Battle Frontier and would be a good watch even for someone who doesn't like Poke'mon or anime'. All in all top notch an improvement over the previous Jirachi the Wishmaker also a much more mature story. The battle at the end between the two Deoxys and Rayqueza while Ash tries to shut down the security droids is very suspenseful. Top notch!".

Some five years later I noticed Pokemon Destiny Deoxys make its U.S. debut on the WB network and I was curious as to whether or not this particular installment would be any better than its original predecessor. It wasnot that that's saying much.In the film's opening we are introduced to a young boy named Tory. His father a professor gathers data on several ice pokemon in an arctic continent with the aid of his assistant. Young Tory enjoys playing with the pokemon until the group is interrupted by a pair of monstrous aerial pokemon Rayquaza and Deoxys who are apparently in a battle to the death just above them. Chaos ensues all of the professor's equipment is destroyed and Tory cowers in fear as a stampede of ice pokemon flee directly in his path nearly trampling the boy. This brief scene sets the mood for the action that is to followin a year that takes place four years after the incident. We see real drama and character development particularly in Tory who works to overcome his fear of Pokemon both of which were entirely absent in the first Pokemon movie.We see significant improvements too in the visual quality of the film. Unlike Pokemon The First Movie Destiny Deoxys contains several visually stunning scenessimilar to scenes you'll find in other popular anime features such as Princess Mononoke. CGI for the most part is incorporated seamlessly with traditional animation.Despite these strides there are several moments throughout the film that simply do not work including the film's many attempts at humor. Amorous Brock for example becomes infatuated with the first girl he sees as he enters a new towna tired routine that has been done time and time again in the TV series as well as the first movie. In the middle of the movie there is an excruciating musical montage in which the main characters' pokemon begin laughing and dancing goofily for no apparent reason. Even the film's climax feels drawn out after a while I just wanted it to end.Pokemon fans will probably enjoy this. Nonfans may find it watchable.".

Most scenes are either Death Scenes or Stylistic Shots.  Anyway there is some technical shots but the movie does not really go into detail about the technicals of his movies.

	schema:reviewBody "A documentary about the Italian filmmaker Dario Argento who specialises in violent and bloody thrillers and phantasmagorical horror films.Dario Argento's movies are an acquired taste. You need a darkness to your psyche to begin with and you have to be willing to consider violence rendered on film as art. If not go watch a nice National Geographic documentary on giant pandas. This documentary focuses chiefly on his midperiod films Profondo RossoDeep Red Suspiria Inferno Tenebre and Phenomena but also looks at three of his earlier films  L'Uccello Dalle Piume Di CristalloThe Bird With The Crystal Plumage and the rarelyseen Il Gatto A Nove CodeThe Cat O'Nine Tails and 4 Mosche Di Velluto GrigioFour Flies On Grey Velvet as well as two movies he produced George A. Romero's Dawn Of The Dead and Lamberto Bava's Demoni. Productionwise it's shoddy  the film stock is pretty grotty the subtitles are poorlywritten Bava is referred to as Rava and none of the people or the numerous clips are introduced or placed in context. Contentwise however it's terrific  Argento's comments are truly thoughtprovoking and often bizarre there is some great behindthescenes footage particularly from Tenebre and Phenomena and the clips will satisfy gorehounds everywhere. I would have liked a little more insight into Inferno the middle of his asyetunfinished Mothers trilogy which I often think is an overlooked gem and an extremely subtle and chilling work. I love Argento's films because they are so outrageously visual and because his style is simply unique. Whatever its shortcomings this documentary is a bloodspattered window into his twisted imaginings. Shot on film by Soavi who was the assistant director on several of the movies featured and subsequently released on video. English title  Dario Argento's World Of Horror. 510".

There is no better person to present a documentary on Argento as Soavi has studied under the man as well as other great Italian legends and through his tutelage went on to be the greatest Italian horror director of his time... to see this early attempt at directing is instructive of both Argento and Soavi.The documentary was released in 1985 so it focuses on behind the scenes on Phenomena and the process by which a hornet was put to sleep with ether surgically modified and remote controlled as well as other camera tricks and special effect work. It's an interesting take on how effects were much different 25 years ago.Another reviewer opined that parts of this would work better as featurettes on the other DVDs and I absolutely agree... though of course in 1985 movies did not have special features. With the rights to many films being owned by Anchor Bay and this one by Synapse I'm unclear how that would work.The best bits are by far the interview segments with Argento where we learn that he thinks his murder scenes are beautiful how murder is erotic and sensual and how he worries that he does not have the skill to pull off his ideas. It's a very sympathetic look but also a frank one. He speaks his mind as unpopular as his views might be.If you do not know who Argento is this may not be the best introduction. But if you've seen a few of his films and want to see more this should put you in the mindset to continue your journey. Experienced fans might not find much new here especially after all these years but I have seen the bulk of his work and still found it insightful.".

	schema:reviewBody "No one can deny Dario Argento. Earning a place in horror as a pioneer while being as visually adept as Peter Jackson John Woo or David Fincher. Unfortunately his style over substance approach has limited his exposure to the European shores and to probing pesky horror fans. This could be the reason why 'Dario Argento's World of Horrors' comes off as more of a commercial than a documentary. It does have its meat with behind the scenes footage and interviews but it also comes off somewhat contrived. The interviews for instance have him talking directly to the camera expressing thoughts and reasons on various projects. While this gives a somewhat intimate approach it also looks staged and heavy handed with Dario looking like he's just talking to himself. Once more the editing is just too abrupt and distracting making it look extremely amateurish with the result being uneven pacing between interviews and selected scenes. OK this was Michele Soavi's first gig but harsh cuts and uneven progression are something an editor is hired to fix. More importantly it never really fleshes out his many film contributions but instead seems content to be Argento's argument to the world that he is a valid director. Almost like propaganda. Yuck. It's too bad because the proof is in the pudding. The more we discover about his films the more we see how inventive and influential his style is. The interesting info is just glanced over here and I wanted more. Such as his Technicolor filming of Suspiria the makeup effects in Demons or the fantastic production design for Tenebre. Footage was shown but never explained or commented on. I wanted to see more about his various styles of camera work that seems almost ripped off by contemporary films. Also you could have put aside an hour alone on his work with composer Ennio Morricone and the band Goblin. Now group this with the fact that it's somewhat dated Miami vice music and all and what you have is an interesting but uninspired 76 minutes.".

Without a clue what happened to him or what to do Daniel turns to the two boys for help.It sounds rather corny and obvious and in a way I suppose it is but by not ever playing it for laughs or being selfmocking the film creates a tone that means it all works as long as you meet it on its terms. The story is sentimental and slushy and in this way I imagine it will put many viewers off for being this way. I surprised myself by actually liking it though and finding it all rather engaging and sweet. Although I doubt he knows where Lost is going Abrams does a good job as writer to avoid clich and mush the best he can. Miner matches this by directing in a controlled manner that holds back on the sweeping music and emotion until he can actually use them.The cast work well with this approach and avoid the film becoming a soapy television movie. Gibson may not have had the best of days recently PRwise alleged drunkdriving and alleged antiSemitic remarks but here he is charming and reasonably good at the emotion. Of course he could have been better considering that when he awoke after 50 years the loss of his wife would still be fresh in his mind. Curtis is solid enough and deals with the material given her. The child support are better than I expected even if they are a bit cute in the way all Hollywood kids are. Wood works well with Gibson which I suppose is the important thing.Overall this is a solid and enjoyable romantic film that is a bit slushy and melodramatic. It avoids clich well enough but you do need to meet it on its terms and not be cynical. Not one for the diehard action fans but it is a good date movie that is gentle and balanced enough to find a mixed audience without losing touch with the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Mel Gibson starred in Forever Young in 1992 it was probably an attempt to break away from the wild man of Mad Max and Lethal Weapon. He actually proves to be quite likable as a romantic lead and makes Forever Young a sweet endearing romantic fable.In 1939 Mel plays Captain Daniel McCormick an Air Force test pilot. No stranger to danger he is willing to brave the latest experimental aircraft but he's unable to take the biggest risk of all proposing to his girlfriend Helen.Every time Daniel tries to work up the courage to pop the question he loses his bottle. So he decides to wait. Unfortunately he waits too long. Helen is run down in an accident and slips into a coma. Daniel can't live without her and decides to volunteer for a risky experiment.Daniel's best friend Harry Finley George Wendt is one of the first scientists working on cryogenics. He has yet to test his theories on a living human subject. Daniel decides to go for it where he will be placed into a capsule and frozen for a year. If Helen ever wakes up Harry wakes up Daniel.But of course things don't go the way they're supposed to. When World War II breaks out the cryogenics experiment falls through the cracks.

Staying with Nat and his mother Claire the delightful Jamie Lee Curtis Daniel tries to piece together the last 50 years.To enjoy Forever Young you will probably have to suspend disbelief quite a bit. The story itself is rather outrageous but on a simple level it's fairly enjoyable. It has more than a few shades of Back to the Future about it. In the same way Robert Zemeckis brought a Frank Capra style of storytelling to BTTF the director Steve Miner also brings a gentle benign touch to this story.The greatest discovery of all is the fact that Mel Gibson manages to make this film work. He makes for a very endearing character when he is lost in the 1990's. His amazement at the new world is played in a very understated fashion. His confusion and oldfashioned naivet are subtly incorporated into the story e.g. discovering filtered cigarettes seatbelts answering machines etc.What's nice about his performance is also the fact that Daniel was brought up in different times. He has a completely different set of values compared to the cynical attitudes of the present day. I like the scene where Daniel saves Claire from an abusive exboyfriend or when he gets to sit in the cockpit of an oldfashioned test plane.This type of story could have become very mawkish but Steve Miner manages to find just the right focus and balances events just right. Jamie Lee Curtis adds sterling support as always and she gets a lot of good scenes with Gibson.Elijah Wood also puts in an excellent performance showing incredible maturity for his age. He acts as Daniel's guide while he is in the 90's and proves invaluable in putting together what happened to Daniel's past. He plays Nat as neither too precocious or too juvenile and went on to the fame that he deserved.In some eyes Forever Young has an improbably happy ending where Daniel is reunited with Helen. But I didn't mind this time round. Probably because I was enjoying myself too much. I especially like the scene where Daniel teaches Nat to fly in his treehouse. Watch the camera angles and you sometimes feel as if they really are flying a plane.Forever Young wouldn't win any awards for originality but if they gave out awards for heartwarming stories Forever Young would definitely be up for a nomination.".

	onyx:emotionText "When Mel Gibson starred in Forever Young in 1992 it was probably an attempt to break away from the wild man of Mad Max and Lethal Weapon. He actually proves to be quite likable as a romantic lead and makes Forever Young a sweet endearing romantic fable.In 1939 Mel plays Captain Daniel McCormick an Air Force test pilot. No stranger to danger he is willing to brave the latest experimental aircraft but he's unable to take the biggest risk of all proposing to his girlfriend Helen.Every time Daniel tries to work up the courage to pop the question he loses his bottle. So he decides to wait. Unfortunately he waits too long. Helen is run down in an accident and slips into a coma. Daniel can't live without her and decides to volunteer for a risky experiment.Daniel's best friend Harry Finley George Wendt is one of the first scientists working on cryogenics. He has yet to test his theories on a living human subject. Daniel decides to go for it where he will be placed into a capsule and frozen for a year. If Helen ever wakes up Harry wakes up Daniel.But of course things don't go the way they're supposed to. When World War II breaks out the cryogenics experiment falls through the cracks.

It is a wonderful compelling story of true love a true gentleman and genuine friendship that crosses the ages. Mel Gibson's character Daniel is sensitively portrayed and the ending is incredibly moving. Gibson ably handles all the shifts in emotion and even time.

Jamie Lee Curtis was lowkey and very pleasant. I like the fact McCormick stayed true to his original woman. The film got criticized for being too unrealistic but hey it's supposed to be a fantasy story where everything is not explained. The only thing I found stretching things when it shouldn't have been was the kid Nat Cooper  Elijah Wood helping Capt. McCormick land an airplane at the end. Overall a nice touching movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a lovely sentimental love story that is refreshingly suitable for family viewing. Though not a plausible tale and despite its rather slow start it does have an engaging plot and sympathetic characters.The tale begun in 1939 revolves around a test pilot Daniel who is in love with a pretty young woman named Helen. He discovers himself alas too tongue tied to pop the matrimony question to her in a restaurant as planned. Unfortunately it appears to have been an opportunity forever lost as Helen is immediately afterward run down by a truck. Unable to bear the ongoing pain of watching his beloved in a coma he begs his scientist friend Harry to use him as a guinea pig in his risky cryogenic experiments and place him in a frozen state until Helen awakens. However World War II begins Harry is killed and plans go awry such that Daniel is not awakened until 1992 when a young boy Nat Cooper and is friend inadvertently discover his metal cryogenic tube and pretend it's a submarine. Nat and his mom Claire become Daniel's friends in his newly awakened life.Mel Gibson is very endearing in the role of Daniel who must try to untangle his regenerated life adjust to modern times find Harry and cope with ongoing grief over Helen... all while living with his new friends the Coopers. Elija Wood is suitably appealing as the young Nat and Jamie Lee Curtis gives a sympathetic portrayal of the single mom Claire whom Daniel gallantly rescues from an abusive former boyfriend. Daniel and Claire have some interesting scenes together with her cast as a possible new love interest. Actually Helen Daniel's old love from the 30's makes only brief appearances in this film.There are a number of cute scenes in the movie such as Daniel gobbling down blueberry pie in a diner booth while trying to summon the nerve to propose to Helen. It's quite amusing when Nat  his pal stumble upon Daniel's cryogenic tube and believe this 'cold man' is a regenerated dead guy whose intent is to do them harm! Nat has an adorable tree house where Daniel later gives his young protg flying lessons.Yes it has a sappy sentimental ending although I personally loved it! It's so moving when Daniel is reunited with his long lost love now elderly but still lovely in a dramatic scene with a seaside background. He gets the chance to propose to her that he missed 50 years earlier and they can finally live happily ever after...however long or short a time that may be. The movie teaches us a lesson to seize the moment and never leave words left unsaid to loved ones especially in affairs of the heart.".

It turns out however that he lies dormant until 1992 being accidentally awakened with a boy's jacket in hand. This starts a rather amusing and interesting walk through the streets and a reunion with the boy who with the aid of his mother played spectacularly by Jamie Lee Curtis help him on his search to untangle his past  bringing him to the sudden realization that true love can't wait.  This film has it all  drama action romance bits of humor a wellwritten script a wonderful cast spectacular scenery and most of all a gorgeous Mel who plays his role of the daring young test pilot to a tee. It's a wonderful film to see especially if you're a true romantic at heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "FOREVER YOUNG in my opinion is an excellent drama that will warm your heart and stay with you eternally. When Daniel Mel Gibson got thawed out in 1992 I was really shocked. This was because he met and fell in love with Claire Jamie Lee Curtis. It was sad he had just lost his girlfriend Isabel Glaser in 1939 though. I also enjoyed seeing George Wendt Harry too. The moment I found out he was in this I was taken aback. If you ask me the performances were good the direction was excellent and the cast was perfectly chosen. Now in conclusion I highly recommend this excellent drama that will warm your heart and stay with you eternally to any Mel Gibson or Jamie Lee Curtis fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a feel good time so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it.".

Bless my lucky stars I was wrong. Mel Gibson is frozen by Norm from Cheers after his girlfriend goes into a coma. He wakes up in 1992 he slept in 1939 to a whole new world. No sappiness and Mel Gibson wasn't even sucking as hard as he tends to suck see What Women Want for really hard sucking.I really liked this film it kept me from going to sleep on time. You'll like it too and maybe even more if you watch it with a date because it's really about how love lasts forever. They say diamonds last forever but those materialistic bastards wouldn't know real love if it woke up from a 50year slumber!!!!

	schema:reviewBody "A very touching film because of some extremely sentimental and poignant elements. The girl that holds your heart and to whom you cannot propose crosses a road and gets hit by a truck. Coma irreversible they say. Better get frozen for later than live through this death. Frozen by some doctor who dies and leaves you behind and you are abandoned in a hangar. A couple of naughty boys revive you and then the real nightmare starts. They all believe you are nuts of course except the mother of one of the boys a nurse by profession he saves from an exwhatever who wants to rape her. Finding your identity after 53 years in ice that's hard. But there is a slight problem with Dorian Gray's picture. You are the picture and your age shows fast. Will he find and marry his sweetheart and is she still alive? Will he escape the cops and the doctors? Who knows? What will the little boy who revived him do? Nothing to say here. Just keep in mind this film is a piece of romantic beauty and that's all. The visit of the air force base I remember I must have done it in the same period around 1990 one or two years more or less. That was a funny experience and I would have loved meeting Mel Gibson in one of the jets. But well no luck boy. Mel Gibson is nothing but a celluloid baby who has no real existence and his life is a dream and in this case the dream could have turned into a nightmare. Mel Gibson is a very flexible actor and manages romantic situations or situations with kids just as well as he does mad situations with Max and his tribe not to speak of the mythic religious rewriting of the passion or the whole cosmos. There is something like a certain Connors and Schwarzenegger in that Gibson even if he is a difficult spouse to get a divorce from.

Great action scenes converge with a truly touching story. One of the more subtly sad and warming often lost substories is when it is revealed that Daniel's best friend Harry died trying to save him during a fire which ultimately lead to the 'Experiment' being lost in time. Everything about this story moves along at a wonderful pace...all the pieces believably fall into their alloted time line yet there is enough mystery and surprise to keep it interesting and riveting.

All the characters are just great and they were all extremely likable as well plus Mel Gibson and Jamie Lee Curtis are simply amazing in this!. this should be higher then 6.0 in my opinion and I don't see why so many people dislike this movie it's very charming sweet creative and everything you could want a romantic comedy! plus the ending was just great and left me with a smile on my face. Elijah Wood is excellent as the kidand was really likable and I thought this was very well written and made as well plus Mel Gibson's aging make up was really cool!. It's one of Mel's most underrated films and Elijah has one of the funniest lines in the movie to a girl Bitch'in nail polish it looks like blood plus it has some very surprising moments in the film as well. It even has a little bit of SciFi in it! and it's good natured as well plus the opening was cool as well. This is an awesome charming little film that's very underrated with a creative story and wonderful performances and I say its a must see!. The Direction is great!. Steve Miner does a great! job here with really good camera work cool angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is wonderful!. Mel Gibson is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable funny charming had excellent chemistry with Jamie Lee CurtisIsabel Glasser and Elijah Wood had lots of charisma and had a really cool character as he looked pretty comfortable with his role! Gibson Rules!!!!!. Jamie Lee Curtis is also amazing as always she is beautiful funny  had some wonderful scenes with Mel Gibson also had a cool character and it was great to see her work with Mel! she was amazing Jamie Lee Rules!!!!!!!!. Elijah Wood is fantastic as the kid he was funny and and really likableits too bad that he is not credited enough for this film since its dwarfed by all the attention he gets in Lord of The Ring films. Isabel Glasser is great as Helen she had very good chemistry with Gibson and was quite pretty I liked her. George Wendt is cool in his role as Gibson's best friend I really liked him. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!.  out of 5".

I wouldn't call it just a horror film as it had a bit of everything in it. For oldschool Hollywood filmbuffs it was ripe with numerous knowing film references intercutting snippets of features where our smugly weedy protagonist a multilayered skincrawling performance by Dennis Christopher begins to confuse fictional with reality after everything in his life begins to crumble as his realises there's only one way to escape it. He begins roleplaying characters and scenes with nothing but conviction. While these sequences were creative it just seems to take away from the underlining horror.The dark humour seems to fit but the script is sorely underwritten due to some stringy subplots mainly that of Thomason's character that are poorly thought out. Not that they couldn't added anything but they could've if a little more exposition was spent on them. Instead they feel trivial. The backdrop is interestingly displayed with the director Vernon Zimmerman using genuine locations where it cooked up some gritty atmospherics. Some moments were kind of overdone when the unstable homicidal nature and identity crises kicks in when the torment gets out of hand but it keeps you highly involved. I didn't find it particularly suspenseful other than the climax but the way it's organised shows enough drive and originality.Other than Christopher the rest of the cast featuring the likes of Norman Burton Tim Thomason Eve Brent Morgan Paull and John Steadman are mildly okay. A perky Linda Kerridge the Marilyn Monroe lookalike has a good screen presence and there's a small role for Mickey Rourke. Craig Safan's smoking uncanny score works a treat.".

Dennis Christopher plays Eric Binford a young man living with his crippled domineering aunt and who works as a studio film delivery boy for a living. The nerdlike Eric gets teased and abused by his aunt his nagging boss and his coworkers. Seeing that this is a horror film you know it's only a matter of time before Eric goes over the deep end and beings killing people but the twist is he kills them by copying various death scenes from his favorite movies. With his studio connections he dresses up as his favorite characters Dracula the Mummy etc. for the killings.Although we can relate to Eric Binford as a troubled soul his character is not very sympathetic for it's not hard to see the reason why nobody likes Eric. With the exception that he knows a lot about movies underneath he is just a hollow chainsmoking illtempered clod. A subplot which includes a police psychologist tracking Eric's moves comes off as excess baggage and even the psychologist himself is not likeable either.  In fact with the exception of the actress who plays the Marilyn Monroe lookalike every character in the film is annoying obnoxious loud selfish meanspirited and that hurts the film.I think it could have been a lot better if it was made by more professional filmmakers other than talented amateurs. It was a good idea for a movie but not well made. Although the storyline is good some of the plotlines are not believable the violence and special effects for the killings mostly shootings look cheep and phoney and the editing is poor. But worth a look if you're a fan of the movies and just want to see some clips of your favorite Bmovies oafers and classic horror films.  This is Dennis Christopher's show and he takes hold of it and doesn't let go. Probably his finest hourandahalf.".

He soon begins to act out the violence he sees on the big screen and people close to him soon die.  Although the premise for the film is original and innovative the film does have some budgetary constraints and suffers from a weak overall plot.  Notwithstanding the pedestrian direction and amateurish performances in general the film does have a likable quality to it and does pay tribute to some great films while Christopher turns himself into various characters.  Christopher does a rather good job in his demanding role a role that really needs more flesh to it.  The rest of the cast is rather blah with Tim Thomerson really giving an excrutiatingly bad performance as a psychologist working with the cops.  Linda Kerridge stands out for her beauty if nothing else as an Australian Marilyn Monroe lookalike. Christopher stands into such roles as Richard Widmark's killer in Kiss of Death Dracula the Mummy a very poorly shot and conceived bit Hoppalong Cassidy and Laurence Olivier in The Prince and the Showgirl.  For those of you with a good background in film the movie takes on a different level of meaning and is fun as a homage piece.".

This movie is of the third kind It is a sad character study of a young man called Eric who spends all his time watching movies and finding out trivia about them. He has no apparent friends and he lives with his wheelchair bound aunt who really is at odds with him. The film is very original and has a incredible lead performance from the actor playing Eric. They cops on the other hand are all really badly done I just couldnt wait till they left the screen and every time they appeared again I grimly waited for there departure. Most of the other actors do quite a good job in this film and it also sports a young Mickey Rouke in what I think was his first film role. I would recommend this film only to horror fans The film references the characters and the direction are all tuned to giving any horror fan a good time for their money. Its not for everyone.

You will see snippets of many films here all will be readily recognized. You will see Dennis Christopher's character slip deep into psychosis and take on the personas and look.. of many of these characters in order to wreak his revenge. The more you know about old movies the more you will get out of this film. Yes it's essentially a slasher movie but this goes beyond the genre to get deep into the head of a killer.

	schema:reviewBody "I'd agree that Fade to Black works better in theory than in this actual execution. It should have been more fun and admittedly the hook IS quite delicious what if an unstable film geek murdered those who mocked him while dressed up as his favourite cinematic characters?The main problem is that our antihero Eric Binford Dennis Christopher an employee for a film advertising firm is not sympathetic in the slightest. This isn't a character whom you feel sorry for and root for so much as you want to smack him around. He's an illtempered whiny wimp who attaches way too much importance to his knowledge of movie trivia.Then again this may well have been the intention of writer  director Vernon Zimmerman. One of my Internet acquaintances once described Fade to Black as showing the dark side of being a film geek. Eric seemingly can't relate to anybody on a normal level instead thinking entirely in cinematic terms. As unlikable as Eric may be however it's hard to say whether the problem is in the character as written or any ineptitude on Christophers' part.Another thing that doesn't help are the scenes with the normally entertaining Tim Thomerson as a liberal minded police shrink. The character is a dolt and one doesn't want to root for HIM either even if he is sympathetic to Erics' plight.It's still a fairly enjoyable experience at least for any cinephile. Amid all the movie references clips from classics such as White Heat and Creature from the Black Lagoon are edited in with ease. And it's cool to see Eric dress up as Dracula The Mummy and Hopalong Cassidy etc. while in the act of doing away with his nemeses.The good supporting cast includes Norman Burton Morgan Paull James Luisi Eve Brent John Steadman Marcie Barkin Peter Horton and a swaggering young Mickey Rourke. The major bright spot is Australian beauty Linda Kerridge a Marilyn Monroe lookalike who actually gets named Marilyn in the movie. As Erics' would be girlfriend she shines.A nice music score by Craig Safan and a rousing face off on top of Manns' Chinese Theatre are also highlights.Six out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Hits close to home. Too close.";
	schema:reviewBody "A movie about a socially awkward totally obsessed film fan whose love of old films borders on the obsessive with nights filled with movie after movie after movie? This one hits a little too close to home.Eric Binford Dennis Christopher Breaking Away works in a Los Angeles film distributor warehouse by day and watches movies by night. He' the guy I was referring to earlier  someone so into movies he gets bullied by his family and coworkers. And when he meets Marilyn O'Connor who looks like Marilyn Monroe he finally finds someone whose looks are similar to the movie ideal that life does not always achieve. Or maybe he's just so crazy that when he sees her he goes into a fantasy fugue state and only sees what his brain will allow him to see.Somehow Eric is able to ask her out but she stands him up by accident. This makes him go completely out of his mind transforming himself into various film icons to destroy his enemies.First he reenacts Kiss of Death by pushing his Aunt Stella who is really his mother down the steps showing up to her funeral as Tommy Udo the role Richard Widmark played in the film. No one gets it. No one has seen the movies that Eric loves. There is no one to discuss them with. They can't even put her grave next to Marilyn Monroe's grave in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetary.Eric then becomes Count Dracula attending a midnight showing of Night of the Living Dead. Eric then goes to Marilyn's house in a scene that's taken from Psycho. She screams he drops his pen into the water and the ink becomes the blood. I only wanted your autograph he yells as he runs.Eric then goes back to find a hooker who had been rude to him. He chases her she falls and dies then he drinks her blood. Obviously Eric has not seen Martin. Actually the way this scene is intercut with scenes from old black and white horror films I am certain that the makers of this film have seen Romero's vampire film.Now that Eric has gone this far why not dress up as Hopalong Cassidy and kills off RichieMickey Rourke in an early role a coworker who bullies him. Oh yeah  Tim Thomerson is a criminal psychologist who is working with a policewoman they're having sex because 1980 and all to find what he believes is a serial killer. The big problem is that his captain wants all the glory for himself.Eric talks to his aunt as if she were still alive then after watching Halloween producer Irwin Yablans also produced that film he pleasures himself to a photo of Marilyn Monroe.Eric's dream has been to own his own movie theater and to make his own movie. He tells a sleazeball named Gary Bially his idea Alabama and the Forty Thieves and you get the feeling not much good can come of it.Eric's boss fires him and won't allow him back into work to get his posters. As his everyday self even when trying to talk like a movie character Eric is impotent. But when he's dressed as The Mummy he can frighten his boss into a heart attack.After seeing Gary Bially on a talk show talking up the movie Eric created as his own Eric shows up to the produer's brithday party. Dressed as James Cagney's character from White Heat he fires a submachine gun at everyone in the room before killing the man who stole from him.The cops are on to Eric but he's hired Marilyn for a photo shoot and is all set to reenact The Prince and the Showgirl when Thomerson's character arrives. Eric runs to Mann's Chinese Theater and makes it to the roof before dying just like Cagney in White Heat yelling Made it ma! Top of the world!Writer and director Vernon Zimmerman also created Unholy Rollers but this movie is way beyond that. It shows how only seeing the world as the movies can be a danger to yourself and everyone else.

	onyx:emotionText "A movie about a socially awkward totally obsessed film fan whose love of old films borders on the obsessive with nights filled with movie after movie after movie? This one hits a little too close to home.Eric Binford Dennis Christopher Breaking Away works in a Los Angeles film distributor warehouse by day and watches movies by night. He' the guy I was referring to earlier  someone so into movies he gets bullied by his family and coworkers. And when he meets Marilyn O'Connor who looks like Marilyn Monroe he finally finds someone whose looks are similar to the movie ideal that life does not always achieve. Or maybe he's just so crazy that when he sees her he goes into a fantasy fugue state and only sees what his brain will allow him to see.Somehow Eric is able to ask her out but she stands him up by accident. This makes him go completely out of his mind transforming himself into various film icons to destroy his enemies.First he reenacts Kiss of Death by pushing his Aunt Stella who is really his mother down the steps showing up to her funeral as Tommy Udo the role Richard Widmark played in the film. No one gets it. No one has seen the movies that Eric loves. There is no one to discuss them with. They can't even put her grave next to Marilyn Monroe's grave in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetary.Eric then becomes Count Dracula attending a midnight showing of Night of the Living Dead. Eric then goes to Marilyn's house in a scene that's taken from Psycho. She screams he drops his pen into the water and the ink becomes the blood. I only wanted your autograph he yells as he runs.Eric then goes back to find a hooker who had been rude to him. He chases her she falls and dies then he drinks her blood. Obviously Eric has not seen Martin. Actually the way this scene is intercut with scenes from old black and white horror films I am certain that the makers of this film have seen Romero's vampire film.Now that Eric has gone this far why not dress up as Hopalong Cassidy and kills off RichieMickey Rourke in an early role a coworker who bullies him. Oh yeah  Tim Thomerson is a criminal psychologist who is working with a policewoman they're having sex because 1980 and all to find what he believes is a serial killer. The big problem is that his captain wants all the glory for himself.Eric talks to his aunt as if she were still alive then after watching Halloween producer Irwin Yablans also produced that film he pleasures himself to a photo of Marilyn Monroe.Eric's dream has been to own his own movie theater and to make his own movie. He tells a sleazeball named Gary Bially his idea Alabama and the Forty Thieves and you get the feeling not much good can come of it.Eric's boss fires him and won't allow him back into work to get his posters. As his everyday self even when trying to talk like a movie character Eric is impotent. But when he's dressed as The Mummy he can frighten his boss into a heart attack.After seeing Gary Bially on a talk show talking up the movie Eric created as his own Eric shows up to the produer's brithday party. Dressed as James Cagney's character from White Heat he fires a submachine gun at everyone in the room before killing the man who stole from him.The cops are on to Eric but he's hired Marilyn for a photo shoot and is all set to reenact The Prince and the Showgirl when Thomerson's character arrives. Eric runs to Mann's Chinese Theater and makes it to the roof before dying just like Cagney in White Heat yelling Made it ma! Top of the world!Writer and director Vernon Zimmerman also created Unholy Rollers but this movie is way beyond that. It shows how only seeing the world as the movies can be a danger to yourself and everyone else. Eric goes from shy and withdraw to dark and mean by the end of the movie as he slowly becomes a new character. I wonder what he would have thought about the movie that they made his life into?";

Linda Kerridge Marilyn gives an OK performance as the centre of Eric's obsession but she kind of falls apart at the end but she was beautiful. and it's also worth pointing out is that we get a young Mickey Rourke here in a minor role and does alright in his small amount of screen time another big star making they're mark in a slasher before going on to bigger success.All in all Fade To Black is not as brilliant or memorable as it could of been and this could have been up there with some of the other 80's slasher greats Friday The 13th My Bloody Valentine House On Sorority Row Happy Birthday To Me but sadly due to the many faults this just becomes average.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fade to Black' is movie about a guy who watches lots of movies and kills a bunch of people and the cop who thinks movies make people want to kill a bunch of people. There are also several characters who watch lots of movies and don't want to kill anyone. One of these characters is played by Mickey Rourke who plays a guy who knows everything about Casablanca. Since this is a movie that has Mickey Rourke playing a guy who knows everything about Casablanca you can be sure it's not too credible.What it is is damn unappealing. Dennis Christopher plays the unpleasant Eric Binford a miserable twerp who is bad at his job and makes everyone around him unhappy. Dennis Christopher is a mighty fine actor as he makes Eric's every movement sickening and his every word sound repulsive. It's an amazing performance but ironically it's so convincing that I never ever want to see another movie with Christopher in it. Christopher's Eric is obviously disturbed and seems headed for a homicidal outburst from frame one. He happens to enjoy movies and when he kills he dresses up like movie characters. He could have easily been a music fan killing people while reciting pop music lyrics or he could have been a sports fan and offed people with various types of sporting equipment but for the purposes of this movie's message movies provide this killer with his MO.Eric gets a date with a girl that looks exactly like Marilyn Monroe. How? By telling her how much like Marilyn Monroe she looks. She probably hears that about sixty times a day but somehow hearing it from this railthin oily crazyeyed sociopath charms her. It's amusing to note that in a movie full of old movie clips there is not one frame of Monroe despite the fact that Eric is obsessed with the actress. It's obvious that they couldn't get the rights to any of her movies.In another ridiculous sequences Eric is hitchhiking and is picked up by a powerful movie executive. Eric pitches his movie idea and the producer loves it although it's about as high concept as a Hal Needem flick. The producer gives Eric his number but before Eric can call the producer is being interviewed on live TV and taking credit for the amazing plot of Alabama and the Forty Thieves'. Eric calls his number and somehow directly reaches the producer on the TV show set right as the interview wraps. I'm tempted to think that this is not a realistic portrayal of rich Hollywood producers.What the hell is this movie supposed to be? It's not funny there's no action and there's not enough substance for it to be a drama. I guess it's supposed to be a horror movie because Eric kills people but it's not particularly scary. In one scene he dresses like a mummy and gives a guy a heart attack. In another he dresses like Hopalong Cassidy and shoots someone. It's a given that if the killer in a horror movie uses a gun he's not scary. Michael Myers or Jason wouldn't unless it's a harpoon gun or something. If it is supposed to be a horror movie its alienating horror fans by being so antimovies. They should have gotten a fun actor like Clint Howard to star and tried to make this fun instead of the grating insipid yawnfest it is. Boo!".

He spends his free time obsessively watching the classics of Hollywood's bygone era chainsmoking and ignoring the nagging of his abusive aunt. After meeting an aspiring actressMarilyn Monroe lookalike Eric falls deeper into his delusions of cinematic grandeur and begins executing his enemies just like he sees in the movies.Confused social commentary or perhaps just a cleverly written metanarrative for modern horror cinema Fade to Black is an all around treat that caters to anyone who considers themselves a cinephile. Part horror film and part psychological drama the film oscillates between Eric's daytoday life struggles and the grim reenactments he begins making of his favorite film scenes. Although a low budget picture the cinematography here is classy and the camera picks up on the glamorous facade of Los Angeles and juxtaposes it with its underbelly of working class citizens which parallels with Eric's internal struggle. Dennis Christopher's neurotic performance is key here as he exemplifies the role of the excessive dreamer. Part of the film's success in connecting to the audience is the ways in which Eric reminds us of ourselves we are all dreamers some more than others but his internal struggle as it manifests into real life theatrical performance reveals a bit about our own dreams and how they square up with our realities hopefully with not quite as horrific of consequences. An innocent and plucky performance by Linda Kerridge as the Marilyn Monroe lookalikeobject of affection is a memorable counterpart to Christopher and unfolds as a postmodern Marilyn phantasm of Eric's delusions. The understated and downbeat conclusion does not lend the film a feel good tag by any means but is there any other way for it to end? Fade to Black is a film made by dreamers for dreamers but its protagonist's plight is universalwe all have the makings of the perpetual underdog. Although the vast majority of us have the better sense and dignity to not act upon our destructive fantasies there is a cathartic and appropriately voyeuristic element to watching someone live out that which is internalized in a free society. After all we are not the owners of our fantasies or our desires they are the owners of usand there's a little Eric Binford in all of us too whether we want to admit it or or not. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. This one has been on my radar since the Sundance Festival and all the raves about Elizabeth Olsen's performance. After attending a screening last evening I find myself at a loss to adequately describe not just her stunning turn but also this unusual film from writerdirector Sean Durkin.On the surface this sounds like just another movie peeking inside a creepy cult that brainwashes and psychologically and physically abuses women and is led by a charismatic and creepy religious style figurehead. There are many similarities to the Mansonfamily story of which much has been published but Mr. Durkin takes the film in a much different and very creative direction by concentrating on what happens to Martha Olsen after she escapes the cult.In the QA Durkin states he did much research and found the most fascinating story to be that of a cult escapee and what she went through during her first three weeks of freedom. Martha sneaks out early one morning and places a panic call to her older sister whom she hasn't communicated with in two years. Settling in to the lake house with big sis and new brotherinlaw it becomes quite obvious that Martha doesn't know how to fit in society and has absolutely no interest in discussing her recent past.The sister is played very well by Sarah Paulson and her husband is Hugh Dancy so very good in Adam. This seemingly normal yuppie couple is trying to do right by Martha but the fits of paranoia outbursts of anger and societal goofs are just too much for them.The genius of this film is in the story telling. The cinematic toggling between today and moments of time at the cult farm house leads the viewer right into the confused mind of Martha. We don't get much back story but it's obvious she was ripe for cult world when she was chosen. We see how Patrick the quietly charismatic leader sings her a song and steals her heart ... she wants so much to belong. We also see how she bonds with the other women at the farm house and ends up in a situation that seems to snap her out just enough so she finds the strength to leave. The editing of scenes between these two worlds in outstanding and serve to keep the viewer glued to the screen.Last year I raved about an independent film called Winter's Bone. I chose it as one of the year's best and it ended with some industry award recognition. I am not willing to say this film is quite at that level but I will say that the younger sister of the Olsen twins Elizabeth delivers an incredible first feature film performance and Sean Durkin deserves an audience for his first feature film as writerdirector. Another bond between the two indies is that John Hawkes plays the cult leader Patrick and Hawkes was a standout in Winter's Bone.There will undoubtedly be some debate about whether this is cutting edge independent filmmaking or just another snooty arthouse mindmesser. All I can say is I hope the film grabs enough audience for the debate to matter ... it deserves it.".

This seemingly normal yuppie couple is trying to do right by Martha but the fits of paranoia outbursts of anger and societal goofs are just too much for them.The genius of this film is in the story telling. The cinematic toggling between today and moments of time at the cult farm house leads the viewer right into the confused mind of Martha. We don't get much back story but it's obvious she was ripe for cult world when she was chosen. We see how Patrick the quietly charismatic leader sings her a song and steals her heart ... she wants so much to belong. We also see how she bonds with the other women at the farm house and ends up in a situation that seems to snap her out just enough so she finds the strength to leave. The editing of scenes between these two worlds in outstanding and serve to keep the viewer glued to the screen.Last year I raved about an independent film called Winter's Bone. I chose it as one of the year's best and it ended with some industry award recognition. I am not willing to say this film is quite at that level but I will say that the younger sister of the Olsen twins Elizabeth delivers an incredible first feature film performance and Sean Durkin deserves an audience for his first feature film as writerdirector. Another bond between the two indies is that John Hawkes plays the cult leader Patrick and Hawkes was a standout in Winter's Bone.There will undoubtedly be some debate about whether this is cutting edge independent filmmaking or just another snooty arthouse mindmesser. All I can say is I hope the film grabs enough audience for the debate to matter ... it deserves it.";

	schema:reviewBody "In first time director Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene Martha Elizabeth Olsen a young woman in her early twenties joins a commune in a wooded area in upstate New York and endures psychological and sexual abuse at the hands of charismatic leader Patrick John Hawkes. Patrick is a Charles Manson lookalike who calls Martha Marcy May all women must use the name Marlene when answering the phone. Nothing is said about the reason the commune exists or what its philosophy may be other than Patrick's misinterpretation of the Buddhist word Nirvana and his remark that death is but a continuation not an end. We are not told the circumstances that led Martha to join the group but we do know that her parents are deceased and that her relationship with her older sister Lucy Sarah Paulson has been strained.In the commune women's role is subservient. They work in the garden and prepare the food but are allowed to eat only after the men are finished. They have no beds but sleep on mattresses on the floor in the same room. Their initiation is to be given drugs and brought to Patrick's room for sex. Apparently the house has many babies but it is unclear who takes care of them. Although it is possible even probable that fringe groups such as these do exist and that the director may have personal knowledge of them the members of the commune as depicted in the film seem little more than dehumanized caricatures of how some think freelove hippies should look and act.Without explanation Martha suddenly leaves the commune and escapes into the surrounding woods reaching town though followed by Patrick's assistant Watts Brady Corbet. Strangely she goes to a restaurant in open view and even more puzzling Watts makes no attempt to restrain her and bring her back to the commune odd behavior for a cult that doesn't hesitate to resort to murder. Somehow Martha finds the inner resources to call her sister who brings her to their upscale lake house where she and her husband Ted Hugh Dancy live. It is clear almost immediately that Martha is having trouble reconnecting with society but she is apparently too traumatized to communicate with Lucy or Ted about her present emotions recent past or plans for the future. The film continues on parallel tracks flashing back to scenes from the commune and her life with her sister. The reason she left the commune becomes clearer when a flashback depicts a home invasion in which an innocent man is murdered. Martha's behavior at Lucy's home is unconventional to say the least. She swims in the nude and inappropriately climbs into bed with Lucy and Ted when they are making love. She fears that she is being tracked down by cult members but it is not clear whether this is real or imagined. Martha's trajectory continues downward but no one seems to be able to get a handle on the situation.There is no intervention by the family when it is clearly required no growth or adjustment on Martha's part and not a single moment of sunlight lightening the film's dark mood. There is also no evidence that her sister or her husband have the empathy to create a space safe enough for her to communicate. In a home seemingly shut off from the outside world with no television or Internet to be seen and no thought of contacting a counselor or psychologist all Lucy and Ted can do is to shout repeatedly What's wrong with you? There's something wrong with her until it becomes risible. Ultimately Ted and Lucy decide to act but it may be too late. In an ambiguous ending Martha's fate is left open for the viewer to interpret.Although the performances by Elizabeth Olsen and John Hawkes are outstanding character development is not one of the film's strong points. Though it is billed as a psychological character study Durkin does not provide enough insight into Martha's character philosophy or motives for us to identify with or care about what her fate may be. Martha Marcy May Marlene is a psychological thriller that is beautifully performed and at times gripping but ultimately does not seem to have much point other than to tell us that destructive cults are welldestructive that they mess with your mind and that failure to talk about them afterwards can mess up your head even worse.".

It left a very bad taste in my mouth.This is one of those lazy films that rather then entertain the audience with intrigue and then finally a climax uses the viewers investment against them and pisses them off to get them to talk about the movie after it's over. Writing a movie with it's buzz in mind rather then it's context shows how much integrity the director has. For that reason I say don't waste your time with this film because most regular film goers will feel betrayed and disappointed that the movie builds up to literally nothing.The main protagonist was pretty decent I must admit but when you go over the entirety of the movie it becomes pretty clear that it accomplished very little always teasing that it had more but then coming up completely short.

Also John Hawkes as the cult leader was played very well too. Sadly noone else acts particularly well but a lot of that is because their parts are even worse.

Firstly she goes to great lengths to run away from the cult  hide in the forest to avoid the people chasing her yet she decides to go to the local burger bar in the town just down the road. Firstly where does she get the money and secondly  when one of the guys from the cult finds her why is he content to just leave her there? All very bizarre.There are so many jumps back and forth that it's hard to work out any kind of timeline as to what's going on. I get that she doesn't know if she's remembering or imagining and that's good but some sort of hint at a timeline would have been helpful.The film lacked any kind of sense that it was going anywhere after the first 15 minutes... she escapes and goes to live with her sister until her and her husband get bored when they take her to an asylum  except she appears to be being followed by the cult leader or is this just her imagination?... there's no ending no progression and just a feeling of being no wiser at the end of the film than at the beginning and there was no sense of caring for the characters.

Yes they tromp after her in the woods and she successfully hides. Yay! Lizzy escapes from the cult but then she thinks it's wise to go into the town right outside where the cult is located. Oh Lizzy... why did you do that to us? What were you thinking? Don't you know they KILL people and will probably kill you if they find you? You should go further to a different town or call for help immediately before you risk being caught! You never want to eat for the rest of the movie why bother going to a restaurant barely eating anything and risk being caught? Anyway she decides to eat at this restaurant. Then OF COURSE one of the guys from the cult finds her chomping on some food at this restaurant. HOWEVER for some unknown reason he has a short conversation with her and then he just allows her to walk. His motive you would think as an evil violent killer would be to either kidnap her again or follow her back to where she's taking refuge. But neither of those things happen. No it takes a curious phone call from the Lizzy back to the cult about 1.5 hrs into the 3 hour feeling movieI get it she was a teacher and a leader with the cult and now she is being harassed by her sister's husband for being weirdbefore the question is asked will the cult be able to find her? And what will they do? That question seriously should have been asked from the second she appeared at that house.The illogical nature of the film continues on and on. Motives confound. Some of the writing is painful. The cinematography which is laudedI agree the framing and transitions are greathad some major issues with color and contrast in a lot of scenes. It didn't seem like an intentional creative mistake just bad camerawork.The film is divided into 2 parts 1 scenes in the cult and 2 Lizzy in the care of her sister. Back and forth. Back and forth. No real development. I wish this were based on a true story then I think Durkin would have had a bit more to go off of and the story would have felt believable. Instead he has nothing but glimpses.They say this film is filled with dread. But in order to have dread you need to care for the characters. And what is this about Lizzy Olson's amazing performance? She plays plain Jane and then crazy Jane. There isn't much middle ground there is no devolution into madness. There's just normal and madness. It's just 2 notes played repeatedly over and over. There's nothing to care for.Above all implausibility and a two note script was the worst part the relationship between the 2 sisters in the out of the cult parts of the movie. It was the same monotony over and over and over again. Interesting setup sister now crazy escapes from cult and acts really weird and she's now in her sister and husband's care. She acts weird and her sister and husband have no idea what to do with her. But there's no real payoff or development. It's just like... sis is acting weird. Husband THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER. Ya of course there's something wrong with her maybe you should take her to see a specialist asap or maybe contact authorities. She's obviously the victim of a crime and has been abused and guess what? Maybe YOUR LIVES ARE AT RISK TOO because you have crazy here. Who knows who may be looking for her? People who come out of bad relationships don't act like they were victims of some horrible crime unless they were. Anyway logical thoughts didn't go through ANYONE'S heads in this film. I think the most logical thought was on the nature of death brought by John Hawkes that no one dies that death is just a transfer of life to an alternate reality that no one dies. And unfortunately the same thing was true with my 2 hours sucked into the vortex of time transferred to the MMMM Gods. My 2 hours is gone from me but someone was happy my fanny was in the seatit fed someone's ego.The redeeming qualities John Hawkes is amazing. His performance of the song Marcy is haunting I want a recording of that and overall what he brings is a huge takeaway. I want to watch Winter's Bone again. Brady Corbet is incredible. He needs to be in more movies. He played opposite Joseph Gordon Levitt in Mysterious Skin and I'm surprised his career didn't take like JGL's has done. I wish the film had more of those guys but it wouldn't have been the same movie. It may have actually been good. The premise is pretty kickass. The trailer is sweet. It made me excited for the movie. The sex scenes were well done and messed up. Basically every scene with Hawkes was excellent and most scenes with Corbet were good. The transitions between the two realities were handled well and made you feel a sense of disorientation.210 For the love of God don't get sucked up into the hype and spend 10 and 2 hours of your time or if you bring a date pay to drive there get some popcorn spend like 2530 on this movie. It's not worth it. Disappointing.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS THROUGHOUT So you have a violent murderous cult that kills innocent kittens and innocent people too! that barely cares when one of its members escapes Lizzy Olson. Yes they tromp after her in the woods and she successfully hides. Yay! Lizzy escapes from the cult but then she thinks it's wise to go into the town right outside where the cult is located. Oh Lizzy... why did you do that to us? What were you thinking? Don't you know they KILL people and will probably kill you if they find you? You should go further to a different town or call for help immediately before you risk being caught! You never want to eat for the rest of the movie why bother going to a restaurant barely eating anything and risk being caught? Anyway she decides to eat at this restaurant. Then OF COURSE one of the guys from the cult finds her chomping on some food at this restaurant.

The non linear flashback plot renders the film incomprehensible as it approaches its non ending. The non ending has become so de rigueur these days.

	schema:reviewBody "Moments after the credits began I knew Elizabeth Olsen was destined for the Oscar red carpet for her work in Martha Marcy May Marlene. It was a quiet thriller I knew very little about content wise before hand but knew all about the acclaim it has received since premiering at Sundance and Cannes earlier this year. When it came to the Toronto International Film Festival it was one of the first films I clamoured for tickets for. And now I know why.Martha Olsen has fled an abusive cult lead by Patrick John Hawkes. After years of being offthegrid she calls her estranged sister Lucy Sarah Paulson to pick her up from a bus shelter. Lucy brings her to the lakeside cottage she shares with her new husband Ted Hugh Dancy where they are to spend some much needed time away from their lives in the city. But as Martha tries to adjust back to a normal life she is continually haunted by the memories of her life in the cult. I was initially underwhelmed walking out of Sean Durkin's debut feature loving Olsen's performance but not much else. But as the days have gone on I continually find myself obsessing on every moment of Martha Marcy May Marlene. Despite the backwoods feel and its atmospheric similarities to last year's Best Picture nominee Winter's Bone this film is just simply unmissable. It is deeply unsettling throughout and one of the few films that succeed in making the audience deeply uncomfortable. I usually find myself shifting in my seat from boredom. Here I was shifting just because of how quietly terrified and incredibly disgusted I was with what was going on onscreen. It is a moody piece but one that sticks with you and scares you more every time you talk and think about it. And it is that feeling that earnest inner torment that keeps bringing me back and appreciating it more and more. Durkin brilliantly frames the film in a similar vein to Memento jumping back and forth between Martha at her sister's cottage in the present and her life in the cult in the past. He weaves in and out of the timelines with care never once confusing the audience. We simply watch as Martha tries to get on with her life but keeps finding things that remind her of moments she spent in the cult. He frames the story entirely around her allowing her unreliability to throw the story into offputting and disturbing directions. I found myself simply stunned by some of the unbelievable things that occur without warning. Nothing too horrific physically happens but Durkin makes the implications of what is even more so. More impressive is how no one thing in the film feels insignificant. They all just add up on top of each other magnificently and help drive the paranoia that plagues Martha from scene to scene just as much if not more than it does for the audience. Olsen has appeared in a few films before her work here but this is an incredibly impressive true debut film for her. Her performance is simply unbelievable and unmissable. Watching her transformation from nave teenager to paranoid PTSD victim onscreen is one of the few absolutely amazing moments of film we have had this year. It is made even better by the fact that the film is not even told in sequence so we are forced to watch her navigate between the depictions with relative ease. Watching her character's arch blossom into something terrifying is something that has become truly rare for such a young unaccomplished actress. But she makes it work and forces the audience to never take their eyes off her. She just ups the ante with every scene and undercuts every actor who she shares the screen with. She is magnetic and commands the screen with such strength that you would never even pretend to imagine that she is related to the Olsen Twins. Whatever doubts I may have had about the film did not even come close to quashing her compelling and spectacular performance.Hawkes continues to prove what a remarkable supporting player he is with his work as the leader of the cult. He is always frightening and nightmarish from the very beginning but seeing him differing forms of sincerity make him a genuinely scary villain. We practically scream at the screen before and after what he puts Martha or as he calls her Marcy May through and his performance is one of the key reasons why the film is so vividly unsettling. Watching Hawkes playing the guitar and serenading her with a tune he wrote about her may go down as one of the most horrific scenes in film history. Paulson and Dancy do a fairly great job in their thankless roles as Martha's actual family. They help propel the film forward and make Olsen's role all the more fantastic but I found that they were not given all that much to do outside of helping move the story forward. Paulson does get some very juicy moments but I think their roles could have been all the better if they had so much more to do. They just seemed like mere plot devices more so than anything else.While there is still something I still cannot quite describe that holds Martha Marcy May Marlene back from being the best film of the year I cannot stop thinking about how powerful and great it really is. It is an ambiguous film that stays with you long after you leave the theatre and one that packs one of the single best performances of the year. This is an incredible directorial debut for Durkin and an even better one for Olsen. Missing this film when it hits theatres is quite simply unacceptable.8.510.".

A woman exiting the screening looked at me and said I've never seen a cult that boring  why did she wait so long to leave? It really was every 70's clich you've ever seen and not missed. The audience all started laughing halfway through the screening. It was in NO WAY about the actors. They were all pretty good. It was the script  so hacky and horrid. And the consensus is that the Olsen sister who is a fine up and coming actress looks like the lovechild of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Scarlett Johansson. That's not a bad thing  just distracting. We all like Sarah Paulson  but she's been given the most unbelievable lines of anyone. When someone acts COMPLETELY PSYCHOTIC several times and you keep saying Why are you acting like this? What the hell is wrong with you? and you still resist getting that person treatment  well it's your own fault what will happen... Overall there was not one surprise plotwise in the entire film  just lots of the audience heaving heavy sighs from watching an unintelligible bad decision and giggles from seeing the clich cult dialogue between the demagogue and the unfortunate female victim. And the HelterSkelter house robbery  ridiculous. I have never left before the QA at a screening  until tonight. My only question would have been Did you read the script? Then why did you do this movie???? Awful.".

	schema:headline " Not Great";
	schema:reviewBody "This film got a lot of praise and was even described as one of the best films of 2011 after watching it I find it hard to see why people would say that.The content is good the story is of a girl trying to adapt back to normal life after escaping a cult. It is edited in a very clever way with flashbacks to memories of the cult dotted throughout. Each flashback's beginning is similar to the real life situation.

It tells the story about Martha a young woman who after having lived with a strange cult on a farm in the Catskill Mountains decides to escape. After having gotten herself to the nearest town Martha calls her sister Lucy who picks her up and brings her to a lake house in Connecticut where Lucy lives with her husband Ted. Though seemingly in safety Martha is deeply traumatized by her experiences with the cult and unable to express what she has been through. Lucy hasn't heard from Martha in a long time and is happy to have been reunited with her sister but as days go by Martha's behavior becomes increasingly unusual. Subtly and acutely directed by American filmmaker Sean Durkin this brilliantly narrated story draws an invariably engrossing intensifying and afflicting portrayal of a young woman driven to the edge of her sanity and struggling to recover after suffering psychological and physical abuse whilst living on a remote farm under the power of a cult leader. This unsettling characterdriven drama which is notable for it's refined cinematography by American cinematographer and director Jody Lee Lipes production design by production designer Chad Keith and naturalistic milieu depictions is a remarkable directorial debut and a dark and esoteric poem with a hypnotic score by composers Daniel Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans which emphasizes the films poignant and eerie atmosphere. The fine editing by Zachary StuartPontier and the efficient fragmented narrative structure increases the pace in this profoundly mysterious independent film about the dangers of seductive and misleading cults targeting vulnerable young men and women who are looking for a sense of belonging which is impelled by the internal and efficiently impersonated acting performance by Elizabeth Olsen in her first leading role and the great supporting acting performances by American actor John Hawkes British actor Hugh Dancy and American actress Sarah Paulson. A nuanced and startling psychological thriller which gained among numerous awards the award for Best Actress Elizabeth Olsen at the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards in 2011 and the award for Best Director Sean Durkin at the 27th Sundance Film Festival in 2011.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film last month in Salt Lake City at the Sundance Film Festival. Even though I didn't find it particularly entertaining I noticed this Jury Award winner for directing had no user review yet so I thought I'd throw in my two cents' worth.The film starts out with the lead character Martha Elizabeth Olsen running away from what seems to be a selfsustaining rural establishment of several youths led by a middle aged man John Hawkes and trying to rediscover herself as she seeks shelter under her older sister's roof. The story then unfolds in two convoluted threads one that takes place in reality where she tries to adapt to her sister's and brotherinlaw's highmaintenance life and one that harks back to the memories of the cult that exploited her in the name of a meaningful relationship. As the boundary between the two threads becomes vague we see Martha plunge into abysmal depression to make us all fret that she may be already damaged beyond the point of no repair.The depiction of the main character's endless descent is a turn off for a casual film watcher like myself who'd like to see a glimmer of hope in the most depressing of films. However there is no denying the film is wellexecuted shot in serene rustic settings with grappling performances by the cast.Elizabeth Olsen swings back and forth between Martha's normal and abnormal moments with great authenticity. Not only she is effortless in doing so she also hints at sibling rivalry with a terrific nuance. This film should put her on 25 emerging actresses under 25 or some similar lists if she hasn't been recognized yet.Fans of John Hawkes's will not be disappointed as he gives another solid performance as a backwoods haggard but this time sans the heroic aura he had in Winter's Bone. In one scene he even takes the guitar out and serenades Martha with disturbingly eloquent lyrics.The director Sean Durkin is certainly on top of his game and succeeds in just showing the basic human needs to belong to a group. However what he expects us to take away from the film is not entirely clear to me. I just hope he uses his great skills for more pleasant themes in the future.".

	schema:headline " Suspense fear  psychological manipulation there are aplenty  but that is all there is";
	schema:reviewBody "Martha Marcy May Marlene continuously cuts back and forth between past and present. However the audience could have used a lot more past and a bit more present to help understand more about Martha Elizabeth Olsen. The past shows Martha's introduction to a reclusive cult deep in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York. The present reveals it is two years later Martha has decided to escape the cult and shacks up with her sister and brotherinlaw in an upscale Connecticut lakeside community.First time feature writerdirector Sean Durkin is a bit manipulative with his script and shot choices. Frequently you have to wait a moment or two to figure out if this new scene is in the past or present it shows early on he is going to play with your mind to make you guess what it is until a character walks on screen. This mirrors what is supposedly going on in Martha's head she is having some major psychological trouble differentiating between her present surroundings and her experiences from the past two years.It is up to the audience to interpret how Martha wound up in the company of the cult the film does not show you that. Also Martha must be extremely nave gullible or downright accepting of cultish behavior because her assimilation is quite easy. Sharing beds clothes household chores and each other's bodies comes quite naturally to her. Even after a drugging and rape Martha just shrugs it off as her introduction to the 'family'. Through conversations with her sister in the present you learn mom died young and dad is never mentioned but her early childhood experiences do not sound very much like they were setting young Martha up to be swallowed up by rapist farmers.Back to the manipulation. Both segments past and present start very much in serene settings. The commune Martha joins is very accepting calm and the people provide a lot of compliments about her strong character and leadership skills. The present segment is on a beautiful lake in a gigantic house with supportive relatives. Then each respective scene adds an unsettling layer until by the end these troubling and disturbing layers feel crushing. Events at the commune upset Martha to the point of breaking down and events in the present lake house are all of Martha's doing because she has brought some extreme paranoia and cascading delusions with her after her escape.I do not recommend this film. The director made some creative editing choices and is very effective at building suspense but that is all it is. The ability to muster unrelenting suspense and dread is not the only element to make an effective movie. I became very tired of watching Martha heap abuse and vitriol at her relatives who put up her ridiculous behavior much longer than most people would. I also grew impatient watching Martha get sucked into a cult through outrageously obvious maneuvers.Why is the film world falling in love with Martha? Almost every critic lauds its suspense and acting Durkin won Best Director at Sundance and it was included in the Cannes Un Certain Regard section. For Elizabeth Olsen it was a very impressive first role but I disagree that she has done anything amazing here. She spends the majority of the movie just looking sheepish around John Hawkes and annoyed at her relatives.Break out of the spell Martha Marcy May Marlene is trying to ensnare you in.

	onyx:emotionText "Martha Marcy May Marlene continuously cuts back and forth between past and present. However the audience could have used a lot more past and a bit more present to help understand more about Martha Elizabeth Olsen. The past shows Martha's introduction to a reclusive cult deep in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York. The present reveals it is two years later Martha has decided to escape the cult and shacks up with her sister and brotherinlaw in an upscale Connecticut lakeside community.First time feature writerdirector Sean Durkin is a bit manipulative with his script and shot choices. Frequently you have to wait a moment or two to figure out if this new scene is in the past or present it shows early on he is going to play with your mind to make you guess what it is until a character walks on screen. This mirrors what is supposedly going on in Martha's head she is having some major psychological trouble differentiating between her present surroundings and her experiences from the past two years.It is up to the audience to interpret how Martha wound up in the company of the cult the film does not show you that. Also Martha must be extremely nave gullible or downright accepting of cultish behavior because her assimilation is quite easy. Sharing beds clothes household chores and each other's bodies comes quite naturally to her. Even after a drugging and rape Martha just shrugs it off as her introduction to the 'family'. Through conversations with her sister in the present you learn mom died young and dad is never mentioned but her early childhood experiences do not sound very much like they were setting young Martha up to be swallowed up by rapist farmers.Back to the manipulation. Both segments past and present start very much in serene settings. The commune Martha joins is very accepting calm and the people provide a lot of compliments about her strong character and leadership skills. The present segment is on a beautiful lake in a gigantic house with supportive relatives. Then each respective scene adds an unsettling layer until by the end these troubling and disturbing layers feel crushing. Events at the commune upset Martha to the point of breaking down and events in the present lake house are all of Martha's doing because she has brought some extreme paranoia and cascading delusions with her after her escape.I do not recommend this film. The director made some creative editing choices and is very effective at building suspense but that is all it is. The ability to muster unrelenting suspense and dread is not the only element to make an effective movie. I became very tired of watching Martha heap abuse and vitriol at her relatives who put up her ridiculous behavior much longer than most people would. I also grew impatient watching Martha get sucked into a cult through outrageously obvious maneuvers.Why is the film world falling in love with Martha?

Sometimes scenes are well lit and beautiful and sometimes they just look dark with blacks crushed and you can't see a thing and it's completely random when this happens.Shallow depth of field is overused and abused here. One clear example of this is when the sister is at the kitchen counter and the husband comes in to talk notice that he's completely out of focus even when he's speaking. There is no dramatic necessity to keep the guy blurry when he's hitting his marks here Martha has walked away and there's no need for things to be dreamlike it looks like crap and it's distracting. There were many other moments like this and I don't want to create spoiler see them for yourself.The sound was pretty bad too. When the sisters are in the garden talking the dialog goes in and out as Martha moves her face to the sides. Earth to boom operator wake the hell up. Also there often was distortion when voices were overly bassy not sure if this problem was in micing the scene or postproduction but come on is everyone deaf?I read an article in some pamphlet that praised the movie's seamless technical proficiency and I thought they are either on crack or they are paid shills. Yes Sean Durkin did a great job of directing his actors and the actors were great but next time please hire a seasoned professional to overlook the technical aspects of the productionparticularly getting the film exposed correctly. I also had a problem with the story. The parallel narrative was fine by me it just took forever to develop and then the movie just ends. In the room where I was you could hear a baah! of dissatisfaction rising from the audience when the credits came up. I don't need a Hollywood ending or some sort of traditional narrative but this movie never builds any kind of tension or momentum it just gets lost in a very long cinematic exposition.Verdict a waste of great talent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't read this if you haven't seen the film yet. Don't read any of these just go see it! Though unresolved endings are nothing new in film the abrupt ending to Martha Marcy May Marlene is one of the most apropos uses of an ambiguous ending I've ever seen. The film is designed to leave the viewer in the same state of mind as the title character throughout wondering if we're experiencing the present or the past dream or reality. The point of the ending is that the fear instability and uneasiness isn't going to fade for Martha. Her experience will not be wrappedup nicely in some storybook ending but will continue to haunt her for the rest of her life. She will always live in fear that her world is going to be ripped apart. Other comments have asked about the car at the end the identity of the bartender the appearance of Patrick at the lake and I'm sure the Director could ask for nothing more than for them to be confused. Martha herself doesn't know the answers and neither should the viewer. My personal opinion is that Martha imagined Patrick at the lake the car at the end was just odd happenstance and maybe even the SUV she damaged was unrelated to the Cult but Martha is going to question those and countless other events for the rest of her life. She'll never hear creaks or rattles the same again... she'll never sleep soundly and consistently... she'll never trust her view of reality and that's exactly the point of the ending. Great performances great direction great movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "First things first. On Easter Sunday I pondered whether I should go see the film Black  a film about which I had heard nothing in the popular press until I saw its title on the cinema's Marquee. Not surprising really since the film appears at this point to have only been released in the specialty Hindilanguage Bollywood film circuit in Canada. Which is a real pity because if I had not made an accidental point of presenting myself at a moviehouse that was actually screening the picture as a Euroheritage nativeborn Canadian I would likely still be walking around in a typically North American ethnocentric film fog about this excellent picture.When I initially asked the theatre's ticket clerk what Black was about his description hardly got me excited. It's the story of a teacher who helps a disabled woman. It didn't sound terribly engaging to me. But boy was I wrong! While I am not a complete stranger to a number of Bollywoodtype films I'm lucky if I see one or two in a year and at that it's usually been because someone else has suggested it. While few of these B class movies deserve screen time in mainstream North American theatres this is hardly the case for Black. It is not a B class flic.If only because the film's Director Sanjay Bhansali cowrote the script this obviously allowed him to imagine how he might want to capture the story with beautiful emotionallycharged cinematography. And what a sophisticated symbolically packed feast it was at that! Yet backing up the impeccable imagery was an equally topdrawer story. One dimension tells the story of a once wellregarded teacher who has come to the end of his financial if not his existentiallyjustified rope a man whose talents are neither fully recognized or completely appreciated. Then during this 11th hour turmoil he receives a letter asking for help from the parents of a young deaf and blind girl. Her story is of course equally gripping a girl effectively trapped in an internal prison in which language a vital connector within herself as well as to the outside world is missing. In this sense both characters need one another for both are on the common and all too true brink of being disposable people  people ripe relegated to become outofsight outofmind statistics in a faceless institution.This feature of the story speaks to a possibility few of us care to contemplate namely Who would care for me if everything fell to pieces?. It is a possibility reminiscent of and anchored in a time when as children we depended entirely on our parents for nurturance and love. This I think is what gives this story its privileged access to the innerrecesses of our deep emotional need for interconnection. And because it is a story told as much with emotionally poignant visuals as it is with emotionally gripping dialogue these have a way of bypassing the usual intellectual filters we erect to both define and protect ourselves from one another. This film will have none of that. And the emotionallyforceful performances offered by the male and female leads simply seal our fates leading us to cojourney with them in their heroic quest to find the light that will illumine us as much as them.Few are the number of viewers who could experience this film and not leave better people if only because it succeeds in allowing us to recognize the value of caring for one another as the greatest triumph if not the most important ingredient in all of our other successes as a species. In short this film strives to restore one's faith in the value of life and love and does very well in that task. And what more can anyone ask from any motion picture? It is a work of genius well executed and a triumph of filmmaking regardless the culture. Which is why I believe it deserves a lofty 10.".

In this sense both characters need one another for both are on the common and all too true brink of being disposable people  people ripe relegated to become outofsight outofmind statistics in a faceless institution.This feature of the story speaks to a possibility few of us care to contemplate namely Who would care for me if everything fell to pieces?. It is a possibility reminiscent of and anchored in a time when as children we depended entirely on our parents for nurturance and love. This I think is what gives this story its privileged access to the innerrecesses of our deep emotional need for interconnection. And because it is a story told as much with emotionally poignant visuals as it is with emotionally gripping dialogue these have a way of bypassing the usual intellectual filters we erect to both define and protect ourselves from one another. This film will have none of that. And the emotionallyforceful performances offered by the male and female leads simply seal our fates leading us to cojourney with them in their heroic quest to find the light that will illumine us as much as them.Few are the number of viewers who could experience this film and not leave better people if only because it succeeds in allowing us to recognize the value of caring for one another as the greatest triumph if not the most important ingredient in all of our other successes as a species. In short this film strives to restore one's faith in the value of life and love and does very well in that task. And what more can anyone ask from any motion picture? It is a work of genius well executed and a triumph of filmmaking regardless the culture. Which is why I believe it deserves a lofty 10.";

	schema:headline " Pretentious yet impressive manipulative yet moving";
	schema:reviewBody "Sanjay Leeela Bhansali's Black is definitely a good film. It is brilliantly scripted made and executed and it is also profound and complex. Many have called it a pretentious show and indeed that's something very obvious and annoying. I'm sure Bhansali from the very outset had planned to get many awards fivestar reviews and thebestfilmmakerinthecountry titles but that said nobody can completely begrudge him since this movie is as impressive and wellinvested as it is ostentatious and it deserves the hype. Let's start with saying that technically and visually Black is a treat. It boasts of fantastic sets and wonderful costumes and the cinematography is incredibly good. All these along with the superb background score create a beautifully dark film. Having said that this may be the exact reason why many viewers found it hard to relate to and that's something I can easily understand particularly after having seen his best feature to date Khamoshi The Musical in which everything was kept simple. Here there's no simplicity everything is lavish big grandiose  and that's why it's often labelled pretentious. The film is emotional yet unsentimental which is good but then one of its main flaws is the fact that more than once it resorts to emotional manipulation trying to forcibly wring tears.Well one thing is sure and it is that you can always expect good acting in a SLB film particularly when it has an Amitabh Bachchan. Bachchan's performance is out of this world. His character goes through many phases and each time you feel he's sinking into it more and more so much that no words can be found to describe it. Seeing an actor of his calibre still being there and playing a part with such passion intensity emotion anger and hunger makes one believe that the sky is the limit. Along with Yuva Hum Tum and VeerZaara Black is a film that constructs Rani Mukherjee's transformation from an average performer to a mature actress. She plays the character brilliantly. The scene which had her crying on the phone to her mom is one of her careerbest acts. It's cruel that she is cast opposite Bachchan as she can't take the whole credit to herself and well frankly speaking in my view her role is not as powerful as his as it is a technical part that requires extensive training rather than soul. It's still a memorable performance and in her case if the sky is the limit Black was probably the sky. Without taking anything from Mukherjee I was more impressed and amazed by the far more superior performance of Ayesha Kapur who played the young Michelle to perfection. Kapur is simply flawless in this role.Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a crafted filmmaker who knows his work and his goals very well. In spite of its flaws Black remains artistic and it is overall a moving movie experience. The words hope love dedication and success always come to the mind while watching it. It might not be original it may be extremely manipulative at points but the effort that was put into it by the entire cast and crew is evident and appreciable. Black is definitely better than most of the films made in the Hindi film industry. Though for me too it is a mixed bag I admit that the first time I saw it I kept thinking of it after the show had ended and for quite some time. This is an achievement few films can achieve for me and here's why my high rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Black is an unusual and interesting film in idea and visualization. It's a very special film and there is no doubt Sanjay Leela Bhansali is among the best talents Indian Film Industry has produced. There have been films like Sadma Sparsh and Koi Mil Gaya and Sanjay's directorial debut Khamoshi  The Musical where the protagonists of the films were physically challenged. KHAMOSHI  THE MUSICAL was a tale of a deaf and dumb couple and their ordinary child. Despite the presence of matine idols like Salman Khan Manisha Koirala and Nana Patekar the film failed. Black cannot be described in sheer words. It has been handled with extreme kindliness and it does boast of a plot that's rarely attempted on the Indian screen. Before this movie Gulzar made a movie 'Koshish' in early 70's starring Jaya Bhaduri and Sanjeev Kumar for which they have won the awards.Michelle McNally Ayesha KapurRani Mukerji born to an AngloIndian family is deaf and blind. She is a bright and intelligent girl and she lives in the world of black and this frustrates her because she desires to speak. Therefore because of her frustration she becomes harsh and cruel on numerous events.Debraj Sahai Amitabh Bachchan is a strange person. He is an alcoholic a teacher to the deaf and blind children. The principal of the school believes in his ability and sends him to the McNally house to teach Michelle. Debraj's arrival at the McNally home is far from favorable as he arrives intoxicated annoyed and impolite. On encountering Michelle Debraj realizes that the only way to tackle her is to distress her be violent at times and at the same time show her the love.Debraj succeeds and Michelle amazingly learns her first word  Ma. But this is just the beginning. There are several battles to be won. His dreams of Michelle going to a college with students without any disability. But at this stage Debraj starts to suffer from Alzheimer. He slowly forgets everything including all words and their meanings. The roles are now reversed!Sanjay Leela Bhansali explanation of Helen Keller's outstanding life and the role Annie Sullivan played in her life. The reallife story was presented on the big screen in the 1962's Hollywood flick THE MIRACLE WORKER which starred Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft for which both the performers won the Oscars.A film like BLACK relies heavily on performances and Bhansali has extracted awardworthy work from practically the entire cast. When you talk of BLACK it's not just Bachchan or Rani's work you would like to extol but Shernaz Patel Nandana Sen Dhritiman Chaterji and Ayesha Kapur's contribution as well.International Cinematography by Ravi K. Chandran. Each and every frame is laudable of a great compliment. Omung Kumar has created lively sets for the film. The Shimla shopping mall has been reconstructed to precision in Mumbai. Background music by Monty is apt. BLACK belongs to Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukerji primarily. After Khakee and Dev this one is his best performance and for this role he felt that for the last 25 years I have been working in the movies but this is the first time that I have shown such an interest. Bachchan comes up with a performance that he'll always be remembered for!There's no denying that Rani delivers her best performance to date and her performance in this movie has topped on the number one spot and crossed her early performances i.e. 'Yuva' 'Hum Tum' and 'Veer  Zaara'. Rani has conveyed through expressions exclusively. Here's a performance that should act as a reference guide for all aspiring actors. And yes she's bound to walk away with all major awards next year as well!Shernaz Patel is exceptional. Her sequences with Bachchan are awesome. Dhritiman Chaterji is excellent. Nandana Sen impresses in a small but significant role. Ayesha Kapur is firstrate and she should be given a special award next year in every award ceremony. And also Best Perfromances award should be given to Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee. If Bollywood has to move ahead with time we will be open to experiments like this. A must watch for those who like different cinema. After Lagaan The Legend Of Bhagat Singh Kaante Khakee this is the movie which can compete with any Hollywood Movie. Rating 4 Out Of 5".

After Khakee and Dev this one is his best performance and for this role he felt that for the last 25 years I have been working in the movies but this is the first time that I have shown such an interest. Bachchan comes up with a performance that he'll always be remembered for!There's no denying that Rani delivers her best performance to date and her performance in this movie has topped on the number one spot and crossed her early performances i.e. 'Yuva' 'Hum Tum' and 'Veer  Zaara'. Rani has conveyed through expressions exclusively. Here's a performance that should act as a reference guide for all aspiring actors. And yes she's bound to walk away with all major awards next year as well!Shernaz Patel is exceptional. Her sequences with Bachchan are awesome. Dhritiman Chaterji is excellent. Nandana Sen impresses in a small but significant role. Ayesha Kapur is firstrate and she should be given a special award next year in every award ceremony. And also Best Perfromances award should be given to Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee. If Bollywood has to move ahead with time we will be open to experiments like this. A must watch for those who like different cinema. After Lagaan The Legend Of Bhagat Singh Kaante Khakee this is the movie which can compete with any Hollywood Movie. Rating 4 Out Of 5";

The conceptactingdirection and screenplay was superb. This is one of the few movies which got potential to bind u emotionally with the movie . THe best part was SLB tried something very diff and took huge risk by doing something which was never done before. No songs and very apt music which runs throughout the movie. I do agree that this movie certainly deserves an Oscar and i do agree that it was totally framed for it as the length of the movie most of the dialogs in Englishtotal British background Cristian characters but i guess this can bring golden era to bollywood which is already contributing maximum no. of movieseven more than Hollywood by providing some excellent works.

He drags her through her ignorance and into a world of words and knowledge. Debraj gives Michelle a dream and a goal. Impossible is a word he never taught Michelle. She beats all odds and overcomes the impossible. I recommend this movie to anyone who is sick of Hollywood and yearns for an original story amazing acting and most importantly a movie that will change how you view the world.

	schema:headline " Pretentious sensitivity  The insider's story";
	schema:reviewBody "The story of making of Black is something like this as against the one given by SLB that he got this idea while making Khamoshee a film he wanted to make since he'd seen Gulzar's Koshish Screenwriter Prakash Kapadia Devdas Black met Bhansali at the premiere of P Kapadia's Gujarati film Dariya Chhoru directed by Vipul Shah of Aankhen fame. Bhansali was invited to the screening by Aatish Kapadia writer of Aankhen and the then screenwriter of Devdas. Bhansali came up to Prakash Kapadia after the screening and told him You are the real hero of the film. Of course a few days later Aatish Kapadia was replaced by Prakash Kapadia to write Devdas for SLB. During the making of Devdas and later Prakash Kapadia would discuss all his plays some 20 great stories that he made in his 20 year long illustrious theatre career. Among these were two plays one was a story called Aatam Vinjhe Paankh a Gujarati play inspired straight from The Miracle Worker and the other was a story of an ageing teacher suffering from the Alzheimer's. Post Devdas Bhansali asked PK to render the story of Bajirao and Mastani for him. While PK was busy with that Bhansali clubbed the two stories of Miracle Worker and Alzhiemer's with the help of cowriter Bhavani Iyer and developed a complete English script titled Black. When he sent the script to PK PK rejected most of the screenplay as dry and dull. With PK entering the scene it was decided that SLB will make a bilingual film instead of an outandout English film. SLB approached the Helen Keller Institute for rights and assistance. He was denied the rights but was offered the assistance. So the secondary level problem had now become a primary one. They had to deviate from Helen Keller's life and The Miracle Worker as much as they could. They gave a thank you note to the institute in the film but couldn't mention anywhere that Black is indeed inspired from the Miracle Worker or Keller's life. Problem 2 was they had to expand the role of Debraj's character because it was going to be played by Amitabh Bachhan. In this confusion of events they ended up creating a mess out of a great story. They maintained Anne Sullivan's character of a half blind teacher Bachhan getting the eye drops from Ms. Nayar but added Alzhiemer's to it for further drama and forced sensitivity. They maintained most of the other characters but couldn't use the real names though they ended up using the same costume setting and makeup. They didn't use the same education techniques of Anne Sullivan and because of their lack of imagination they ended up making a 60year old frustrated compulsive brute instead of a compassionate imaginative teacher. They still used the high points in Keller's life like the fountain water scene. For those who defend this kind of plagiarism by saying that remakes are made all the time are forgetting a basic priciple  remakes are made after acquiring the rights from the original. SLB and PK didn't research through archives and works of Keller but instead just relied on an artiste's rendering of her life The Miracle Worker. Several films are made with Gandhi in it but they do not show a man named McNally getting thrown out of a train for being brown and inventing satyagraha. Get my point?Upward downward arrogant pretentious cinema designed for awards and critical appreciation in a country which has had very little collective self analysis in the last 50 years. I think that pretty much defines Black. It makes the semiintellectual and pseudosensitive life forms to feel important and profound for having the ability to identify and appreciate great cinema. I'll compare this feeling to the way the English speaking Indian elite feel about themselves. Though they won't admit it deep down they still carry the genes of slavery and feel proud to be on the same level as the international read American English speaking communities. That's precisely the problem with this kind of contorted cinema. Just because a film looks like a Hollywood Oscar winning film doesn't mean that it's a good film. Black is empty of substance. It doesn't make any attempt in understanding the inner world of a person born deaf and blind while creating an illusion that it's in fact doing so.Good stepping stone for just outofthecocoonselfproclaimedfilmanalystsandintellectuals though.".

	schema:reviewBody "I fail to see any mastery in the narrative of the most celebrated film of this year. Black. loosely inspired from the 1962 film The Miracle Worker based on Helen Keller's life. Debraj Bacchan the stereotypically cranky genius teacher of Michelle Mukherjee a girl born deaf and blind was supposed to enter a magician  I would have loved to see a Robin Williams there  of Dead Poets' Society of Patch Adams of Goodwill Hunting of the Hook or for that matter a Johny Depp of Finding Neverland or Philippe Noiret of Cinema Paradiso  a magician a creative genius a compassionate enlightened and colourful wizard. What I got instead was a brainless brute for a pedagogically wrong teacher a monster who incessantly shouts on through the first half of the film at a child he knows can't even hear. The scenes with most potential are the ones treated with most preempted melodrama and least substance. The sequence where Debraj finally gets to training his student for twenty days for example. Here director Bhansali largely considered a master of misenscene succumbs to hiding the lack of research and screenplay material behind a touch and go montage squeezing the whole story of Michelle's training loosely based on Anne Sullivan's struggle to teach communication to the blind and deaf Helen Keller which is later going to develop into the second plot point of the film. Michelle's world remains relatively unexplored throughout the film but for melodramatic purposes. There are infinite references to the title in the dialogue but we never understand how is Black different to green or scarlet or turquoise to a completely deaf and blind girl when she is not even aware of the existence of other colours to make a comparative statement like that. There wasn't a single reference to her training in colour references or rhythm recognition again something that gets hidden under Ravi Chandran's immaculate chiaroscuro. Each frame of Chandran's could be printed as a work of art but his cinematography was largely incoherent with the narrative. I'd flatter it to say that for me it reached Conrad Hall levels but failed to show me either Michelle's or Debraj's world and stayed confused between the two like the narrative itself. Art director Omung Kumar successfully creates an Eastern Europe in North India but leads Chandran in incoherency with the story. Robert Frost's 'Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening' has been used on the walls of a sign linguist's house where one expects to see a dictionary of homespun signs and words inscribed on the walls. McNally's AngloIndian house looks like a museum where Shernaz Patel gives a tiresome performance as a postcard. The Hindi dialogue of the film belongs to a story like Devdas and the English dialogue belongs in a Class 5 Balbharati textbook. The semifinal blow comes when director Bhansali rips off a scene from his own film Khamoshee. The emotionally pulsating climax of Khamoshee where Nana's character gives a thank you speech in sign language becomes a tearjerker preclimax in Black with Rani swapping places with Nana and Shernaz with Manisha. The climax again is brilliant you are just about to say good at least caught one out of the many juggled balls when comes the final blow  the dnouement. A yet another mumbled painting. Now some great scenes quickly  the first hospital scene where Bacchan is walking in one direction and Rani in the other the enlightenment scene where Bacchan throws Rani in water the party scene where Rani lip reads the singer the campus bench scene where Rani teases Bacchan about the snowfall she predicted not giving him the umbrella the kiss scene the only melodramatic scene in this list  the climax water. First Swades then Black. Indeed it is a great phase for Indian Cinema  the phase of transition.".

Instead of trying to make the ultimate cinematographic masterpiece it is far from that if they had just focused on how to craft a good story at least modify original version to where it became enjoyable esp. as an Indian remake.The makers of such films seem to be smug and arrogant in their beliefs that simply throwing gobs of money results in good work.

	schema:headline " Bhansali overreaches and comes up short...again";
	schema:reviewBody "While some may applaud his effort to foray into semiserious filmmaking especially moving away from the formulaic song and dance numbers Bhansali comes up short on delivering the story in the best way possible. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and the symbolism though a bit heavyhanded is again appreciated. Bhansali manages to do a good job with his actors but does not deliver the home run he was looking for. Reining in Rani and Amitabh would have made their performances all the more stoic instead giving them wild hyperactive motions and overplaying their histrionics makes a theatergoer wonder what could have been. Black is a solid effort but by no means the wonder and crossover of Bollywood into something more serious. Bhansali recognizes his great talents as a filmmaker but as in Devdas clearly plays for the awards and makes the film a tribute to his own skill. Devdas was extravagant simply for the sake of extravagance and while a visual treat did not really portray the progression of the characters into the abyss it just showed them at their best and worst points. Black does almost the same thing when it shows extraordinary moments of recognition but it focuses much more on the dramatic and not the subtle changes in the characters. This movie is clearly made for awards and Bhansali does show flashes of brilliance. However on the whole his unwillingness to pull back from constantly hitting us with moment after moment instead of letting things build really takes away from the movie if he truly was looking to make something different. By addressing handicaps and Alzheimer's and remaking a truly great film Bhansali is playing to awards and when a film tries too hard as Devdas did it inevitably falls short. The film as spectacle is great great cinema it is not.".

	schema:headline " '...lovely dark and deep'";
	schema:reviewBody "'lovely dark and deep'Black Dir Sanjay Leela Bhansali Cast Amitabh Bachchan Rani Mukherjee Ayesha Kapur Nandana Sen Dhritiman Chaterji and Shernaz Patel. Written by Sanjay Leela Bhansali Bhavani Iyer and Prakash Kapadia. Rating As the credits began to roll at the end of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's therapeutic parable 'Black' I remained seated for a few seconds stunned mesmerized and completely enamoured. I had witnessed magic that rare phenomenon in cinema which makes you speechless with awe! 'Black' is unarguably the best film in years to have come out of our industry. Based loosely on the life of Helen Keller that deafblind woman who defied the whole world and probably God himself 'Black' is about Michelle McNallyRani Mukherjee who cannot see hear or speak. The movie begins with her quest to find Debraj SahaiAmitabh Bachchan that person who had led her into the light when all that her destiny promised was an emptiness without sights sounds or speech. She finds Debraj old and worn out in an asylum suffering from Alzheimer. Debraj has forgotten everything. Through Michelle's determination to remind Debraj of his achievement with her we are taken inside the story of how Debraj helped Michelle. Debraj had entered young Michelle'sAyesha Kapur life as the last straw of hope for her mother Catherine McnallyShernaz Patel. There is a thin line between mental retardation and the frustrated rage of a child that has been denied three out of the five senses. What Michelle's fatherDhritiman Chaterji perceives as nuisance Debraj sees as a desperate attempt to fight fight her destiny. Watch as young Michelle punches her fist in the air trying to break out of the void and reach out to something. Debraj uses Michelle's anger and channels it to free her out of darkness's bondage. He teaches her to fingerspell but she only seems to imitate without really understanding what the words mean. Then in a brilliantly shot scene Debraj dragsyes he drags her Michelle to a waterfountain and like with Helen Keller throws her in it for her impudence. As Michelle feels the touch of water she is filled with a desire to know what it is. Her first tacit word is water and she goes on a frenzied zest to learn new words as she feels everything. Debraj guides Michelle through her life from a girl to a woman who aspires to be a graduate. But concomitant to her progress is the deterioration of Debraj. A man that has always thumbed his nose to life itself is harshly being swallowed by life. A man that helped Michelle reach out of the darkness is slowly walking into it himself. It is not about sight but darkness says Debraj during a conversation with Catherine. Cinematographer Ravi Chandran achieves this sentiment splendidly throughout the movie in a work that would've done the late great Conrad L. Hall proud! Note also how Omung Kumar uses the contrast of black and white when Michelle meets Debraj in the asylum. It is amazing how the movie resembles a magnificent canvas with primarily the use of only two colours black and white! Bhansali's direction is topnotch. Watch closely as he drops a hint on the period of the film. I'll give you a clue it's got to do with Charlie Chaplin! Moreover never before has Robert Frost's 'Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening' been put to better use. As we are introduced to a weary and tired Debraj watch how Frost's most quoted lines reflect on all the walls around him. In fact every frame of the movie is symbolic. Mr. Bhansali take a bow! Special mention needs to be made of Bhavani Iyer's imaginative English dialogues in her debut feature. Rani Mukherjee performs exceedingly well in a role that is both challenging and has the utmost potential to overact. But she restrains herself from going over the top. However it is the little Ayesha Kapur as young Michelle that completely steals the thunder from Rani. Hers is a performance that resembles very much to Shamili's in Mani Ratnam's 'Anjali' but yet different. As I stated earlier there is a thin line between retardation and frustrated anger. Ayesha manages to stay on the saner side of that line. Finally though this movie is unimaginable without Amitabh Bachchan. In what is his career's best work Bachchan gives a powerhouse performance that reminds you of Al Pacino. Whether it is his humming an unfamiliar tune or his mouthing Frost his eccentric wit or his calm concentration and his sudden anger or his contented smile Mr. Bachchan goes through the whole range of emotions with effortlessness. His eyes speak a thousand words and you can see the pain the sorrow the defeat and the victory in them even before he speaks especially as he begins to lose grip over his memory. 'Black' is a wellmade wellintentioned film. When I had entered the cinemahall the lights had already gone and I had to ask the usher to help me in the darkness. But two hours later Bhansali had guided me into the light!Abhishek BandekarRating  Poor  Average  Good  Very Good  Excellent4th February 2005".

I later learnt that the first half was virtually a scene to scene repeat of the Hollywood Oscar winner The Miracle Worker. Oh crap.Mr Bhansali although I am a great admirer of your work you have to start producing original scripts. The execution of Black in the first half was mesmerising but only due to a copied screenplay.In short Black left a lot to be desired. A copied script was the first crime.

	schema:headline " I prefer WHITE!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Black is the answer to all Hollywood's misgivings till date Bhansali's Black is comparable to any of contemporary cinema's classics. Blahblahblah..Now time for some truth.. Hear it from the horse's mouth. Ladies and Gentlemen presenting before you the man himself Feel blessed feel honored. The final word on the most confusingly reviewed and misinterpreted movie of all times.yes you are bang right we are talking about the much raved about famously pronounced as The sole deserving candidate for the academy awards a masterpiece of art creation beyond comparison or even explanation a movie so huge you feel like disappearing in thin air when it rolls and wish you could run away from those pretentious pricks applauding in the dark asylum amidst an alarming vacuum of misconception and misinterpretation and may be catch something subtle at home for a change far from the maddening crowds who rejoice at every howl who jump at every brawl.. Take me away O lords of my destiny if this is BLACK I prefer WHITE! This is easily the most misconceived movies of all times at least in the Indian celluloid history. The minute the movie rolled and I saw a schizophrenic Amitabh I knew what was coming and guess what I was RIGHT! The protagonist the small girl looks like an Indian impersonation of the two girls from The Ring and The Exorcist with due apologies and respect to Verbinski and Friedkin respectively who keeps howling all the time as if she has just come back from watching Black. She looks like she went to see Sixth Sense and missed THE scene. Agreed that it was supposed to be a DARK movie agreed that they were supposed to garner sympathy and tears for its hollering monologue sessions and agreed that as human beings you do tend to get swept away in the stream of emotions so basic to our survival but tell me one thing. Where were the emotions?! All I found was noisy confrontations all through the tiring 95 minutes well if the actual movie is longer I would kiss the guy who gave me an edited DVD! in first few minutes of the movie I thought it will take me a while to get attuned to the dark unexpressed emotions but when it didn't affect me a penny I started getting worried about my reaction time and nerve impulses' functioning. But they were not to be blamed may be I have seen way too many movies by now that such blownup sagas of pathos don't influence me any longer even in the minutest possible way. The movie did have some inspiring aspects like the sets the camera the lights but let me add just one thing they all were looking way too Victorian to fit the depicted time period in the movie! Amidst all this mumbojumbo of Black making it to the Oscars I have some thousand thirty inhibitions about the remote possibility of that being true. The movie attempts a daring depiction and storyline of disabled people which is a very commendable step to start with. They have even tried showing the constricted views of the world towards the chances of their betterment to a certain successful extent. But if the moviemakers had embarked upon such a noble task of diverting the attention of the hackneyed audience who have become used to the song and dance routine much too often now may be they should have worked a little more into understanding as to what their world is all about beyond the stereotypical BLACK that they keep hammering from pillar to post. I understand that Black substantiates their concept and symbolizes a world devoid of all things colorful and lively but couldn't they leave a few things to the intelligent audience's imagination an assumption that they sure must have made while spending such obscene amountsread a fifteen crores INR!. A few things like the muchpublicized KISS between the lead actors which truly I was imagining all the time waiting for it! This could have been a rare creation by Mumbai cinema considering the oodles of moolah they waste on lavish sets and costumes which make no sense whatsoever. All the movie relies on is gaining sympathy on characters oozing with selfpity and pretence. Way to go Bollywood you don't get Oscars by stuffing things like Alzheimer's schizophrenia amnesia and the works. Remember someone said Keep It Simple Stupid!".

	onyx:emotionText "Black is the answer to all Hollywood's misgivings till date Bhansali's Black is comparable to any of contemporary cinema's classics. Blahblahblah..Now time for some truth.. Hear it from the horse's mouth. Ladies and Gentlemen presenting before you the man himself Feel blessed feel honored. The final word on the most confusingly reviewed and misinterpreted movie of all times.yes you are bang right we are talking about the much raved about famously pronounced as The sole deserving candidate for the academy awards a masterpiece of art creation beyond comparison or even explanation a movie so huge you feel like disappearing in thin air when it rolls and wish you could run away from those pretentious pricks applauding in the dark asylum amidst an alarming vacuum of misconception and misinterpretation and may be catch something subtle at home for a change far from the maddening crowds who rejoice at every howl who jump at every brawl.. Take me away O lords of my destiny if this is BLACK I prefer WHITE! This is easily the most misconceived movies of all times at least in the Indian celluloid history. The minute the movie rolled and I saw a schizophrenic Amitabh I knew what was coming and guess what I was RIGHT! The protagonist the small girl looks like an Indian impersonation of the two girls from The Ring and The Exorcist with due apologies and respect to Verbinski and Friedkin respectively who keeps howling all the time as if she has just come back from watching Black. She looks like she went to see Sixth Sense and missed THE scene. Agreed that it was supposed to be a DARK movie agreed that they were supposed to garner sympathy and tears for its hollering monologue sessions and agreed that as human beings you do tend to get swept away in the stream of emotions so basic to our survival but tell me one thing. Where were the emotions?! All I found was noisy confrontations all through the tiring 95 minutes well if the actual movie is longer I would kiss the guy who gave me an edited DVD! in first few minutes of the movie I thought it will take me a while to get attuned to the dark unexpressed emotions but when it didn't affect me a penny I started getting worried about my reaction time and nerve impulses' functioning. But they were not to be blamed may be I have seen way too many movies by now that such blownup sagas of pathos don't influence me any longer even in the minutest possible way. The movie did have some inspiring aspects like the sets the camera the lights but let me add just one thing they all were looking way too Victorian to fit the depicted time period in the movie! Amidst all this mumbojumbo of Black making it to the Oscars I have some thousand thirty inhibitions about the remote possibility of that being true. The movie attempts a daring depiction and storyline of disabled people which is a very commendable step to start with. They have even tried showing the constricted views of the world towards the chances of their betterment to a certain successful extent. But if the moviemakers had embarked upon such a noble task of diverting the attention of the hackneyed audience who have become used to the song and dance routine much too often now may be they should have worked a little more into understanding as to what their world is all about beyond the stereotypical BLACK that they keep hammering from pillar to post. I understand that Black substantiates their concept and symbolizes a world devoid of all things colorful and lively but couldn't they leave a few things to the intelligent audience's imagination an assumption that they sure must have made while spending such obscene amountsread a fifteen crores INR!. A few things like the muchpublicized KISS between the lead actors which truly I was imagining all the time waiting for it! This could have been a rare creation by Mumbai cinema considering the oodles of moolah they waste on lavish sets and costumes which make no sense whatsoever. All the movie relies on is gaining sympathy on characters oozing with selfpity and pretence. Way to go Bollywood you don't get Oscars by stuffing things like Alzheimer's schizophrenia amnesia and the works. Remember someone said Keep It Simple Stupid!";

	schema:reviewBody "After watching Black I wished I were blind and deaf so that I would never have had to endure this movie or its fantastic reviews.When I watch a film like Black I can say that the director is definitely talented. He manages to make a film without any songs with most dialogues in English and an unusual storyline and get away with both rave reviews and housefull theatres. Or maybe it has got away with rave reviews and housefull theatres because it has no songs has many English dialogues and an unusual story line. Maybe people are so tired of the usual good film that an unusual bad film seems extraordinarily good.Despite all its unusuality Black is filled with clichs and highly predictable sentimental dialogues. The only thing moving in this film was me shifting in my seat trying not to run from the theatre. Rani Mukherjee who plays Michelle a girl blind and deaf from birth and Amitabh Bachchan who plays her teacher have been said to have delivered fantastic performances yet I found it to be their worst performances that I know of. Rani Mukherjee has her head cocked to one side through the whole film yet it is only the blind who do that to catch sound which is out of the question with Michelle. It seems critics and audiences see overacting as brilliant acting in some scenes there is so much overacting the movie seems bizarre and unreal.What is most unreal is the script and the dialogues. Michelle joins a university where the teachers are not trained to deal with a student like her and because of this Michelle graduates only ten years after she joins. Why? Simply because her typing speed on a Braille typewriter is too slow for her to finish her examination within the time limit. Surely a college that has managed to handle a blind and deaf student can find a different way to test her. The script does not even deal with the problem in the end. They take the easy way out after having failed several times Michelle in a fit of rage suddenly manages to type at a furious speed after ten years of not being able to do so. The location and timesetting of the movie are very unclear. The whole movie takes place in an EnglishHindi speaking town when Charlie Chaplin movies are releasing. They seem to be completely cut off from the rest of the world.Then there's the case of Michelle's sister. She is a normal person who gets an abnormal lack of attention from her parents because of Michelle's constant needs. When she gets frustrated with her parents and Michelle for the same reason she is portrayed as a sister who isn't understanding who is completely to blame who is a character made to take the audience's fury. One should really sympathise with her someone who from childhood gets a highly inadequate amount of her parents' attention.After all the other fantastic reviews that this movie got mine must seem like blasphemy. Well everyone's entitled to their opinions and I'm expressing mine. What really bothers me is not how bad Black is but the fact that the Indian audience considers something of such mediocrity to be fantastic. And that's my opinion on everyone else's opinion.".

Deathstalker and Dionara with the help of a sidekick they persuade seek to foil the queen.There is lots of wild action outdoors and indoors some banquets and orgies and nudity and the queen even has some erotic moments with Deathstalker and the sidekick.  Dionara has a water hole fight with her lead rival before a climactic swordfight.  But Rick and Maria make a great pair of protagonists the best Deathstalker romantic pair.

In fact it's pretty terrible. I can't say just how terrible it is in relation to its three predecessors because they were experienced way back in my murky impressionable childhood and the only bits I can remember are the bits that were inexplicably recycled in this one.But the real tragedy of Match of Titans is that while it's certainly a long way from the likes of the Conan films in terms of production values and well... everything really it's also not quite inept enough to be funny. Don't get me wrong the scale of incompetence runs pretty high considering it's the fourth instalment in a series but when it comes to the crunch Rick Hill goes and ruins everything by turning in an inappropriately decent performance. Maria Ford's worth looking at too. Not worth watching mind you but definitely worth looking at. There's a difference.Still the 'special' 'effects' are well down to standard for the genre as are the 'plot' 'dialogue' and 'continuity'. And I can only speculate that the 'fight scenes' were choreographed by a couple of arthritic wheelchairbound 85yearolds drunk on gin which is great for a film entirely based around a handtohand combat tournament. So it's not all bad then.".

There's a difference.Still the 'special' 'effects' are well down to standard for the genre as are the 'plot' 'dialogue' and 'continuity'. And I can only speculate that the 'fight scenes' were choreographed by a couple of arthritic wheelchairbound 85yearolds drunk on gin which is great for a film entirely based around a handtohand combat tournament. So it's not all bad then.";

	schema:headline " Deathstalker IV Is A Great Conclusion to the Franchise";
	schema:reviewBody "Rick Hill is to the Deathstalker movies what Sean Connery was to the James Bond thrillers. Hill plays the eponymous warrior and he wields his sword with greater aplomb than either John Terlesky or John Allen Nelson. Writer  director Howard R. Cohen teams up again with Hill for this epic variation on the original about a tournament where nobody wins except the sorcerer. Deathstalker IV boasts a female villain and her plan to turn warriors into stone to fill the ranks of her army qualifies as above average for the franchise. Indeed Deathstalker IV appears to resume not long after the original and our hero carries s a sword endowed with magical powers that did not exist in either Deathstalker 2 or Deathstalker 3. Altogether not only does Deathstalker IV top the original Deathstalker but it also surpasses the first two sequels. Hill seems far more confident and assured as the muscular protagonist.Mind you Deathstalker IV doesn't take itself any more seriously than the original but it never degenerates into the campy bimbo farce of Deathstalker 2. Deathstalker IV drums up more drama and legitimate comedy than Deathstalker 3. Of course the combat choreography is one of those insurmountable weaknesses that have always plagued Deathstalker series. The hero and his adversaries might as well be dueling with tennis rackets than swords for all the suspense that is created. Cohen's screenplay is predictable. Again a tyrant rules a kingdom that he or she stole from the heroine and the hero furnishes the strategy and the muscle to recover it. Typically in sword and sorcery movies the chief villain is a sorcerer or a sorceress.Deathstalker IV opens with a prologue narrated by Dionara Maria Ford of Stripped to Kill 2 Live Girls who identifies the eponymous hero the ancient time setting and the predicament that she faces. In the age of darkness there was chaos. It was a time when honest men ran in fear from the armies and beautiful women were toys to be fought over and tossed away. Good men lost their lives defending family and honor. Weak men lived or died at the mercy of cruel overlords. In the midst of this chaos there were men heroes who fought against evil and injustice. This is the story of one such man a great warrior who feared nothing. He helped me like many others fulfill my destiny. It was he who destroyed the evil sorcerer Munkar recovered the sword of justice and reunited the three powers. He was the man I came to know as Deathstalker. In other words if you missed the original Deathstalker Cohen's recap brings you uptospeed about our hero and his legendary sword. This makes Deathstalker 2 and Deathstalker 3 look like innameonly sequels. Rather than shoot more Deathstalker footage action with Rick Hill producer Roger Corman and company have lifted footage from the original film and fleshed out the sequel. Actually Corman used the same footage to supplement the first two sequels. Happily this footage has been grafted skillfully onto the plot without interfering with the action.Deathstalker finds a massacred wagon train and rescues a maiden from warriors wearing lion's heads for helmets. Essentially our hero is searching for Endoron Rumen Dimitrov a friend of his. He's got my sword Deathstalker explains to the maiden's father. Deathstalker talks about how Endoron and he battled an unknown army that lay siege to a village. Ultimately they were separated. Things got a little confusing. He wound up with my sword and I with his. Tarinda Jenny Philipova warns Deathstalker about Kana's evil army. Kana's soldiers have assaulted one village after another. They sacked the towns ravaged the women and killed all the weak and helpless inhabitants. However by Kana's orders they captured all the strongest warriors and took them away.Our hero and heroine are among the many warriors competing in a tournament hosted by the evil Queen Kana Michelle Moffett of Hired to Kill who rules as a tyrant the throne that once belonged to Dionara's father. I've come back here to reclaim my birthright. She explains that Kana's father murdered her mother and father and imprisoned her sister and her. A servant helped them escape. Deathstalker isn't too surprised when he discovers that Dionara is a princess. I'm always getting mixed up with princesses. Meanwhile Deathstalker and Dionara have noticed that the tournament is rather unusual. Every warrior from 200 miles around has come to fight in it but Kana seems to be going out of her way to disqualify combatants get them hopelessly intoxicated with wine and then imprison them in her dungeons. Eventually Deathstalker and Dionara figure out that Kana is spiking her wine to incapacitate combatants and transform them into an army of stone warriors at her beck and command. She takes an antidote to counteract the effects of the wine.Deathstalker and Dionara persuade another warrior Vaniat Brett Baxter Clark of Malibu Express to seduce Kana and learn what her antidote for the wine is. Although Vaniat is basically a virgin he is such a hunk that Kana falls for him big time. Vaniat doesn't like to drink and Deathstalker explains he must not swallow the wine. Vaniat manages to fool Kana. Nevertheless Kana and his sidekick imprison Deathstalker and almost petrify him with their poisoned wine. There is an interesting scene when Deathstalker discovers the stone warriors in Kana's castle and tries to fight them. He loses and Kana feeds him wine only Vaniat's discovery of the antidote and Dionara's swift intervention saves Deathstalker's life.Cohen does a good job of pacing this lowbudget shotinBulgaria sword and sorcery feature. Clark is hilarious as an inexperienced lover while Maria Ford is a fetching blond. Deathstalker IV contains scenes with women shedding or slipping into their clothing but at some time displaying their breasts. Deathstalker IV marginally overshadows the original Deathstalker.".

In this regard the movie in question surpasses itself by casting the absolutely gorgeous Maria Ford as Deathstalker's love interest who also happens to be an incredibly feisty warrior!It's such a pity that the rest of the film fails to have the same lustre. Whilst I've certainly watched far worse in my time this movie overall just feels flat and uninspired and I can really only describe it as average at best.

Maybe film it in Russia to save cash and use that money to hire an ensemble of swordtoting women and throw them in the dungeon too.  And at the end of the movie Rick Hill can come along and free them all.

Hill is clearly enjoying himself this time round he's more buffed and his wig looks better hehe his new warrior friend also adds to the laughs. The guy is almost like an early Dwayne Johnson type sidekick.Its all still highly cheap and cheesy but by now it would be wrong to change that. Every clich in the low budget barbarian book is used all over again blonde women are good brunettes are bad lots of tits and ass on show soft core sex scenes at times and all wizardswise men have long 'Merlin' type beards. Loved the stone slaves used by the Queen some dazzling makeup and acting on show there I tells ya.Still can't work out why they use the exact same archive footage from the previous films. The exact same reels are used! plus it still shows the previous characters that have been killed off! At least use footage that doesn't show previous characters or footage not used before geez!

	schema:reviewBody "First the good news.  Seeing DS4 in absolutely no way obscured any memories of Sexo por Compassion with  among others  Mariola Fuentes which I saw a few days ago.  That's an extremely fun expressionist film and Charlie Chaplin could have learned a lot had he had the opportunity to understudy Mariola.Now just some of the bad news...Very early on DS4 caused me to recall Animal House.  The thing looks as though produced by the Alphas!  Of course the Deltas wouldn't have touched it with a 40foot spear.  Our medieval personages are cleanshaven and wearing costumes fresh off some drycleaner's rack.  I found myself smelling imaginary cologne their faces were so fresh and clean.I also found myself comparing this to the Rocky Horror Show  not the appallingly ghastly and imbecilic piece of suburban banality on film but to what I experienced in a decaying downtown theater in New York back around 1970.  Well...  DS4 has no feel for the jaded or for the erotic or for the decadent and certainly not for the arty.  Highschool cheerleaders jumping in their broadknit sweaters and skirts and saddleshoes and pompoms are sexier  and for any readers of this who retort Yeah?  You haven't see OUR cheerleaders just let me tell you Yeah well you don't wanna see these turkeys in DS4!Okay okay.  The lead actor has an aging head  with hair teased and blowdried to compensate for a surplus of scalp  that reminded me of poor Jimmy Stewart in his final years  attached to a huge greased plastic body with invisible nipples and no hair.  In fact one could wonder if with all the steroids pumping him up if he can still get anything other than his sword up.There seem to have been no grips on this set as the sound is mostly dubbed but occasionally live in which latter case it's uneven and scarcely audible.  I believe I even could have composed better music.  Even silence would have been better than the incoherent junk someone pawed on a synthesizer  though the thought did strike me that it would have been better with Mozart's Requiem for background music  that is if their editors could have handled another track. The leading woman a sad case with her teased bleachblond hair and generally sexless figure might better have played the scarecrow in an offoffoff Broadway Wizard of Ozz  though on those stages there's often an absence of typecasting.  Come on even flat women can be erotic  but not her.  If only they'd all read a little Robert Crumb beforehand maybe that would have helped if any of them still has any capacity for hormone flow.Early on the thought struck me that if we are at a party I'd have never asked that leading lady to dance  but soon I suspected she probably couldn't dance anyway  as it is she can hardly talk convincingly.  The film refuses to make fun of itself  indeed it's so bad the simple concepts of fun and self would confound that effort.  Besides the actors aren't capable of it  I don't believe they could even play a McDonald's cashier well enough to sell a burger  which is maybe why they allowed themselves to be bullied into permitting their names to be associated with this thing.  The Loved One with old Jonathon Winters and Robert Morley can make fun of death but there's no making fun of Deathstalker  no more than of a wet pile of horsehair.I won't go on.  Look.  I actually really enjoyed DS2.  It was on that basis that I excitedly shelled out five big ones in a flea market and bought DS4. But the two bare virtually zero relationship to each other.  Believe it or not I'm a DS2 liker.  Not as much so perhaps as with Cielo Abierto or Sexo por Compassion with Mariola Fuentes but it amused me.DS4 is static sterile impotent.  Gosh even zombie victims staggering off the original set of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers could have done better. Whew!  Gimme a break!".

That's an extremely fun expressionist film and Charlie Chaplin could have learned a lot had he had the opportunity to understudy Mariola.Now just some of the bad news...Very early on DS4 caused me to recall Animal House.  The thing looks as though produced by the Alphas!  Of course the Deltas wouldn't have touched it with a 40foot spear.  Our medieval personages are cleanshaven and wearing costumes fresh off some drycleaner's rack.  I found myself smelling imaginary cologne their faces were so fresh and clean.I also found myself comparing this to the Rocky Horror Show  not the appallingly ghastly and imbecilic piece of suburban banality on film but to what I experienced in a decaying downtown theater in New York back around 1970.  Well...  DS4 has no feel for the jaded or for the erotic or for the decadent and certainly not for the arty.  Highschool cheerleaders jumping in their broadknit sweaters and skirts and saddleshoes and pompoms are sexier  and for any readers of this who retort Yeah?  You haven't see OUR cheerleaders just let me tell you Yeah well you don't wanna see these turkeys in DS4!Okay okay.  The lead actor has an aging head  with hair teased and blowdried to compensate for a surplus of scalp  that reminded me of poor Jimmy Stewart in his final years  attached to a huge greased plastic body with invisible nipples and no hair.  In fact one could wonder if with all the steroids pumping him up if he can still get anything other than his sword up.There seem to have been no grips on this set as the sound is mostly dubbed but occasionally live in which latter case it's uneven and scarcely audible.  I believe I even could have composed better music.  Even silence would have been better than the incoherent junk someone pawed on a synthesizer  though the thought did strike me that it would have been better with Mozart's Requiem for background music  that is if their editors could have handled another track. The leading woman a sad case with her teased bleachblond hair and generally sexless figure might better have played the scarecrow in an offoffoff Broadway Wizard of Ozz  though on those stages there's often an absence of typecasting.  Come on even flat women can be erotic  but not her.  If only they'd all read a little Robert Crumb beforehand maybe that would have helped if any of them still has any capacity for hormone flow.Early on the thought struck me that if we are at a party I'd have never asked that leading lady to dance  but soon I suspected she probably couldn't dance anyway  as it is she can hardly talk convincingly.  The film refuses to make fun of itself  indeed it's so bad the simple concepts of fun and self would confound that effort.  Besides the actors aren't capable of it  I don't believe they could even play a McDonald's cashier well enough to sell a burger  which is maybe why they allowed themselves to be bullied into permitting their names to be associated with this thing.  The Loved One with old Jonathon Winters and Robert Morley can make fun of death but there's no making fun of Deathstalker  no more than of a wet pile of horsehair.I won't go on.  Look.  I actually really enjoyed DS2.  It was on that basis that I excitedly shelled out five big ones in a flea market and bought DS4. But the two bare virtually zero relationship to each other.  Believe it or not I'm a DS2 liker.  Not as much so perhaps as with Cielo Abierto or Sexo por Compassion with Mariola Fuentes but it amused me.DS4 is static sterile impotent.  Gosh even zombie victims staggering off the original set of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers could have done better. Whew!  Gimme a break!";

	schema:reviewBody "The Black Swan And The Mark of Zorro show Tyrone Power at the height of his career. This was the Tyrone Power that the public wanted to see but who he got tired of being. He was constantly after 20th Century Fox and Darryl Zanuck to give him more challenging roles.Jamie Warring is another of Power's patented heroheel characterizations. When we first meet him Power's a totally unrepentant scalawag who has but one virtue loyalty to the former pirate leader Henry Morgan. Morgan by all accounts was an effective and charismatic leader both in this film and in history. But that leadership is put to the test when the British government decides he's the only man capable of dealing with his former compatriots.Laird Cregar as Morgan makes a plea for the group to turn honest.

He was constantly after 20th Century Fox and Darryl Zanuck to give him more challenging roles.Jamie Warring is another of Power's patented heroheel characterizations. When we first meet him Power's a totally unrepentant scalawag who has but one virtue loyalty to the former pirate leader Henry Morgan. Morgan by all accounts was an effective and charismatic leader both in this film and in history. But that leadership is put to the test when the British government decides he's the only man capable of dealing with his former compatriots.Laird Cregar as Morgan makes a plea for the group to turn honest. But there's a fly in the ointment. A dissident group led by George Sanders and Anthony Quinn don't want to give up the pirate lifestyle.

The sets and action sequences are the main merit of this film very majestic and wellstaged. You may think that any film with pirates would fall into predictability but this one doesn't it is original funny at times and has a touch of romance in it. The performances were excellent. Tyrone Power is surprisingly good in the title role though swashbuckling fans may be yearning for someone like Errol Flynn and Maureen O'Hara is beautiful beyond words as Margaret. It is probably true that their romance isn't quite as convincing as the one in The Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland but it is still a convincing and fairly witty one and rarely interferes with the focus of the film.

Everything about this film is worse  the script the acting the direction and especially the choreography for the swordfights Zorro does not for instance feature such obviously spedup footage in the fight scenes! Another disappointment is that The Black Swan spends way too much time developing its often tedious romance subplot. Maureen O'Hara is nice to look at and she does have some chemistry with Power but she rebuffs him again and again in scenes that get repetitive really fast.I don't want to sound too negative since there are aspects of this movie that I like. The plot deals with the compelling issue of pirates being forced to turn legitimate after Britain and Spain make peace. Some of them decide to work for the British crown while others go renegade. Watching this schism develop in the pirate community is pretty interesting.There are also a few good guest actors  notably Laird Craiger as Captain Morgan the guy on the rum bottle? His flamboyant costumes and overthetop dialog give the movie some life during segments when it might otherwise be slow and draggy.But despite a few good points The Black Swan is essentially just a lightweight action movie  the Pirates of the Caribbean of its day. A more literate and witty script might have elevated it to a higher level but alas the only line of dialog I can remember offhand is the English dog still barks! Hardly Shakespearean is it?".

This began with the remake of The Mark of Zorro 1940 and Mr. Power was suddenly compared to Douglas Fairbanks as a man he was more like Rudolph Valentino though not quite showing it all in Blood and Sand 1941. Each of these adventure films retains their sense of hokey fun.In this one Power's sex symbol status is complimented by a bare chest stubble and the beautiful Maureen O'Hara as Margaret Denby. All in Technicolor. Director Henry King and friendly costars like George Sanders as Billy Leech helped keep both Power and the public happy. Power performs smoothly with sword in The Black Swan but felt he deserved more varied roles.As an aside a writer at Paramount in the late 1980s mentioned walking over to Tyrone Power's grave which was near the studio so I tagged along. It was a beautiful fall day and the graveyard was deserted. At the time I had only a vague notion of who Power was  probably from seeing movies like The Black Swan on television  and was startled to see the star's final resting place so wellkept and adorned with fresh flowers.

A scene at the beginning has Sanders and Power guzzling ladles of rum out of a barrel while sitting on a beach with a couple of beautiful Latin maidens tied up to be carried off for sale to the highest bidder.

There is nothing too low that Jamie will not do. He assaults beats stalks and kidnaps a woman who is engaged to be married. How twisted is that? His brutality is a source of commentary throughout the movie. Even the other pirates find his behavior offensive yet he does not stop. The purpose of such offensive depictions is unclear. However it does add a morbid element to what apparently was intended to be light fare about pirates. Tyrone Power is exceedingly believable as an abusive piratemarauder and Maureen O'Hara gives one of her better performances as a woman who is the target for Jamie's harassment and abuse. Indeed so depraved is Jamie's behavior that he cannot understand why the woman keeps rejecting him. Indeed nothing in the movie including the intercession of other pirates can dissuade him from pursuing a damsel who is in distress entirely because of him. Whether this movie is meant to be a spoof on chivalry is unclear. What this movie definitely is not about is women's rights.".

As a result we have a perfect little motion picture that will outlive its critics and satisfy film buffs forever. Examine it and cherish it as it is  a comic book converted to eyecandy from the past and you always will treasure this piece of art as a permanent fixture in your home library.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie years and years ago with my grandfather who was a huge fan of the beautiful Maureen O'Hara. i just revisited this film recently and found it fun and entertaining. For some reason I never realized George Sanders was playing Leech! Wow. I hardly recognized him as the same actor who played Addison DeWitt in All About Eve. Never knew he could play any role other than the sophisticated creep but I was wrong. Also I found that his famous voice sounded different in this film but I'm sure that was done for the character. I've only seen Tyrone Power in one other film Witness for the Prosecution which is certainly a better showcase of his acting skills than this film. Nonetheless he shows himself to be a capable fencer and athletic actor. Unfortunately Power lacks the chemistry with O'Hara that Errol Flynn had with Olivia de Havilland in the similar film Captain Blood. However to be fair very few on screen couples past or present had the chemistry that Flynn and de Havilland did on screen those two just ignited chemistry even by just looking at one another. O'Hara is as always beautiful and appealing as the headstrong love interest of the lead character and her costumes are fantastic. To me though the real star of the film is Laird Cregar as Henry Morgan. His character gives the film a bit of depth and he steals every scene he's in. I had no idea he was only a year older than Power and that he died so young only 31 just two years after this film! but I suppose he always played older characters in films. All in all it's fun but not fantastic. The dialog is not memorable and the special effects have not aged very well. Still worth watching though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rafael Sabatini an Italianborn historical novelist who made his home in Britain is little remembered today but he was highly popular during the first half of the twentieth century and several of his novels most of which dealt with pirates or other swashbuckling adventurers were made into films. Errol Flynn for example starred in the 1935 adaptation of his Captain Blood. Tyrone Power was the nearest thing Flynn had to a rival in the swashbuckling department so he was perhaps a natural choice to star in this 1942 film based on another Sabatini novel about pirates.The action is set in the year 1674. The film opens with an English seaman named Jamie Waring being tortured by a dastardly Spaniard Don Miguel somewhere in the Caribbean. This scene is rather confusing and in fact something of a red herring one might think that the action is taking place in Spanish territory and that Don Miguel will be the villain of the piece but suddenly Lord Denby the English Governor of Jamaica appears and announces that England and Spain previously at war are now at peace. Waring is released and thereafter Don Miguel fades out of the film altogether.The reallife pirates of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries may have been ruthless villains but Hollywood has long had a soft spot for them romanticising them as dashing heroes just as it has often romanticised other categories of ruthless criminals such as Wild West outlaws or ProhibitionEra gangsters. This however is one film where the pirates are the bad guys. The good guys are those former pirates principally Waring who have seen the error of their ways and now fight on the side of law and order. The main villain is the notorious pirate Captain Billy Leech played by a young George Sanders. The film's title is taken from the name of Leech's ship. The main hero apart from Waring is his friend and colleague Henry Morgan now Denby's successor as Governor of Jamaica and tasked by the King with suppressing piracy in the area.Morgan of course was a real historical individual. In real life he always claimed that he was a privateer rather than a pirate and that he never attacked anyone other than the enemies of his King during wartime. The Spaniards who were his principal victims found this distinction a bit too fine for their liking and always referred to him as a pirate. A subplot deals with the romance between Waring and Denby's beautiful daughter Margaret. She is played by Maureen O'Hara as that stock figure of historical romances the proud fiery beauty who starts off loathing the hero and ends up passionately in love with him. One thing that helps Margaret change her mind is the discovery that her fianc Roger Ingram supposedly a respectable gentleman is secretly in league with Leech providing him with information about ship movements. O'Hara also plays Margaret with an Irish accent part of a fine mixture of accents in this production. Laird Cregar American born but educated in Britain plays Morgan with a historically correct Welsh accent but Power makes no attempt to hide his American accent even though Waring is supposedly a Londoner.Despite an occasionally confusing plot The Black Swan is visually attractive it won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography Colour with some good action sequences. The final handtohand duel between Waring and Leech can stand comparison with the famous one between Flynn and Basil Rathbone in The Adventures of Robin Hood. Even though it was made more than seventy years ago the film remains watchable today. Remarkably one of its stars O'Hara is still alive. 610".

There is a civil war going on and Jordan who has joined up on the side that appeals most to idealists of that era  like Ernest Hemingway and his friends  has been given a highrisk assignment up in the mountains. He awaits the right time to blow up a bridge in a cave. Pilar who is in charge there has an ability to foretell the future. And so that night she encourages Maria a young girl ravaged by enemy soldiers to join Jordan who has decided to spend the night under the stars.";

	schema:reviewBody "Reading some of the comments here left me wondering in some cases whether the writers had this film confused with some Bmovie potboiler. Some have written scathing contumelies with not a single positive remark to be found. It's amazing how differently two people from the same planet same culture can view the same thing. For me this has always been one of my favorite movies with very few flaws to be found. Gary Cooper could never be accused here or anywhere else of over acting. His style has always been one of understatement. He in fact was one of the actors who helped change the style of acting from the theatricality of the silents to the more realistic method still in vogue today. Here he is perfectly cast Hemingway would accept no otherthe quiet stoic ruggedly handsome American. Ingrid Bergman is my favorite actress so it's probably hard for me to be objective but I feel this is one of her greatest roles playing the damaged yet still innocent Maria it was in fact the role for which Bergman felt she would be most remembered. True her accent could hardly be mistaken for Spanish but this seems trivial when this is stacked up against her immense talent as an actress. The criticisms about her appearance have no justification at all as has been pointed out by others. All Spaniards do not look alike. Ms. Bergman is absolutely radiant luminous stunningly beautiful. Her scenes with Coop are wonderful. You can see Roberto's interest in her immediately first of a carnal nature but increasingly with tenderness and concern. Their's is one of the best love stories on film.The supporting characters are superlative Akim Tamiroff is fine as the once courageous but now cowardly and possibly treacherous Pablo Vladimir Sokoloff as the lovable aging guidebut where did they find Ms. Paxinou? Her Pilar is a fascinatingly vibrant character full of grit and valor and indomitable courage and yet capable of being deeply wounded by the thoughtless actions of a child. She apparently never did another film either before or after this onejust taking her well deserved Oscar and slipping away Edit Dec. 2005 I've since discovered that Ms. Paxinou DID appear in a few less prominent films after this one. It's true that war is not romantic and the film shows some of the horrors of this enterprise. It is also true that it does to some extent romanticize this war in that it emphasizes the selfsacrifice and courage of these people. In any case I feel most people will find themselves moved by the sacrifices and SPOILERS the doomed romance of the leads. The story has been altered a bit from the wonderful novel but this is inevitable. Still it follows it much more closely than most Hollywood filmizations. The scenery is spectacularthe color the cinematography are top notch and Victor Young has composed a lush and moving score that wonderfully underscores the action and emotions of the playershis creation being among the best in cinema history. The direction strikes an excellent balance between showing us the details of day to day survival by these hunted insurgents the suspense of battle and the growing romance. Some have criticized the dialogue but I find it quite believable. That last speech of Jordan's and his thoughts right after have in particular been singled out for scorn. But for me it is extraordinarily real. He doesn't utter some plasticized ideal of what a parting speech should beno it's something someone might actually say filled with simple but heartfelt phrases. Well dear reader you simply must see this film. Then judge for yourself whose comments are more accuratethose above or those who have reviled the film. I know where I'd put my money.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ernest Hemingway was most particular about how is work should be portrayed on screen. He had hated the version of A Farewell to Arms that was done ten years earlier.What he did like was Gary Cooper's portrayal of a Hemingway hero. He and Cooper got to be good friends so he was Papa's first and only choice to be Robert Jordan in For Whom the Bell Tolls.The novel grew out of Hemingway's experience in the Spanish Civil War that raged for almost four years. A number of generals not liking the leftist trend the new Spanish Republic was taking pulled a military coup d'etat. The whole world took sides with the Soviet Union aiding the Republic's defenders and Italy and Germany aiding the Nationalist Generals.The USA was officially neutral but people had their opinions. Believe it or not many supported the rebelling generals seeing them as upholding traditional Catholic Spain. But some in America organized the Abraham Lincoln Brigade a group of volunteers who fought for the Republic. Some in there were U.S. Communist Party members but a whole lot were idealists. All of them had a lot of difficulty after World War II for shall we say being to prematurely antiFascist.Gary Cooper plays just such a volunteer and he's got a mission to blow up a key bridge in the Guadarrama mountains. He makes contact with the guerrilla band of Akim Tamiroff and Katina Paxinou. Of course fighting with them is Ingrid Bergman so we had some romantic interludes there which steamed up the screen.This was quite a year for Ingrid she did Casablanca as well that year and her name became synonymous with romance. She was not the first choice here. Director Sam Wood did not like his original leading lady Vera Zorina and replaced her with Bergman who he really wanted in the first place.In fact Wood was a second choice. Paramount originally scheduled this film for Cecil B. DeMille. I'm betting there were some creative differences between DeMille and Papa Hemingway. If this had become a DeMille type film it would have been a disaster.Gary Cooper Ingrid Bergman Akim Tamiroff and Katina Paxinou all got Academy Award nominations. Only Paxinou won the Oscar for this film. A great performance but also probably a tribute to her refugee status. She had fled her native Greece when the Nazis took over where she was a leading member of their national theater. She accepted her Oscar in memory of her late colleagues there.The only criticism of the film came from those that thought it lingered too long on Cooper and Bergman's romance. Something by the way they were having in real life as well.But Ernest Hemingway liked the film just fine and I think most will as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film opens with a tolling bell and a quotation from John Donne's No Man Is an Island. Then the action literally explodes on the screen with an act of sabotage by Robert Jordan Gary Cooper who has just struck a blow for the young Spanish Republic against the fascist Nationalists. As one of about 60000 foreigners who have come to fight for Spain's freedom Jordan's story plays out against a background of cataclysmic world events.Jordan is immediately assigned the task of blowing up an important bridge behind the Nationalist lines in the Guadarrama Mountains near Segovia. The main story line follows him as he joins a ragtag troop of guerrillas in pursuit of his mission. The guerrillas are led by the forceful Pilar in an Academy Awardwinning portrayal by Katina Paxinou. An equally pivotal character in the band is cunning treacherous Pablo Akim Tamiroff who may at any moment defect to the Nationalist side if it profits him. The guerrillas are a motley crew of pan European characters each with his own life story and reason for being in that place at that time.And then there is the innocent vulnerable incredibly beautiful Maria Ingrid Bergman who was rescued from Nationalist rapists and is now protected by the guerrillas. Under Pilar's watchful eye Robert and Maria fall in love. With the signing of Ingrid Bergman to play the role of Maria Paramount jumped on the postCasablanca bandwagon. Echoes of the earlier film that were not in Hemingway's novel crop up as Robert morphs from the stalwart freedom fighter to the lover who is torn between duty and love. A lengthy film of about 160 minutes FWTBT takes time to explore the relationships between characters even the lesser lights. We find out who is strong and weak who is in favor of the war and who is not and get a glimpse into how each one might react when the chips are down. A particularly meaningful interchange is when Robert explains to the guerrillas that although the Communists are on their side under orders from the Soviet Cominterm the fascist governments of Germany and Italy are supplying the Nationalists with Panzer tanks and Stuka divebombers. In reality those governments were testing their armament in preparation for the coming world war.SPOILER The end of the film is a whirlwind series of scenes in which Robert almost single handedly demolishes the bridge as the Nationalist army approaches. Then fate takes a hand. To escape the guerrillas must ride across an open area through a hail of enemy machinegun and light artillery fire. Everyone makes it across but Robert bringing up the rear who is blown from his horse by an exploding shell. Too wounded to ride Robert must be left behind with a machinegun to slow the advance of the Nationalists. With courage and great pain Robert delivers his hill of beans and where I'm going you can't follow speeches to Maria. He promises that they will be together in spirit but stops short of saying We'll always have Guadarrama. Maria is thrown onto the back of a horse and the band gallops away her screams fading into the distance. Fighting nausea and unconsciousness Robert sets up the machinegun and fires directly into the camera mirrored at the end of Bataan with Robert Taylor. Smoke and cordite fill the screen and the scene dissolves to the giant bell tolling a warning to mankind.In 1943 Hemingway and the everyone in the film knew to their sorrow that the Nationalists had won the Civil War in 1939 and that Spain now lived under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco. They could not know that ironically with Franco's death in 1975 Spain named King Juan Carlos I sovereign of the democratic constitutional monarchy that rules the Kingdom of Spain today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based in Ernest Hemingway's world famous bestseller this film is one of those classical melodramas even though not in a Douglas Sirk style and maybe of quite another matter. In the book Hemingway worked up his own experiences in the Spanish Civil War of the 30s  the film was shot in the middle of World War II  and that is why certain things are plain clear. Of course the whole plot of the film takes place solely within the lines of the Republican forces. Of course it takes an unequivocal stand against Franco's fascism and its followers. Of course the male lead an expert for explosives is a sincere American who stands on the right side. But without any cynicism For Whom the Bell Tolls is in an utterly positive sense straight straightforward clear or however you want to word it.Sam Wood shaped the story through three strands the love between Mara Ingrid Bergman and Robert Gary Cooper the preparations of a detonation and the conflict in the group with Pablo Akim Tamiroff. Here Wood presents a set of excellent characters. Pablo brilliantly played by Tamiroff as the most enigmatic of the ensemble does not only bring trouble into the group but also impersonates a man who is torn between friendshipsolidarity and personal interest. Robert is a sober prudential reflecting man who knows what he wants but sees danger in his love for Mara. He is not an ignorant macho but someone who carefully listens evaluates and then decides. And then there is Pilar played by Katina Paxinou this rough angular active woman with heart a heart which is not only on the right place but also has a deep feeling for what is going wrong in her country and what danger is coming up for her and her people if Franco might win the war. It seems as if Wood adapted a real and important protagonist of the Civil War with the character of Pilar the Communist leader Dolores Ibarruri aka La Pasionaria.With this variety of human patterns Wood gives us a crosssection through a small spatially limited civil society where the story line can be interpreted in context to the events in 1943 in Europe. Hitler and his allies are at the high peak of their conquest and extermination campaigns. In this respect the film asks the question how democracy is going to work after the terror is defeated taking also those into account who are erratic and cowardly like Pablo. And it asks the question for consideration between betrayal and solidarity love and necessity.".

Because of the bravery of so many men and women of that time the freedom that many today take for granted was assured. But it is by no means permanent.The film is relatively heavy but certainly many modern films about current events are equally heavy. One is either involved or not but I found it a great story of a small group of people who have survived a great deal of pain in life and who have little to lose. The film presents the characters very well allowing us to like and understand them. It was shot in Technicolor on realistic locations and beautifully designed by William Cameron Menzies. The music by Victor Young is outstanding.In case anyone may not know Ingrid Bergman was the choice of Ernest Hemingway. In fact he went out of his way to see to it that the ballet dancer and actress Vera Zorina who was originally cast and who had begun shooting the film was replaced by Bergman. Hemingway also wanted Gary Cooper and no one else to play Robert Jordan. How can these actors be 'miscast' when the author who created the characters felt they were perfect for the roles?".

Nearly three hours in length originally with an intermission there ARE those epic moments issues of freedom sacrifice etc. but overall it was released midWWII as a drama and romance of a very high level equal to The African Queen. Handsome Gary Cooper and lovely Ingrid Bergman star with a cast of gritty mountain fighters including the bawdy toughasnails Katina Paxinou. Cooper is an explosives expert from America who makes the private effort to join the antifascists. He sees the writing on the wall if the Axis isn't stopped in Spain they'll take Europe England and then America which of course WAS the actual plan of Germany. Bergman is an accidental member of the fighters who was saved by this disparate band. The main goal is to destroy a huge important bridge spanning two mountains which the Axis needs for transporting troops and weapons. Despite the almost lurid Technicolor you CAN get it adjusted to something reasonable if you try or just switch it to bw this is an engaging if sometimes drawn out story of one effort to destroy one location by a small group of fighters who are willing to die for their people and freedom. The characters and story are more complex and unpredictable than a typical Hollywood film thanks to Hemmingway. The love story should be expected but IS used as a device to establish epic issues. By the end I was riveted to the increasingly tense outcome.".

Nonetheless as a film it is deadly. As others have correctly pointed out Gary Cooper was wooden throughout. He finally rises to the occasion in the last thirty seconds of the film where he realizes he has the strength to shoot the machine gun at the enemy by thinking of Maria Ingrid Bergman. It's also at this point that the film slips into voiceover mode it's jarring. Ingrid Bergman was without a doubt stunningly beautiful that could not be argued. I also felt that she was a good actress  but not necessarily in this film. It isn't her fault it's what she was given to work with  a dull uninspired script. Let's talk about that script. There were a lot of questions and answers that repeated the questions. There was mundane banal dull laughable. The movie went on endlessly and for what... because Gary had to blow up a bridge at dawn Those are orders!  and so we the viewing audience must also wait until dawn while Gary Ingrid and a band of misfits point fingers at each other drink wine eat and apparently never bathe or take a dump. The only actors that I found to be interesting were Katina Paxinou who had a sort of ferociousness about her performance and the Academy awarded her and Akim Tamiroff who looked like the original Hobbitt. As the movie wanders around mountains and fights between nationalists and republicans or somebody and somebody the only thing that seems to be of concern to Ingrid is whether Gary is okay. In fact that seems to be the only thing that matters to Katina as well. Despite all the talk of liberation and freeing themselves from their oppressors this was supposedly the Spanish Civil War all that seemed to matter was whether Ingrid was happy. While I did enjoy looking at Ingrid's pretty face and Gary's eyes were killer I could not understand what she saw in him. He was twice her age if not more and he kissed with the passion of a sedated goldfish. It's an old film. It's slow. I felt that emotions were manipulated beyond all reason. I just did not enjoy it. So 2 out of 10 1 for Ingrid's face 1 for Gary's eyes.".

Bergman gorgeously photographed and Cooper fall in love instantly and we are never in any doubt about that. They are surrounded by some of the talkiest guerilla fighters hiding out in a murky cave where much of the technicolor action takes place each with thick accents that don't seem to match their characters. Katina Paxinou certainly does a stunning job as Pilarand Akim Tamiroff is more than adequatebut the film becomes weary after the first hour and gets bogged down in too much talk before it finally zeros in on its main action sequence involving the blowup of a bridge. Again Hollywood fails to inject a Hemingway story with enough human interest and fails to make us care enough about these characters. Transition to the screen just doesn't work when it comes to Hemingway whose writing style is best confined to the novels he wrote. The only bright note is Victor Young's pseudoSpanish score which gives the picture its only lift. Not the film it was hyped to be at the time depending on its status as a bestseller by Hemingway for a builtin audience. Satisfaction not guaranteed unless you are a huge fan of Bergman and Cooper.".

The only bright note is Victor Young's pseudoSpanish score which gives the picture its only lift. Not the film it was hyped to be at the time depending on its status as a bestseller by Hemingway for a builtin audience. Satisfaction not guaranteed unless you are a huge fan of Bergman and Cooper.";

	schema:reviewBody "What a weird casting choice  Ingrid Bergman to play a Spanish freedom fighter.  At first I couldn't figure out what she was supposed to be American Swedish Eurotrash.  Then in the course of coming out to Gary Cooper she tells of how her father was the mayor of a Spanish town and they killed her mother and father in front of her and then did unspeakable things.This odd casting is made even worse by the romantic plot set against a background of Spanish Loyalistswith a politicallymotivated Gary Cooper as Ingles the American who leads the peasants plus a gypsy and Ingrid Maria cough cough as they blow up a bridge vital to Franco's nationalists.The action in this movie is excellent the scenery spectacular for its day and the character roles wellcast particularly Katina Paxinou as Pilara real women's lib type well before such existed in the real world.  Yet Pilar is a romantic.So as not to make Gary Cooper seem like a Communist they stuck him with a speech about how bad both the Russians and the Germans are and how both countries are just using Spain for a proxy war.  He is a freedom fighter who does not believe that the ultimate result of his actions will be freedom. But there is no reason given why he does it.  He doesn't do it for Ingrid because he only meets her when he starts hanging out with a loyalist cell that hangs out in some caves.  And he gives her up and dies for the cause but makes a speech about how he will always be with her.So this is really a romance with some terrorism thrown in rather than an action movie with romance.  And Ingrid is unbelievably bad  cloying annoying selfpitying and stupid.  The role is far beneath her talents. Cooper on the other hand is fine so long as the life is not drained out of him by Ingrid.So I gave the movie a 4.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Spanish Civil war is a conflict that has seared itself upon the romantic idealist . It's good versus evil of fascists on one side and idealistic freedom fighters from all across the world fighting to save a democratic socialist Republic from the jackboot of Hitler  Mussolini and Franco . Of course much of this conflict has been romanticized . It's often forgotten that Joseph Stalin was supporting the Republican cause while following his own agenda and the leftists spent more time fighting amongst themselves rather than fighting the Falangists . Regardless of this I've always viewed it as good versus evil  an opinion reinforced by a conversation I once had with a Spanish workmate who was of  Marrano Converso  linage whose grandparents were murdered by the Franco regime . I told her gloomily that's the worst thing about the 21st Century  there's no crusades to go on  no chance of jumping on a plane and changing the world . Though later when I thought about it there is a modern day equivalent and that is young people joining the military in NATO countries knowing fine well they'll be serving in Afghanistan fighting against murderous jihadists . Was it not Orwell himself who described all tyrannies being  theocracies in nature  ?Perhaps idealism gets the better of me and I have grown out of it because the opening scene of FOR WHOM THE BELLS TOLL has stayed with me since childhood . Two freedom fighters blow up a train  make their escape only for one of them to be wounded and he begs his comrade to shoot him . It's an impressive scene though its impact is negated having been done so many times in other films . I guess this was probably the first time I'd seen this type of scene and that's why it stayed with me . The mind of a child is very impressionable and idealistic I'm afraid that my idealism towards this film has become somewhat revisionist after seeing it again as an adult. Not a lot happens in the movie which is composed of a handful of characters sitting on two or three sets of studio exteriors spouting clichd melodramatic dialogue along with an annoying incidental score that never seems to go away . Interesting to note that the screenplay has most of its politics exercised and there's only one scene where the idealistic manly hero Robert Jordan played by Gary Cooper at his most wooden explaining the reason why he joined the good fight This means you're a watching a film lacking in scope . When I say nothing much happens I mean this literally . Some people might appreciate the set design or cinematography but the film concentrates on the romance between Jordan and Maria and Jordan's abrasive relationship with the band of Gypsies . There's very little sense of time and place and I had to keep reminding myself that it's set in Spain in 1937. It's also a film that is very static and dated even to fans of Classic Hollywood like myself and someone would do better reading George Orwell's Homage To Catalonia than watching this Hollywood melodrama".

	schema:reviewBody "Sorry but after waiting nearly 30 years to see this movie after I first read a review of it somewhere I find that its badness is confirmed in nearly every aspect of production. Beginning with the casting If Hemingway had anything to do with the choice of Cooper and or Bergman for the lead roles someone should have realized that he had no head for cinematic adaptation and shrewder minds should have prevailed. But EH was probably one of only a handful of famous authors whose production suggestions would have been taken seriously despite the fact that Ernest himself had said many times that he wouldn't dare set foot in Hollywood not for love or money. At least he understood his limitations. Too bad the studio heads didn't. To begin with the novel of For Whom The Bell Tolls is probably one of Hemingway's least successful novels and as a consequence following its basic structure was probably a recipe for celluloid disaster. As the critics have said over and over Hemingway's psychological self projection of his imaginary persona into a series of heman leading partsbeginning with the Nick Adams stories and continuing through Death in the Afternoon The Green Hills of Africa and To Have and Have Not and extended after FWTBT with Across The River and Into The Trees and Islands in the Streammarred most of his fictional efforts. In imagining himself as the doomed rugged crusty soldieroffortuneharddrinking levelheaded romantically vainglorioushe created a series of improbable cardboard tragic heroes whose wooden dialog and fatalistic affected charm appeared increasingly dated as the years passed.I won't go into detail about the production values of the Sam Wood fiasco except to note that Ingrid Bergman's camp charade as the buffedup Hollywood version of an oversexed Spanish hottie with cropped hair and perfect teeth had me rolling in the proverbial aisle. Realistic values notwithstanding it was also a bit much to see Tamiroff and Paxinou stomping around looking grim and picturesque as Spanish peasantpuppets a role reprised by Tamiroff in Topkapifor laughs. The best part of the movie surprisingly enough were the cinematic tricks used to create split screen depthlandscapes and backdrops which probably saved hundreds of thousands in location shotsthe work is really superior and deserves to be studied. My favorite is the one where the hairpin mountain road is pictured with military trucks moving in three directions at once from a camera angle far above. That's not something that I recall having been tried again until Patton where the jeep convoys crisscross up a steep hilly terrain in the scenes for the invasion of Sicily. Probably the biggest problemsaside from the bad casting wooden dialog and peculiar meandering quality to the narrationis that audiences today hardly realize the complex political social philosophical and religious issues which played out in Spain in the 1930's. All we really think we need to know is that this blundering American is blowing up bridges and needs to get his rocks off which side he is fighting for and why probably is of little concern to presentday audiences. We're certain of one thing though If Maria was raped by those Fascist bastards that's probably all the proof we need that they deserve our hatred. In the end I was left wondering why the little ragtag band couldn't improvise a quick mounted getaway for Cooper but that would certainly have gotten in the way of the tragic hero's demise mowing down cavalry with a rusty old machinegun. Moviemaking has come a long way since 1943 and thank god for that. It's astonishing to note that this movie was made in the same year as Casablanca another vintage effort that has as many things right with it as this movie has wrong ones.".

But I found the film to be an overlong bore centering around a leaden Gary Cooper playing the clichd embodiment of Hollywood's idea of a romantic soldier of fortune and a ludicrously miscast blonde Swede Ingrid Bergman as a Spanish freedom fighter. Like most of the movie Bergman is distractingly gorgeous and the filmmakers' choice to shoot it in opulent Technicolor often undercuts the dramatic weight of the story.Far more convincing than the two leads are Katina Paxnou who richly deserved the Oscar she won and Akim Tamiroff as characters grounded with human flaws and inconsistencies that make them compelling as opposed to the stupefyingly boring Cooper and Bergman whose only interest comes from the undeniable sexual chemistry that they project. It might have been a perfectly unobjectionable little 1940s adventure film were it not for a script that takes two hours and fortyfive minutes to tell a story that frankly isn't very interesting to begin with.Things finally do start to rev up in the second half when the handsome and heroic Cooper finally starts to play out the manly mission that threw him in the midst of the freedom fighters to begin with but up to then I found my patience weighed down by Cooper and Bergman making googoo eyes at each other while PaxnouTamiroff  Company bicker amongst one another often using Hemingway's flowery prose for dialogue that is completely out of step with their characters.If you're an advocate of Hemingway's brand of ultramasculine romanticism you should probably disregard this review. But if you're a more objective viewer while the film certainly has its positive aspects usually when Paxnou or Tamiroff is on the screen be prepared to mouth the word overrated after sitting through its lengthy runtime.".

Oh and Gary Cooper.Hollywood in the 1940s was never particular about these niceties. A foreign accent was a foreign accent. In many of the movies of the period a British accent would serve for Axis spies.But who cares right? This is Hemingway after all and old Ernie can overcome this kind of wanton casting. Except that Hemingway was always difficult to transpose to film. His best passages  those pebbles in the clear stream the frozen carcass of the leopard on Mount Kilmanjaro  tended to be descriptive. His dialog sometime very funny could also be very purple ultra violet even and those seemed to be the particular pieces of dialog that appealed to writers and producers. Here we're stuck with Ingrid Bergman's first kiss. Where do the noses go? And that long incomprehensible explanation by Gary Cooper of why Bergman must leave him and his broken leg behind to provide a rear guard for the others. If you go we both go. Go and we go together. But if you stay we don't go so we don't go together. Something like that. At least he doesn't say Forget about me. Save yourselves. And we're also spared from the novel the observation that when Cooper and Bergman have sex the earth moved. Hemingway had a fable about dealing with Hollywood. You drive up to the California border. The producers are on the other side. You throw them the manuscript and they throw you the check. Then you drive away fast.The movie is really constructed in four acts. I Gary Cooper the ex prof is introduced to the dozen or so guerrilla fighters hiding out and slowly rotting in the mountains. II. Cooper romances Bergman. III. El Sordo Joseph Calleia the Maltese is trapped on a mountain top and dies fighting Franco's troops and airplanes. IV. Cooper and his companeros blow a bridge and some of them are killed including Cooper.The locations were shot in the beautiful crisp air and granite rocks and evergreens of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. The outdoor imagery is very impressive. Most of the scenes are shot in a damp dark cave that looks studiobuilt. The robust and ugly Katina Paxinou livens up these scenes and it's a good thing because most of the dynamics are a little gloomy. Akim Tamiroff in a dramatic part is half coward half burntout revolutionary. Some of his grimmer lines are in context almost funny what with his echtRussian accent. Sullen and resentful his face painted a ghoulish green Tamiroff swills down wine and insults people at random until people punch and slap him and threaten to kill him. His mantra is smothered in sour cream and mushrooms and cabbage soup  I doan prowoke. Cooper is pretty good. He's handsome and virile he manages to activate both facial expressions and it fits the part. And Ingrid Bergman is nicely tanned considering that she's just spent a winter in the icy mountains of Spain. Her short haircut detracts not at all from her fresh beauty. She glows with her love for Cooper. At one point the script has her become hysterical as her lover rides off to battle. Oh please bring him back safely. Please. I big you. I will do anything you say! and she buries her sobbing face against the neck of an indifferent horse. I wonder if the writers deliberately tried to torpedo what virtues were found in the novel.The film like the novel takes sides. Well  it HAS to. Who in 1943 was going to give a break to Hitler and Mussolini? But the Republican side doesn't come off as exactly saintly. When they take over a town they drunkenly torture and kill anyone who was linked to the loyalists. It's a horrifying scene a flashback narrated by Paxinou. Overall a film with considerable impact even today.".

This DVD deserves a perfect 5 this is the second that I give after ROBOCOP director's cut.130 minutes of absolute pleasure with actors who were real stars  Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. The colors are wonderful the scenery superb and the musical score terrific.But I hear someone out there complaining  Gosh ! It's a 1943 movie an antiquity. Don't be afraid you will not be disappointed. There are also in this movie explosions gunfires and even torrid love scenes. Just observe how Ingrid Bergman plays with her hair in order to seduce Gary and you will forget all the actual little starlets.This story of a threedays love affair during the Spain civil war is about idealism selfsacrifice and hope. Themes that I agree are not specially in in 1998 but were developed by Ernest Hemingway one of the best american writers.A healthy DVD in order to clean our eyes and ears.".

It comes across now  to me at least  as a film of individual performances rather than as a whole and Katina Paxinou towers so far above the rest of the cast that she threatens to overbalance the whole thing. Watching it today it's very difficult to believe that Akim Tamiroff's Pablo wasn't laughed off the screen it's so OTT. Topbilled Gary Cooper is as wooden as ever and there's no more chemistry between him and Ingrid Bergman that there was between him and Audrey Hepburn in Wilder's Love In The Afternoon some fourteen years later. Bergman of course is just simply ravishing and makes no attempt at a Spanish accent but who cares. To watch a film about one war whilst the world was embroiled in another global war is always going to be different than watching it in peacetime but even allowing for that this is not something to which I'll want to return.".

It seemed a little odd also that Maria was so smiling and happy all the time  when she had gone through such an awful experience as a gang bang recently. The woman playing Pilar was wonderful though  strange that I had not even heard of her before.I did not like the ageism. I mean when Pilar who was of Robert Jordan's age at least the actors playing them were of the same age talked about herself as an old woman and seemed to think that it was a matter of course that it was Jordan and the very young Maria who should become a couple. That no one could love her anymore when she was only 43...It was difficult to understand what the war was all about and who the waring parties were. But I read now that the filmmakers did this on purpose  for political reasons.But the worst thing was that the movie did not feel like Hemingway. It could have been any action story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman smoulder in this Hemingway adaptation. Filmed in glorious Technicolour the two stars give among their best performances amidst the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War.I wonder why this film seems to be almost forgotten today. It certainly had a huge effect on me after my first viewing it stayed with me for days. The CooperBergman teaming was amazing. Coop gives a great performance and is very attractive as our hero Robert Jordan. American Jordan is working for the Republicans hiding out in the mountains for the opportunity to blow up a bridge. A band of native freedom fighters are assisting him in his task led by the strongwilled Pilar Katina Paxinou. With them is the shy innocent Maria Ingrid Bergman. Maria has endured a horrible past with the murder of her parents and her rape it is implied though never mentioned because of that Hayes Codeby enemy soldiers. Jordan who she calls 'Roberto' and Maria fall in love and Coop fights himself fighting for more than the noble cause.This is nicely disguised war propaganda from the 40's. World War Two was then in it's element and a story of the Spanish Civil War with an American hero combating the fascists communists etc must have seemed appropriate. Still that assumption is not taking anything from the overall product we have here. It's a great adventureromance story wellcrafted and handled for it's time. Many comments have been made about the Swedish Bergman playing a Spanish girl but I for one have no qualms with it. Many Spanish have blonde hair and blue eyes and Bergman's acting is excellent here. I just love the scene where her character gets her first kiss from Coop. Her line 'I do not know how to kiss or I would kiss you. Where do the noses go?' is one of the most memorable and sweet in the entire film.An actress with incredible range Bergman could play both the innocent and the seductive with ease. Just compare her role here with her Alicia in 'Notorious' 1946. Coop is often accused of being wooden but his underplaying only adds to his performance. There are never any silly theatrics from Coop his acting style is quiet measured and steady perfectly suiting his character. A colourful range of supporting actors complete the cast. Also there has been criticism of the handling of Hemingway's brisk dialogue. Yes it loses impact when transferred to the screen but Coop's last speech to Maria'Wherever you go I go' is never anything but powerfully felt.910.".

Most of them are quite Marxist and there is this proletarian sidetheme going on during the movie.  But the primary storyline follows the film student mentioned above I cannot remember his name. One day he is out filming and someone grabs his Bolex film camera.  He chases after him trying to get it back but he turns a corner and sees the person that he was pursuing on the rooftop of a building holding his camera.  He blinks for a second and the person has jumped off of the building and the police have started to gather around him.  The film student grabs his camera from next to the dead thief and starts to run away from the police.  They capture him beat him and he wakes up at his friends' house wondering where the camera is.  He tries to describe what happened to one of his closest friends who says that his story could not have happened because she was with him the whole day.  In any case they somehow acquire the film that was shot by the person who committed suicide and the movie is about understanding this person's last film which is said to be his last will and testament. There are some parts that are pretty funny in the movie too.  There is the radical Marxist in the group who is always accusing the others of funny things there are the funny intellectual film student debates about abstract concepts and there is this strange relationship between the two main characters the primary film student and his friend which I would not call a love affair but it figures into the story somehow.  The movie deals with alternate realities and captured life vs. real life and all sort of artarguments like that.  I liked this movie.".

It's entirely appropriate that this film have so many names as it's so many things at once. A lament for the decline in activism or more aptly activism that really means something a film about film and a film about the director these three at least though more meanings about selfexpression political affiliations personal relationships perception death and who knows what could also be equally true. The first two times I viewed it I appreciated on the level of Film about Film self referentiality needing the least amount of context just the film itself. The film begins with an act of filming who is filming is left open and becomes a key component of the story arc only to be altered and left open to question throughout. Borrowing cameras filming viewing films and contemplating cinema art dominate the dialogue. There is a narrative structure but it is changed manipulated and experimented with so often and at such levels that its constantly thrown into question. This is a film about film which operates only on dream logic and in this way also repeats itself without answering important questions. It would be a waste of space to recount the plot details as whether or not what's happening is really happening doesn't matter again though part of what makes it fascinating is the confusion built by the details. The film says much about the pointlessness of filming landscapes but in the end its a landscape all the same with no real action. Hard to explain and much better said by the film. Gorgeous full frame flattened black and white cinematography. Whatever you have to do to see this do it.".

This is a film about film which operates only on dream logic and in this way also repeats itself without answering important questions. It would be a waste of space to recount the plot details as whether or not what's happening is really happening doesn't matter again though part of what makes it fascinating is the confusion built by the details. The film says much about the pointlessness of filming landscapes but in the end its a landscape all the same with no real action. Hard to explain and much better said by the film. Gorgeous full frame flattened black and white cinematography. Whatever you have to do to see this do it.";

The thief jumps to his death holding the camera. The police show up but the student grabs the camera which he claims is his. The police give chase and get the camera back. The student chases on foot after the police car that has the camera but loses it in a long dark traffic tunnel. The student wakes up surrounded by his friends all members of a communist protest group devoted to filming the upcoming revolution. They recount a very different story than what we have just seen.

The student get fixated on the dead man's girlfriend and tries to solve the mystery which he is convinced can be solved by watching the film in the confiscated camera.Oshima who was a bit older than the characters portrayed in this film clearly has some things to say about the turbulent youth protest movements of the time. That makes the film interesting and perplexing at the same time. There are certainly things going on in this film that don't travel well across culture and time. The dialog between the revolutionary group is funny and insightful about people with big plans for society but no means to actually implement the sweeping changes they propose. In a way this is the problem with the film for this viewer.There seems to be three films going on here one a sort of metaphysical mystery film another a commentary about the student protest movement and third the standard ATG nudity and sexual violence art drivel. I have now seen enough of the ATG output to know that they frequently required their film makers to cram in at least two rape scenes per movie. Besides the repulsiveness of such scenes here they serve little real purpose that I can discern except to titillate the frustrated Japanese male audience.The end result is a fascinating really well photographed interesting movie that ends up a bit unfocused. Maybe that was part of the point. Unfortunately the ending telegraphed itself to me but I was captivated to the end.".

When he gets the opportunity to run for marshal Seton finds himself running against the respected local schoolteacher William Cantrell. Not is what it seems however. While acting as the upstanding citizen in public Cantrell is dangerously ambitious and is prepared to do anything to make his mark and his fortune on the Territory. When he loses the race for marshal he forms a group of raiders who run guns into the territory and rob and terrorize settlers throughout the territory. Eventually donning Confederate uniforms it is left to Seton and the good citizens of Lawrence to face Cantrell and his raiders in one final clash.";

In fact they put him back in some Three Mesquiteer films for a while. I'm sure it took a little negotiating on his part but Republic finally decided to give him an A film under its own banner. Which set a pattern for his career over the next decade. The Duke would do at least one prestige film a year for Republic but Herbert J. Yates would make just as much money loaning him out to the big studios also.This is not the story of William Quantrill. In fact like Inherit the Wind where the real life Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan are given pseudonyms Quantrill here is named Cantrell. He's played quite well by a loan out from MGM Walter Pigeon.Pigeon in essaying Cantrell has captured the character of a man desperate to succeed and not particularly caring about what he has to do. His character is conveyed in the scenes he has with Marjorie Main as his mother. When she and Pigeon talk about the family of outlaws they left in Ohio his background is vividly portrayed. Their words and the way they deliver them give us what Piddgeon's real nature is.In fact Pigeon was heading towards the height of his career. Next year in How Green Was My Valley and the year after in Mrs. Miniver he was in back to back Best Picture Oscar winners. Not too shabby for that man.John Wayne gets his third film with Claire Trevor which almost qualifies them as big a screen team as the Duke with Maureen O'Hara. She was in his breakthrough film Stagecoach and Alleghany Uprising with Wayne. Later on she was also in the cast of The High and the Mighty as one of the passengers on that nearly ill fated flight.The Duke sits real tall in the saddle in his role as Bob Seton the man who had a host of sayings from Texas. He's got an appropriate acolyte here as well in Roy Rogers who made one of his few departures from his own B western films at Republic. Rogers is Claire Trevor's younger brother in Dark Command with Scottish banker Porter Hall as their father. Pigeon's ruthlessness is never more graphically demonstrated than when he both defends Rogers in court after Rogers murders a northern man in Lawrence Kansas with Pigeon as his defense attorney by day. But as a night rider he and his gang intimidate the prospective jurors with the inevitable results. Look for some good performances by both Gabby Hayes and Raymond Walburn in roles that were tailor made for the talents of each.The film is directed by Raoul Walsh who gave John Wayne a first chance at stardom in The Big Trail back in 1929. That film flopped for many reasons but John Wayne eventually made it to the top. Not too many folks in Hollywood get a second chance but Wayne sure made the most of is. For reasons though that I can't explain he and Walsh never worked together again. Odd because Wayne was definitely the kind of action star Walsh worked with best.Although John Wayne is the hero and he's his usual Duke the film really turns on Pigeon's performance as Cantrell. It's the most complex part in the film and it's a bit of offbeat casting for him. Still I recommend it to John Wayne fans wherever they be.".

	schema:headline " Quantrell Bloody Kansas and W.R.Burnett.";
	schema:reviewBody "If the South can make a case that the abolitionist figure John Brown was not a martyr but a maniac murderer and traitor the North can point to the socalled proSouthern guerilla leader William Clarke Quantrell or Quantrill as a bloodthirsty killer and thief and the trainer of a generation of criminals i.e. his followers included Cole Younger and Frank James...and maybe Jesse James too.  The fact is that Bloody Kansas was where the violence that became our Civil War began and it lasted there for more than the four years of the actual war. There are few movies that tackle this story.  SEVEN ANGRY MEN and SANTA FE TRAIL gave us versions of Brown's story.  There is a film called THE JAYHAWKER with Fess Parker and Jeff Chandler about a proSouthern fighter in Kansas.  And there are about four mentioning Quantrell though none are totally factual.  Most though do touch on the one event of his career that everyone recalls the massacre at the town of Lawrence Kansas in August 1863.  Lawrence was the center of the abolitionist movement in the state and it's leading citizen was James Lane a particularly violent antislavery fanatic who became first Senator from the state.  Quantrell was responsible for ordering the deaths of nearly 150 men and boys but failed to get Lane whom he wanted to burn at the stake  the Senator managed to hide in the field of corn in the back of his farm. Quantrell barely survived the war  he was shot in the back trying to flee Federal troops in Kentucky where he had gone in a ridiculous plan to reach Washington and assassinate Lincoln little did he know someone else had similar plans.  This film culminates in the attack on Lawrence  but here Quantrell is beaten back when Seaton John Wayne reaches the town to warn the citizens that the guerillas are on their way.  In short DARK COMMAND shows that the sacking of Lawrence was a failure.  Regretably it was a success. Quantrell here Cantrell was a teacher at one point of his career but he was also a thief and murderer before he found he could turn himself into a guerilla chief.  His patriotism is still questioned.  Southern leaders like General Sterling Price never fully trusted him  they suspected his motives and goals and did not like the unregimented nature of his followers. Still however they let him have his semiindependent command.  To be fair the North too could have violent allies in their cause.  Witness the actions in 1862 of General John Turchin who let his Federal troops loot a southern town. Turchin was sidetracked for awhile but back on the battlefield later in the war.Keeping in mindthen that the film does take liberties with the historical record it remains the best film about Quantrell.  It does capture the spirit of sectionalism that rent Kansas society apart and it does capture the nature of Quantrell and his opportunism.  In Walter Pigeon it has an interesting surprise.  Pigeon is with Robert Montgomery and Franchot Tone and Robert Young one of the leading second string leading men at MGM in the 1930s and 1940s usually in comedies.  In his case he also was teamed by accident as it turned out with Greer Garson in a series of films from MRS. MINIVER onward.  Here he has one of his rare western roles another is as the sheriff in THE GIRL OF THE GOLDEN WEST with Eddy and MacDonald and one of his few villains another would be Morbeus in FORBIDDEN PLANET. He is quite effective  witness the scene when he addresses the jury at the trial of Roy Rogers  a jury he has individually intimidated in a nightrider disguise  repeating the word pain again and again.  This performance is the central one though Wayne's Seaton is suitably relaxed and a balance to Pigeon.  Roy Roger's young McCloud is a surprise too  as he shows a hurt anger in much of the film.  Highly unusual for him.  Claire Trevor gives her normal good performance  she has a nice chemistry with Wayne and also does well with Pigeon.  In the support one can name Gabby Hayes Marjorie Main ultimately a sad performance reminding one of her similarly unhappy mother of a monster in DEAD END and Porter Hall as the stubborn banker father of Rogers and Trevor. Even Raymond Walburn has some funny moments one as a nonpaying customer of Hayes.Finally take note that this film is based on a tale by W.R.Burnett. Forgotten by most of the public he was an above average pulp novelist who gave the world LITTLE CAESAR HIGH SIERRA and WHITE HEAT.  Usually he did prototypes of film noir especially WHITE HEAT so DARK COMMAND is a pleasant surprise that he could handle westerns as well as crime.".

	onyx:emotionText "If the South can make a case that the abolitionist figure John Brown was not a martyr but a maniac murderer and traitor the North can point to the socalled proSouthern guerilla leader William Clarke Quantrell or Quantrill as a bloodthirsty killer and thief and the trainer of a generation of criminals i.e. his followers included Cole Younger and Frank James...and maybe Jesse James too.  The fact is that Bloody Kansas was where the violence that became our Civil War began and it lasted there for more than the four years of the actual war. There are few movies that tackle this story.  SEVEN ANGRY MEN and SANTA FE TRAIL gave us versions of Brown's story.  There is a film called THE JAYHAWKER with Fess Parker and Jeff Chandler about a proSouthern fighter in Kansas.  And there are about four mentioning Quantrell though none are totally factual.  Most though do touch on the one event of his career that everyone recalls the massacre at the town of Lawrence Kansas in August 1863.  Lawrence was the center of the abolitionist movement in the state and it's leading citizen was James Lane a particularly violent antislavery fanatic who became first Senator from the state.  Quantrell was responsible for ordering the deaths of nearly 150 men and boys but failed to get Lane whom he wanted to burn at the stake  the Senator managed to hide in the field of corn in the back of his farm. Quantrell barely survived the war  he was shot in the back trying to flee Federal troops in Kentucky where he had gone in a ridiculous plan to reach Washington and assassinate Lincoln little did he know someone else had similar plans.  This film culminates in the attack on Lawrence  but here Quantrell is beaten back when Seaton John Wayne reaches the town to warn the citizens that the guerillas are on their way.  In short DARK COMMAND shows that the sacking of Lawrence was a failure.  Regretably it was a success. Quantrell here Cantrell was a teacher at one point of his career but he was also a thief and murderer before he found he could turn himself into a guerilla chief.  His patriotism is still questioned.  Southern leaders like General Sterling Price never fully trusted him  they suspected his motives and goals and did not like the unregimented nature of his followers. Still however they let him have his semiindependent command.  To be fair the North too could have violent allies in their cause.  Witness the actions in 1862 of General John Turchin who let his Federal troops loot a southern town. Turchin was sidetracked for awhile but back on the battlefield later in the war.Keeping in mindthen that the film does take liberties with the historical record it remains the best film about Quantrell.  It does capture the spirit of sectionalism that rent Kansas society apart and it does capture the nature of Quantrell and his opportunism.  In Walter Pigeon it has an interesting surprise.  Pigeon is with Robert Montgomery and Franchot Tone and Robert Young one of the leading second string leading men at MGM in the 1930s and 1940s usually in comedies.  In his case he also was teamed by accident as it turned out with Greer Garson in a series of films from MRS. MINIVER onward.

It's also a transitional film mixing in elements and actors from the long line of Republic horse operas of the 1930s with themes leads and a director more in line with the A pictures of its day. The real star is the heavy Cantrell Walter Pidgeon who begins as a schoolteacher and ends as a cynical partisan leader with no real allegiance. John Wayne is no slouch here but his role is too much the conventional good guy to allow him to outsize Pidgeon.  Roy Rogers actually gets to kill a guy and Gabby Hayes plays something more than a caricature.Now for the history There wasn't really a time warp in 1861 Kansas that allowed people to get Colt Model 1873 revolvers which everyone in the movie except Claire Trevor seems to pack.  Sergio Leone got away with it in The Good the Bad and the Ugly though so I will forgive Mr. Walsh. Cantrell is VERY loosely based on William Quantrill a Confederate guerrilla leader who actually burned Lawrence KS during the Civil War.  Thirty years after Dark Command John Wayne would play a former member of Quantrill's Raiders in True Grit.".

The love at first sight ended happily despite the detour of another marriage. Set in the times of the American Civil War the story told of turmoil courage uncertainty and unswerving love.When Bob Seton arrived in this small town from Texas he meant to just pass by this Kansas town on his way to something big.

Hugely expensive and one of the first talkie westerns unfortunately it was a box office bomb with Wayne unfairly shouldering most of the blame. The present film is a mixed westernCivil War dramacomedy set in bleeding Kansas. Wayne has plenty of support from a cast of well known actors in this wellpaced film. Claire Trevor is actually given top billing as the belle around which Wayne Walter Pigeon and a young Roy Rogers revolve. It seems highly implausible that Wayne as illiterate drifter Bob Seton should become infatuated with prim snobbish Claire nor that she could ever consider him husband material. Wayne's persistence in promoting this unlikely union even after her marriage is a recurring source of comedy and drama. Initially another source of comedy is the recently established working partnership between Wayne and Gabby Hayes a former doctor reformulated as a traveling dentist barber and whatever else he can fix for you. Character actor Raymond Walburn also provides a comedic touch as a bugeyed stammering stuffedshirt of a judge and apparent mayor of Lawrence Kansas. Roy Rogers looks rather incongruous as the frustrated brother of Claire under his father's overbearing thumb who yearns to be a cowboy or soldier. His hot head gets him into big trouble several times during the film. Wayne on the other hand with the backing of Hayes changes from an apparent hothead to an honest coolheaded sheriff despite his illiteracy. Walter Pigeon is the eloquentspeaking legally literate but financially struggling rival of Wayne for the affections of Claire and for the office of sheriff. The striking contrast in personalities and skills of Wayne and Pigeon in their various competitions is another recurring source of comedy and drama. We wonder why Pigeon with his obvious talent for oratory and knowledge of law isn't a lawyer rather than a poorly paid schoolteacher? We suspect that he has been a lawyer but was forced to resign for some transgressions. In engineering Roger's defense in his murder trial we see the snake that he is behind all that eloquence.Things get a lot more serious and complicated as the story progresses. Pigeon as William Cantrell knows he is a natural leader of men. Frustrated in obtaining a prominent position in the political establishment of Lawrence he organizes a large band of outlaws posing as Confederate soldiers as did his historical counterpart William Quantrell. The film title may suggest this evil gang of thieves and murders or it may equally suggest the fact that most of the violent and smuggling encounters take place at night. Pigeon faces the difficult task of trying to justify or hide from his new wife his ongoing rapacious activities. The continuing back and forth relationships between Wayne Rogers Pigeon and Claire provide much of the drama in the later part of the film. In fact their tangled relationships remind me very much of those in another western released just the year before Union Pacific another of my favorite westerns.".

	schema:headline " Bleeding Kansas";
	schema:reviewBody "Although the American Civil War officially broke out in 1861 armed hostilities between supporters and opponents of slavery had been going on for several years prior to that in some parts of the USA especially in Missouri and Kansas which became known as bleeding Kansas. Dark Command is a film which explores this period of American history. The main character is a young man named Bob Seton who arrives in the town of Lawrence Kansas some time in the late 1850s. The first part of the film is dull and slowmoving dealing with Seton's unsuccessful courtship of Mary McCloud the pretty daughter of the town's Scottish born banker and his attempt to start a political career by running for Marshal. He also makes the acquaintance of the local schoolmaster William Cantrell who is his rival in both love and politics. Things start to get more exciting when Seton wins the election John Wayne was always more convincing as an action hero than as a screen lover and as Marshal Seton has plenty of work on his plate. Disappointed by the failure of his hopes for a career in law enforcement Cantrell decides to take up a career in law breaking and forms his own gang of outlaws to terrorise the district. He is careful however to ensure that his identity is never discovered so remains a mildmannered teacher by day an audacious bandit chief by night. Cantrell as his name might suggest is based on a real historical figure William Quantrill.The area is sharply divided between proNorthern and proSouthern factions and matters come to a head when Mary's hotheaded proslavery brother Fletcher shoots a man dead in an argument about politics. Mary offers to marry Seton if he will grant her brother bail but he has too much integrity to agree knowing that Fletcher will abscond if given the chance. In desperation Mary turns to Cantrell who manages to secure Fletcher's acquittal partly through his eloquence but mostly through the simpler expedient of intimidating the jurymen. Most films from this period with a Civil War theme tended to sit on the fence politically in order to avoid alienating either Northern or Southern audiences an exception is Belle Starr from the following year which is quite disgracefully proSouthern. Dark Command is never quite as biased but even so the filmmakers tend to distort history to make their film more acceptable south of the MasonDixon Line. The real Quantrill was a Rebel guerrilla whose activities were initially sanctioned by the Confederate high command. They eventually disowned him because of his brutal methods. Here Cantrell is simply an opportunist robber with no connection to the Confederate forces but who dresses his men in stolen Confederate uniforms as a disguise. The murderous Fletcher McCloud who for a time joins Cantrell's gang is allowed to redeem himself by joining the good guys. A rare example during the Production Code era of a murderer getting away with his crime unpunished and a rare example of the normally cleancut Roy Rogers playing a criminal. The hero Seton himself turns out to be from Texas although Wayne does not attempt a Texan accent. Rogers does give Fletcher a Southern accent but his efforts are undermined by the fact that Claire Trevor as his supposed sister sounds Northern and Porter Hall as their father Angus is definitely Scottish. This was the only film which Wayne and Rogers both major Western icons made together. It was also the only film Wayne made with director Raoul Walsh apart from The Big Trail Wayne's first leading role from ten years earlier. It has its moments such as the scene near the end when Cantrell's gang attack the town of Lawrence recreating an actual attack by Quantrill's Raiders. Too much time however is taken up with the romantic subplot especially as Mary never seems a very sympathetic character. Seton may be prepared to overlook her obvious flaws such as her blatant attempts to pervert the course of justice to save her worthless brother or the lack of judgement which leads her to accept Cantrell as a husband. Audiences may be less charitable. In my view this will never really count as a major entry in Wayne's filmography. 510".

	onyx:emotionText "Although the American Civil War officially broke out in 1861 armed hostilities between supporters and opponents of slavery had been going on for several years prior to that in some parts of the USA especially in Missouri and Kansas which became known as bleeding Kansas. Dark Command is a film which explores this period of American history. The main character is a young man named Bob Seton who arrives in the town of Lawrence Kansas some time in the late 1850s. The first part of the film is dull and slowmoving dealing with Seton's unsuccessful courtship of Mary McCloud the pretty daughter of the town's Scottish born banker and his attempt to start a political career by running for Marshal. He also makes the acquaintance of the local schoolmaster William Cantrell who is his rival in both love and politics. Things start to get more exciting when Seton wins the election John Wayne was always more convincing as an action hero than as a screen lover and as Marshal Seton has plenty of work on his plate. Disappointed by the failure of his hopes for a career in law enforcement Cantrell decides to take up a career in law breaking and forms his own gang of outlaws to terrorise the district. He is careful however to ensure that his identity is never discovered so remains a mildmannered teacher by day an audacious bandit chief by night. Cantrell as his name might suggest is based on a real historical figure William Quantrill.The area is sharply divided between proNorthern and proSouthern factions and matters come to a head when Mary's hotheaded proslavery brother Fletcher shoots a man dead in an argument about politics. Mary offers to marry Seton if he will grant her brother bail but he has too much integrity to agree knowing that Fletcher will abscond if given the chance. In desperation Mary turns to Cantrell who manages to secure Fletcher's acquittal partly through his eloquence but mostly through the simpler expedient of intimidating the jurymen. Most films from this period with a Civil War theme tended to sit on the fence politically in order to avoid alienating either Northern or Southern audiences an exception is Belle Starr from the following year which is quite disgracefully proSouthern. Dark Command is never quite as biased but even so the filmmakers tend to distort history to make their film more acceptable south of the MasonDixon Line. The real Quantrill was a Rebel guerrilla whose activities were initially sanctioned by the Confederate high command. They eventually disowned him because of his brutal methods. Here Cantrell is simply an opportunist robber with no connection to the Confederate forces but who dresses his men in stolen Confederate uniforms as a disguise. The murderous Fletcher McCloud who for a time joins Cantrell's gang is allowed to redeem himself by joining the good guys.

	schema:headline " The Actors  Their Characters";
	schema:reviewBody "Dark Command is a film I can recommend as a good example of the Western genre and stars some of film Western's icons plus Walter Pidgeon a solid professional actor but not one usually associated with Westerns...As others have commented on the strengthsweaknesseshistory I'd like to confine my comments to some of the actors and their portrayals.In order of Billing Claire Trevor as Miss Mary McCloud. Ms. Trevor was a fine actress and a beautiful lady and here Ms. Trevor gives a solid and respectable effort as a haughty lady brought down by the circumstances of her seeing the folly of her rejection of the suit of principled Bob Seton John Wayne for the superficially charming but fatally ambitious and unprincipled William Cantrell Walter Pidgeon. Ms. Trevor speaks with her normal New York accent. John Wayne as Bob Seton. Mr. Wayne has the role of hayseed drifterhero here. Mr. Wayne does as well as he can with this role. By nature Heroes are almost always more bland and limited than are Villains. Here Mr. Wayne projects solidness forthrightness honesty social clumsiness and an intellectual awkwardness that is countered by a native shrewdness. What color he adds to his portrayal much like Jimmy Stewart's in Destry Rides Again are the homespun anecdotes he tells of life in Texas. Wayne uses his normal manner of speaking with a touch of western drawl.Walter Pidgeon as William Cantrell. Mr. Pidgeon was on loan from MGM for this film. Pidgeon is the villain of the piece beginning as merely a romantic rival and escalating to fullblown vindictive monster. Pidgeon textures his role by starting as a charming decent even good natured fellow with dreams of improving his station in life. He even offers to educate Wayne's Seton to level the field for their suit for Ms. McCloud's hand. But with his defeat in the election for Sheriff to that same uneducated cowboy his shattered dreams turn bitter and vindictive as he starts down the road to his destruction although it is his plan to take as many as he can along that same road. IMO Pidgeon is pitch perfect in his characterization. He speaks with his normal rich voice.Spoiler Warning! Roy Rogers as Fletcher Fletch McCloud. Mr. Rogers plays Mary McCloud's good natured almost goofy cowboy wannabe brother. After the truly out of character gunning down of a man with differing political outlook the Fletch McCloud character forces a crisis of conscience for John Wayne's Bob Seton as Trevor's Mary McCloud pleads with Wayne to abandon his principles and allow the clearly guilty Fletch McCloud to escape punishment. Later as second in command of Cantrell's raiders Fletch has an unexplained change of heart about the lowdown bushwhacker's he has fallen in with. Basically I felt that this character and his motivations were too arbitrary and underdeveloped...basically Roger's McCloud was a Deus ex Machina when the screenwriters had no clear path to continue the narrative. In the role Mr. Rogers seems lightweight when compared to the other leads. Ultimately unsatisfyingly and I don't know how this got by the Board of Film Review McCloud never has to pay for his crimes. note this is not to always agree with the heavy handed Review Board just a comment that it was unusual for a period film to allow a character to get away with murder...however I was so annoyed by Rogers in this performance having him selfsacrifice to allow BobMary's escape would not have been unwelcome. Throughout this film Rogers speaks with a Hey Howdy! affected Texas accent...Incongruent with his sister's Northern accent or his father's Scot's accent.George Gabby Hayes as Doc Gunch practitioner of Arts both Dental and Medical. Plays his archetype as an irascible shrewd slightly clumsy comicrelief sidekick. He has the sidekick camaraderie thing down with Wayne as they had played friends and sidekicks from long before George became Gabby. For instance see the Lone Star film Blue Steel to see Hayes playing a role as sidekick preGabby others have mentioned Tall in the Saddle for classic WayneGabby. Here Hayes is a little more grounded as a reasonable intelligent Gabby type. Hayes routinely was a scenery chewer but here he is second place to...Another SPOILER WARNING! Porter Hall as Angus McCloud banker and father to the hero's love interest. I can see where Alan Young and the Disney Cartoon studio got the idea for Scrooge McDuck. Hall's grasping banker with a tremendous Scot's accent was completely over the top...including a death scene that Burton or Olivier would have a hard time outdoing. Hall demands attention when he is on screen and this IMO to the movie's detriment. I mentioned before my observations on the accents that the actors chose to use perhaps it is just me but the scenes with the three McCloud family members together are marred by Hall's and Roger's battling accents next to Trevor's completely unmatching manner of speech.LAST SPOILER WARNING! Marjorie Main as Mrs. Adams William Cantrell's Housekeeper. Others have noted that this character plays William Cantrell's missing conscience as his mother that he presents as his Housekeeper for reasons of pride and vanity that are only briefly touched upon early in the film. Main plays it somber and sober as a disappointed mother who sees her last child who she had hopes would rise above unnamed sibling's disappointments choose his ultimately destructive path. Main is the also screenwriter's answer to the final climax with an unexpected solution to the final Cliffhanger where the now completely evil and unbalanced Cantrell has the drop on Seton and Mary McCloud Cantrell with no apparent way to escape. Dark and brooding Main makes the most of her small vital part.In summary a film that is worth viewing yet does contain some flaws in plot and characterization.".

Quantrill like most of the bushwhackers irregular southern sympathizers and jay hawkers irregular northern sympathizerswas simply out for personal gain. He didn't give a damn which side won the war. That most of his band of outlaws supported the South including Cole Younger and Jesse James mattered little to him as long as they kept their commander's coffers full of gold and the spoils of looting and robbing.Though the grand finale of the burning of Lawrence Kansas is not as spectacular as the burning of Atlanta in Gone With the Wind in many ways Dark Command is a more realistic less romanticized account of the Civil War period. It is certainly less racist than Gone With the Wind. Much of this is owed to the script based on a novel by the usually gangster oriented writer W.R. Burnett Little Caesar The Asphalt Jungleand to the direction of Raoul Walsh.Making all this gel is an exceptional cast handpicked by Walsh and Republic. Heading the roster is John Wayne who had recently gained acceptance from the Hollywood moguls as a result of his standout performance in Stagecoach. Republic threw in their cowboy star Roy Rogers and his sidekick Gabby Hayes. Roy though somewhat miscast does a creditable job showing a wide range of emotions and gives life to his role of kid brother who wants to be a contender. When Roy and Dale had a show on the Nashville Network in the 1980's they invited viewers to send in questions they would answer on the air sending the writer an autographed picture in return. I asked Roy about his being teamed with John Wayne in Dark Command. In answering the question on the air it was obvious that he was not pleased with his appearance along side the Duke. Perhaps Republic had pushed Roy into the part holding him to his contract. Whatever the reason Roy had no need to be ashamed. His performance indicates that he could have succeeded in A movies had that been his desire. Gabby Hayes is in top form and his role not only adds much needed humor to this rather dark film but serves also as a father figure and guiding hand to the man from Texas played by Wayne. Walter Pigeon adds a degree of dignity to his role portraying Quantrill Cantrell in the film as a three dimensional character with both good and bad in his nature. Upstaging them all is the divine Claire Trevor who walks away with the show. This is a Republic picture so naturally the action and stunts are going to be first rate especially with the likes of Yakima Canutt on the payroll. There is also the gallery of bad guys under contract to Republic who were some of the most despicable heavies in film history. Adding to the authenticity of the movie is music from the period including two Stephen Foster songs.".

This one also stars Claire Trevor and Walter Pidgeon but i think Pidgeon was wrong for this movie and he wasn't very good in here. I don't think Pidgeon did any westerns after this one and i can see why. This one is set right before the civil war in Kansas and Kansas doesn't want to get involved. Pidgeon is going to run for sheriff but is beaten by Wayne and Pidgeon is upset and then becomes a criminal first as a slave trader than a gun runner and when the civil war stars he starts to loot towns. Trevor is Pidgeon's girl but Wayne steals her away but you can find that out for yourself when you watch it. This one is for die hard fans of Wayne only.".

It's a riveting story with a touch of peculiarity some great characters and an amazing music score.The film is a tale of justice and revenge as a man returns home to his ranch after some sort of military service and discovers that his brother has been killed by a gang of outlaws. The basic plot is typical spaghetti western fare but what makes this movie stand out is its style.The main character has kind of a mystical aura about him because of his uncanny ability to predict the weather and use it to his advantage. He also has a knack for seeming to appear out of nowhere to surprise his targets. Lang Jeffries's acting in the film is a bit wooden for the role of such an interesting character but the fantastic performances by Carlo Gaddi as the slimy menacing outlaw Ted Corbin and the always great Fernando Sancho as Porfirio the gang leader who is losing his grip make up for it.There is a very odd implementation of zoom shots in the camera work during one particular scene as the film approaches its climax. Rather than the usual sustained intensitybuilding closeups that Sergio Leone was so fond of the director here uses a rapidly zooming in and out camera for a more unsettling effect. This turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie.The music score is perhaps the best part of this film. The opening theme is one of my favorites and is one of those unforgettable tunes that will play in your mind over and over long after the movie is done.

But this good stuff in no way manages to compensate for the bad stuff. The characters are bad  the bad guys don't really ooze evil and the good guy who wears a ridiculouslooking leopard skin poncho only makes a limited number of appearances. Most of the movie is composed of the characters endlessly talking resulting in little action.

I remember I felt that every character was so sympathetic and easy to agree with that I immediately loved the movie. In fact at that age more or less 15 I was a little awkward in the same way as Ralph was and I would have liked to have been more selfconfident like Tommy incidentally Lucas Evans and Anthony Rogers act great with just minor flaws which  in my opinion  contribute to render the movie even more realistic. Moreover I must admit it's always a pleasure to hear different English accents mainly Canadian and Australian as is possible in this movie being a nonnative speaker of English I always appreciate it when I can feel these differences which are easy to catch since in this case the linguistic level is not that difficult. To sum up congratulations to the director and... too bad that the young actors didn't go on acting at least to the best of my knowledge.".

The whole idea of a live action film involving stamp travel is quite ingenious in my mind. The location details in China and Australia are quite good as are all the special effects. The acting is also in my opinion very well done and very believable. I won't spoil the ending for you but I think you will find the ending to be an interesting twist.

Ralph eventually gets to Australia but so does Tommy.

Then Ralph embarks on a fantastical treasure hunt that takes him to China and then Australia. He not only encounters some very colourful characters along the way  particularly in mainland China  but he comes up against a master con artist who tricked him out of a rare blue nose stamp aptly named Tommy Tricker Anthony Rogers.This movie is made primarily for kids which is why some of the dialogue may come across as too puerile for adults to take seriously. Yet one has to admire the imagination that went into creating this intricate plot which defies all movie formulas. For instance there is an incredible scene where Ralph shrinks to a midget and ends up on stamp after his sister and friend perform a strange chant. But after that magic trick takes place only the people who do not perform this ritual can put the letter into a mail box to be sent halfway across the world to Australia. Crazier still after the letter arrives at its destination and is opened Ralph blows up to his regular size and lands in the most inconvenient places. To craft a scene like that takes a lot more imagination than is put in most movie scripts. Directorwriter Michael Rubbo also has a great eye for locations with the result that we are treated to China's roadways clogged with cyclists a gorgeous Chinese garden a dragon TaiChi and Australia's cricket match.".

	schema:reviewBody "This family adventure movie produced in Canada was released when I was two years old before any of my earliest memories I think. I obviously didn't see it when it was brand new but remember seeing a lot of it several times in the 90's. However I don't recall ever watching it right to the end in my childhood as I could never remember how it ended. At 23 years old I've finally gotten around to seeing Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller the whole film from start to finish after not seeing any part of it for maybe around fifteen years. This probably wouldn't have happened if I hadn't remembered it from my childhood. I thought much of the movie was reasonable thanks to the humour but eventually it got a little tiring.Ralph James and his con artist friend Tommy Tricker are both elementary school kids who collect stamps. Tommy likes to use stamps as a way to swindle his peers and even does this at school until Albert the leader of the stamp club stops him. Unfortunately when Tommy comes over to Ralph's house one day Ralph becomes another one of his victims. Tommy tricks him into trading one of his dad's rare stamps and Ralph doesn't realize he's been tricked until the young schemer is on his way and it's too late! Ralph knows he will be in trouble when his dad finds out and his sister Nancy decides to help him try and get it back or find a replacement. After failed attempts the siblings discover how to magically shrink and travel inside a stamp and Ralph decides to do just that in a search to find Charles Merriweather a stamp traveler who has been missing for 75 years! This movie is not billed as a comedy but I probably wouldn't be able to give it an above average rating if it weren't for the times I laughed. I think many people would agree that the film clearly has more for kids than adults with a storyline that could easily bore adults. I can't forget such comedic highlights as the way Albert tells Tommy to stop swindling other students with stamps Ralph locking himself up while his dad tries to get him to come out and the chase through the mall featuring an early appearance from Rufus Wainwright years before his music career took off. I did not care much for Tommy as a character with some of the things he does such as the prank he pulls on Albert early in the film. Mind you even that character can be funny at times. Unfortunately in the end the humour is not consistent enough to carry the film and to me the film seemed a little overlong. If it were shorter I might be able to rate it 710 instead of 6 but as it is I can't say I highly recommend it for adults.".

I remember seeing previews for it when I was a kid and there was nothing more in the world that I had wanted to watch. I was raised on The Neverending Story Legend Krull The Beastmaster and The Dark Crystal. So sure I loved fantasy. It was my favorite genre. And even though many will say that Lord of the Rings is better I have to disagree. The Lord of the Rings is a good melding of drama reallife struggle and fantasy but's it not fun to watch. Willow on the other hand is a blast to watch.The music from Horner's great ... I can still whistle the adventure theme song and often do sometimes. Val Kilmer as Madmartigan was a great rogue hero who had plenty of great lines laughs. Sorcia was by Joanne Whalley was hot as hell ... a fiery redhead who just refused to be ordered or commanded. General Kael who was supposedly based on one of Lucas' critics is awesome. His look spawned an entire decade of me thinking that people with skull masks were horribly cool. The woman who played Fin Razel sp? was great. The Brownies were hysterical. And last but not least give it up for Billy Barty and Warwick Davis little people with big roles. I think little people probably thank Mr. Lucas and Ron Howard for making them stars for once for giving them a showcase piece. Davis really had no better role in his life than this one. And he shined in it.Well if that particular teacher is reading this by any chance I hope you go back and rewatch this as a kid. For me and obviously many others on this website the movie was more than a fun little escape ... it was almost a genreleading film. If there's one thing that preprequel George Lucas was good at it was at giving the audience a good time ... Indiana Jones Willow Star Wars ... the best adventurefantasy films ever to come out. Each of them with charming heroes obvious bad guys magic swords and humor.Pirates of the Carribbean resurrected this sort of cinema I think and the American public responded to it with verve. I still remember hardnosed critic Lisa Schwarzbaum giving Pirates a D rating in Entertainment Weekly. I bet she about choked on her own vomit when she saw how much fun everyone had with the film.And Willow is the same thing. It's pure magic. Pure escape. Especially good for children but good for the adults too. If you can't have fun with this one than you better go get your laughs from movies like White Chicks ... just don't be surprised when the kids come out making jokes about dcks and pssies afterward.".

I have enjoyed it with each viewing mainly because I just take it for what it is to me  namely just a fun escapist fantasy flick that whisks you away to a magical kingdom where all kinds of mystical cute clever and at times even sinister things are happening all against a backdrop of remarkably beautiful scenery. Oh yeah you also get to see Val Kilmer Madmartigan step squarely into a fresh pile of troll poop  truly a classic moment in cinema history! I noticed that other reviewers herein went to great efforts to point out glaring similarities between Willow and Star Wars and these similarities apparently ruined the movie for them or at least they just didn't like Willow. Well to each their own As for me I won't even begin to compare Willow to Star Wars because drum roll please... I've never even seen Star Wars. Not even once. So there!! You've never seen STAR WARS!! I can hear the collective gasp of all you moviegoers out there. Yeah okay so just shoot me already!. But similarities shmimilarities! As Bill Murray said in Meatballs It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter!...Anyway if you haven't seen Willow then I would recommend you see it at once and enjoy it for what it is a fun escapist fantasy movie that heaven knows current events and all... we could all use a little more of in this day and age. If you have already seen it and love it well go see it again! And finally if you have seen it but don't like it because of annoying similarities between it and Star Wars well what can I say? I would hazard that all things considered Willow nevertheless DOES have its own special charms that you probably won't find in Star Wars. At the very least I haven't heard that Madmartigan's counterpart in Star Wars Han Solo stepped in a big wet pile of troll poop!Well I'm glad I got all this off my chest. I feel BETTER!!".

	schema:headline " Lucas Howard Make Magic";
	schema:reviewBody "When Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon in 1969 the whole world paused now such things are second nature to everyone veritably taken for granted as more and more science fiction becomes reality every day.  In 1977 when George Lucas made Star Wars' it turned the cinematic universe on it's ear with it's scope and vision offering things neither seen nor experienced by anyone before now his accomplishments are virtually taken for granted his vision dismissed by many with a shrug.  But in this original story by Lucas that vision is captured once again and proffered to the world via the magic of the movies in Willow' directed by Ron Howard.A long time ago in a galaxy perhaps far far away a baby comes into the care of the elvish Willow Ufgood Warwick Davis and his wife Kaiya Julie Peters.  The infant bears the birthmark of the one prophesied to come who will put an end to the tyrannical rule of the evil Queen Bavmorda Jean Marsh.  But the Queen too knows of the prophecy and is seeking the baby bearing the telltale mark.  For the sake of his village as well as the safety of the child it falls to Willow to transport the baby to a safe haven beyond the boundaries of his land and the reach of Queen Bavmorda.  So Willow sets out upon his journey and along the way finds an ally maybe in the person of the selfproclaimed World's greatest swordsman' Madmartigan Val Kilmer and together sort of they embark upon an adventure that will ultimately lead them to a final confrontation with the evil Queen herself.With some help from George Lucas Ron Howard delivers this highly imaginative tale which bears that unmistakable Lucas touch with a touch of magic of his own.  A showcase of special FX it pioneered the morphing' technique so vital to the success of films like The Abyss' filmed one year after this one and Terminator 2  Judgment Day' 1991 it is nevertheless decidedly not a special FX' movie.  The FX though a big part of the film to be sure do not supersede the story.  And because of that it makes that necessary emotional connection with the characters possible and takes the whole film to a higher level.  A big part of what has made Lucas and Howard so successful in fact is that innate ability of being able to tap into the humanity of any given story With Lucas for example his American Graffiti' and even THX1138' and Howard's Parenthood' Night Shift' and Apollo 13' and knowing how to convey it to their audience.  It's the difference between being a true filmmaker and just someone to whom an opportunity is handed who simply hasn't the insight or sense of human nature to know what to do with it Like Adam Shankman with The Wedding Planner' Jeff Franklin's Love Stinks' Nick Gomez with Drowning Mona' or Peter Hosun Chan's The Love Letter.'  All movies that suffered greatly because of their director's inability to do what Lucas and Howard do so proficiently and seemingly with facility.In the title role Warwick Davis does a good job of bringing Willow to life as does Val Kilmer in the flashier role of Madmartigan.  Joanne Whalley does a decent turn as Sorsha daughter of the evil Queen but is overshadowed by the deliciously sinister rendering of Bavmorda by Jean Marsh whose wickedness is shamefully delightful.In a supporting role however and with extremely limited screen time it is Julie Peters who really captures the attention with a sincere and affecting performance as Kaiya.  She has such a pure and natural manner that it's hard to believe this is an actor playing a part the realism she achieves in fact can be compared to that of Harriet Andersson in any one of a number of Ingmar Bergman's films.  Her ability is a true gift that endows her with a quality and a presence that would make her an asset to any film as she certainly is here.  And it's a shame she has apparently never been afforded the opportunity of plying her craft more Willow' is her only feature film.  It's a singular success however and one of which she can be proud.  Her portrayal of Kaiya goes far in demonstrating the positive effect a supporting role can have on a film especially when it's this well acted.The supporting cast includes Patricia Hayes Fin Raziel Billy Barty High Aldwin Pat Roach General Kael Gavan O'Herlihy Airk David Steinberg Meegosh Mark Northover Burglekutt Kevin Pollak Rool Rick Overton Franjean and Maria Holvoe Cherlindrea.  With an intelligent screenplay by Bob Dolman and original music by James Horner Willow' is an entertaining enlightening film rich in characterization and metaphor with a subtle message and a moral that unobtrusively makes a statement about diversity and the value of an individual's contributions to the society of which he is a part as well as the fact that one person can indeed make a difference.  Visually stunning too it's a transporting experience truly filled with magic and a journey definitely worth taking.  I rate this one 910.".

It's one dimensional it plays on typical fantasy stereotypes and it doesn't really have anything that previous fantasy films didn't except for... style.Yes I consider this a stylish film. Mostly because even after 'growing up' I can still watch this film and be as wrapped up in the story and characters as I was when I was a little boy. It's formulaic plot and generally onedimensional characters are a large part of that reason  the film makes no pretensions of being something it isn't. It's honest a quality lacking in so very many films these days which seem to be produced only to suit the latest fashion.The characters are all well acted  there's no ham acting to be found here in my opinion. Clearly the actors had fun with the roles and gave them as much life as they could. Madmartigan is man with a dark past clearly an antihero redeemed by the end of the film. Airk the 'good' general is everything one expects in a 'knight in shining armor'  chivalrous dedicated brave. Bavmorda is the quintessential 'wicked witch' scheming maniacal obsessed with power. It is these characters that play so well into the average person's conception of fantasy fare that is precisely what makes the film a success  it entertains us because it knows what we like and what we expect to see and then delivers it with action and a bombastic musical score.Critics panned it for being unoriginal but being original wasn't the point of this movie. The point was to entertain to make us thrill to a tale of high adventure of dragons of far away lands of swords and sorcery. On this account no other fantasy film with the possible exception of Conan the Barbarian has ever done this so exceedingly well.".

The effects look a little dated now especially the twoheaded beastie but it has enough humour and action to keep most satisfied. It's no LOTR but then it was made 14 years ago.Warwick Davis plays Willow a Nelwynn a race of hobbitsized folk who don't have anything to do with The Big People as they call humans. Basically it's the Shire transplanted into this movie but without the budget. Billy Barty is the village's wizard and basically plays the character Gweldor again from Masters of the Universe but without the silly makeup and stupid musical key.Val Kilmer is Madmartigan a human warrior who befriends Willow and helps him on his journey with varying degrees of ulterior motive.The acting is all reasonably good. Warwick Davis was only 18 when this film was released so his performance is very good considering his age and lack of experience prior to this he'd played a goblin in Labyrinth and an ewok in Return of the Jedi. It's also interesting to see Pat Roach here. Pat was a former wrestler and has carved out a little niche for himself playing villains and tough guys. Here he plays General Kael the righthand henchman of Queen Bavmorda played with gusto by Jean Marsh. That woman is truly frightening.It's all good fun and the two funniest characters in the movie are Franjean and Rool two Brownies who help Willow regardless of the latters wishes. They have the funniest double act and reminded me more than a little of Merry and Pippin in LOTR.All in all well worth a watch if you want some pure and somewhat silly entertainment.".

This fantasy has action adventure and romance in an excellent screenplay and special effects. The characters are charismatic and there are many funny scenes. Unfortunately this type of movie that is pure magic and entertainment has been recently forgotten by the studios.

Now on to the midgets. Willow is a pretty kickass movie.  Val Kilmer is a drunken lecherous arrogant brawler and Madmartigan is a fun character too.  There are some great one liners in this movie I find it to be endlessy quotable.  Also it's got multigenerational appeal.  Kids and adults can watch and enjoy this for completely different reasons.  I have to say I love midgets. After Rainbow Motel this is the best midget movie I've ever seen.  It beat out Jedi because the midgets had to wear little bear suits.

Women were represented a lot stronger here than in the normal fantasy movie genre.  The evil heavy Bavmorda is a chick I think the baby savior the possumcrowgoat lady and Joanne Whalley all have a strong presence in the film.

	schema:headline " Willow the epic fantasy of the 1980's";
	schema:reviewBody "Plot Willow Ufgood is a Nelwyn if you know what a Hobbit is you'll understand a member of a dwarf race in a magical fantasy realm that looks interestingly enough a lot like New Zealand. He comes across a special baby Elora Dannen the heiress to the throne of the land by prophecy. This spells bad news for the wicked Empress Barmovda who took over the realm through violence and black magic. Her rival the good witch Raziel was banished and she has a ton of evil minions including wild pigs a skullmasked General and a great army. Secure in her power she feels all it will take is to find the baby Elora and destroy her. But Willow a rebel named Mad Martigan and the wild warrior daughter of Bavmorda herself will team up with Raziel to save the day. Willow's confrontation with Bavmorda results in goodness' triumph.I've seen Willow two times. The first viewing was as a child of the 1980's when Willow would show up on television usually on a Saturday night on either basic TV's Channel 13 back then called Very Independent and would also air other children's classic fantasies of the 80's like The Never Ending Story from '84 and Excalibur from '81 and or Channel 5 now known as the WB. Willow was larger than life a huge epic as I recall and everything about it was pure magic adventure. Basically it was the Lord of the Rings of the 1980's and no other fantasy movie of the decade topped Willow. It was unbelievable. I still have strong feelings about this movie connected to the first viewing as a child and this is always the case with children who grew up on adventure fantasy films of the 80's. Everything was like something as epic as the Bible  a child with a destiny who floats down a river on a basket like the baby Mosesan evil Queen and Sorcereress who wants to keep her power from being replaced a dwarf with a heart of gold and courage magic spellsbeautiful locations evil characters the skullmasked General Kael was especially frightening. Being a child and a sensitive one certain scenes were violent scary beautiful and aweinspiring. The fairy queen Cherlindrea who manifests herself to Willow in the forest was a very memorable scene. There were many things I did not understand about the film particularly the importance of the quest to save the baby and the grownup dialog went beyond my understanding. The movie too was too long and longwinded for a child to fully pay attention. The battle outside Queen Bavmorda's castle her evil ritual and her fantastic death that cloud of red smoke was all very intense the first time I saw it.The second viewing was as an adult I hadn't seen it in years not since probably 1989. I'm a girl so I enjoy romance and adventure films so I have a fondness for the fantasy genre. I sincerely think Willow is one of the best fantasy films of the 80's. It was very special and ahead of its time. Sure I can be cynical and analytical about it now. The script is intelligently written but the characters are very onedimensional underdeveloped and lacking any real complexity. It's just blackandwhite in terms of who is good and who is evil. Bavmorda Jean Marsh is pure evil as she is a bad witch as opposed to a good witch like her rival Raziel Patricia Hayes. They don't explain just how Bavmorda took over the land and the extent of her evil. Obviously she is unpopular with her own countrymen and she ruled the land with an iron fist like a tyrant. The baby Elora Danan is considered special and magical but there is no hint of magic in her she would not do one little magic trick and throughout the movie she just makes cute faces and needs rescuing all the time. Willow the hero of the film seems to take second chair when Val Kilmer's character Madmartigan enters the movie and soon becomes the swordwielding paperback novel romantic hero complete with long Indianstyle hair and shirt open to reveal his chest who can really fight. Sorsha Joanne Whalley is the worst character in the film. There is no real conflict in her when she betrays her mother Bavmorda and falls for Madmartigan and joins the good guys. Jean Marsh' Bavmorda is also flat and her scenes could have been extended so that we can see just how wicked she really is. It seems like they toned down her character so as not to be too frightening. Willow is also too much like a Hobbit and Bavmorda is evil without any depth. So yes the film has its flaws these flaws being in the story apparently there was lots of back story but Ron Howard and Lucas did not want the film to be longer than standard movie time. Both Howard and Lucas did this film because it was their retaliation at their denial of buying the movie rights to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. This is their alternative to Tolkien a story so right for the late 80's with special effects and computer graphics then in its infancy used sparingly and yet beautifully never killing the story and in fact appropriately enhancing the action adventure. Today's fantasy movies contain far too many special effects and CG effects that they completely take over the story. Willow is an example of a story that can be told through good acting fine script great cinematography and great music James Horner's second fantasy movie score his first was Krull in '83. This is a movie that you can escape into. It is perfect in every sense and no fantasy movies made today can compare to Willow.".

	onyx:emotionText "Plot Willow Ufgood is a Nelwyn if you know what a Hobbit is you'll understand a member of a dwarf race in a magical fantasy realm that looks interestingly enough a lot like New Zealand. He comes across a special baby Elora Dannen the heiress to the throne of the land by prophecy. This spells bad news for the wicked Empress Barmovda who took over the realm through violence and black magic. Her rival the good witch Raziel was banished and she has a ton of evil minions including wild pigs a skullmasked General and a great army. Secure in her power she feels all it will take is to find the baby Elora and destroy her. But Willow a rebel named Mad Martigan and the wild warrior daughter of Bavmorda herself will team up with Raziel to save the day. Willow's confrontation with Bavmorda results in goodness' triumph.I've seen Willow two times. The first viewing was as a child of the 1980's when Willow would show up on television usually on a Saturday night on either basic TV's Channel 13 back then called Very Independent and would also air other children's classic fantasies of the 80's like The Never Ending Story from '84 and Excalibur from '81 and or Channel 5 now known as the WB. Willow was larger than life a huge epic as I recall and everything about it was pure magic adventure. Basically it was the Lord of the Rings of the 1980's and no other fantasy movie of the decade topped Willow. It was unbelievable. I still have strong feelings about this movie connected to the first viewing as a child and this is always the case with children who grew up on adventure fantasy films of the 80's. Everything was like something as epic as the Bible  a child with a destiny who floats down a river on a basket like the baby Mosesan evil Queen and Sorcereress who wants to keep her power from being replaced a dwarf with a heart of gold and courage magic spellsbeautiful locations evil characters the skullmasked General Kael was especially frightening. Being a child and a sensitive one certain scenes were violent scary beautiful and aweinspiring. The fairy queen Cherlindrea who manifests herself to Willow in the forest was a very memorable scene. There were many things I did not understand about the film particularly the importance of the quest to save the baby and the grownup dialog went beyond my understanding. The movie too was too long and longwinded for a child to fully pay attention. The battle outside Queen Bavmorda's castle her evil ritual and her fantastic death that cloud of red smoke was all very intense the first time I saw it.The second viewing was as an adult I hadn't seen it in years not since probably 1989. I'm a girl so I enjoy romance and adventure films so I have a fondness for the fantasy genre. I sincerely think Willow is one of the best fantasy films of the 80's. It was very special and ahead of its time. Sure I can be cynical and analytical about it now. The script is intelligently written but the characters are very onedimensional underdeveloped and lacking any real complexity. It's just blackandwhite in terms of who is good and who is evil. Bavmorda Jean Marsh is pure evil as she is a bad witch as opposed to a good witch like her rival Raziel Patricia Hayes. They don't explain just how Bavmorda took over the land and the extent of her evil. Obviously she is unpopular with her own countrymen and she ruled the land with an iron fist like a tyrant. The baby Elora Danan is considered special and magical but there is no hint of magic in her she would not do one little magic trick and throughout the movie she just makes cute faces and needs rescuing all the time. Willow the hero of the film seems to take second chair when Val Kilmer's character Madmartigan enters the movie and soon becomes the swordwielding paperback novel romantic hero complete with long Indianstyle hair and shirt open to reveal his chest who can really fight. Sorsha Joanne Whalley is the worst character in the film. There is no real conflict in her when she betrays her mother Bavmorda and falls for Madmartigan and joins the good guys.

It is a rather good movie that is fast paced and fun but it does contain flaws.  The main one is Warwick Davis.  In some scenes he is good but in other scenes his character comes off as a bit too whiny.  The story is kind of a take off of The Lord of the Rings books.  A man small in statute has to keep a baby safe from an evil queen who wants to sacrifice it cause it may grow up to kill her.  While protecting the child Willow Davis' character runs into a swordsman played by Val Kilmer. He does a great job playing this character and is my favorite character in the movie.  Some of the effects are good and some quite lame the two little guys accompanying Willow but considering this was 1987 you can overlook this.  The battle scenes are ok the one at the abandoned castle is the best but they are just not on the scale of other movies of this type. This movie is worth a look though.".

All the kids on the block loved Willow. I mean we used to hum the theme song when we did the stupid crap that little boys do.Swing from a rope hum the Willow theme. Battle each other with sticks hum the Willow theme.It's sort of like Lord of the Rings only entertaining. It's sort of like Star Wars only in the Dark Ages. It is sort of like the ultimate childhood fantasy movie.And now that I am older I still love it. It is still entertaining but it's really the nostalgia that goes along with it.It's a film made of little boys...but one in the 80s that is still sort of dark and would NEVER get made of kids today. Probably because of that when I watch it I feel like I'm 8 again.Little kids love adventure movies and this is well this was the best adventure any of us had ever seen aside from Star Wars.".

There are no new stories just new ways of telling them. It's called Archetypal Criticism and it's one of the most popular ways of looking at literature. And George Lucas and Ron Howard managed to do that excellently in Willow.I'd rather watch Willow yell at Madmartigan and call him stupid than watch Sam and Frodo Just hold on a little longer because everything will be happy because of LOVE!There's betrayal redemption action the scariest dragon I've ever seen in my life love purposfully corny poetry and lots of jokes.

There are no new stories just new ways of telling them. It's called Archetypal Criticism and it's one of the most popular ways of looking at literature. And George Lucas and Ron Howard managed to do that excellently in Willow.I'd rather watch Willow yell at Madmartigan and call him stupid than watch Sam and Frodo Just hold on a little longer because everything will be happy because of LOVE!There's betrayal redemption action the scariest dragon I've ever seen in my life love purposfully corny poetry and lots of jokes.

	schema:reviewBody "George Lucas and Ron Howard collaborate to make 'Willow' a charming little film about an aspiring little magician Willow played wonderfully by Warwick Davis who finds himself responsible for the rescue of a little princess. Fantasy films in the 80s were something else. Think movies like 'Ladyhawke' 'The Dark Crystal' 'Return to Oz' and more from that time. All of these films had a distinct look. Rather than using CGI robots and dummies were created and this gave the creatures an authentic look. At the same time these films really succeeded in storytelling. They had heart and never let the special effects and visuals as stunning as they were overshadow that. 'Willow' does make some decent use of CGI as well.'Willow' tells the familiar story of an underdog unintentionally becoming a hero. I really liked the idea that Lucas chose to tell a story and cast little people in significant roles. Moreover the film's got some charming lines and the characters are very likable. I did feel that the transformation of the Sorsha character was drastic. It's the only character that I felt was underdeveloped.The performances are brilliant. Val Kilmer Jean Marsh and the rest of the supporting cast is great. Kilmer provides fine comic relief. Joanne Whalley is a stunner despite her character being illdefined and her scenes with Kilmer are a delight. Julie Peters is superb as Willow's loving wife. The twins playing Elora are convincing too thanks to Howard for extracting such performances. However the hero of 'Willow' is undoubtedly Warwick Davis then only 18 years old who pours his heart and soul into the character. I wish his talent was more recognized by Hollywood but the actor seems to be doing well in England.'Willow' is funny adventurous visually captivating and just a lot of fun. It may not be one of its kind but it's got a heart of gold.".

	schema:reviewBody "To sum things up this was really a George Lucus filmwith the then relatively inexperienced Ron Howard hired to directunder the watchful eye of Lucus. Lucus wrote the screenplay raiding his bookshelf for Tolkein especially The Hobbit and Lewis Narnia. Then he simply transferred the heroheroine romance from his Star Wars screenplay. Not necessarily a bad thing it was a simple way for him to build a feature length screenplay targeting younger viewers but sophisticated enough to entertain the entire family. Willow has some scary stuff but should not be a problem for the average grade school viewer. My rating is based on comparisons to other films with a similar target audience. I must confess upfront to a positive bias. My favorite part of Star Wars is the caustic romance between Han Solo and Princess Leia and in Willow Lucus has refined his technique and actually improved something that was already close to perfection. Sorsha Joanne Whalley and Madmartigan Val Kilmer substitute nicely for Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford with the added dimension of having them begin the story on opposite sides. The romantic elements are efficiently and subtly inserted into the film. Even though these characters are part of the main storyline the romance is separate enough to serve as the film's main parallel story. The only downside is that this side story soon becomes more interesting than the main one so much so that its climatic kiss occurring about 20 minutes before the ending unintentionally turns into the film's climax at least energy wise. The actual resolution of the main story then plays out rather anticlimatically. Willow is a delivery quest story much like The Hobbit where a reluctant Nelwyn small person is required to set out on a perilous journey to return a lost baby even smaller to a Daikini tall person. Along the way he is assisted by a couple of Brownies yet smaller guys who speak with outrageous French accents. The size differentials are the main theme of the film and are especially intriguing to young viewers who easily identify with having to deal with people who tower above them. Howard encourages this identification process by shooting most of the action at child level. If you watch the film with young children you will be amazed at its ability to draw them into the story this happens because the camera angles intentionally match a child's pointofview of the world. The viewing child's surrogate is the title character Warwick Daviswho does a commentary on the DVD a unlikely hero who inspires audience sympathy as he bravely faces the dangers of his journey while gamely putting up with an everchanging group of irritating companions. There are frequent cutaways to Elora Danan the baby mostly for reaction shots. As in Raising Arizona the producers took enough stock clips to match her expressions to almost any situation. Willow learns early on from Cherlindrea a dazzling fairy that Elora Danan is a princess who it has been foretold will one day vanquish the evil Queen Baymorda a fun role for Jean Marsh. Things get a bit BiblicalNarnia here as the Queen is seeking to eliminate the Princess before she becomes a threat. The DVD features WillowThe Making of an Adventure made during production in 1988 and Willow Morf to Morphing made in 2001 for the DVD release really put the film in historical context relative to its place in the evolution of special effects. It was really the transitional point where photochemical film effects were subordinated to digital effects. This gave Willow a significant place in film history and these two featurettes taken together nicely illustrate the continuing challenge to those involved with special effects any new development is soon overused and no longer an audience draw. Meaning that effects people have to stay on the cutting edge to simply justify their existence. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Although there may appear to be echoes of and borrowings from such American movies as Romancing the Stone and Raiders of the Lost Ark it turns out to have characteristically Hong Kong elements wire fu fights crossdressing etc.  all featuring the hero as played by Jet Li action  in one case whipwielding  women as well as its own attractions I particularly like the idea of the pen as a real as well as metaphorical weapon.  All this having been said it still seems to lack the extremes of and thus seem surprisingly tame compared to many another Hong Kong movie...which may explain why it is not a particular favorite of many Hong Kong movie fans.  On the other hand for those relatively unused to the pace gore and quick mood changes of so many movies from that part of the world this would be recommended as a movie which showcases the imagination of Hong Kong movie makers and the ability  in terms of quality but also range of possibility  of its actors and actresses.".

Although there may appear to be echoes of and borrowings from such American movies as Romancing the Stone and Raiders of the Lost Ark it turns out to have characteristically Hong Kong elements wire fu fights crossdressing etc.  all featuring the hero as played by Jet Li action  in one case whipwielding  women as well as its own attractions I particularly like the idea of the pen as a real as well as metaphorical weapon.  All this having been said it still seems to lack the extremes of and thus seem surprisingly tame compared to many another Hong Kong movie...which may explain why it is not a particular favorite of many Hong Kong movie fans.  On the other hand for those relatively unused to the pace gore and quick mood changes of so many movies from that part of the world this would be recommended as a movie which showcases the imagination of Hong Kong movie makers and the ability  in terms of quality but also range of possibility  of its actors and actresses.";

The idea is ambitious the production is lavish but the story is confusing and unengaging and the result is a film too bizarre and selfindulgent for most audiences. Jet Li once again proves that he can act in a dual role no less but the vast majority of the fighting is overthetop and intentionally unrealistic. There are some memorable moments however like his brief encounter with two huge sumo wrestlers! ".

Granted it's not the Worst Movie Ever but here the film just drags to the point where you just want to turn it off even if you're a patient person like me. Fan of Jet Li who are here just to see his performance and showing off his MartialArts skills will be heavily disappointed because there are few scenes where he is creatively beating up someone or drawing in the viewer. The film is just a silly Chinese version of Indiana Jones and sadly it was better off not being parodied andor being rehashed. Watch it if you absolutely need to see anything with Jet Li in it but don't come complaining to this IMDb board exclaiming on how disappointed you were !".

I didn't end up getting cable because not only did I find this movie at my notsolocal video store but I discovered that it had yellow subtitles  which are far better than the white ones that are found on most Chinatown videos.Now I at first thought that this movie was a simply Indiana Jones adventure movie which was one of the reasons that I wanted to hire it. There was a lot of similarities between this movie and the Raiders of the Lost Ark but the thing is that this movie was a thousand times better  Harrison Ford was never that great a martial artist.The difference with this movie is that it jumps between the 1930's and the present day. Dr Wai is actually a script being written by a company and the writer is in the middle of divorce and has lost all will to right so his assistants take the job of writing it for him but when he sees it going a way he doesn't like he takes over and moves it to a more acceptable place then others come along and add their own bits to the story.The writer of the story is a geek though Jet Li doesn't come across as a geek and so are his cowriters. Every character in the present era have duplicates in the story though this duplicity becomes less substantial as the characters being to take on their real names and real roles. Dr Wai is about dreams and how we place ourselves into our own dreams a dream of what we want to be is true. Here the geek who could not hurt anybody is a rough tough adventurer king who is a whizz at martial arts. His wife Monica is a bitch queen who controls the Japanese soldiers in China. Yet when others take over their perception of Monica take over and so does their perception of Dr Wai. The scene where he drives a steam train through the town is a classic scene of where another aspect of Dr Wai emerges.The movie itself seems predictable but we don't watch Hong Kong movies for their unpredictability actually we do because there are a lot of unpredictable aspects to their movies but we watch them for their action and Dr Wai delivers. It has every thing from ramming a steam train through numerous buildings jumping out of a burning aeroplane fighting a monster who is in fact the bad guy who was mutated and ancient artifacts that are needed to be retrieved. This movie has it and this movie seriously rocks.".

Unfortunately plottwists gradually become more random and ridiculous so atmospheric visuals and fightscenes remain as the only redeeming factor. Action focuses on effect and not so much on realism Jet Li battling a NinjaSquad is a blast though. The Indiana Jonesfeel is there but without the suspense or energy. SFX are looking good and carry a certain trashy charm to them while events in the real world stick to being a rather dull affair. Some good jokes here and there but in the end there's nothing really to remember. Subtitles on the HKDVD are of worst kind imaginably they make no sense at all.".

So his two idiot assistants and soontobeexwife 'help' him by writing in parts of the story while he sleeps causing the main story line of 'Dr. Wai' to go off in wild directions and causing characters to shift from good to bad and back again. As a straight adventure movie this is fine entertainment but as a comedy about the creative process it is very clever and quite effective. Each of the four writers has hisher own slant and makes the story different by their contributions and yet it all comes together smoothly.

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Wai and the Scripture With No Words is a rousing adventure tale set in the middle part of the 20th century. Dr. Wai known as the King of Adventurers is a writer and archaeologist in the mold of Indiana Jones and a renowned finder of missing artifacts.He is also the alterego of his creator Chow SiKit played by Jet Li. Chow SiKit is a beleaguered writer of serialized adventure tales whose own life is in a tailspin. His wife Monica Rosamund Kwan wants a separation and is going to great lengths to insure the break with her husband up to and including engaging in the equivalent of phone sex with her husband's employer in SiKit's presence. Later at a dinner requested by Monica to discuss divorce a famous movie staranother apparent romantic swain of Monica's barges in lawyer in tow offering the barrister's services for the divorce.His rotten homelife is intruding upon Sikit's work. He is suffering from writers block and cannot seem to move the adventures of Dr. Wai forwardrisking his livelihood.Fortunately Chow SiKit has friends in the publishing house where he works. Shing Takeshi Kaneshiro is an eager young writer who befriends SiKit and tries his best to support him in his marital troubles and help break his writer's block. When that effort is unsuccessful he enlists the aid of Yvonne a pretty young colleague and together they begin to ghost write the adventure of Dr. Wai and the Scripture With No Words. Shing is represented in the tale by an alteregoalso named Shing who is sidekick and disciple to Dr. Wai The Scripture is actually a two fold artifact which has in the course of time been sundered into its components. The first is a seemingly ordinary wooden box with an inscribed lidwhich can kill and maim the unsuspecting who open it. The second is a scripture scroll which when joined with the box creates an oracle which can tell the future. Many nefarious and greedy types are looking for the two artifacts for their own ends. Dr Wai has more than one occasion to engage the villains in martial arts battle providing a showcase for Jet Li's impressive physical prowess.Shing and Yvonne who are engaged in a budding romance of their own soon steer the serial into the area of romance even while Chow SiKit is being ever more plagued by his personal life.The plot of the film within the film lurches forward in a somewhat nonlinear way as a novel by committee is wrested to and fro between its authors. Ultimately the lines between reality and fiction become less distinct as a convalescing Monica begins to see her husband in a new light. Coming into his room and finding him asleep and his friends gone she makes contributions to the novel herself.The dual plots wind down one to a bittersweet end the other more hopeful.Jet Li is very appealing in the dual roles of Chow SiKit and Dr. Wai King of Adventurers. Where Chow SiKit is a bit of a bumbler and a man victimized by life Dr. Wai is capable and fearless in his pursuit of his objective. Takeshi Kaneshiro shines as the two Shings both stalwart and steadfast in their support of their friends.Rosamund Kwan is the perfect ice princess as Monica and her alter ego Cammy. Charlie Yeung is excellent as Yvonne and the editor's assistant who is instrumental in bringing the two aspects of the Scripture With No Words together.".

And don't even get me started on the scene with the puppet mutant mouse  yes you unfortunately read that right a giant puppet mutant mouse.For hardcore Li fans the only thing of interest is seeing Li play a totally different type of character  out of touch a semiloser not sure what's going on and dumped on by his love interest. And that held my attention  for all of five minutes. Then I had to have more beer. And it still didn't help. Do yourself a favor and skip over the VCD in your local Chinatown and grab New Legend of Shaolin or Hitman if you're in the mood for Li or Tokyo Raiders or Double Tap for good modern HK cinema.

	schema:headline " Good fun if you're in the right mood!";
	schema:reviewBody "Dead or Alive is a film that is so exploitative and atrociously bad that somehow it ended up being a whole lot of fun. However to view this as a fun film it must be viewed as intended With brain switched off and ol' Mr McDong taking control of your functions for 80 minutes. Yes this may be a film with a predominantly female cast but ladies need not turn up to watch this cause they probably won't enjoy it unless their sexual barometer is registering the opposite end from hetero. This film is total gratuity in every regard from the scantily clad sexy ladies to the barrage of testosterone pumping action. This is hot chicks doing high kicks! So with that and having this the preconceived idea when I bought my ticket I knew I'd enjoy it. Hell the film was marketed right. It's about a video game and has the subtlety of said game which is in the button bashing short attention span of the games spectrum. It's a simple movie for a simple movie going experience. IF anyone goes into this film and comes out having not enjoyed it then they SHOULD have known better! I think only those who want to see this kind of film who are in the mood will watch and they'll get a kick out of it like me. Critics will despise it cause it represents a film they have to watch but probably don't want to.So DOA is essentially a noninteractive video game an FMV if you will. It's got an awful script mediocre acting and all the efforts of the filmmakers have gone into perfectly capturing glistening bouncing boobies amongst the martial arts mayhem. The plot essentially is nothing more than little setups to all the fights taking place at a secret fighting tournament set up by Eric Roberts in gradeA scenery chewing mode. Roberts to me is a tragic waste of talent who in the early 80's looked a great prospect and to some me included has more talent than his overrated sister Julia who now of course takes all the plaudits. Roberts is consigned to doing DTV movies now or TV movies and on the rare occasion he appears back in the multiplexes it's in another Bmovie that usually is awful. However at least Eric is enjoying himself here relishing his return somewhat to the limelight. or to put it another way to remind people Julia wasn't an only child! The rest of the main cast who register any interest are the hot ladies. There's the rather bizarre yet strikingly attractive looking Devon Aoki and then there's also Holly Valance Sarah Carter and Natassia Malthe too. However it's Jaime Pressley who steals the show not only with her performance that delivers the most laughs intentional ones that is but also she has a bod to die for and considering some stiff competition from Valances sculpted physique in particular that's no mean feat.Overall though this film will go down as a classic bad movie. The filmmakers never intended making anything beyond what they deliver. This is bad it's cheesy and it's forgettable. But it's outrageously fun while it lasts and it most certainly requires the wearing of loose fitting underwear to allow for Sgt Schlong to stand to attention every now and again. I feel guilty having enjoyed it but I had a good idea of the film that would be delivered and it was delivered as I imagined. ".

This is high class trash cinema that should be high on your popcorn list.The plot of the movie has a group of the world's best fighters all being chosen to go to an island for the DOA contest where they will compete for a 10 million dollar prize. The main characters are women so we get to see lots of beautiful woman fighting and frolicking on a tropical island. The contest is a cover for Eric Roberts to use his computers to take all of their fighting information so he can be the worlds best fighter thanks to a program which he intends to sell to the highest bidderor something similar.So unserious from the get go its a wonder that people dislike the film for being silly. The trailer and most of the promotional material let you know going in this is a silly western martial arts movie with its tongue through its cheek and lots of unreal wire work. The action riffs on every martial arts film you've seen and does so in such an inoffensive way that you just go along with it. This is form and substance over meaning and its all a great deal of fun. Its silly in the right sort of smile producing way. If you go in expecting mindless really mindlessbut intentionally so entertainment you'll enjoy yourself a great deal.I really liked the film. If I have any misgivings its that the film loses focus in the final half hour as plot lines are dropped or hurried through. At some point the film gives up real plot for action leaving only a sketch of where its going. Thats fine since by then the film is just nonstop action of the highest well not highest most entertaining order. this is one of those films destined to become a guilty pleasure once it hits cable you know the ones where you stop every time its on and watch it to the end.You will want to rent this at some point since its a blast.The Chinese DVD I saw had about 9 minutes of deleted scenes. You'll want to see them. Some were rightly removed but a few others really should have stayed in.".

The DOA logo gets an on screen appearance too much that is very annoying. The love relationships seem so poorly built up that it exists just for the sake of existing. Not to mention the numerous soft porn scenes that make the film look cheap. Oh and Devon Aokiwears the same facial expression on her face all the time and her dialogs are spoken in such a plain and mundane way that is devoid of any emotion.However there are good things about the film. The film is pure brainoff entertainment. The fight scenes are very well thought out and rehearsed. This alone makes the film fun to watch.".

Colourful and featuring plentiful reasonable action DOA is only interesting in the opportunities it presents to draw comparison to others.Borrowing stylistic and casting ideas from Charlie's Angels and Kill Bill DOA is essentially Mortal Kombat and Streetfighter combined. Drawing parallels to Enter the Dragon too there is nothing original or inventive.Kane Kosugi benefits most from the choreography. He has a sequence on a flight of stairs which is brilliant and brutal  very similar to his scenes in his Japanese breakthrough vehicle Blood Heat. Elsewhere while the film sexes up the concept of the tournamentvideo game movie it's fatal flaw is that it's heroines don't convince. In Charlie's Angels they did.Cory is notable for doing more than his share of fighting femme movies back in Hong Kong including the recent So Close but none are classic. DOA should have featured support from the likes of Cynthia Rothrock and Michelle Yeoh rather than Eric Roberts and Robin Shou. The girls are pure eye candy. Only Pressley comes close to credibility  because she has an impressive physique and attitude. Holly flutters her eyes at Coronation Street's Matthew Marsden while forcing an English accent. Devon Aoki lacks charisma.The incorporation of the video game elements such as the character intros K.O. freeze frames etc works really well and the costume design and production design brings the game to life brilliantly. You believe in the exaggerated world and that is key. But ultimately this is little more than a time waster.A decent popcorn movie but nothing new for action fans.".

Sure it was a very poor excuse for a plot but the action was really quite good. Before I get into that I need to make a remark a lot of people have been slandering this movie because of it's story line fair enough but if you say that it doesn't make sense you must be one thick chimpanzee The story is so linear it hurts and very I repeat VERY easy to understand! Back to the movie. The acting was fine I was especially pleased at Holly's Performance A perfect role for her I would say if Anyone's ever seen any of her film clipsPlot Prowrestler Tina Jaime Pressly master thief Christie Holly Valance and ninja princess Kasumi Devon Aoki are competitors in a martial arts tournament with a 10 million prize.That pretty much sums up the basis of the plot haha but yeah. Good Action Hot Girls a worth while watch. Oh and another thing Sarah Carter who starred in 3 episodes of Smallville plays another butt kickin' Babe very sexy. It was kind of refreshing be able to watch a movie where the plot wasn't really a problem at all all you had to do was focus on what was going on no having to think about how this person knows this person and why they want to kill each other. It was also good to see a 'Girl Power' Flick which wasn't cheesy in the way that Charlie's Angels was yeah it was cheesy in other ways but none of that come on angels let's go get 'em All in all a good watch I just hope they don't try and do a sequel sighs and IF they do I hope they get a damn script writer!!!!7 Stars".

But what Impressed me the most with DOA is the fight sequences. Kane Kosugi has one of the best I've seen In a while on a flight of stairs and Sarah Carter and Holly Valance battle it out in the rain making it an almost glorified wet tshirt Competition.If your looking for something innovating form this genre keep walking but if your looking for a great way to spend and hour and a half with some friends then see DOA.".

Many may have to lower their expectations so as to not feel as other reviewers have and may need to remind themselves that these women are not masters of combat and that a gorgeous woman in a bikini is not offensive but a vision.

So when it was released I avoided watching it until now.Corey Yuen did an amazing job directing this one. The choreography of the fight scenes were really good but the script and the plot... those needed work. It was fun seeing Robin Shou and Collin Chou in this film.

	schema:reviewBody "With its one dimensional characters and convoluted story dead or alive was never really the best game to bring to the big screen . But nevertheless thanks to cory yune and a dubious ensemble cast we now have a dead or alive movie. But is it any better than the corny trailers suggests ? The answer is NO .Like the games its based on there's plenty of scantily clad babes and over the top action but thats all there is. There's no sense of suspense interesting characters or successful attempts at intentional humour just over edited fights mixed with a healthy portion of TA.Will the fans like it ? I can safely bet that once again the answer is no. Much like 94's street fighter movie the characters are brought to life through a horribly mismatched cast decked out in cheesy cosplay outfits only the most diehard fans will be completely happy with this one.DOA isn't completely terrible. The few fights that aren't edited to death are pretty good  and there's lots of laughs to be had from the corny acting and dialogue but its overall buffoonery doesn't raise it above trashy midnight movie on cable status.Its one for horny teens and dead or alive completists only.".

Jaime Pressly is great in this movie along with Eric Roberts and Devon Aoki. Great cast and great fights makes this out to be a pretty good movie plus hot babes that can fight just never gets old in the action genre to me. Overall I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 because I thought it was good and entertaining but it could have been a little better if it had been rated R or if the fights were extended a little more.7 out of 10 recommended for fight fans and action junkies like myself.".

	schema:headline " Better Than Most Video game Adaptations";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to say that based on the previews I didn't think this film stood a chance of getting anything better than a 210. However knowing that Corey Yuen was directing the picture I probably should have at least given the action the benefit of the doubt. As it turns out DOA is a pretty rubbish flick in terms of plot and acting but the action is solid. Yuen has a very Ronnie Yu style in terms of how he works the camera and while this film isn't going to win any awards anytime soon it's a solid popcorn action flick.For the folks who have seen Yuen's So Close which starred Shu Qi and Zhao Wei DOA follows the same formula. Good looking women taking part in some good looking action and whooping on each other's good looking behinds. The plot which is virtually nonexistent simply consists of fighters from around the world being invited to a martial arts tournament. Of course each fighter has his or her own motives and there are obviously some secret agendas going on behind the scenes. Honestly the plot is so paper thing it's not even worth discussing. Women might be put off by this film and immediately assume that it's nothing more than a teenage boy's fantasy but in fact DOA does a better job of appealing to women as well than McG's overly girl power Charlie's Angels.All in all there isn't much to say about this film except that the action and the sporadic humor are the only things which make it worth viewing. That might not sound like much but Yuen's experience with choreographing fights scenes really shows and as mentioned earlier he really knows how to work the camera. In fact he could probably convince you that Steven Segal has something left with his camera work alone. Yuen also knows how to shoot the leading ladies in terms of knowing how to make them look good and I'm not just talking about the fight scenes. Yes the fighting consists of somewhat over the top wire work at times but it's 10 times better than the amateurish stuff McG tried to put together for Charlie's Angels. The film also makes no attempts to take itself too seriously like Lara Croft Tomb Raider did at times. DOA compares to the first Mortal Kombat film in that it's kind of a faithful adaptation of the source material and definitely made for fans of the series in that the focus is on the action although fans of martial arts flicks in general will find plenty to like with DOA. DOA wont change peoples opinions on film adaptations of video games anytime soon that task is in the hands of Kojima and his Metal Gear Solid project but it is a much better popcorn action flick than the previews lead you to believe. The way I see it if people are willing to pay to watch something thrown together by hacks like Paul W.S. Anderson and yes I know that he directed the original Mortal Kombat and McG why not DOA? The fight choreography is much better than anything those two could ever conjure up and the leading ladies are about as good looking as can be. Besides no one watches a film like DOA for anything aside from the eye candy anyway. Far from great but much better than I had anticipated. 6.510.".

I don't even care if there really is a video game called DOA. I do care that the great Corey Yuen is on atomic crack overdrive in this flick. While every bit as goofy as other video game movies DOA is miles above as far as the action goes even when compared with regular Hollywood action flicks. Of course it doesn't hurt that the women who are doing all the a kicking are incredibly sexy. The biggest surprise is how good Jaime Pressly is in this film. I'd seen her play hot chick before and I'd seen her play hillbilly comedy on TV but she does both in this one on top of doing some very convincing wire fu. She really should have an action career.".

I knew it was desperate for some ratings.This will NOT satisfy actionmartial arts fans and it will NOT satisfy DOA fans. So what has Corey Yuen tried to achieve? Absolutely nothing.The DOA characters are bland and generic How did Yuen screw up the source material?!. The actors can't act. Their story arcs or lack thereof do not help the audience sympathize with them.Holly Valance acts as the sexy cat thief Christie. It hurts that the whole time she tries to act like that. Devon Aoki as Kasumi was a complete miscast. Sarah Carter as Helena didn't stand out but she didn't completely lose face in this mess. Ayane is nothing more than a reason for a cat fight between her and Kasumi. Ryu Hayabusa was played out to be Kasumi's love interest rather than a masterful ninja any game enthusiast would wonder how Yuen could butcher one of the most beloved video game characters of all time.The added characters are uninspired. Weatherby is annoying and unfunny the only reasons I remember his name. Oh yeah and the fact that he kept telling everyone who called him Wallaby. Was that funny?. You can see that the man is TRYING to act. Max as Christie's partner in crime does nothing to enhance the plot he adds 3 minutes to the 86 minute movie by allowing Christie to sleep with him. The main antagonist and the final fight is almost laughable.The only saving character is Jaime Pressley as Tina Armstrong. Although not in the busty proportions of game Tina it's almost forgiven as she makes the character her own and has a genuinely funny relationship with her father Bass. One of the only reasons to watch this movie.The plot is completely horrible. Generic and predictable it would have looked better back in the 1980's. One expects it to revolve around the actual tournament or focus on a specific character's story seen in the game. What I got was some lame conspiracy and as Tina rightly puts it in the trailer They're a bunch of pervs.The soundtrack is unoriginal. It's a bunch of licensed music probably because the music composer gave up on this movie. Funnily enough DOA rightly plays the song 'Scandalous'.The martial artsfighting is as fake as it can get. Wires can be 'seen' without actually being visible and Yuen's decision to do 'Matrix' shots is a double edged sword. Good because it's apparent Popstar Valance can't fight bad because the audience has had enough of slow motion sequences. All characters apparently do the same type of martial arts. One comes to wonder how the nonninja characters fight fluidly with a sword against 20 trained professionals. Utter rubbish.Attention to detail is obviously something the crew thought unnecessary. The characters are from different ethnicities. A few even come from Japan. Yet they can all speak perfect English. WITH American ACCENTS. From the first line the audience roared with laughter at this very poor mistake.DOA fans Dear Yuen and co why pay homage to DOA Xtreme Beach Volleyball when you can't even pay homage to DOA properly? Christie works in a team? Hayate is the ultimate fighter? Hayabusa acts like a ninja wannabe? Helena is American? How did Jan Lee get defeated so easily? What about Lei Fang? Yes she is in it but not as a beautiful oriental schoolgirl. She has a cameo but anyone would realize the woman portraying her is some 40 year old dressed up like a schoolgirl. Hideous.Essentially a movie not worthy of your time unless you're REALLY REALLY bored. Miss. Pressley saves this stinker from scoring a one.210".

They have never played computer games and I haven't since my kids were young  say 15 years ago. So the fact that this is based on a beat 'em up was not a factor.We all laughed when Devon Aoki's wings snapped open. And we laughed again when Holly Valance put her bra on and caught the gun. And we laughed some more at the pirates being put to shame.In fact we laughed quite a lot throughout. I know it is ostensibly a martial arts movie but it is played throughout very tongue in cheek. It knows that it is essentially tripe but it is cheerfully unashamed of that fact. It is good humoured bright colourful funny and full of sexy girls on display in a rather wholesome and nonsleazy way.This movie is fun and should be given a chance for that alone.".

	schema:headline " Bad in all the right ways DOA is just a hell of a lot of fun to watch!";
	schema:reviewBody "I find it rather hilarious that people actually take films like this seriously. How they write out these longwinded reviews that probably had more thought put into them than the entire creative process of this film calling it horrible poorly put together an abomination dumb brainless sophomoric etc. It's all just pointless and a big waste of time. DOA Dead or Alive isn't trying to be a meaningful film. It's not trying to be The Godfather or Citizen Kane. With that said I'm now going to waste my time typing out a longwinded review... but a positive one D First the story... or lack there of. DOA centers around a fighting tournament called... you guessed it DOA where fighters from all over the world are apparently randomly picked. They come to this tournament fight and then crown a champion. That's about all there is to it. Oh yeah there's also some kind of plot twist later on where the leader of the tournament turns out to be evil big surprise and he's apparently trying to make a pair of hightech sunglasses that will make him the greatest fighter of all time. No I'm not joking that's actually what happens. I swear to god.DOA is all about the overthetop action and watching some of the most beautiful woman on earth kick lots of ass as well as show it and boy does it deliver these things in spades. Now granted a lot of movies that strictly rely on these types of simple tactics to entertain truly are horrible and sometimes even unwatchable but there's a certain charm to DOA that just makes it a joy to watch. It's as if the film KNOWS that it's a crappy video game movie and it embraces it. In doing so the film stacks cheese on top of cheese and hamfisted acting and becomes all the more fun and memorable for it.Compare DOA with other movies based on video games if you want an idea of what I mean. Movies like Street Fighter The Legend of Chun Li and Mortal Kombat are huge failures because they take themselves WAY too seriously and that's a big nono when your premise is so silly. DOA knows what it is it doesn't try to be dramatic or touching it doesn't try to be anything memorable granted there are a few I WILL AVENGE YOU!!! type cringeworthy moments but they are short and quickly lost in the endless shots of TA and action.Make no mistake DOA is a pretty poorlymade film. The story is nonexistent the acting and dialogue are atrocious but there's a certain playfulness to it all that still makes the actors a joy to watch some of the special effects if you want to call 'em that are pretty laughable.However for everything that DOA does wrong it also does something right. The acting as bad as it is has a hidden perhaps even unintentional genius to it almost as if the actors are saying yeah I suck but damit I'm having a good time making this film!. One thing I have come to learn about film is that most of the time if the actors are noticeably having a good time making the film on screen the audience will in turn have a good time with the actors.One thing DOA does exceptionally well is the fight choreography. It's simply the best I have seen in a video game based film MK Street Fighter Tekken take some lessons!. What makes it all the more memorable is that while we are watching these amazing fights the director never lets us forget that we are watching a ridiculous cheesefest.Amidst all of the mindblowing stunts and flawless direction during these moments the director will insert a shameless boob or ass shot or some kind of horrendously bad special effect. The expert filming techniques during the fight scenes in combination with the hilariously bad amateur moments no matter how unintentional are simply brilliant and really give this film a character and soul of it's own.Perhaps one of my favorite elements of DOA is Eric Roberts yes Julia Roberts' brother!. Once kind of a household name in the 80s Eric fell from grace and for a large part of the 90's and 2000s mainly appeared in crappy Bmovies kind of like this one but without the fun. Here Roberts' plays a hilariously awesome hamclenching villain whose solepurpose in life is to create the ultimate sunglasses and take over the planet. Roberts plays the character pretty straight but his occasional 'moustache twirling' and hilariously bad and nonsensical motivations work extremely well within the context of the film.In closing I think the best way I can explain DOA is by calling it an accidental masterpiece. It's successful in my opinion for a lot of the reasons that Plan 9 from Outer Space became successful over time. These films have a charm to them something pure perhaps a highly motivated director with a very loving passion for creating films but lacks the skill to actually make good ones. They do a lot of things wrong but these mistakes miraculously come together in actually making the film memorable. Unlike Plan 9 however DOA actually manages to do some things well.I give DOA 8.5 crotch shots out of 10. Now THIS is how you make a movie based on a video game!".

	schema:reviewBody "Dead Or Alive is one of those films in which you would watch it if you were a big fan of the video games or at least heard of them. I being a big fan of the video games thought it was not as disappointing to the video game series as I thought it was going to be and it really in the end was a very great action movie. Although it was very mediocre at times such as the comedy was low and unfunny the fighting was intense and they were able to create really nice action sequences without any use of blood. Plenty of things were impossible for the characters in this film to do if these characters were actual people and not somehow genetically enhanced before they went to this island but still it's a movie and a very fun and entertaining one at that. When there is no sense of danger for the main characters though it's kind of hard to enjoy it and the main characters seem to be on top too much for you to worry about them.Anyway this film basically just has more involvement around the women of the DOA tournament than any of the other players which was sort of taking a big risk and I think they did that just because they thought a lot of guys would see this. Another thing was that they left out the awesome character of Hitomi. Well this is actually an extremely pleasing fighting film if you enter with the right expectations and it has a few big problems but I'm sure anyone who makes a movie based on a video game can not get everything 100 accurate and overall this film was very well put together. Resident Evil is my favorite video game adaptation.Ayane is a very respectable character adaptation in this film as well but she is overlooked and under screen played. I enjoyed it a lot otherwise...".

A fight style tournament experts in their fighting styles get picked randomly fly to an island and have to parachute out of a plane to find it. These fights are not to the death rather but loser goes home prize is 10 million dollars. Now the acting is pretty flat there is 2 subplots mixed in while the fights are picked. For men the horn dog side will be satisfied as the women are scantly clad in much of it. The savior of this fil is the cinematography and choreography with the fights and martial arts. Jaime Pressley is actually funny and wildly good with her stunts in this. Devon Aoki wow exceptional skill set and reminds me much of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon style. Holly Valance was amazing in her role as fighter and thief. I was a little dismayed at Eric Roberts performance as the antagonist not his better moments and his fighting was god awful. I rather enjoyed this film though and if your a fan of martial arts and some comedy watch it. I went 710 here".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll get straight to the point and say ITS BAD. Any fans of the games prepare to be severely disappointed.When I first heard that they were doing a DOA movie I was sceptical. When I first saw the actors picked I was more so. When I saw the film I was amazed how bad they actually did.I've never seen anything so painful. And I'm not talking about the strictly average fights. Somehow they've managed to totally butcher almost every characters personality beyond belief. Every new character coming on screen was like a kick in the face.Now i knew that it would be near impossible to get good actors who would look like and really feel like their characters. But they avoided that problem by not even trying! Instead they tried to get some lame cast of stars rather than people actually suited. We don't want a Christie thats played by a pop star!!! We don't need an Ayane played by someone who looks twice her age! Also many of the costumes also look as if they were stolen of cosplayers.But that doesn't matter either because they've decided to throw away any similarity to the characters anyway. Just a few nags... For some reason they made Helena  as best as I can describe some rollerskating bubbly pop girl. They seem to totally remove any sense of her french nationality and the fact shes a opera singer. They also add in and god knows why.. this geeky 'love interest'. Its not Helena at all! Christie is said to be a thief rather than an assassin. No longer the cold and detached killer shes meant to be. They also changed her unique fighting style no SheQuan anywhere to be seen she seems to prefer to fight with clenched fists. Again just not the same character.Ryu. Even as one of the 'least butchered' characters any fans of ninja gaiden will be pained to see their hero being so... mundane. His capture is plain insulting. They also made the mistake of saying he's in the same clan as Kasumi.kasumi's title as a 'ninja princess' is horribly skewed. For some reason the small simplistic ninja village is replaced by a city with her living in a palace and an army of soldiers not even ninjas. Her soft personality is reversed to being cold and constantly looking quite moody. Also at the end of the film her and the others go back to her clan and massacre the army. WTF!?!? Oh yeah and Shinobi apparently means runaway ninja now... morons...Ugh... I could complain about every character but I've probably said enough on that. The plot also sucks and has no relation to the game. Even the comparatively easy bit the fights are poor. Average at most then dropped by the fact they ignored the games again. They had several games full of fighting manoeuvres they could have used so to make Ryu fans shout out Yeah! He did Izuna drop. Just generally make them fight in their own styles. But did they use it? Nope. Sod that.So there. The people responsible for this need to be slapped round the face with sponge full of glass dust and soaked in acid. I knew making a live action DOA movie would be a bad idea but there is no excuse for something this poor. Unforgivable.An insult to DOA and fans and nothing more than a cheep second rate action movie for everyone else.".

Holmes Watson and then Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard all venture up to the Scottish mansion to investigate the murders.This is good stuff with nary a lull during the 69minute film that features a variety of suspects from evillooking to the nicest guy in the house.

	schema:reviewBody "While it's not as great as earlier Holmes mysteries such as The Hound of the Baskervilles The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and The Scarlet Claw The House of Fear is still an admirable entry in Holmes' list of triumphs. My favourite detective mysteries are always the ones that include a dash of horror and I'm pleased to remark that this one has that. The film is directed by Roy William Neill the same man that directed fellow horrororientated Holmes yarn The Scarlet Claw. For this film Neill has succeeded in capturing a foreboding and intriguing atmosphere once again and the story which includes a rickety old house benefits immensely from that. The story follows a group of men that have moved to Scotland from London after forming a club and buying a large house. After two of them are murdered subsequent to receiving strange notes the supersleuth and his trusty sidekick Dr Watson are called in to get to the bottom of the mystery. Could the fact that each member of the group is a beneficiary of each of the others' life insurance policies have anything to do with it? This film is very short at just 69 minutes and this is part of the reason why the film doesn't work quite as well as other Holmes yarns. Despite being short the film doesn't have many moments of real tension and there are several instances where the story slows down to walking pace and these can be a trifle dull. The story in this movie is rather thin but despite it's lack of tension it does have intrigue which redeems the plotting somewhat. One thing that the film definitely does benefit from is that like all other Universal Holmes films made in the 30's and 40's it stars the great Basil Rathbone as the great detective and Nigel Bruce as the sidekick Dr Watson. These two have a great onscreen chemistry and you can really believe that they are old friends. The climax of the film is nice and it's unlikely that you'll see it coming...but that's its main vice also it's somewhat unlikely. I'm becoming a big fan of Sherlock Holmes movies so I'm rating this one a little higher than many would but in spite of my slight bias this is still a very good film and one that Holmes fans will not want to miss".

	onyx:emotionText "While it's not as great as earlier Holmes mysteries such as The Hound of the Baskervilles The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and The Scarlet Claw The House of Fear is still an admirable entry in Holmes' list of triumphs. My favourite detective mysteries are always the ones that include a dash of horror and I'm pleased to remark that this one has that. The film is directed by Roy William Neill the same man that directed fellow horrororientated Holmes yarn The Scarlet Claw. For this film Neill has succeeded in capturing a foreboding and intriguing atmosphere once again and the story which includes a rickety old house benefits immensely from that.

	schema:reviewBody "Murder says Sherlock Holmes to his friend Dr. John Watson is an insidious thing. Once a man has dipped his fingers in blood sooner or later he'll feel the urge to kill again. Good gracious me says Watson. High on the lip of a Scottish cliff overlooking the crashing sea sits Drearcliffe a grim stone mansion where says the legend no man ever goes whole to his grave. Seven more or less elderly men live there the members of the Good Comrades Club. The host and fellow member the owner of Drearcliffe and a most cordial even innocent and trusting man is Bruce Alistair. He was quite enthusiastic when someone he can't remember who he tells Sherlock Holmes suggested each member of the club take out an insurance policy with all the other members listed as beneficiaries. The last man alive of course will be very wealthy. When one of the seven men sitting at dinner receives an envelope with seven orange seeds no one thinks twice. Hours later the man is murdered done to a crisp in a horrible automobile crash. The next night another member of the club receives another envelope this time with six seeds. He's found later at the base of the cliff so mangled that only his cuff links can identify him. At this point the insurance company calls in Sherlock Holmes Basil Rathbone. Soon he and Watson Nigel Bruce are in Scotland and have secured invitations to stay at Drearcliffe. As gruesome death stalks the ancient house there will be only two members of the Good Comrades Club left alive. One is the perpetually agreeable Bruce Alistair. The other is a man Holmes had encountered years earlier a famous surgeon who was acquitted of the brutal murder of his young bride. Despite boulders rumbling down the cliff Great Scott Holmes that was meant for us! a suit of armor that trembles a moldering passageway the entrance to which is hidden in a great flaming fireplace and death that is accompanied by hideous mutilation Sherlock Holmes is not to be deterred. The secret of the deaths of the Comrades Club will amaze us but not Holmes at it's ruthless logic and subtle scheme. The House of Fear runs slightly more than an hour. It sets a brisk pace that doesn't falter and turns out to be one of the better RathboneBruce entries in the series. The mystery is just clever enough that I doubt too many will figure out what's up until most of the movie is over. Rathbone does his usual serious portrayal of Holmes. Bruce does his usual imitation of a buffoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sherlock Holmes movie series resumes with its tenth installment of THE HOUSE OF FEAR Universal 1945 produced and directed by Roy William Neil. Being the only film in this franchise to lift a title from unrelated Holmes movie Universal's own mystery The House of Fear starring William Gargan this entry based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Adventures of the Five Orange Pips attempts on being different and most stylish from the previous entries especially when formula tends to mix with that of both Doyle and famed mystery writer Agatha Christie.Following the traditional opening titles and theme score introducing Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes an Nigel Bruce as Doctor Watson through the lifting fog as the camera captures their footed shadow images walking slowly down the streets of uncertainty the voiceover narrative reveals what's about to occur The events I'm about to relate began a fortnight ago in a grim old house first high on a cliff on the west coast of Scotland. This singular structure is known as Drearcliff House. Gathered there for dinner were the seven members of the most extraordinary club called the Good Comrades ... The story opens with the gathering of wealthy middleaged members headed by its jolly old founder Bruce Alastair Aubrey Mather Ralph King Richard Alexander Stanley Rayburn Cyril Develati Captain John Simpson Harry Cording Guy Davies Wilson Benge Doctor Simon Merrivale Paul Cavanaugh and Alan Cosgrove Holmes Herbert. Mrs. Monteigh Sally Shepherd the melancholy housekeeper who never smiles passes out an envelope containing orange pips to Ralph King a retired barrister. The following night King is killed as his car plunges over a cliff. As the men drink a toast to their dearly departed member Mrs. Monteigh passes out another envelope this time to Stanley Rayburn a distinguished actor in his day. He too meets his doom. Because the club members have made each other beneficiaries to their substantial life insurance policies Mr. Chalmers Gavin Muir an insurance underwriter comes to famed London detective Sherlock Holmes for assistance. When Holmes learns Doctor Merrivale a famous surgeon acquitted years ago for murder to be one of the members he immediately takes the case. Assisted by his colleague Doctor Watson the two crime solvers come to Scotland via train The Flying Scotsman. Upon their arrival more ghastly murders take place all preceded by a mysteriously slid under thedoor envelope containing orange pips indicating a symbol of death. Inspector Lestrade Dennis Hoey and assistant Sergeant Bleeker Leslie Dennison of Scotland Yard soon enter the scene not long after Doctor Watson's life is threatened and soon abducted when coming close to solving the mystery himself during his frightful stay in the house or better yet castle of fear.With an abundance of movie mysteries produced at that time whether individually or part of a continuing series the best are the ones that succeed even with overly familiar plots. THE HOUSE OF FEAR happens to be one of them. Witnessing club members being killed off one by one as survivors come fear of their lives suspecting one another adding to the suspense. Another added treat is the imaginative midcamera range of subject matters to appear taller than their actual size as well as capturing certain viewpoints through slant camera focus. Aside from well constructed mystery and fine use of witty exchanges between Watson and Lestrade the plot formulates wellintentioned humor for one noted scene that would do the comedy team of Abbott and Costello proud set during the midnight hours in a cemetery where Watson is shown doing all the work digging up a grave while Holmes sits around to think. As Holmes temporarily steps out of the picture Watson finds himself conversing and answering questions to the constant sound of Who? turning out to be from an observing owl resting on a tree branch above. Notable quote No man goes whole to his grave.For some trivia THE HOUSE OF FEAR turns out to be a rare instance in the series to not include Mary Gordon in her recurring role as Mrs. Hudson. It's also the second time the full name of Holmes' assistant is indicated that of Doctor John H. Watson. Harry Cording usually seen in villainous briefs in other Holmes segments has a sizable role for a change while Doris Lloyd Bessie David Clyde MacGregor the blacksmith and Alec Craig Angus turn up in scene or two. Excluding one brief moment of a plunging car THE HOUSE OF FEAR could easily pass for Doyle's original intent with story setting being the 1890s rather than the 1940s.THE HOUSE OF FEAR distributed to home video and later DVD format having been broadcast on numerous public television and cable channels including Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere December 26 2009 may not show preference as the best in the entire series but certainly as enjoyable from start to finish as Holmes mysteries go. Next installment THE WOMAN IN GREEN 1945 which features Holmes' arch enemy Professor Moriarty. ".

The plot itself is reasonably compelling as we try to guess who's killing off members of a gentleman's club onebyone. Still and all the brief running time 69 minutes doesn't allow much character development so the whodunit angle remains underdeveloped. Couple that with the pointless presence of an unfunny Inspector LaStrade isn't Watson supposed to supply the comic relief? and much valuable screen time is wasted. I wish the screenplay had taken better advantage of the spooky sets by playing up the menace as for example the shadowy appearance of the mystery man's shoes. Or Sally Shepherd as the zombielike housekeeper Mrs. Monteith who's enough to make you want to clean your own castle. Nonetheless there's enough mystery atmosphere and Basil Rathbone to make this a solid Holmes entry.".

	schema:headline " Excellent example of how to make updated Holmes work";
	schema:reviewBody "By this time Roy William Neill and the other creative forces behind the Sherlock Holmes series at Universal had learned how to make an updated version of Holmes work...by pushing the updated elements into the background and letting the character of Holmes take center stage. The House of Fear is a fine example of this philosophy featuring Holmes in a story that would play just as well in Victorian Britain as in the WWII era.Indeed the film is based albeit very loosely on Conan Doyle's Holmes story The Five Orange Pips. Only the main device is borrowed for the film...the foretelling of violent death by the mysterious delivery of orange pips that's seeds for all us Yanks...but the main thrust of the otherwise entirely original script is quite Holmesian in itself and gives the character of Sherlock Holmes plenty of room to utilize his singular gift for deductive reasoning.This cinematic reworking of Conan Doyle's tale has Holmes at the home of the Good Comrades Club a suitable location for the mystery which unfolds. The members of said club are frightened out of their minds hence the House of Fear as one by one they receive the ominous warning of the orange pips then soon after die horrible deaths...their corpses mangled beyond all recognition then to be discovered by the surviving members of the club. No one knows who will be next and it seems very likely that the killer is in fact one of the club's own members. Sherlock Holmes must solve the mystery hopefully before the club's roster dwindles any further.There are ample twists and turns along the way...and also this being a traditional whodunit red herrings galore. The cinematography and direction are on a par with the best of the series' films and the performances are of the usual admirable quality especially given the brief shooting schedules and appallingly low budgets afforded the filmmakers. The atmosphere I'd say is most comparable to that of Sherlock Holmes Faces Death...but is slightly more effective here. As always Sherlockian purists may be offended by Nigel Bruce's bumbling portrayal of Watson. But these are the little things we allow to slide in order to enjoy this film for what it is...a fun and entertaining mystery which even if it defies some of the principles of the Holmes canon at least follows in the tradition of the original Holmes character. A definite improvement over the first three films.Overall one of the top entries in this series...which started out with little promise and went on to deliver great things. 1944 was the best year for the series but 1945 delivered the goods more than once...this being the first example. Definitely recommended for series fans or anyone with an appreciation of Sherlock Holmes or classic whodunits.".

Like the other films in the series it is stretching the original story let us say embellishing it. But the embellishing works.Who is killing off the members of THE GOOD COMRADES a small friendship society live in an isolated country house? The members are all successful professional men now in retirement  except one Dr. Simon Merivale Paul Cavanagh. Holmes is called in by an insurance company who notes that the members of the society are the beneficiaries of the life policies of the dead members. Holmes notes Merivale a very brilliant surgeon murdered his wife a number of years before and did such a bangup job defending himself before a jury that he was acquitted. So he is already suspect number one. But Holmes discovers that some of the murders are committed when Merivale could not have committed them. Subsequently he has to look at the others Henry Cording Holmes Herbert and Aubrey Mather. And every time the same crazy set of circumstances prevents him from choosing one of them as the killer.Oh yes the orange pips. It seems that the unknown killer delights in taunting his victims by having the maid deliver at dinner before the next murder a sealed unsigned envelop containing orange pips. The number of pips in the envelop tell you how many days the proposed victim has left. See I told you it's a neat plot. Lestrade is here Hoey as funny as usual  note his scene where he compares his foot with the killer's shoe. Aubrey Mather as the owner of the house is genial and weird. Cavanagh is properly superior and untrustworthy it was one of three films in the series he popped up in and he did fine in all three  he was a good actor in both villain and sympathetic roles and yet never quite got the popularity of others like him like Thomas Gomez Henry Daniell Lionel Atwill and George Zucco possibly because he seemed too friendly at times. Also notice Sally Montieth as the creepy gloomy maidservanthousekeeper.The film is based on THE ADVENTURE OF THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS from the first collection of Holmes' short stories THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES. In the original the basic story concentrates not on an insurance murder plot but on a criminal gang and their targeting one family again and again and again. Conan Doyle was well read in crime literature and fact and his gang is none other than the Ku Klux Klan. It must have been a revelation to readers in 1891 London to hear about the racist organization but it fits in quite nicely in the original story  if not in this fine variation of it.".

Produced and directed by a veteran of the Holmes series Roy William Neill from a screenplay that Roy Chanslor adapted from Arthur Conan Doyle's story The Five Orange Pips the engrossing film ranks among the best of the Universal series. The script offers Nigel Bruce as Doctor Watson amusing opportunities to verbally spar with Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade and to shine in several solo scenes in one of which he identifies a critical clue that leads to Holmes solving the mystery. Basil Rathbone inhabits the Holmes persona with perfection perhaps to his own disenchantment at being stereotyped as the character. Paul Cavanaugh who played Lord Penrose in The Scarlet Claw returns as Doctor Merrivale a member of the men's group. Among the supporting players Aubrey Mather stands out as Bruce Alistair another of the original seven gentlemen and Sally Shepherd is the memorably humorless housekeeper Mrs. Monteith who delivers the envelopes that contain the orange pips. Virgil Miller who lensed The Pearl of Death provided the evocative black and white photography that utilizes dramatic shadows and occasionally askew angles to enhance the mystery that enshrouds the sinister Scottish manor.What initially seems overly familiar Agatha Christie territory soon evolves into a deeper mystery that fully engages Holmes's intellect to unravel. From Rathbone and Bruce to the group of seven the housekeeper a tobacco merchant and a group of seamen the performers are all in fine form the script is excellent the direction taut the photography atmospheric and The House of Fear stands tall among the Basil RathboneNigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes films.".

	schema:headline " I really enjoyed this atmospheric entry ...";
	schema:reviewBody "... even though I saw the end coming a mile away. I've got the entire series of Basil Rathbone Holmes films on DVD and I think the films were better being brought into the modern era when they were taken over by Universal although this particular film has such a Gothic atmosphere it really could be set in either the 19th or 20th centuries.Seven welloff men in rural Scotland who enjoy each other's company have named themselves the good comrades and have oddly taken out life insurance policies on themselves naming all of the others as beneficiaries. However two of them have been murdered after receiving an envelope containing a number of pips equal to the number of surviving comrades at that instant in time. Sherlock Holmes is recruited to solve the mystery not by the police but by the insurance company that doesn't want to pay off seven large policies. Who gets the money if all seven die? That detail is conveniently omitted for the viewers' pleasure.Thus Holmes and Watson are off to the castle in which the Good Comrades meet. The murders continue even while they and the police are actively involved in the investigation including a near miss on Holmes' life with a large boulder thrown from a cliff along the beach. As usual Holmes says things that tell you he's hot on the trail of the solution to the mystery but nothing that would let the viewer in on matters until the final scene when Holmes solves the crimes.Holmes is generous to the police in letting them take credit and generous to a fault to his friend and colleague Dr. Watson who may know medicine but is usually neither a help nor hindrance to Holmes. However in this film one key detail is noticed by Dr. Watson.Of course you have to wonder if you know who the intended victims are why not just round the surviving comrades up in a room with a cadre of policemen and Holmes as watchdogs but then that wouldn't be much of a film now would it? Highly recommended for the atmosphere for Rathbone and Bruce who wear the roles of Holmes and Watson like a perfect fitting glove and for the sight of the housekeeper at the comrades' meeting place delivering all of the death envelopes as though they were routine telegrams and trudging around the castle at night wielding a hatchet when she thinks she hears a noise like something straight out of a Universal horror film of ten years before.".

I've got the entire series of Basil Rathbone Holmes films on DVD and I think the films were better being brought into the modern era when they were taken over by Universal although this particular film has such a Gothic atmosphere it really could be set in either the 19th or 20th centuries.Seven welloff men in rural Scotland who enjoy each other's company have named themselves the good comrades and have oddly taken out life insurance policies on themselves naming all of the others as beneficiaries. However two of them have been murdered after receiving an envelope containing a number of pips equal to the number of surviving comrades at that instant in time.

Since 2006 Toho Company has started remaking the originals of Doraemon turning them into more emotional educational and more to be the feasts to the eyes.The storyline of this version and the original are much alike yet Nobita and the New Steel Troops is actually the most altered version comparing to the comics and its original film. The additions was mainly Pippo who shares the same role as Lilulu to be the center of emotions in this version. This doubled the emotional scenes thus making the film much more touchy. The cuddly appearance of Pippo as I believed shouldn't be something unnecessary but rather very important to give the film its emphasis of sympathy and compassion to one another and the meaning of sacrifice oneself for the right reason. The details about Lilulu and Pippo's communication starslike hearts and the seemingly developed love between Nobita and Pippo Shizuka and Lilulu made the film much more emotional and more educational to watch. I myself adored this film though I'm not quite the age to watch stuffs like this. In fact I have to admit that I was stunt watching this not because it was worse than the 1986 but it indeed improved in many aspects. It was worth crying at the end when Pippo and Lilulu were disappearing. It's a fact that this film are what you should watch at least once.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was watching this film with a friend of mine. He was a really big fan of Doraemon when he was a youth in China and he had spent the last few weeks introducing me to the series. I'm not a very big fan of anime but the cartoons reminded me a lot of the cartoons I used to watch when I was younger so I found myself enjoying them on their own goofy level. I watched the movie on his suggestion.The plot concerns Nobita and his friends attempting to stop an invasion of Earth by an alien robot army being spearheaded by a young woman and an electronic bowling ball they met earlier. I wouldn't say it's the most original concept but it fits very well into the Doraemon universe and it's wellwritten and welldirected enough to keep you invested.The thing that struck me the most about this movie was it's somewhat darker more emotional tone compared to the TV show. Without giving away the plot I can say that it is not quite the goofy jokefest that the TV series was although it still leaves you feeling good at the end.The animation is quite good. It's not the best I've seen but everything is quite nice to look at. The copy I was watching was Japanese with English subtitles so I can't really comment on the quality of the voice acting although I can't say anything seemed wrong with it.Overall I would say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's not anything that I would call 'innovative' but that's not a bad thing. It's simple but comforting like chicken noodle soup. Anybody who has a little under two hours to spare and wants to enjoy something pleasant should seek this film out especially if they are young children or fans of the Doraemon cartoons.For the record this movie was a remake of a film from 1987. I haven't seen that version but I've been told that the animation is of lower quality and the story is a touch differentsome say better. Quick warning for parents There is one point in the film where one of the female characters appears without any clothes on. She is rendered with Barbie Doll Anatomy though so there isn't really anything to shield your kid's eyes from. Keep in mind that this is not uncommon in Japanese animated works even ones intended for children.".

Many of Rueben's friends are still involved in 'less than legal' occupations and the poverty and wretchedness of the estate seems even worse than when he lived there before. He needs to decide just where he fits in back home and what direction his life will take. Despite trying to make a new life for himself obstacles from past and present seem to always get in the way. While I did find this movie slow paced it captured the dismal feel of this community excellently. It also avoided using simplistic general stereotypes for example police are portrayed both in a very positive and very negative light.

The movie while obviously lowbudget no different than we'll say My Beautiful Laundrette or Mona Lisa at this particular time in UK productions yet its concentration on the inherent drama of a confused and conflicted exPara in a nonempathetic society totally overrode its budgetary limitations.

And jeez I was stunned. It was Britain showed from a totally different angle that I used to know as a tourist and an exchange student. At moments I must admit the picture that emerged was that negative that I started suspecting it must be very much onesided.But coming back to the story a veteran Northern Ireland and the Falklands comes back to the part of London where he used to live only to find the world from which he tried to escape unchanged  probably even worse. His former buddies with whom he used to get into troubles continue to do so only with much graver consequences. He tries to keep away from them find a decent job find a girlfriend but it turns out that no one in this country needs a black war veteran. The only thing he has is his honour and pride from having served his country.What is amazing for me in this movie was probably the inevitability of his fate. Returning home means for him returning to people who got stuck in this ghetto since it is a kind of a ghetto deprived of any future of any hope for better future. Drug dealers thieves war veterans their women and children  they are all thrown into the same category of common criminals the socalled social margin from whom it's best to keep away. The funny thing  sending the police to fight them does not really solve the problem quite the contrary leads to an open war. Yet this is how the problem is being dealt with in most countries.All in all a very good movie one worth seeing not only because of Denzel Washington  but also because of the social problems mentioned... And really is Britain such a racist country?Just one final remark  I wonder what makes D. Washington such a good pick for roles of soldiers and exsoldiers. Huh?".

The budget doesnt help because the scenario of the Falklands War is relegated to a brief scene to a bunch of soldiers looking out of a ship doorway seeing flashes of gunfire away in the distance  and thats the extent the film paints of the Falklands War . Its not only this scene that irritates  I couldnt help noticing that many of the interiors look like they were filmed in a film studio . But perhaps the most unconvincing thing about the film is Denzil Washingtons London accent  I cant believe some people think its any good because I find it as irritating as Dick Van Dykes in MARY POPPINS . And lets not forget that when this film was made Washington wasnt the double Oscar winning mega star he is today but was best known as a TV star due to ST ELSEWHERE . Indeed FOR QUEEN AND COUNTRY feels like an overproduced TV play similar to the excellent PLAY FOR TODAY that the BBC produced in the 1970s but not as well written . The ending is just too coincidental . I know its trying to be bitter and ironic but is completely contrived . Soldiers dont fight and die for Queen and country. They fight and die for one another Major Chris Kebble . 2 Para".

Though the movie is downbeat it does remain interesting throughout despite the fact that the story progresses at a very slow pace for the most part. Also you can see that this movie might possibly have planted the seed for the later Michael Caine movie Harry Brown. Washington is pretty good and the supporting players also give solid performances.

From her teenage days in a school for poor noble young ladies to her near accession to the throne of Russia she showed utter and complete love and devotion for the Tsar Alexander II.What is particularly well depicted in this movie is the waiting. Katia and Alexander spend hours days years sometimes waiting to see each other again. And each second of waiting renders their love stronger. The whole movie is based on some kind of patienceimpatience duality. Alexander begs Katia to be patient but the terrorists feel anything but patience against the regime. They want reform now they want the tsar out with everything he represents now. They are a light of impatience in a country that is still trapped in laws and traditions of the middle ages.".

	schema:headline " Explosive Burst of Talents";
	schema:reviewBody "After Romy Schneider's definite answer NO at the attempts to cast her in the fourth part of SISSI she did not entirely get rid of portraying a monarch on the screen. In fact as a young actress with the European career ahead of her the late 1950s she could embody these characters with the similar grace like the greatest Hollywood stars of the time. And so KATIA a remake of the 1938 movie by Maurice Tourneur the action of which is set in Russia during the reign of tsar Alexander II boasts of her magnetic presence. But its link with SISSI appears to be more biographical than actual. The effect Romy creates in KATIA owes much to the experience of hers under Marischka not only SISSI but also MAEDCHENJAHRE EINER KOENIGIN. In that case it seems quite justified what Film Dienst said about KATIA Sissi with Russian names. Some scenes are so similar to the latter that one could even go further and refer to the style herein as the one on the verge of directorial plagiarism. Yet after analyzing some details of the movie and its background this opinion appears to be quite simplified and generalized. There is one thing that strikes mostly the conservative fans of Kaiserin Elizabeth  while SISSI was a model of morality on the screen KATIA is a far more daring movie which prepares in this way a ground for more controversial movies. The film's content is affected by EXPLOSIONS! Thanks to many people and their encounters but first let me outline some data about the director of this movie.Robert Siodmak had already gained experience in Hollywood making some of the most intriguing film noirs of the time. One of such great effective experiments with the genre appears to be PHANTOM LADY 1944 with the staff producer Joan Harrison Alfred Hitchcock's former secretary and script assistant. After coming back from the USA such European stuff as in KATIA's storyline was surely new to Mr Siodmak. Nevertheless in this typical romance of the time that includes misalliance and typical charm for the stuff he handles some of the skillfully 'manipulated' images exceptionally well. While in thriller we are occupied by the question Where is a murderer? in KATIA we are occupied by Where is the tsar?The revolutionary ideas and attempts that are incorporated into the storyline though may seem boring and exaggerated at certain moments bombing is artificially depicted serve a very useful purpose to depict the twofold reality that influenced the imperial court of the time. Though not very thrilling the details that we pay attention to are a real product of the film noir experience of the director. This focus on details is resembled at the Institute of Smolny sequence and the little portrait of the tsar that Katia holds in her hand. Moreover the camera highlights the face expression of a dying man rather than calling our attention at shooting itself. In the conspiracy sequence the objects of bread and bottle mark the plot's undertone memorably. Some scenes are built upon mere hints not exposing the entire image of a situation.Naturally the film is a royal costume drama and therefore it offers a lot of splendid garments in scenes of exceptional charm. Just to name the great ball that tsar opens with Katia and the young girl from Smolny Institute claims not to dance with anyone else from then on. It may be called a 'Russian epic' thanks to its typical combination of love and reign of tradition and reform of striking heart and national duty. The splendor of the Orthodox Church is nicely depicted in the scene of tsarina Maria Alexandrovna's funeral. But that would be all quite little if it were not for the people we actually see this film today Romy Schneider and Curd Juergens. Here lies another explosion...the one of talents.Their age discrepancy a generation works well on the screen and accurately stresses the 'forbidden love' that was bound like most of the Hollywood romances to lose. Their chemistry is clear and not at all enforced. Romy Schneider in fact portrays a character that grows in age and in experience 'kidnapped' from the narrow minded institute to the court while Curd Juergens portrays a ruler whose heart changes. Their scenes are romantic sleigh ride and daring in one scene they lie in bed  still something uncommon in 1959. Among many of the skillful methods of acting consider their eye contact where camera does an additionally effective job. The supporting cast including Pierre Blanchar as Koubaroff and Monique Melinand as Tsarina remain in the shadow of the two. KATIA is truly a Romy Schneider and Curd Juergens' film. Such a unique pair and isn't that an irony of fate that they both died within one month?All in all no great work of cinematic production but an interesting little film where Romy's talent actually bursts out in the role more free to interpret than Sissi and not yet so daring as her later roles of possibilities in their fullness.".

Their romance however is likely to throw the already troubled Czarist rule by the activities of a group of terrorists seeking more humane laws into turmoil he himself mistrusts his ministers but they in their turn are willing to collaborate with the enemy in order to put a stop to Jurgens and Schneiders love  which is giving the Empire a bad name thus threatening their own position! In fact during the course of the film we are witness to no fewer than four attempts on the Czars life  which is a bit much if you ask me nevertheless its in scenes like these where we get a glimpse of the old Siodmak he was one of the finest exponents of Film Noir the films most creative bit of direction is Siodmaks decision to refrain from showing a duel but rather concentrate on the snowcovered trees nearby and only cutting to the bloodied body Katias officer brother who was defending her honor! once the shots are heard on the soundtrack. The revolutionaries themselves  led by future Claude Chabrol regular Michel Bouquet  are typically depicted as desperate men and women rather than villainous a fate reserved for the Ministers though theyre actually more pitiful and misguided in their own selfimportance than truly evil the ultimate irony is that Jurgens had always been sympathetic to the terrorists cause but the burden of tradition and a whole set of events such as the release of the rebels imprisoned friends promised them by the Emperor via Katia seen as an act of betrayal when the Ministers arrange for the exconvicts to be gunned down soon after eventually seal his fatejust as with the Empress dead Schneider was about to take her place on the throne by his side! For the record the impossibly young Schneider had actually risen to stardom with a similar Ruritanian i.e. quasi fairytale role  that of Princess Sissi in a series of three Austrian films made between 1955 and 1957 as for Jurgens I have his second of two Michel Strogoff films made in 1956 and 1961 recorded as was this one off Italian TV awaiting its turn to be watched. Finally given KATIAs silly U.S. retitling one shouldnt confuse it with an earlier Siodmak picture from his Hollywood days  THE GREAT SINNER 1949 which incidentally was also a period piece about Russians adapted as a matter of fact from Fyodor Dostoyevskys The Gambler.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the most fantastic contemplation of earth paradise in existence.First it's imperative that we notice one major difference the short version and the version longue are two completely different films. From tip to toe. I only knew this film previously in its short version. Yesterday I bought the version longue in my local FNAC store without subtitles it's rare these days.And.................... I fell in love with everything about it stunned and mesmerized being at the same time riddled by the way that the short version lost all sense in comparison with the longue version. You can think of an integral version like a way to stuff a film with pictures but in this movie we have the feeling that the movie was intended to have 164 minutes and not nearly two.And you can picture the transformation that occurred in my perception of this film as I passed from that mutilated fullscreen monosound version to a full widescreen and hifi version. This is why Le Grand Bleu passed from just a movie by Luc Besson to the greatest movie of my greatest director.My perception is that this is the great underwater epic he always wanted to make. And he achieves it in every way specially letting the audience identify themselves with it.Perhaps my favorite Besson movie was The Fifth Element I like them all but after having the privilege of experiencing this fantastic beautiful stunning vivid and moving film The Big Blue passed from one of the medium levels to definitely the top one. The characters all gained strength the underwater scenes all made sense the previous movie was completely backed up and the feeling that this movie was a contemplative journey gained finally its place.I gave it a 10 out of 10 not for the US version how can they even think of erasing Eric Serra's score?!?!? which for its mutilations deserved a 1 but for the version longue which is the only way the movie shall be seen. What a masterpiece! After I saw this movie I rewinded it thinking that my only wish is that one day I get to take part on such an experience being there dreaming and sharing my dream with everyone who would like to share it with me. Perhaps one day a beautiful blue day...".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the movie of my life !I never before saw a film that i could identify myself so much with. Im lucky enough to live in a place near the sea very similar and as beautiful as those in the movie and the opening scenes always remind me of my teenage years and the waters i explored like young Jaqques Mayol does in the beginning of the movie. Things that i still do. So i immediatley related to the character and its love for the ocean.I guess thats the beauty of this movie. It makes us feel that we could be any of its characters because theyre so real. We almost cant believe that they dont exist outside of the movie. This is an amazing beautifuly well written acted photographed and directed movie ! It carries us into an extraordinary world and its our world !! mine at least to some point Not some hollywood depiction of reality !But what its about it ? This is the worst thing anyone can ask about this movie.I would hate to be the guy who had to publicize this in USA. And i can see why it failed there.But what can i say about it?... That its the story of two friends who compete to find out whos best ?...Its more than that ! That its a love story ? It goes beyond every love story ! That its an adventure ? You bet it is ! But it has no action no chasesno dangerous cliffangers no guns and no explosions. It doesnt even has bad guys ! Or good guys in fact. That its a travel or a road movie ? Probably. This movie has better locations than any James Bond movie will ever get and theyre all real !But they dont matter much compared to the characters in the film. The characters then... Theres a hero right ?... Well theres two of them. Two men. But theyre not heroes.Probably the hero is a woman who sacrifices her happiness for love. So theres a woman and two men. Theres got to be a love triangle there to cause all those love story rivalary subplots right ? Well theres a love triangle but there arent subplots attached to it. In fact the love triangle has more than three people. All characters are a part of it realy. Including dolphins ! Even the ocean.Aha ! So this is some sort of a kinky erotic and exotic movie thing ? Wrong ! Theres sex in it but not in that way at all.Its a comedy then... Youll laugh but youll cry too. Its a drama ... Not in the conventional clich way. Not at all. A dramatic comedy... Nope !Its a scifi film !... Well theres scientists in it and deep underwater and even under ice diving scenes but its not a scifi film although the American version Movie Trailler presented it like if it were some new esotheric adventure underwater scifi horror movie when in fact it is not.So what is this movie about ?!!Its about what you want it to be. About what youre feeling. Its that open. You just have to feel it.As Luc Besson said in an interview at some point in the movie he was stuck because he didnt know how to carry the audience inside.Then the real Jaqques Mayol who worked in the film as a diving and story consultant took Besson diving with him one day and made him experience the sea in his way. Then Besson understood that he didnt had to explain anything to the audience. He just had to make people feel what it was like !And boy did he make it ! The atmosphere in this movie goes beyond words. It has to be felt ! Also the soundtrack is out of this world and trully magical.To me this film is about love but in a much deeper meaning than the usual. Beyond race beyond gender beyond sex beyond nationality. Love as an emotion. And about freedom !So get a wide screen TV and a full blast surround. This movie is the reason to buy one if you dont have it! Believe me ! And watch it in the dark.Try to get the european full version of the movie. The american is not that terrible the feeling is there but its diferent from the original.This movie is a masterpiece !  in any version ".

	schema:reviewBody "The Big Blue is a story mainly centred around Jacques Mayol JeanMarc Barr a free diver. Free diving is a sport where people dive as deep as they can with a single breath and no equipment other than a rope and a weighted mechanism to take them to the required depth. Although to say the story of Big Blue is just about free diving does not do it any justice. The story starts in Greece with Jacques as a child then moves forward to present day. In the story we also have Enzo Jean Reno Jacque's lifelong friend and nemesis who motivates him to free dive in competition so he has some competition and also gets him work in other areas of diving. During this work Jacques meets an insurance investigator Johana Rosanna Arquette and a romance starts albeit mostly from her. The story continues as Jacques struggles with problems in his past present and future.The Big Blue is an unusual movie. There is some silly but arguably funny humour. Also there are some serious levels including romance and how we deal with problems from our past our existence and our future. The film is also quite long in the aptly named version longue at about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Fans of Jean Reno would certainly love this movie.I really enjoyed this film. The main story is very light and thinly stretched so to really enjoy it I feel you have to look deeper at the characters and read between the lines. I also really enjoyed the humour which was silly but fun and was a good counterpoint to the serious scenes. JeanMarc Barr was absolutely stunning as Jacques bearing in mind the number of underwater sequences that were required as well. It's a real shame that we don't see JeanMarc in more leading roles. Jean Reno was also extremely good and although for me an irritating character Rosanna Arquette put in a reasonable performance. The cinematography is another lush element of the film with the beautiful locations and underwater sequences especially those with the dolphins. Eric Serra's soundtrack is pretty good also although sounds a little dated. As mentioned this review is based on the version longue. 55".

For anyone wanting to watch a fantastic dream of a film with absorbing characters true love in all its forms and some awesome underwater photography then this is for you! The characters are all formed perfectly almost exaggerated but not Jean Reno is his usual astounding self and JeanMarc Barr really out does himself with Rosanna Arquette in a superb supporting roll. the story ambles along at its own pace but never stops or gets dull keeping you interested along the way I don't want to go too much into it as it was kind of spoiled for my by reading too much of these boards needless to say I was crying at one point and that doesn't happen often. The score compliments the film perfectly Eric Serra has done a wonderfully emotive score that almost interacts with the scenes along the way.Overall I'd give this film a 910 yet again awesome direction acting and soundtrack and definitely in my top films! just a shame i've borrowed it off a mate and have to give it back tomorrow it's definitely something i could watch again and again!".

Le grand bleu it's simply a periphrase with a tinge of euphemism to design the ocean a universe that always inspired to men fear but also fascination. The two main characters Jacques Maillol and Enzo Molinari are fascinated by the sea but for different reasons. If Reno devotes all his energies to diving so as to access to success and glory the sea is more than this for Jacques. He was born with it he swears by it so much that he neglects Johanna's love and the sea will lead him to death. A place of athletic competition an ideal place for rest and entertaining where dolphins are his real and sole friends finally the eternal heaven the ocean epitomizes all this to Jacques. le grand bleu also ranks among the movies that you must watch rather than telling it. Of course there isn't almost any plot dialogs are short and rare but pictures are gorgeous enough to create an entrancing climate supported by Eric Serra's mesmerizing music. The movie's technical qualities can only arouse admiration a shiny photography that perfectly reflects the color of the sea the blue and a fluid making sometimes clever Jacques' childhood is made in black and white. Besides the movie enabled to discover two outstanding actors JeanMarc Barr and Jean Reno but oddly if Reno became one of the most popular French actors it wasn't the case with Barr. In spite of a promising debut he has never be able to make a movie that could have got back him in the saddle. Maybe was he so elated at the bottom of the sea in heaven where everything is fine...".

	schema:reviewBody "OK OK.  I sent in the following comment just after seeing this movie for the first timeThe summary Stupid Pointless Terrible pretty much says it all. Save yourself 2.5h of boring hardtowatch stupid movie. Perhaps the only conclusion about this movie is that accidents involving parents during childhood can really really mess someone up.I admit that I was upset and not just a little bit.  After some relaxing and thinking the above needs some elaboration to be useful to anyone that has not yet seen this movie.First this could have been a very good movie it comes close in a lot of areas especially in the cinematography.  The Greek locations are spectacular.  But I have to say that the underwater shots left me unimpressed.SPOILERS More importantly this movie seems to be a movie about love  the lead male Jacques Mayol is conflicted between his love of the ocean love of his family of dolphins and love of his human partner Johanna. This is where I just don't get this movie and the almost overwhelmingly positive response to it at IMDB.  Mayol is in many respects a classic male lead  he reminds me of Clint Eastwood in many of his westerns and as Dirty Harry.  Does Clint portray a loving male role model in these movies?  Not in my book and Mayol misses even more so in this movie.  Mayol doesn't communicate with anyone in a reasonable fashion except it seems his dolphins.  My initial response to his adult character is that he's just a really messed up individual that never got over the abandonment of his mother and the death of his father who was a diver for his living.Nothing I saw in the movie leads me to believe otherwise about Mayol.  One wonders why Johanna would possible stay with this guy.  He and she never have anything more than extremely tense completely dysfunctional interactions.  Johanna tries to get him to interact with her but other than sex absolutely nothing happens that one could view as positive in any way. Mayol has sex with her tells her he thinks he's in love with her and then takes off and spends the rest of the night swimming in the ocean with his dolphin friends lovers?.  A lot is made about the friendship between Mayol and his boyhood bully Enzo.  Forget it Enzo tries his best to be friends with Mayol in their adult life but again Mayol seems completely disinterested in this other form of human contact.  Enzo and Mayol compete in free diving but Mayol clearly just doesn't care about the competitions taking any real interest away from this part of the movie.Mayol is just flat nuts in the head and the end of the movie proves that he is more seriously suicidal that Enzo.  Enzo dies trying to prove he is the best Mayol dives away from the love and family that is offered to him with Johanna.  So my anger has to do with watching such a destructive unhappy dysfunctional individual not only mess his own life up but also that of the people that need and love him.  There's some weird talk in the movie about the call of the deep blue and mermaids that await males in the depths of the ocean if their love is true.  What a load of baloney!  It would work if the movie went toward showing how Mayol was psychologically damaged by his father's death and how Johanna and Enzo's death help bring him back to humanity.  But the movie goes in just the opposite direction.I found this movie utterly depressing and pointless.  It's clear a lot of other people saw something else in it.  Even as a fairytaleMayol swims away to live as a weird humandolphinthe movie just doesn't work.  He leaves a wife and unborn child for no justifiable reason.I finally gave the movie a 4 of 10 rating only for the cinematography.  If you like weepy love stories there have to be many better movies out there! This one just makes no sense at all.".

For me THE BIG BLUE is simply a masterpiece a wonderfullyshot wonderfully funny and wonderfully human and honest epic about romantic love versus one's life passion. There is so much I'd love to say in praise of this film but I just can't put into words the moods of exquisite melancholy and hope conjured by Besson cinematographer Carlo Verini and composer Eric Serra note  this review refers only to the fulllength European version without the Bill Conti score happy Hollywood ending etc.. I think a lot of people miss the point of the ending SPOILER. All too often the reaction is Huh? He leaves Rosanna Arquette to become some kind of halfman halfdolphin at the bottom of the ocean? What the heck is THAT about? For me the ending is symbolic not to be taken literally just as Jacques' fevered dream of his bedroom becoming the sea is not to be taken literally another analogy would be Renton disappearing down the toilet bowl and swimming in Trainspotting. It doesn't happen  it's just a visual metaphor. As I interpret it Jacques does indeed leave the soontobe mother of his child. He knows and she knows and we the viewers know that he just cannot when it comes to the crunch commit to her as wholeheartedly as to his life's passion the sea. We see the signs at various points in the film especially during the truly unnerving scene in which he abandons her when she's trying to talk to him by doing one of his virtuoso dives. A character as pure as driven by passion as he is cannot compromise. Rather than focus partly on his woman and partly on the sea he choses to focus wholeheartedly on the latter. Even the news that he is going to be a father cannot alter his decision. Ever since he was a small boy and his own father drowned Jacques' life has been an obsessive quest to in some way master the sea master diving and somehow cheat the death his father had almost in revenge for it. This film could so easily have delivered a happy ending indeed I understand that in the US version it does and given the tremendous highs and lows the comic joy the thrilling dives the scenestealing dolphins and the sexual chemistry of JeanMarc Barr and Rosanna Arquette with which it dazzles us such a happy ending would not have left viewers feeling let down. Instead Besson pulls off a master stroke showing us how human beings can fail to connect with each other and how even great loves are doomed to flicker out in the face of other greater obsessions. Alternatively the ending may be read as Jacques' brief descent to say his goodbyes to the depths and to the past before surfacing to take up a happy future life with his lover and their child. But the guts to fashion an ending open to interpretation is the icing on the cake of a tremendous film that is both a celebration of and meditation on life life's passions and romantic love. Simply amazing stuff.".

After looking at so many of the other reviews I was more than amazed that so many people hated it but then I realized that they just didn't get it. Everyone seems to think the story is a romance the love triangle or a sports flick the free diving and that Jacques obsession with the sea is a mere subplot but that's completely backwards. The romance and the free diving are just the mechanisms that Luc Besson uses to reveal the real story and to resolve the main character's emotional turmoil. The subplot lying deep beneath the other stories what a brilliant analogy by Besson is summed up in only a few scenes the opening sequences that reveals Jacques love and fear of the sea his admittedly bizarre relationship with dolphins as his family the myth about the mermaids the release of the female dolphin from captivity and finally the end where he fulfills the myth by proving that his love for the deep sea is pure and sincere so that she takes him away forever to paraphrase the myth. It was this final image that haunted me for days and drove me to write this review. I agree with many people that the movie was quite long and had unrelated scenes but so what. Besson's directing is great. The first appearance of the young Enzo the first appearance of the older Jacques Enzo's car and flamboyance the tide of water flowing downward from the ceiling and the very last scene all these bold images were fantastic. By the time the movie is complete all that weight from above is focused down to that one instant when Jacques releases the lifeline. Luc Besson clearly demonstrated the art in film. It's a great flick that's really all there is to it.".

It made me calmer more thoughtful and more critical of materialism. In France the film was such a phenomenon that a whole generation of youth who saw it was renamed The Big Blue Generation. These people became more laid back and balanced in life like it was an emotional revolution. Something that was quite the contrary of angry youths rioting on the streets in the 60s.Jacques Mayol and Enzo Molinari are both worldclass freedivers and lovers of the big blue sea. Everything they do revolves around it they live in it they dream with it every single day. They are like sea creatures only without gills. They both grew up in the same Greek island but lost contact of each other after the tragic death of Jacques's father. Now they are reunited in Taormina Sicily to compete in the World Championships of free diving and really challenge one another. Their circles are subtly breached and stirred up by the arrival and intrusion of an American woman blindly in love with Jacques.Luc Besson's masterpiece is both breathtaking and thoughtprovoking. What's more it really inspireds in its own nonintentional way conservationism by depicting nature's wonders as they are beautifully and lachrymosely unique tranquilizing and therapeutic. Had everybody seen this movie there would be no wars but content and creative people aspiring to make this planet more cozy and livable. Or at least that is what I'd like to think.".

Even more frustrating is Jacque's unresponsive relationship to Joanna which starts out sweet but eventually becomes a question of what is Joanna going to do with this guy?The photography is beautiful and really something to see and something to learn if you don't particularly know much about the sport or how it operates. Plus the European scenery is gorgeous. But above anything else this is a fine display of the great charm that Reno adds to all of his characters. It's a lot of fun to watch.

You've got this really annoying broad from NYC who ends up meeting this diver dude. He's pretty hot so of course all of a sudden she's madly in love. Are you kidding me? The guy obviously has an IQ of about 50 but the dumb broad is madly in love. She's obviously and idiot and the diver can barely put a sentence together in any language so it's obvious he's a moron. So she goes back to the city and obsesses about this dude she barely even spoke to so much that she defrauds her boss who seems like a good enough dude to go see him in Italy. So she ends up losing her job and even opens herself to criminal fraud charges just to see this hot Italian guy cause she's horny. Right. Then the main diver dude and his retarded friend compete in diving and this simple scene that should last about 15 minutes goes on and on for most of the rest of the movie and the dumb broad falls deeper and deeper in love with the guy even though he's a complete moron who bangs her and then refuses to talk to her as much as is possible. So of course you know either him or his friend are going to die diving. His friend goes down too far comes up wakes up enough to beg his friend to take him back down instead of have the doctors standing right by try to save him. Completely retarded. Then of course the bch gets knocked up and he feels the need to commit suicide instead of deal with his pregnant woman. Which is of course not AT ALL selfish or anything. What a great guy. But the woman helps him do it anyways because they're both really stupid people. One can only hope she aborts the baby because people this stupid shouldn't even be allowed to have kids. So this is a stupid and pointless movie and I fail to comprehend how anyone could possibly like this piece of crap. The characters are so stupid and pathetic you really just wish a big missile will hit Sicily and wipe them all out. That's the stuff dreams are made of.".

And worse they endanger the lives of the rest of the dive team. There's a scene where the divers are drinking alcohol before doing deep sea work. Its not funny.

This is the best part  when Enzo fails in his dive attempt and is pulled out of the water  the moron scientist pushes away the rest of the crew including the medics who are trying to render first aid to Enzo.

Leonard and Olivia were so beautiful that Shakespeare became trendy again and I don't mean any disrespect by it I'm simply stating a fact. The real stunning dusty locations the costumes the faces the music made the whole thing a totally new Shakespearen experience. Remember than the biggest screen adaptation of this play had been with the forty something Leslie Howard and Norma Shearer in those roles. Here everything reeked of youth underlining the tragedy in the most cinematic way. Another important point is to confirm that in 2007 the film still feels young and fresh. Recommended".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Romeo and Juliet at the Odeon Leicester Square the day after the Royal Premier and from that day I was hooked on this film. I went back three times with different sets of friends just to watch it again and each time I enjoyed it more. Now owning it on DVD when I want to just feel good about films I watch it!So much has already been written about the youth of the two young unknown stars and the chemistry that they had on screen that I don't need to repeat it now. However the key to this film's great success was that it was visually stunning Zefferelli is the master of using colour setting and costume to great effect. He was so clever in his casting not just with the very handsome young Leonard Whiting who at the time when I was only 18 myself I thought was gorgeous but also the innocence of an immature Hussey was perfect. A master stroke was Milo O'Shea as Friar Lawrence never ever has there been a better role for this talented by rarely seen Irish actor.It's pointless complaining that the text is cut by leaving out Romeo killing Paris and also the apothecary selling Romeo the poison in no way detracts from the overall imagery and beauty of Shakespeare's text. To have made the film using the whole text would have been too difficult and perhaps Zefferelli did want to portray Romeo as a little nicer than he actually was. In truth he was a fickle young man as all teenage boys can be and also prone to an amount of passionate violence so prevalent in adolescence. But this was Italy in Tudor times when life was cheap and the willingness to reach for the sword was as it should be.Shakespeare understood human nature better than anyone and that's why all his plays show so much insight into the human spirit.Zefferelli balanced the film perfectly nothing was overdone. He combined the tragedy with the humour as well as the love story by casting the right actor for each role and even if some of them faded into oblivium later for this film they were all perfect. I never want to see another version. Baz Luhrmann's pales in comparison and thats not a bad film.Come the Oscars I waited with baited breath having convinced myself that it would get best film  I was so disappointed!. It did collect Best Costume and I think Best Cinematography but what a travesty especially when the film that did win that year was not even in the same league and is hardly ever remembered. It's always very difficult to succeed with Shakespeare on the big screen but this version of Romeo and Juliet had it all. Only Kenneth Brannagh's mammoth production of the uncut version of Hamlet comes anywhere near this wonderful film.How Nino Roto's soundtrack also missed out on an Oscar I will never understand. Footnote Luciano Pavarotti has recorded the main love theme and it's called Ai giochi addio  it is so beautiful it will make you cry as you remember the film.".

Although he trims the dialog heavily in places Romeo says But soft what light through yonder window breaks? and leaves it at that his version captures all the passion of Shakespeare's play magnificently.The scenes at the Capulet's ball at which the two young lovers meet are about the greatest I've ever seen on screen. The famous balcony scene avoids cliches altogether and makes others pale by comparison. The Queen Mab speech the fight and the scene in the tomb are all exquisite highlights of this film. Even the dubbing for the Italian actor's voices and of the crowd noise is superior. It is amazing to me that an Italian could be so sensitively in tune with one of the English language's most sublime works.Zeffirelli wanted to make a movie that spoke to youth and he succeeded to put it very mildly. If school systems were smart they'd pack up their freshmen and sophomores on buses every year drive them to a local theatre and show them this movie. I can't think of a better investment in young people's education that could be made. It worked for me.".

	schema:headline " A masterpiece a very special and emotionally powerful movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Words cannot express how much I love Romeo and Juliet. This is my favorite movie my one and only cult movie and by far the most beautiful I've ever seen. I wish I had already been born in 1968 to be able to see it in a theater! I happened to watch it on TV for the first time in 1986 as a little girl and I just thought that Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey were the most gorgeous people and the bestmatched couple ever. Then I saw it a second time about ten years later and was so impressed by it that I found it hard to sleep that night and quickly became obsessed with it. It overwhelmed me in indescribable ways and still does so today. In fact whenever I watch this movie it haunts me for weeks and never fails to make me feel like crying in the end. It's a bit weird really. I can't get enough of it yet I don't want to watch it too often because it moves me so deeply... There's definitely something about it that makes it very special. As a matter of fact it's the only movie that brings me joy and sadness at the same time. Firstly this is the definitive version of Shakespeare's play. Forget Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard this is the real stuff this is how it was meant to be bursting with life and passion! Everything seems perfect in it the sets the colors and the lavish costumes the music there's so much to say about Nino Rota's exceptional score alone! and the cast of course not only do we have incredibly realistic and topnotch performances by the two lead actors but the rest of the cast including Michael York Milo O'Shea and John McEnery is also very good. The extraordinary thing about Leonard and Olivia is that they looked just the way one would imagine Romeo and Juliet pure sweet and innocent. Whenever I hear talking about Romeo and Juliet I can't help thinking about them both. Another extraordinary thing is that Zeffirelli had another actress in mind with blonde hair! before he finally chose Olivia after a second test. Neither Olivia nor Leonard were experienced actors yet they delivered stunning performances. They didn't know each other before filming but it turned out they had wonderful chemistry onscreen and definitely set the standard as the perfect Romeo and Juliet. I was not surprised to learn that Leonard fell in love with his costar during the shooting of the movie. I mean who could blame him? Nino Rota was a very talented film music composer but he had never written such a beautiful score beforehand. He was extraordinarily inspired when he wrote this one. Considering all these elements I think this movie is nothing short of a miracle. Granted it's an old movie. You can see it was shot in 1968. So what? This doesn't prevent it from being very emotionally powerful. I don't think Zeffirelli could have given a more romantic and poignant rendition of this mythical love story. He filmed the two leading actors with grace and sensitivity and love has never been better indeed. Besides I think he perfectly captured the quintessence of the play. What else can I say? I love this movie with all my heart. To me it's a jewel a work of art. And it has its own universe... it's just mesmerizing.".

Until this time RJ had been played by much older actors since it was assumed they could understand Shakespeare's language. In 1968 Franco Z. gives us actors the actual age of Shakespeare's lead characters and they can act. Add to that stunning sets costumes and music the result is a moving artistic creation. The performances are superb my personal favorites being Michael York's Tybalt and Milo O'Shea's the Friar. The language can be difficult and the action plotting but one has to have patience when devoting attention to Shakespeare's plays acted or read. Enjoy!".

	schema:headline " Stunning portrayal of Shakespeare's romantic tale of woe";
	schema:reviewBody "If you're a fan of the Bard's timeless tale of forbidden young love and even if you're not then you're in for a treat. Franco Zefferelli's spectacular cinematic version of Romeo and Juliet eclipses all others. Don't even bother with Leonardo DiCaprio or any of the other renditions that pale by comparison. This is the real Romeo and Juliet as Shakespeare himself lived he in our erawould have orchestrated its filming.From the opening scenes at Capulet's ball you'll be transported from this time and place to Renaissance Verona. It's a real period piece and worth watching for the sets and costumes alone. Stunning cinematography with sweeping colorful panoramas...the period ball the dueling and crowd scenes the morbid tomb...The young actors Leonard Whiting at 17 and Olivia Hussey at 15 are the age Shakespeare intended and magnificently portray the star crossed lovers with very believable chemistry. Olivia's Juliet has the right mix of youthful innocence and passionate intensity. With her masses of long black tresses no wonder Romeo declares she doth teach the torches to burn bright. The balcony scene brilliantly filmed rings true and the wedding night actually morning after is touchingly and tastefully done even with its hint of nudity for the teenage stars.The movie has a superb supporting cast including John McEnry as Romeo's hot tempered and humorous friend Mercutio and Michael York as Juliet's rather despicable cousin Tybalt. Personally I find Mercutio's death the most moving in all Shakespeare. Although the feuding Montague and Capulet parents are supposed to be the villains of the piece Lord Capulet actually seems quite sympathetic in his moving portrayal of grief in the loss of his daughter.No spoiler warning here. This quintessential tale of doomed love is familiar to everyone. However these stars give such compelling performances that you'll be longing for a different ending riveted to your seat praying the messages will get through properly this time. Whiting and Hussey deliver such grief and passion in the final tomb scene you'll experience this tragedy as never before. Apart from omitting Romeo's killing of Paris my sole complaint the movie is true to the major events of the play. And it's hard to fault the dialogue. Despite occasional omissions and minor alterations it was written by the English language's foremost expert. My son normally an enthusiast of Shakespeare's tragedies claims with some justification that this particular play is a silly unbelievable tale though told with absolute brilliance. Even if you're not normally a Shakespeare buff don't miss this amazing movie. Seeing his timeless tale of woe brought to life so compellingly and in such a magnificent manner might just turn you into one.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is as near perfection as I can conceive a film coming. Though I have limited toleration of reseeing films I have seen this one about a dozen times. I am still in awe of its beauty and invariably streaming with tears at its ending.If aspiring to make a stupendous film about love it does of course help to choose a story standing so high above others of its kind that it has become a byword for romance. As one should be able to but cannot take for granted with a dialogue already supplied by the greatest playwright ever it has been only occasionally and gently edited for vocabulary. Zeffirelli made however some very judicious cuts to bring his film down to a suitable length. Gone therefore are most of Romeo's professions of love for Rosaline his duel with Paris and the little detective story near the end whereby the love story is finally explained to all. At the risk of sounding presumptuous I would say Zeffirelli improved Shakespeare's story with the removal of these distractions.I found every single actor wellcast and brilliant the nurse possibly the best. The only fault I found was that Friar Lawrence's incongruous Irish accent grated a little. The lovers were suitably beautiful which again one might hope one could take for granted with such a topic but cannot. It is extraordinary that Zeffirelli was the first film director to have the sense to cast teenagers in the leading roles as Shakespeare obviously intended. Both story and dialogue are otherwise patently absurd. Not only Romeo and Juliet but also their companions impart perfectly the innocence passion swagger spontaneity charm and eros of Renaissance youth.The mild but exquisite eroticism of the bedroom scene was essential there can be no moment when beautiful nudity is more strongly called for than in the sole such scene of a film celebrating young physicallyinspired love. I only wish Zeffirelli could have gone further despite our puritanical society. It is a particular shame as he had the sense and good taste to pay homage to the beauty of both sexes.The periodperfect Italian settings and ravishing costumes are so authentic and beautiful that many of the scenes look exactly like Renaissance paintings in other words some of the most beautiful images ever made. For me however the crme de la crme is the one of these visual feasts where we are simultaneously treated to a youth's singing of the superbly apt theme song What is a Youth? itself the most beautiful song I know of.Edmund Marlowe author of Alexander's Choice a modern tragedy of forbidden love www.amazon.comdp1481222112".

I am still in awe of its beauty and invariably streaming with tears at its ending.If aspiring to make a stupendous film about love it does of course help to choose a story standing so high above others of its kind that it has become a byword for romance. As one should be able to but cannot take for granted with a dialogue already supplied by the greatest playwright ever it has been only occasionally and gently edited for vocabulary. Zeffirelli made however some very judicious cuts to bring his film down to a suitable length. Gone therefore are most of Romeo's professions of love for Rosaline his duel with Paris and the little detective story near the end whereby the love story is finally explained to all. At the risk of sounding presumptuous I would say Zeffirelli improved Shakespeare's story with the removal of these distractions.I found every single actor wellcast and brilliant the nurse possibly the best. The only fault I found was that Friar Lawrence's incongruous Irish accent grated a little. The lovers were suitably beautiful which again one might hope one could take for granted with such a topic but cannot. It is extraordinary that Zeffirelli was the first film director to have the sense to cast teenagers in the leading roles as Shakespeare obviously intended. Both story and dialogue are otherwise patently absurd. Not only Romeo and Juliet but also their companions impart perfectly the innocence passion swagger spontaneity charm and eros of Renaissance youth.The mild but exquisite eroticism of the bedroom scene was essential there can be no moment when beautiful nudity is more strongly called for than in the sole such scene of a film celebrating young physicallyinspired love. I only wish Zeffirelli could have gone further despite our puritanical society. It is a particular shame as he had the sense and good taste to pay homage to the beauty of both sexes.The periodperfect Italian settings and ravishing costumes are so authentic and beautiful that many of the scenes look exactly like Renaissance paintings in other words some of the most beautiful images ever made. For me however the crme de la crme is the one of these visual feasts where we are simultaneously treated to a youth's singing of the superbly apt theme song What is a Youth? itself the most beautiful song I know of.Edmund Marlowe author of Alexander's Choice a modern tragedy of forbidden love www.amazon.comdp1481222112";

Filmed in Italy and actually using teenage actors to play the starcrossed lovers at the right age for the first time ever brought great veracity and a definite freshness to this story. The performances were uniformly outstanding and of course Nino Rota's touching sound score wove the whole thing together in a highly charged emotional work. It tends to take the viewer through the uncomfortable feeling of viewing a tragedy in the making knowing what is to come and being unable to do anything but helplessly watch as it comes to pass. This is the film maker's art at its best and it is a pity that the film did not win the Best Picture Academy Award in its year.

We see 2 beautiful peopleWhiting and Husseylooking like Romeo and Juliet themselves as their creator put them. I also doff my hat for Michael York he was absolutely brilliant as Tybalt and I must say that my liking for York has gone up several notches with this movie. Bruce Robinson was also pretty good as Benvolio. Mercutio had energy wit and a rough common sense and John McEnery projects them all. There may be several differences between the movie and Shakespeare's play but it doesn't take anything away from the acting and the movie in general. So I give it a 10 out of 10.

Others provide far more detailed reviews but this has always held special meaning for me so I finally decided to weigh in with some comments.I saw this when it was originally released in the US while I was a high school aged teen. It is difficult to describe the depth of its impact on me mostly because it was such a perfect film. Zeffirelli's genius abounds in so many different ways but aside from the genius of the film script involving more than just him by far the primary thing that separates it from the long list of other attempts to film this story was the casting of two actors in their earlytomid teens the proper age for the two protagonists instead of using twenty or in some film variants thirty year old actors in those roles as had been done in so many previous efforts. Having actors in other films who were sometimes twice the appropriate age for those roles attempting to pull off those performances simply never rang true.Second only to the casting was the absolutely perfect tone of the entire film. Filmed in Verona where the play was obviously set plus the cinematography and then the unbelievably perfect score all facilitated its translation from its original stagebased home to what is a true film masterpiece.It is the actors' appropriately youthful innocence and that perfect tone that make this depiction of the tragedy stand out from other efforts. It is also what makes it so rewatchable. You can't help falling in love with them again in each viewing as you watch them so innocently fall in love with each other. And when that seminal moment plays out against the backdrop of the soulful rendition of What is Youth the hook is set and despite the inevitable train wreck that is coming it's just impossible to walk away because you are yet again simply too invested in these two teens' tragic journey.To be fair about the age comment I should say that I'm not blind to other film interpretations which have utilized ageappropriate actors e.g. Luhrmann's take on RJ. But the varied attempts like his to take the play and place it in some bizarrely modern setting have never really worked for me. It just feels awkward like a square peg in a round hole. The only time that I have been comfortable with some RJ inspired story is when someone simply takes the basic theme and retools it entirely e.g. the classic and equally tragic West Side Story being a perfect example.In short this is simply one of the most moving and beautiful films that you could ever hope to see regardless of whether you are or are not into Shakespearean classics. And it would be difficult to imagine anyone ever doing a better job of translating this play into film. For insight into Zeffirelli's scripting choices I would highly recommend reading film222's IMDb review. See httpwww.imdb.comuserur5222822.".

The theme song still stands as one of my favorite pieces of music  I will stop and listen when it so infrequently comes on the radio.

He packs in a great performance looks awesome fights dances cries laughs and even kisses yes the infamous kiss! all the way. Just watch this for him. Ash looks fabulous and puts in a great performance as well. The songs are a let down except for the title number Dhoom machale. The story is good however the ending is a letdown as compared with the first part. Don't listen to your pals who tell you that this is copied from numerous Hollywood movies. It's just that the intellectuals are jealous because Bollywood has finally managed to look as good as Hollywood!".

The plot was good.... A lot different than the first....Now for what i didn't like in the movie Bipasha as a double role was not needed in it at all and nor was the girl who played Abhishek's wife... These were just waste..... And the story didn't carry so much weight like the first one.... But it's acceptable because most sequels aren't good enough....Overall it was a good movie.... I enjoyed every moment of it.... The outfits gadgets music dances and locations were great... And i also liked the way it surprised me to some extent....Some parts of the movie weren't acceptable to the family crowds but i guess that's completely okay compared to a lot of movies.... First of all this movie is not meant for kids due to it's violence and women in scanty clothing... Which goes for Dhoom 1 as well..... anyway am sure a lot people enjoyed it..... so i give it an 810.....".

Not just in terms of the clothes women wear but also in terms of the script..if there is any! It's obvious that Mr Ghandvi lost focus with all the star cast glamour and money to splurge on the look. No doubt that the look was Super cool or flashy locales breath taking but if that is all that you are looking for then Dhoom 2 is for you! I don't expect movies..especially Hindi movies to cater to some High IQ needs of some viewers..I for one completely switch off my brain during the movie..but even by that standards there are some scenes that are too much to handle!! Especially the so called Chemistry scenes between ASH and Hrithik..oh god save me!!! Now on to my take on the stars of the movie Hrithik  was Simply Amazing. I am not a big Hrithik fan have never been but if there is any reason to watch this movie it is Mr A! Roshan as A acts well does some amazing stunts dances beautifully now that is nothing new! and looks absolutely FAB!!! the movie belongs to him..ASH as sunehri  the less said the better..I may be a bit biased here for I am no fan of her's ..but seriously ASH is good as long as her mouth is shut or she is not trying to act or over act! seriously she is the most beautiful woman in the world ..but can someone teach her acting??? She looks good even if they may have made her a bit extra tanned!!Bipasha  well she was definitely a treat for the men ..but thats just abt it..not that you expect anything more from her..uday  he is the 'funny guy' in the movie..he is funny even when he does a serious role in some other movies! so ..well...ABBY BABY  now thats one man i went to watch the movie forbut i was disappointed..he looks so tired and disinterested through out the movie..obviously he couldn't resolve his wt problems and being biased towards him its becuz of his preparation for guru..but his character was the least developed and all attention was given to hrithik!! but don't worry abby baby you have guru waiting! having said that ..he was good in two of the scenes he meets hrithik! Overall verdict  if you are easy going tolerant and generally not bothered have time or a big fan of hrithik i guess this movie will appeal to you. Else dont worry you are not missing muchDhoom 1 or Dhoom 2  my choice Dhoom 1".

And Rai fails to impress in this regard. Her teen 'hep' character is contrived and shallow. Especially as the 'gritty' American girl who challenges her dude to a basket ball game. Most of Dhoom 2 is like that... a collage of borrowed concepts and montages which can be easily traced to their origins giving a feeling of being cheated.

Dhoom Again performed by easily the best dancer in the world masterfully choreographed by stage whiz shiamak davar. The film already had its plus points.However as the movie meandered on its course the movie became more about gloss and less about substance.Each character  except Abishek who apparently was left in the dark ages  have worked on their looks and appearance for their repsective roles but did any of the brains trust at YashRaj expect the attractive to not just look the part but portray it as well?The plot and screenplay was as skimpy as the clothing the female leads had to wear. Each and every sequence was copied from their superior Hollywood counterparts and at many a times these looked like a lesser version of the original. At times the stunts were overly done.Plusses  With the regular costume designers given a welldeserved break from designing actual clothes the actresses were forced to wear little if anything at all.... well for some of us that is a plus! Hritik Roshan and his dancing skills is this guy for real?  The brilliant locales Rio Durban Namibia  Some good music though some have been plagiarised from mideast singers  Bipasha and Aishwarya HOT!

Abhisek BAchchan his angry young dude role is somewhat lame and he looked like the odd one out. He needed a makeover which the rest of the cast clearly had.  Forcing Abhisek to dance in the same movie or song as Hritik is like having a danceoff between a rank leftfooted newcomer and an champion dancer. He looks laughable.Regardless of my rants and raves D2 will continue to dominate the boxoffice while more superior oldfashioned films Babul with actual substance will find their vying for appreciation an uphill battle.".

It is what is called as the perfect timepass paisa vasool film.What Dhoom2 lacks in terms of a coherent plot and neatly crafted screenplay it more than compensates for through a clever and consistent sprinkling of aweinspiring stunts energetically choreographed dance routines pictureperfect scene compositions and oodles of eye candy.Dhoom2 like its predecessor is the quintessential cop and robber tale where there's neither the place nor the need for logic. The film opens with a breathtaking visual of a lone train running through a vast Namibian desert. Though the execution of this robbery is disappointing it almost seems that the writer and director felt that once they had a great setting their task was done it sets the stage for what would unfold over the next 2 hours. From then on we are drawn into a highoctane cat and mouse game so what if the robber always has the upper hand...right till the end?. The action explodes with such energy that one doesn't get the time to think about the loopholes in the plot.Yes after the movie is over you wonder if the film would have been much better had the writer made it into a mind game between the adversaries  a kind of intelligent oneupmanship. But as long as you're in the theatre you're hooked on! You don't regret that the cop  who insists that such games are won by the mind and not the bullet  has virtually no plan except planting a mole. You don't mind that the mole  seemingly a consummate crook herself  doesn't show any skill except loads of sexual energy. And you certainly don't mind that Mr. Perfect Thief gets away unscathed every single time thanks to  if I may use the word  a DUMB cop who appears dumber than his bumbling sidekick. All this because of the charismatic screen presence of Hrithik Roshan.It wouldn't be wrong to say that Dhoom2 belongs to Hrithik Roshan Mr. A Aryan. Mind you that's not a tribute to his acting talent. He is at best an aboveaverage actor but when it comes to screen presence no one among the current crop of actors can come even closer to him. And boy what a dancer! His dance movements are more unbelievable and aweinspiring than the cablesupported SFXcreated action sequences. It is absolutely clear that Dhoom2 was designed to be his showcase. How else would you explain the terribly underwritten character of the cop or the fact that Hrithik is on the screen in 90 of the scenes?And then there's Ash Sunehri. Could anyone believe that her 'plastic beauty' persona could actually set the screen afire? What has she done to her body! What a metamorphosis!! Ash's Sunehri is HOT. She and Hrithik come across as the most perfect screen pairing in recent memory. But hey what was all that hullabaloo about their liplock? On the acting front Ash is adequate. All she is required to do is to look hot and be a perfect foil to Hrithik. She does precisely that with great lan. It's sad that Abhishek Jai Dixit got saddled with a hastily written role. It's unpardonable that the character of Jai Dixit the main connecting link between the sequels  is so onedimensional. Numerous reviews have lambasted Abhishek's acting in Dhoom2 but the blame here lies with the producerdirectorwriter. They seem so hell bent on making this a showcase for Hrithik that they've given almost a stepmotherly treatment to Abhishek's character. On his part Abhishek honestly portrays what he's been asked to do.Uday Chopra Ali should find solace in the fact that his father and brother are the most successful producers in India and they will continue to find roles for him in their films. He has no acting talent whatsoever. Hats off to Aditya Chopra for using the clever ploy of giving Ali's character dozens of oneliners that manage to draw a few laughs from the audience and divert them from Uday Chopra's unbelievable yet unquestionable lack of acting skills.Should I get deeper into the negatives? For one The music is very disappointing  had it not been for the Shaimak Davar's and Vaibhavi Merchant's choreography or Hrithik's and Ash's fluid dance movements the songs would have been unbearable to watch on screen. Also despite a larger canvas and more style it doesn't cover any new ground compared to Dhoom....nah I wouldn't get into all this. If one were to start the list of negatives for Dhoom2 might be quite long but why dwell on that? I found the film very entertaining and that's all that mattered to me while watching the film.".

The movie sure did showcase Hrithik's ability to take risks and do some adventurous stuff quo dos to that and a super duper physique that girls would swoon for.Rest of the starcast seems to be a wasted lot. Abhishek and Ash's real life comedy seems to be showing on screen as well. Who cares what happens to them. We want some life in the character that an actor is trying to portraynot attitude show off.And thanks to Bipasha Basu we learnt to do some aerobics. We shall try it out in a Beach when we go there!!!!!!!!Dhoom2 is definitely for those people who rave and rant about looks physique and short dress. Thank you very much but there are still some human beings who care for a movie that's makes the movie a star and not a movie where the stars can control the story. It seems like a desperate attempt to match the rest of the guys character to that of Hrithik's stunts. But nothing to beat Ash's premovie self publicity indulgence of having done dare devil stunts!!! What hogwash!!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Dhoom 2 is a mindless popcorn flick that asks for your brain at the door and hands it back 3 hours later when you leave hoping you had a good time in between. I was amused more than once and I can appreciate several things in the film. But in the end the hard reality and number one rule of good film making is and always will be and that really needs to sink in more in Bollywood A GOOD FILM STARTS WITH A GOOD SCRIPT EVEN IF ITS ONLY AIM IS CAREFREE ENTERTAINMENT FOR 3 HOURS. Dhoom 2's script is simply very half baked full of plot holes so big the usual disclaimers for fantasy action fare are stretched too thin here and it becomes annoying. What should be a gripping tale of the psychology of cop and robber sprinkled with sleek action and display of technology in the film and making the film degrades into standard formula fare with unnecessary songs forced comic routines abrupt and unmotivated sight seeing orgies and replacement of a main character. Let's ignore the heavy inspiration from many Hollywood films. That's not the main problem. The interference of the Bollywood formula and weak script is. Not all is bad though some parts are well done and in a better film would fit in very nicely. The Russian roulette scene is the emotional core of the film and delivers ending included bravo for going against the formula here. The statue scene is cool as well unrealistic but in a way one can smilingly accept l'art pour l'art. The Queen act at the beginning unexpected hilarious the action afterwards less so. And this of course brings us to the main asset of the film this Indian A list actor and I mean international A list as far as potential is concerned whose publicly announced goal is to lift commercial Hindi cinema to an international quality level so it can cross over stuck in another local B grade effort by international standards limiting his impact The one and only HRITHIK ROSHAN. He carries the film from start to finish and it hurts to see him work his ass off and exude more charisma with one finger than the whole cast of most films do with all they got just to be let down by shoddy scripting and stylistic choices that might impress in some quarters but definitely not at others where international product is well known and fighting it out for market share with Hollywood. The rest of the cast is OK. Aishwarya and Hrithik are eye candy of the highest caliber. Abhishek Uday and the rest have not really got roles though. 2 of the songs should be cut right away. 3 others are good. Film is well shot stunts are OK although highly unrealistic most of the time and the fact many of them are really done by Hrithik himself is not obvious enough. He trains for 3 months and it's over in 3 seconds. Hm. See it if you like Ash and Hrithik do not expect much and you will likely be impressed by some of it. 4 points for the film and 2 extra for Mr. Roshan. By the way Hrithik is NOT playing his first villain in this film as claimed in the promotions. He's not anymore a villain than Robin Hood. He's the hero of the film which you cheer on and want to succeed. If Robin Hood is a villain then Hrithik was a villain before in Fiza and Mission Kashmir.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to the theater yesterday with a almost no expectations from this movie as I had hated its predecessor Dhoom. But it succeeded in confounding my expectations. This movie was worse than I expected. I felt awkward even sitting there and watching that drivel from the first scene to the last. The story is outlined this way. Hrithik Roshan is the meticulous and extremely successful Mr.A who pulls off the most impossible robberies. He jumps of trains manages to have his own against the most well prepared security forces with gravity defying stunts and kicks not to forget the disguises. He is disguised as the queen to rob the queen's jewels. He steals the world's most priceless artefacts not to sell them. Now enter Jai Dixit and his half idiotic low IQ friend Ali Abhishek and Uday. Their first scene where they capture a bunch of nitwit criminals is as unbelievable as it can get. He is joined by college buddy Shonali Bipasha in the hunt for Mr.A. They are always given the slip by the wily Mr.A who continues to rob the priceless items with his brains and gizmos par excellence how he funds these gizmos god knows. Mr.A later meets his soul mate during a robbery where Suneheri Aishwarya uses The A name to rob a castle of a priceless sword. Suneheri and Mr.A form a deadly alliance and give the police a slip all the way. The story loses whatever little sanity it possessed at this point and begins to meander way off course. This movie would have been slightly better with a fewer songs and some believable action scenes. It also desperately needs Direction and a script. Everyone except Hrithik sleepwalk through the movie. Aishwarya especially proves once again that she is more a glam doll than a serious actor. Abhishek Bachchan sleepwalks through the film and his Cooldude Shelock Holmesesquire demeanour begins to irritate. Uday Chopra tries his hand at comedy but comes up with lame ones most of the time. Bipasha Basu...Why was she there in the movie..?? Makes you wonder. Hrithik saves the day for Dhoom doing some justice to his role. Coming to the technicals. Direction is not of very high quality. The Director Gadhvi has focused more on bikinis and skimpy clothes rather than trying to make a slick taught thriller. The dialogues are forced and have no impact whatsoever. The story could have been told much better with the actual presence of a SCRIPT. Pritam seems to be directing the same type of music. The music scores nothing. The cinematography shines like a diamond in all this muck but could have gone easy on the slow motion. Half the scenes seem to be in slow motion.After all this I can only say. If your spouse is nagging you really bad on a beautiful weekend and all you need is to sleep. Then you might consider watching this film.".

It has used some cool script and costume ideas from Bourne Identity Lara craft The Saint Val Kilmer and two more movies I can't recall but all in a good stylish Indian flavour.The story is packed with so many Punches both in stunts and in suspense that U won't get even a min for stretch etc..even songs are lovely too..You would need to adjust yourself to the pace and style of the movie right from beginning.. within minutesmay be secs of its start..n many would whistle its catchy theme tone on way out..Hrithik and Aishwarya..Bollywood's God and Goddess have appeared together in a Movie First ever time.. and Aishwarya has given a Good Lip Kiss won't call it a smooch first time ever..Aishwarya has never looked so sexier before.. and I thought the gals in FnFTokyo Drift were so sexy..even tho she sizzles all DA time and melts the screen many times... many would agree with me that in DA movie this Nymph and celestial beauty was beaten first time in personality by Bollywood's only DEMIGOD a Rock Personality with the Face of an AngelEyes of an Elf Prince and Physique of Achillies..HRITHIK..It could be the Script Aish eyeing Hrithik or Cameraman's focus on Hrithik's face N personality..Or Aish admiring Hrithik's eyes..and convincingly succumbing to his magnanimous persona which would be difficult to believe with any other actor..This onemanarmy is Bollywood's onestop answer to Tom Cruise Brad Pitt and the likes of James Bond..or rather Shows a BIG ? to Hollywood.. HAVE YOU GOT AN ANSWER TO THIS MAN? Bipasa does her part well.. her acting n figure has improved a lot.. Uday did his part well too.... and sorry for all Abhishek's Fan of his looks his acting was good in this movie..but in terms of fast  furious looks..he was the only 1 who didn't fit there..ignorable bearded druggie looking dude...has anyone noticed that he slouches all DA time.. his neck wanna fell down to floor has a Lil double chin and has dark circles around his swollen eyes.. look at him carefully in DA movie...and u would notice all that..".

It has used some cool script and costume ideas from Bourne Identity Lara craft The Saint Val Kilmer and two more movies I can't recall but all in a good stylish Indian flavour.The story is packed with so many Punches both in stunts and in suspense that U won't get even a min for stretch etc..even songs are lovely too..You would need to adjust yourself to the pace and style of the movie right from beginning.. within minutesmay be secs of its start..n many would whistle its catchy theme tone on way out..Hrithik and Aishwarya..Bollywood's God and Goddess have appeared together in a Movie First ever time.. and Aishwarya has given a Good Lip Kiss won't call it a smooch first time ever..Aishwarya has never looked so sexier before.. and I thought the gals in FnFTokyo Drift were so sexy..even tho she sizzles all DA time and melts the screen many times... many would agree with me that in DA movie this Nymph and celestial beauty was beaten first time in personality by Bollywood's only DEMIGOD a Rock Personality with the Face of an AngelEyes of an Elf Prince and Physique of Achillies..HRITHIK..It could be the Script Aish eyeing Hrithik or Cameraman's focus on Hrithik's face N personality..Or Aish admiring Hrithik's eyes..and convincingly succumbing to his magnanimous persona which would be difficult to believe with any other actor..This onemanarmy is Bollywood's onestop answer to Tom Cruise Brad Pitt and the likes of James Bond..or rather Shows a BIG ? to Hollywood.. HAVE YOU GOT AN ANSWER TO THIS MAN? Bipasa does her part well.. her acting n figure has improved a lot.. Uday did his part well too.... and sorry for all Abhishek's Fan of his looks his acting was good in this movie..but in terms of fast  furious looks..he was the only 1 who didn't fit there..ignorable bearded druggie looking dude...has anyone noticed that he slouches all DA time.. his neck wanna fell down to floor has a Lil double chin and has dark circles around his swollen eyes.. look at him carefully in DA movie...and u would notice all that..";

It has poor cinematography poor music poor actions sequences too much over acting over editing poor choreography poor choice of costumes average special effects and horrible story line that has been adopted from 10 or more Hollywood movies. It might be entertaining for some but the movie is set in present day. How come abishek doesnot wear a uniform for being a cop? How come he knows almost every about Mr. A and other look so stupid. The Comedy scenes are rediculuosly filled with over acting and some dumb background music. There were at least 80  88 unnecessary scenes in this movie. There were too many things too unreal if you are gonna make a movie like dhoom do it realistically we r not in the 90 or 80s any more we are in 2006 people. If Some one handed me 90 crores to make this movie i would have done a hell lot better. Why are there many remixes in the soundtrack to dhoom? Overall im a movie lover but not for these kind of movies. Dhoom 2 is a big disappointment. Come on bollywood why are you adapting so many stories and plots from Hollywood what happened to you creativity? Where are the great awesome movies? Be original n Be real!".

The queen has the most brattish kids running around  do they not know what royal kids are like? 3. The queen coincidentally has a long face and beaked nose just like the thief  what was he her long lost son or something? 4. The queen has guards that fire bullets that cannot penetrate a surfboard and are super slow  the thief can deflect them one after the other.5. The queen hires security guards that cannot shoot at a man who is hooked up to the train and being pulled behind it on a surf board.6. The thief has a supernatural surfboard that can cross over train tracks and go from side to side.7. The thief then surfboards away among sand dunes  is the surfboard motorized? we are now 5  6 minutes into the film...8. cut to a hot number with lots of hip grinding dance moves muscled thief and scantily clad babes and all...9. cut to a boat onto which a motorcycle lands and stops just like that. Had to close my eyes and sit through some annoying Uday Chopra dialogs 10. Two bad guys have guns drawn on him and they wait and they wait and they wait 11. A jet boat comes out from UNDER water flies sky high and lands on the boat and stops just like that.12. Is the boat an aircraft carrier? 13. People stand around and shoot at each other now no one even makes a pretense of ducking.14. Amidst all the shooting and standing around the phone rings and some Bangla conversation starts.This queen  heshe was the ugliest royal I have ever seen  but then of course in Dhoom 3 Mr. A will turn out to be her illegitimate son and so they had to resemble each other! I have watched a bit more to catch the most beautiful woman but no appearance yet.. In the meantime 15. Uday and Abhishek are having inane conversation while still shooting at the bad guys. Is this supposed to be humorous? 16. Abhishek is doing his best to imitate an inanimate object that can talk.17. Bipasha is hot but which respectable police officer walks with that exaggerated hip sway? looks like a model for Old Navy clothes.18. Bipasha says they know nothing about Mr. A while random maps and faces keep flashing on the screen  whose faces are these?19. Abhishek now shows that he is an intelligent inanimate object.. he has cracked the code by God! 20. Mr. A masquerades as a statue and runs the Mars Rover over the floor to a diamond he wishes to steal.21. The rover appears to be smarter than any human being in the movie.22. It can not only steal the diamond just like that but can create an illusion that the diamond is still there.. I knew that alien technology existed in Roswell.23. Then suddenly the statue is an old man  I loved to watch the Transformers and maybe Mr. Gadhvi did too! 24. The old man drops into the sewer after melting the cover with acid in his shoes.25. The young Mr. A explodes out of the sewer in an unknown location.. I always knew the sewers were full of explosive gases.26. The chase is on  Abhishek is suddenly on a chopper and shooting at Mr. A from the air.27. Mr. A ducks each and every shot  now we know why the police in India are incompetent. No one taught them how to accurately shoot a gun.28. Mr. A jumps on and off various vehicles using some LED containing device on his hands.. Roswell all over again.29. Mr. A roller blades on a narrow I mean real narrow railing and escapes.30. There is still no sign of the most beautiful woman and I have to turn the show off in frustration.Try number 3  31. The most beautiful woman comes on and speaks in valley girl speak the entire time I can bear to see this movie.32. She also addresses herself in the third person uses like in EVERY sentence ends it with funny guyyy.I bravely soldier on...A word about the Music and the acting To match My name is Ali we have Crazy Kiya Re every song is at that level including something that is going 'Yeh love to Hai fire..' with a lot of what sounds like doom doom! So the entire soundtrack seems to be a comic turn. Hritik is good OK acting nice bod  too bad he has no credible story line or plot to match his acting. Aish is so annoying I cannot believe it every sentence is like inane enough to drive one insane. Uday is annoying as hell and Abhishek is virtually inanimate. Bipasha is hot but what is she doing in the film? If you can bear to part with your brain for three hours check it in at the popcorn place and go in to see this film. If you were recently hit on the head then you might not need this. Enjoy!".

The way he has played his character one really starts to believe that Mr. A is the most prudent guy around and indeed catching him is one hard nut to crack .Abhishek and uday chopra are OK as cops and aishwarya looks beautiful and has done well in acting department. The action of the movie was the highlight and the robberies executed by Mr. A are very meticulous and crafty. Direction was extremely gripping and fast paced .Considering the fact that HRITHIK is my favourite star i would go ahead and sayMy favourite movie of all time !!!!!!and for those who criticize dhoom 2  granted the fact that the movie did receive a critical bashing but it was the BIGGEST hit of 2006 at the box office which is the highest form of acclaim and one of the biggest success's ever Indian cinema has seen.".

Unlike the first Dhoom where there was a crisp storyline supported by great stunts this one has superb stunts trying to hold together a nonexistent story.Ash is extremely annoying from her first dialog onwards. Bipasha is wasted. Abhishek doesn't have that much to do and is more supporting cast than anything else. I can't stand Uday Chopra.Hritik is the best thing in the movie. He is cool smooth and can take on action really well. However compared to John Abraham's character in the first one Hritik is a slightly kind hearted and emotional guy. I preferred Kabir's character cos he was really a bad boy. I don't know why they didn't go all the way with Hritik on that. It might have been better and Ashwairya's character could've been completely written off.All in all watch it once cos its fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to the film with many expectations more because of the trailer no plural as they made just one and less because of the first film which at the outset I may say was abysmal. To begin with the trailer of this film was fabulous. Everyone except AB Jr has lost so much weight and is so toned up that the words eye candy don't quite do justice to them. Leading from the front lead man Hritik looks like the descendant of a Greek god. Aishwarya and Bipasha look more sporty and sexy than they have ever looked in their glamorous lives Now THAT's something! hey even Uday is well toned. The stunts and the chase sequences in the trailer are really what draw in the viewers. Sadly it's all downhill from there. Synopsis Hritik plays a slick criminal who's trying to leave his mark on the world by stealing flawless priceless jewels and artifacts. He uses state of the art technology some scifi and some good disguises to achieve this end. Abhishek and Uday are cops with the Mumbai police department so is Bipasha. They're all tracking Hritik and... Apart from one twist that's it really.Review For starters 99 of the best scenes from the film are already in the trailer. I say that as there is one great scene between Hritik and Ash and I don't want to ruin that for you. Hritik has the meatiest role and the best lines and he plays it to perfection with zeal and intensity. His dance is legendary of course but his acting skills and the effort he puts behind his character are what make it worth buying a ticket. Kudos to him.Aishwarya has the second best role with conflicts both internal and external and in her first few scenes one does get the feeling that she's a better treat for the eyes than the ears! She may be the best looking woman the world has seen but sadly Ms. Rai can't act.Abhishek could have done well to tone up in company of everyone else who looks amazing. I say this because neither is his role any good apart from one or two good lines nor is his physical appearance. Abhishek I'm sure is a great actor and would have done better if his role was written any better.Bipasha is in the film only for the glamdoll effect. Her character starts off well and is built up to what one hopes will be a strong character. But suddenly midway in the film that character disappears without apology and is replaced with a twin sister whose character is nothing short of a Baywatch bimbo frolicking around uday. Bipasha was totally wasted.Uday is there coz well we all know why he's there! I'll give the guy this he plays every character exactly the same way. Yes I know that's neither here nor there much like his character in the film. His buffoonery is childish and his role even sillier. He's a loyal sidekick to Abhishek who simply dances around the screen seeking attention. Uday seems to be in a hurry to say all his dialogues. He smiles uncontrollably for no rhyme or reason and is perhaps likable for just that. His role is short and short of sweet.Now for the Technical aspects of the film I did want very much to suspend my disbelief but the director had other plans! Every time something was going right he steered the scene in the opposite direction.Let's start with the amazing visuals CGI and Wirework works best when it's not seen. The shots in the trailers manage to do that... but the additional ones in the film are laughable! Perhaps Sanjay Gadhvi doesn't realize but the audience can see with the gift of sight when he's used the green background to cheat on the visuals.For one someone needs to give Allan Amin some lessons on wirework and perhaps physics especially gravity too... you don't HAVE to use something because you can! And please don't make it so obvious!! Like the reversesomersault thing he puts into every film of his.... and his waterfallfall shot is as pathetic as the one he'd done for Rakeysh Mehra's Aks water falling faster than individual even in supposed slow motion! Basically Allan Amin needs to learn a few things about the earth and a few more about his job.The story is by Aditya Chopra who gave us marvels like DDLJ Mohabbatein etc... And this time it seems like he was sleeping on the job. How else would you explain the worthlessness of so many characters Bipasha and Uday the most Lots of other structural flaws in the skeleton thread of story weaved around a few good looking people doing stunts. Really disappointed with Adi this time...The Makeup department have done a decent job with Ash and ESPECIALLY Hritik. I say this of course given Indian movie standards... again if the audience can see through the makeup why cant the characters themselves?The music of the film is nothing shy of comical! The title track reminiscent of the first film is worth listening to but the others are just welcome toilet breaks! Songs have no purpose in a film like this and the Lyrics are like prose instead of poetry to say the least. Pritam is better than the rubbish he's come up with for this film.Overall this movie is a neat little Could've been awesome! And the numerous flaws both in characterization and in filming were the director's responsibility. Sanjay Gadhvi alas comes across as a novice.Final verdict If you want to see Hritik Aishwarya and Bipasha better than you've ever seen them DO watch this film. Otherwise Dhoom 2 is sadly a film that just fizzles out. Overall 410".

Perhaps Sanjay Gadhvi doesn't realize but the audience can see with the gift of sight when he's used the green background to cheat on the visuals.For one someone needs to give Allan Amin some lessons on wirework and perhaps physics especially gravity too... you don't HAVE to use something because you can! And please don't make it so obvious!! Like the reversesomersault thing he puts into every film of his.... and his waterfallfall shot is as pathetic as the one he'd done for Rakeysh Mehra's Aks water falling faster than individual even in supposed slow motion! Basically Allan Amin needs to learn a few things about the earth and a few more about his job.The story is by Aditya Chopra who gave us marvels like DDLJ Mohabbatein etc... And this time it seems like he was sleeping on the job. How else would you explain the worthlessness of so many characters Bipasha and Uday the most Lots of other structural flaws in the skeleton thread of story weaved around a few good looking people doing stunts. Really disappointed with Adi this time...The Makeup department have done a decent job with Ash and ESPECIALLY Hritik. I say this of course given Indian movie standards... again if the audience can see through the makeup why cant the characters themselves?The music of the film is nothing shy of comical! The title track reminiscent of the first film is worth listening to but the others are just welcome toilet breaks! Songs have no purpose in a film like this and the Lyrics are like prose instead of poetry to say the least. Pritam is better than the rubbish he's come up with for this film.Overall this movie is a neat little Could've been awesome! And the numerous flaws both in characterization and in filming were the director's responsibility. Sanjay Gadhvi alas comes across as a novice.Final verdict If you want to see Hritik Aishwarya and Bipasha better than you've ever seen them DO watch this film. Otherwise Dhoom 2 is sadly a film that just fizzles out. Overall 410";

Instead a chilled beer in your home with good music would help.Now coming to the storyline Thank God ! It had at least something to call as a story .. Aryan aka Mr.A Hritik is a world class thief .. stealing things trotting the globe. Jai Abhishek is as usual the ACP who goes after him .. Ali Uday There is nothing to talk abt him ..Just that he became a police in this one ! Aish With hot dressing aids Jai to catch A in the first half then in the process falls in love with A ! Now Bipasha .. a dual role ! Both of which are utter waste .. just for the gimmick and of course to be a part of Ali's dreams ! The way this movie has been presented thanks to the Art director because almost every scene happens in a set and they are soooo monotonous !The climax is an age old clich..where the heroine shoots his lover to save him from police and yes of course as you people guessed .. there is a After 6 months tag .. where both A and Aish are in some Fuji island taking care of a restaurant ! There comes in the directors touch .. where he brings in the ACP again who is unstoppable  As expected he too praises the love of the thief and leaves the scene for another assignment !Finally .. The only positive thing about the movie is  Hritik. He is cool as usual. Then above all .. to make our money worth  THERE IS A SMOOCH BETWEEN AISH AND HRITIK ! Believe Me !

The plot is absurd and the script bumbles along from one event to another with an array of songs that kill the continuity if any was meant in the first place.Abhishek's skills of inference and deduction never cease to amaze he figures the next location where the genius thief is going to make his attempt by a twosecond study of map patterns and by feverishly tapping a laptop key four times in quick succession but his gruff demeanor leaves him looking like he'd rather be doing something else. Make no mistake Aishwarya is awesomely irritating and left me stunned with her strange vocabulary. She peppers her lines with strange words  Sample funny guy and like which was the third word in any dialogue she spoke. Besides she persistently refers to herself only in the third person and after watching her for a bit you wonder if she was better off on the Jerry Springer show rather than the Oprah Winfrey stint she got invited to. Then there is Uday Chopra. He looks like he's walked straight out of XMen with odd bulbous biceps and acting skills equivalent of mammoth Amazon rain forest.Redemption comes in the form of Hrithik Roshan who's all toned abslatino look is the only thing that works here. He appears completely convincing doing all those gravitydefying jumping kicking skating and rappelling. But he's the lone warrior in a losing battle.The music is as it usually is these days  catchy tunes contemporary lingo and a host of electronic sounds the visuals are pleasing but overall Dhoom2 is perilously close to a neardeath experience if there is indeed such a thing.

Dhoom 2 was released and in India had opened in full houses. The movie boasted of great music great action great dance great star cast  a bigger canvas a bigger story and bigger stunts.I had also heard later that the movie is not good  except Hritik Roshan. With this mixed reviews in my head I went to see Dhoom 2 in Pathe Arena theatre. Pathe Arena is a theatre that is located a bit far  in South of Amsterdam. The theatre hall is good. I think the biggest of all the Pathe theatres.I was happy to see many Indians in the movie hall. The movie unlike in India  did not have an interval break in between.Now the movie. Hritik was fantastic he carried the movie on his shoulder. Not a single move of his was out of place. Each expression each twitch on his face represented the emotion that was undergoing the character.But the movie was bad. Abhishek acted as if he was acting in his first movie. Ashwairya looked starved to death  except her face  her body was ugly to look at. Adiya Chopra  he had the best dialogues and punch lines  but he does not have anything in him to carry off his character or such wonderful lines. Though they bring some smiles on your face  the lines were really good.The songs were filmed nicely  especially the first dance of Hritik  Dhoom Again  was as good as  Main Aisa Kyu Hu.This was the first time  I was disappointed by Masand Ki Pasand's review  who gave 3 out of 5 stars to the movie and appreciated the movie by saying that the Director knows the what audience loves and wants  and delivered that in the movie. I could not disagree more with him. It seemed that Masand was blown away by the movie hall full of youngster  in hyped first show or may be Masand was paid in cash or kind to write a good review by the Film Directors. All in all  not a worth seeing the movie  except Hritik. If you are Hritik fan  go for the movie.My brother roared about the high level of action scenes  but that too can not help me say that  avoid this movie. It is bad!".

And then just when I got used to it she starts singing the Indian version of Got me looking so Crazy right now.... Sorry but I had to laugh. I was half hoping she mite start singing I like big butts and I cannot lie... I liked Bipasha  very stunning indeed but Uday??? my god how he got into acting is beyond me? oh hold on a minute thats right! he's a Chopra!!! What was with Hritikh Roshans blonde highlights?? My advice? don't bother watching this film unless you want to see skinny Ash with dodgy thick eyebrows dark skin and really strange hair that looks like it has been washed with soap?? Get some hair conditioner girl!!! Having said all that I still love Abisheikh Bips Hritikh  was disappointed with Ash.".

AKA  Beyonce? what was that about? and why did she keep saying like and rolling her eyes like a wannabe black girl? And then just when I got used to it she starts singing the Indian version of Got me looking so Crazy right now.... Sorry but I had to laugh. I was half hoping she mite start singing I like big butts and I cannot lie... I liked Bipasha  very stunning indeed but Uday??? my god how he got into acting is beyond me? oh hold on a minute thats right! he's a Chopra!!! What was with Hritikh Roshans blonde highlights?? My advice? don't bother watching this film unless you want to see skinny Ash with dodgy thick eyebrows dark skin and really strange hair that looks like it has been washed with soap?? Get some hair conditioner girl!!! Having said all that I still love Abisheikh Bips Hritikh  was disappointed with Ash.";

Keith is all for getting Larry out of the country for he is a successful barrister who is soon to be made a judge and doesn't want any skeletons coming out of the closet.

Robert Newton had a small role as the enthusiastic lawyer who is convinced his client the beggar who constantly repeats that on that particular night he lost his self respect is not guilty.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a rather interesting tale of an accidental killing that turns both into a travesty of justice and battle of conscience for the one responsible for the killing.Lovers Wanda Vivien Leigh and Larry Laurence Olivier are in the honeymoon phase of their love when one night they enter Wanda's apartment and there is a guy who somewhat resembles Jabba the Hutt claiming to be Wanda's estranged husband and trying to put the squeeze on her  for money not affection. He's three times Larry's size but when he gets physically aggressive Larry fights back and manages to get his hands around his neck. He only means to hold on until the man stops fighting but unfortunately he does not stop fighting until he dies.Why doesn't Larry call the police and explain things? This is never clear. Maybe he doesn't want Wanda embroiled in a scandal  carrying on with Larry when married to another although estranged. Maybe he believes he will not be believed. But then maybe he is also worried for the reputation of his brother who has just been named a judge.So Larry carries this huge man's body and tries to place it outside in such a way that he MIGHT be considered some homeless person who just died of exposure if the police are sloppy. Too bad the police are not sloppy and worse they arrest an exminister who has become a bum and who confesses to the police he has lost his self respect and done a terrible thing. But that terrible thing was to steal some money and the ring of the dead man once he knew he was dead. No matter the police arrest the minister a guy with no known violent past for killing somebody he obviously did not know.Meanwhile Larry has confessed all to his brother who advises both he and Wanda burn all things showing that they have ties to each other and not see each other until this blows over. Apparently Larry's brother the judge doesn't have any faith in the British justice system either or maybe he is just afraid of the scandal and his own career. He assures Larry the minister will never hang for something with such circumstantial evidence.Well Larry shows up at the arraignment.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a rather interesting tale of an accidental killing that turns both into a travesty of justice and battle of conscience for the one responsible for the killing.Lovers Wanda Vivien Leigh and Larry Laurence Olivier are in the honeymoon phase of their love when one night they enter Wanda's apartment and there is a guy who somewhat resembles Jabba the Hutt claiming to be Wanda's estranged husband and trying to put the squeeze on her  for money not affection. He's three times Larry's size but when he gets physically aggressive Larry fights back and manages to get his hands around his neck. He only means to hold on until the man stops fighting but unfortunately he does not stop fighting until he dies.Why doesn't Larry call the police and explain things? This is never clear. Maybe he doesn't want Wanda embroiled in a scandal  carrying on with Larry when married to another although estranged. Maybe he believes he will not be believed. But then maybe he is also worried for the reputation of his brother who has just been named a judge.So Larry carries this huge man's body and tries to place it outside in such a way that he MIGHT be considered some homeless person who just died of exposure if the police are sloppy. Too bad the police are not sloppy and worse they arrest an exminister who has become a bum and who confesses to the police he has lost his self respect and done a terrible thing. But that terrible thing was to steal some money and the ring of the dead man once he knew he was dead. No matter the police arrest the minister a guy with no known violent past for killing somebody he obviously did not know.Meanwhile Larry has confessed all to his brother who advises both he and Wanda burn all things showing that they have ties to each other and not see each other until this blows over. Apparently Larry's brother the judge doesn't have any faith in the British justice system either or maybe he is just afraid of the scandal and his own career. He assures Larry the minister will never hang for something with such circumstantial evidence.Well Larry shows up at the arraignment. In spite of the fact that it is obvious that the minister if not innocent is at least touched in the head he is held over for trial in three weeks. Larry ignores his brother's advice to leave the country and avoid Wanda and says he will take his next quarter's allowance spend frivolously on Wanda enjoy their 21 days  the time to the trial  and then turn himself in.This next part of the film with Larry and Wanda basically having what amounts to a 21 day holiday is the best part of the film.

	schema:headline " A limp and unconvincing romantic thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1919 play The First and the Last by John Galsworthy this is a limp and unconvincing romantic thriller. The second of only three films that Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh made together it was filmed in 1937 but not released for almost three years by which time its two stars had made names for themselves in Hollywood. Olivier later said that he believed that the film may never have been released otherwise as it was so dreadful and he and the future Lady Olivier were so dreadful in it. While I would not go quite that far I don't think that anyone involved gave it pride of place on their CV. It is certainly my least favourite of the Olivier films that I have seen. It is badly written by Basil Dean and Graham Greene even Homer nods and the former's direction leaves a great deal to be desired.The film concerns Larry Durrant the ne'erdowell younger brother of the prominent barrister Keith Durrant who is soon to be appointed to the bench and his lover Wanda. On April 21 1938 Larry and Wanda return home from a romantic trip to the pawnbroker's and find that her husband Henry Wallen whom she hasn't seen in three years is waiting for them in her flat. Henry threatens to kill Wanda and Larry accidentally kills him. He later places his body in an archway not far from Wanda's house. Fearing the shadow that it will cast on his legal career Keith advises Larry not to tell the police even after a harmless vagrant named John Evan is arrested and charged with murder. In spite of the very circumstantial evidence Evan is remanded for trial in three weeks. After learning that Henry was a bigamist Larry and Wanda get married and try to fit 30 years into 21 days. Larry has decided that he will come forward if Evan is convicted but not if he is acquitted. As it turns out Evan is convicted and sentenced to death  after a one day trial mind you  but dies that very night so Larry is off the hook. This is supposed to be a happy ending but it isn't as a wrongly convicted man has died probably due to stress and his name will never be cleared. This happens so that two dippy characters can live happily ever after. Considering Larry acted in selfdefence one would hope that this justification would be successful in court and he would be found not guilty so there is a very good chance that they could have lived happily ever after even if he had done the right thing. However they would rather a very nice and far more importantly innocent man be considered a murderer.Olivier's performance as Larry which is what he liked to be called in preference to Sir Laurence or Lord Olivier in later life is not one of his best but it is nevertheless the best in the film. He makes the film and its flawed poorly thoughtout plot all the more bearable as I couldn't help but pay attention to his great skill as an actor whenever he was on screen. Leigh was a fantastic actress but not in this film. She has a thankless role as Wanda but she plays it dreadfully. In many cases she fails to even deliver lines in a convincing fashion which shocked me. She was excellent in Fire Over England which she and Olivier made shortly beforehand so I don't know what happened here. Leslie Banks is good as the morally dubious Keith  well the more morally dubious Keith  but the best supporting performance comes from Hay Petrie as the unfortunate Evan. It also features nice small appearances from Robert Newton and William Dewhurst who died over two years before the film was released. Banks and Newton likewise appeared in Fire Over England and Olivier later cast them in his version of Henry V incidentally.Overall this is a very bad film which does not make a great deal of sense if you think about it but Olivier saves it from being a complete disaster. Still it is one of my least favourite films of the year.".

	schema:headline " Superb Suspense Thriller But Beware of Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "In the tragic romantic suspense thriller 21 Days Together costars Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh are a young couple who get away with a crime that the authorities treat as murder after a selfconfessed suspect eagerly takes credit for the offense. Adapting the classic John Galsworthy short play The First and the Last Constant Nymph director Basil Dean and noted novelist Graham Greene have generated a gripping topnotch nailbiter that could only have been produced in the United Kingdom owing to the moral improprieties of the film. At the very least under Hollywood's insurmountable Production Code Administration this starryeyed couple would have faced manslaughter charges and the man who claimed that he committed the transgression would never have received a death sentence. Indeed 21 Days Together boasts three major twists so if you haven't seen this tantalizing tale prepare yourself for something entirely different. Moreover cease from reading this analysis now! The forthcoming revelations in the second paragraph will sabotage the suspense if you blunder ahead. Olivier and Leigh make a charismatic couple that you will have you shedding a tempest of tears until fadeout. Leslie Banks delivers a strong performance as Olivier's smarter brother who not only takes their best interests but also his selfish interests to heart. While they might not have known better in the heat of the incident he has no excuse for his incorrigible actions to shield them from exposure. Neither Larry Durrant Laurence Olivier of Wuthering Heights nor Wanda Vivien Leigh of Gentlemen's Agreement are ever questioned about the murder of a sleazy individual who tries to blackmail them. Actually this foreign dastard had married our heroine some years before when Wanda was starving on the streets of Paris and would have consented to anything. According to Wanda their marriage lasted barely a week. Nevertheless Henry Wallen Esme Percy of Pygmalion awaits them as they return to Wanda's London flat and they refused to capitulate to Wallen's blackmail demands. A violent handtohand struggle with Larry and Wallen ensues after the latter brandishes a knife. Wanda doesn't stand by idly but participates at some point in the brawl. During the commotion Wallen falls and fatally smashes his head on the bricks of a fireplace. Fearing the worst for their future Larry and Wanda decide to dispose of the corpse without informing the law. Stealthily Larry places the corpse inconspicuously in Glove Lane in an empty archway when nobody is present. Immediately the remorseful Larry visits his older wiser brother Keith Leslie Banks of The Most Dangerous Game and explains his hopeless predicament. Keith is a prominent barrister and his name has been touted in the press as the ideal candidate for a judgeship.

	onyx:emotionText "In the tragic romantic suspense thriller 21 Days Together costars Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh are a young couple who get away with a crime that the authorities treat as murder after a selfconfessed suspect eagerly takes credit for the offense. Adapting the classic John Galsworthy short play The First and the Last Constant Nymph director Basil Dean and noted novelist Graham Greene have generated a gripping topnotch nailbiter that could only have been produced in the United Kingdom owing to the moral improprieties of the film. At the very least under Hollywood's insurmountable Production Code Administration this starryeyed couple would have faced manslaughter charges and the man who claimed that he committed the transgression would never have received a death sentence. Indeed 21 Days Together boasts three major twists so if you haven't seen this tantalizing tale prepare yourself for something entirely different. Moreover cease from reading this analysis now! The forthcoming revelations in the second paragraph will sabotage the suspense if you blunder ahead. Olivier and Leigh make a charismatic couple that you will have you shedding a tempest of tears until fadeout. Leslie Banks delivers a strong performance as Olivier's smarter brother who not only takes their best interests but also his selfish interests to heart. While they might not have known better in the heat of the incident he has no excuse for his incorrigible actions to shield them from exposure. Neither Larry Durrant Laurence Olivier of Wuthering Heights nor Wanda Vivien Leigh of Gentlemen's Agreement are ever questioned about the murder of a sleazy individual who tries to blackmail them. Actually this foreign dastard had married our heroine some years before when Wanda was starving on the streets of Paris and would have consented to anything. According to Wanda their marriage lasted barely a week. Nevertheless Henry Wallen Esme Percy of Pygmalion awaits them as they return to Wanda's London flat and they refused to capitulate to Wallen's blackmail demands. A violent handtohand struggle with Larry and Wallen ensues after the latter brandishes a knife. Wanda doesn't stand by idly but participates at some point in the brawl. During the commotion Wallen falls and fatally smashes his head on the bricks of a fireplace. Fearing the worst for their future Larry and Wanda decide to dispose of the corpse without informing the law. Stealthily Larry places the corpse inconspicuously in Glove Lane in an empty archway when nobody is present. Immediately the remorseful Larry visits his older wiser brother Keith Leslie Banks of The Most Dangerous Game and explains his hopeless predicament. Keith is a prominent barrister and his name has been touted in the press as the ideal candidate for a judgeship. He realizes only too well what may happen to his own prestige if his brother is arrested and put on trial. Comparably Larry is the black sheep of the Durrant clan and everything that he tries his hand at ends horribly in disaster. Not only should Larry book passage on a ship and leave the country but Keith also urges him to never see Wanda again! Predictably the forlorn Larry can do neither.Later Larry encounters a former clergyman John Aloysius Evan Hay Petrie of The Red Shoes outside of a pawn shop.

	schema:headline " 21 Days Together for Olivier and Leigh but For Us...A Pretty Short Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "What happens when you kill your lover's estranged husband? Three weeks to party during the trial of the wrongfully accused man before you fess up I guess. That's what happens when Larry played by Laurence Olivier gets into a tussle with the estranged husband of her lover Wanda played by Vivien Leigh and ends up killing him in self defense after the husband pulls out a knife. Worried that his status as a homewrecker would prejudice a jury against him he stashes the body in an alley hoping that the murder will be deemed unsolvable. When a homeless man he meets on the way back is given his gloves the police finger him for the murder. Larry becomes torn between the ensuing guilt and wanting to continue his relationship with Wanda. Encouraging him to let the homeless man take the fall is his attorney brother Keith played by Leslie Banks who doesn't want a family scandal interfering with his plans to become a judge. While the moral quandry is played out over the average 21 days that the trial is estimated to take Larry and Wanda decide to live their lives to the fullest in London until Larry reluctantly swoops in at the last minute to save the man before he goes to jail and take his place. Kind of a queasy concept although it is worth the watch to see an early Vivien Leigh who filmed the movie three years earlier than the release date in 1940. She looks radiant in every scene and is worth the price of admission just to watch her do her thing even if it is a supporting role to Olivier. As other reviewers have stated Olivier unfortunately is not quite used to the differences in movie acting versus stage acting yet and tends to shout his lines and overemote as if he's projecting to the back row. The plot is serving to it's 72 minute runtime as I didn't really feel cheated that it ended soon. It didn't need to be longer. The movie is mostly the two of them going on dates until the final decision is made. Not a bad movie but Olivier and Leigh definitely have their best work ahead of them.".

	schema:reviewBody "If 21 Days Together had been made in 1930 I would have cut it more slack. It feels like it was one of the first talking pictures ever made not like it was made after such epics of Gone with the Wind and Wuthering Heights. The script is disjointed the direction amateur and the scene transitions are silly. Plus Vivien Leigh's performance is so stinky it's impossible to believe she was an Academy Award winning actress.Real life spouses Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh play sweethearts in the movie but when her husband shows up after a threeyear absence Larry accidentally kills him. An innocent homeless man Hay Petrie gets arrested for the murder and Larry feels so guilty he turns to Leslie Banks his brother for advice. Leslie is up for a prestigious judge appointment and he doesn't want any scandal so he encourages Larry to stay silent until the trial. Hence the trial. Larry and Vivien have 21 days of bliss together before they learn the verdict. Naturally they spend their time taking ferry rides riding roller coasters darning socks and going to the fair. See what I mean? It's pretty silly almost like a college student was in charge of the story.Leslie Banks has a larger part than Laurence Olivier and he's sufficiently nervous and overbearing as the role requires. In turn Larry is sufficiently brooding and handsome as the role requires. Oddly enough there's zero chemistry or sparks between him and his wife. Vivien seems like this was her first acting role. If you thought her eyebrow raise as Scarlett O'Hara was good acting you'll be sorely disappointed when you see it in the same position the entire time during 21 Days Together. With an unflattering haircut and a bad makeup job she doesn't even look pretty and her strange delivery of her lines makes it seem like she's faking her British accent. I really can't recommend this movie I'm sorry to say.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alright guys I'm gonna be straight with you. In this review I'm gonna be praising Out for Justice and will be recommending it to anyone but the truth is Steven Seagal's best movie to me is always gonna be Under Siege period. Out for Justice to me is more like his second best even though you might think that saying that might not be saying much at all the truth is Out for Justice is an a great martial arts film that is worth your time.During Steven Seagal's ponytail years and before Under Siege came out Seagal was basically putting out a few martial arts films that were considered to be something new at the time. And because of that they were boxoffice successes and other actors such as Jean Claude Van Damme and Wesley Snipes started doing what Seagal was doing and the three of them rose to stardom. But during the course of the 1990's and the 2000's the mainstream culture started to look to other martial artists like Jason Statham in his ridiculous Transporter films and Seagal Van Damme and Snipes started doing their thing in the straighttoDVD way and things will never be the same again.But thank god we still have the movies to watch forever and Out for Justice does Seagal's career a whole lot of true justice. In this he plays a Gino Felino a tough as nails cop who grew up on the streets of Brooklyn and with Mafia ties. But one day his best friend Bobby is ruthlessly shot and killed in daylight and in front of his wife and kids by a wannabe wiseguy named Richie William Forsythe. And Gino happens to know him since those two were kids and he's willing to do anything to get to Richie such as arresting his sister to get information and even being rough with his parents. Also even the mob guys are after Richie since he's making them look bad but they keep screwing up and Richie keeps killing whoever they send to get him.And Seagal isn't too shabby as an actor when he gives that depressing monologue about his character's father but I'll admit that there were some areas that he could've improved on to make it better. And his slick fighting skills make his character really stand out. And also the part when he saves a harmless pup from being runover by a car after its owner threw it out in a garbage bag on the road is what is another defining point of him. And then in the end he finds that owner and kicks that guy in his family jewels. Pretty funny stuff there.Also William Forsythe's portrayal as the psychotic Richie is another one of the movies best parts. He's completely believable in his role as a guy who was always breaking the law since the start and then finally loses his mind when he starts taking crack and dope. And Forsythe displays his character's emotions of insanity and fury with sheer skill and also I laugh every time the line Shut up about the fking mouse! is said.And as always the action is what's best the aikido martial arts is completely realistic and doesn't seem too fake or stiff that some karateesquire movies do. The action is absolutely and positively brutal bloody and violent. And this is clear proof why Steven Seagal is the best at what he does the scene in the bar in which Gino takes a billiard ball wrapped in a towel and whacks Richies men and knocks a guy's teeth out is one of Seagal's best ever fight scenes. And who could forget the end when Gino storms that house with a shotgun and totally trashes the hell out of Richie?I actually just rented this movie last night from Blockbuster and I was amazed at how wrong I was about Seagal before. He doesn't deserve all the criticism he gets for not giving any depth to his characters but in Out for Justice I was seeing some of that. And next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna buy this on DVD and add it to my collection. Who knows? Maybe I'll even start making a collection of Seagal movies and this is along with Under Siege is a start.....".

And also the part when he saves a harmless pup from being runover by a car after its owner threw it out in a garbage bag on the road is what is another defining point of him. And then in the end he finds that owner and kicks that guy in his family jewels. Pretty funny stuff there.Also William Forsythe's portrayal as the psychotic Richie is another one of the movies best parts. He's completely believable in his role as a guy who was always breaking the law since the start and then finally loses his mind when he starts taking crack and dope. And Forsythe displays his character's emotions of insanity and fury with sheer skill and also I laugh every time the line Shut up about the fking mouse! is said.And as always the action is what's best the aikido martial arts is completely realistic and doesn't seem too fake or stiff that some karateesquire movies do. The action is absolutely and positively brutal bloody and violent. And this is clear proof why Steven Seagal is the best at what he does the scene in the bar in which Gino takes a billiard ball wrapped in a towel and whacks Richies men and knocks a guy's teeth out is one of Seagal's best ever fight scenes. And who could forget the end when Gino storms that house with a shotgun and totally trashes the hell out of Richie?I actually just rented this movie last night from Blockbuster and I was amazed at how wrong I was about Seagal before. He doesn't deserve all the criticism he gets for not giving any depth to his characters but in Out for Justice I was seeing some of that. And next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna buy this on DVD and add it to my collection. Who knows? Maybe I'll even start making a collection of Seagal movies and this is along with Under Siege is a start.....";

If you like Seagal you will love this film if you don't OFJ probably will not convince you.The fight scenes have a nice bonecrunching kinetic energy to them the plot has something of an urgent feel to it and the soundtrack contributes greatly to the atmosphere and mood of the proceedings. I especially liked the placement and timing of 'No Sleep 'Til Brooklyn'. This played during the montage driving scene where 'Gino' Seagal drives through various ethnic neighborhoods and reacts to various sights and extras  to me this was the actual highlight of the film giving the viewer a sense of place and humanity missing from most films of this type. There are of course a couple of major problems with the film that keep it from being anything more than a typical Seagal action vehicle. The first one is that 'Gino' is such an unstoppable fighting machine that you never really worry about him or whether he will be a match for the villain once he finds him. And indeed once Gino catches up with 'Ritchie' William Forsythe dreadfully miscast and not especially convincing the denouement is a completely onesided sskicking that lacks any suspense whatsoever. Gino just mows Ritchie down like winter wheat and the scene comes to an end. At least Seagal had some trouble with Tommy Lee Jones and the terrorists in 'Under Siege' and with the voodoo gangster guy in 'Marked For Death'  you got the sense that he really was in danger. Not so here.2ndly and probably worse Seagal seems to have decided that he wanted to stretch himself as an actor in this movie. So the script gives the movie way too many scenes where he delivers endless monologues  no actually they are more like oratories  in a static talking head shot filmed over the shoulder of another actor or extra. These scenes go on for literally minutes and bring the film to a screeching halt because Seagal just can't pull them off. Hell I'm not sure Deniro filmed by Scorcese could pull them off because these speeches just go on and on until even the biggest Seagal fan is saying 'OK Steven we GET IT you're ACTING now can we PLEASE MOVE ALONG?!?!? Still this film and the following film 'Under Siege' probably represent the peak of Seagal's career as an action star. After this he started going downhill getting greasier and flabbier with each new release and each new release was more and more unconvincing and badly made than the last until finally he seems to have bottomed out with Exit Wounds and directtovideo crap like Out For A Kill.So if you want to watch a GOOD Seagal film consider this one. It holds up well over repeated viewings and over the decade since it was made.".

His partner Bobby Lupo has been gunned down in the streets in front of his wife and kids by crazed wannabe gangster Richie Madano. Richie was always into something bad even when he was a kid and now seems to be going psycho snorting coke and smoking crack. He's got a oneway ticket to oblivion and he's going to have fun getting there along with his evil henchmen Joey Dogs Bobby Arms and Bochi. Luckily for the good citizens of Brooklyn Gino is on the case and on the mission to find Richie by means of broken bones severed limbs and agonizing pain.As Steven Seagal movies go the pre1997 Golden Years Out For Justice is definitely one of the strongest. Tight fastpaced direction well balanced widescreen framing a great score by David Michael Frank and an impressive cast of familiar faces give it a lasting impression. Also Seagal has mentioned that this is his favorite film of his own and you can really see it in his acting. He's often been criticised for not giving any effort and I wholeheartedly agree in regard to his later films. But there was a time when he did try and in Out For Justice you can see that a little effort goes a long way. I know his Brooklyn accent isn't THAT convincing and his acting in general isn't exactly on par with Olivier but if he we're to be just as enthusiastic about his other characters then maybe his film career wouldn't be in the toilet.Out For Justice never loses its appeal. William Forsythe is just so evil as Richie that I've never been convinced by the nice guy characters he's played in other movies. The fight scenes in which Seagal takes measures to ensure maximum suffering are most entertaining and small moments of character give it a strange edge. But you can tell that there's been a lot of stuff left out. This is especially evident in the montage sequences where characters are wearing different clothing and meet up with each other all over the place. There is also hints at more murders by Richie in the trailer that are never seen or referenced in the film at all.Proof positive that Seagal once had it.

Oh it's a great sound! He even manages a few amusing wisecracks or so although I could have heard less of his character's moving childhood stories with some sort of philosophical message but we're just seeing the sincere reflective side of the man. Even taking time out to look after a dumped puppy while after an elusive criminal that he knew through childhood that's roaming Brooklyn and who brutally killed his partner  friend in coldblood. I guess this is to counter balance the violence and there's a lot of it. However Seagal is overshadowed by William Forsythe's dominating hotheaded and vicious drug fuelled gangster. Definitely one of the most insane villains put on screen and Forsythe milks out every opportunity to display it. When these two characters finally come to blows it doesn't disappoint. Director John Flynn keeps it lean mean and quite explosive in a familiar but well done manner as he knows when to up the ante and to let it settle. The music soundtrack was the only thing I found to get in the way at times trying to be hip in its flavour. The rest of the cast is reasonably good with the likes of Jerry Orbach Gina Gershon and Julianna Margulies showing up. An entertainingly unapologetic action joint".

The script by David Lee Henry doesn't take any prisoners as it's an incredibly violent  brutal action flick with Seagal impaling guy's to walls with meat cleavers a pool ball wrapped in a towel to knock some guy's teeth out a bad guy has his lower leg blown off with a shotgun Richie who is constantly high on crack throughout the entire film dragging a woman out of the window of her car  shooting her point blank in the head  a constant barrage of profanity  bad language I don't know what the profanity count on Out for Justice is but it seems like every sentence has some form of abusive terminology. I haven't mentioned the story yet have I? Well I don't think I really need to as there isn't much of one I mean someone kills one of Seagal's buddy's  Seagal either kills or beats up just about everyone he meets to get to the scumbag who did it what more do you want? Forget about any meaningful character's or dialogue as Out for Justice is all about it's brutal setpieces  that in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing as you can just forget about the silly story the bad dialogue  Seagal's silly ponytail  enjoy Out for Justice for what it is a foul mouthed excessively violent 90's action flick like the kind they just don't make anymore. Just make sure you pick up an uncut version as far as the UK is concerned the Warner Bros. DVD is uncut while all other previously released VHS copies here were cut by about a minute.Director Flynn does alright there are no cheesy oneliners here  Out for Justice is as serious  deadpan in tone as they come. As already mentioned the violence here is brutal with a fight in a butcher's  a pool bar both being very violent as Seagal takes no prisoners  has no mercy. Most of the action revolves around fights or shoot outs although there is a decent car chase at the start there aren't many big stunts  disappointingly nothing blows up. I must admit I thought the accents were bad especially Seagal who lets face it can't act at all. He sort of mumbles his way through Out for Justice but then the dialogue is secondary to the action anyway so it's bearable. I don't understand why everyone has to swear so much though it becomes silly  distracting after a while as entire sentences seem made up of profanity.Technically the film is fine although one suspects the budget wasn't anything amazing it's well made enough if somewhat unspectacular. Some of it was actually shot in Brooklyn while Los Angeles was also used as a location. The acting isn't too bad Seagal is Seagal while Forsythe makes for a suitably scumbag villain John Leguizamo turns up in a small role while Gina Gershon provides the glamour.Out for Justice is definitely one of Seagal's better efforts he still looks a bit on the flabby side but he looks tough here unlike his more recent efforts. A hard fast moving  brutal action flick that's worth a watch if you don't mind the violence  profanity. Made under the title of The Price of Our Blood which is just crap really  it's a good job they changed it to Out for Justice for it's release.".

The killer Richie Madano played masterfully by William Forsythe is a total psychopath who treats murder and violence like it's a hobby. Richie just does whatever he wants killing on a whim terrorizing people for fun and snorting crack. Still as much of a sadist as he is he fails to realize the hell storm he's unleashed in the form of a vengeful Gino.Gino pursues Richie all over town shaking down people for info and fighting anyone who wants a piece of him. He's out to get Richie and won't let anyone stop him resulting in several memorable fight scenes including the bar room brawl and the infamous fight in the butcher shop. Seagal is less spiritual and much darker in this. This movie really shows that while he's the hero sticking up for working girls and even rescuing an abandoned puppy Seagal has no problem being totally ruthless with the bad guys.The movie is pretty graphic and the final showdown in the last 10 to 15 minutes is epic. And when it's down to Gino and Richie Richie makes the mistaking of declaring that he 'likes pain'. Let's just say that Gino gives it to him in spades.".

It's one of Seagal's best films and also one of his best performances plus the ending is damn funny!. William Forsythe is very menacing as the main villain and the finale was very exciting!. I really enjoyed this movie it was a lot of fun! with lots of wicked violence. The Direection is very good. John Flynn does a very good job here with some cool camera angles and keeping the film tense and fast paced throughout! excellent job. There is plenty of blood and harsh violence. We get Nasty bone breaking tons of extremely bloody gunshot woundscleaver in the handvery nastyhand split in 2 and leg bloody gunshot wounds to the head some object in the head head beaten repeatedlyvery bloody and lots of blood! Pretty Decent. The Acting is very good!. Steven Seagal is Awesome here and gives one of his best performances he is great in the acting department has a couple cool one liners and kicks that ass! Seagal rules!. William Forsythe is excellent as the main villain he was crazy! and was very menacing! he did an excellent job. Jerry Orbach is good in his limited screen time wish he had more screen time though. Jo Champa is good as Seagal's wife she was beautiful had decent chemistry wit Seagal and was pretty likable. Gina Gershon is GORGEOUS!she was very sexy and did excellent in her limited screen time i needed to see more. Overall this is a terrific Seagal film and i say go see it!  out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Walking into the movie theater in 1991 on this one was fun and because Seagal was still fairly new to audiences it was a 'fresh' star as well so the excitement and newness were great factors in the enjoyment and nostalgia of all of this. Finding your seat and carrying the popcorn and big gulp then just getting ready for the feature that you had anticipated. It's great to be young. This is a story of the fast streets and crime in the city of darkness and light. It's also one of the handful of films that Seagal has been in that are just outstanding. His character and portrayal of in this story is on the mark as you would think and feel that they would be dealing daily in this type of life and situations that accompany such a life. Gino is the type of friend who is not just a badass on the streets he authentic he is alert and sharp and reads between the lines. Thats' a sense that you could not survive a day on the force without having. That would be the sense working for you like an onboard computer would. He is also loyal he believes in family and true friends and will obviously fight for that which he believes in and values most. If you are gonna mess with his family you had best kill him first.S.S is the best and most real man to put into this streetsmartviolent rush of a cops and robbers drama. It was really a feast for the senses when you see the place that he lives and works and what it would take to just continue on in that arena without slipping or going crazy.This place is tough and that doesn't even really do it justice as a description. Hard as the concrete that you would hit when someone thoughts you out of a ten story window! Murder mayhem all bought and sold on the street right here everyday. Day in and day out. The people like Gino are the ones that need a parade and a healthy pay raise for they stick their necks out everyday to some crackhead low life that would take aim and kill them in a second and then not even have a thought about it afterwards. Cold. Death. That is this place and it needs to be cleaned up. And fast. Enter Gino a nononsense officer who looks like a criminal but brings em to justice with a vengeance!!!For Bobby Lupo who just happened to be a good cop maybe he was playing with the blind spots of the job. Ultimately that's what got the drop on him in the midday life that he should have been playing out with his familyspending time and shopping joking around etc. Not when Richie gets in town and is told a story by the little girl that Bobby is doing. She puts Richie in a spot because she is mad at Bobby and Richie has a thing going with her as well. So it becomes easy for a crackedout crazed killer like him to target and assassinate Bobby in broad daylight. A whole lot of trouble over who's having sex with who. That's where it starts and ends on this caper. But the action and conversations are explosive in the between time. This is a grade A feature for the actiondrama enthusiast. Making it a tophit in my book of favorites. This is well written and acted with expert direction. A fury of faced paced pursuit that would have Bruce Lee interested I do believe. There is quite a bit of cursing and swearing and of course on the street it's just that way but I would love this without if possible because I have already heard all the profanity in life that I will ever need to hear. Way to go Steven Seagal and company. I recommend this film because it isn't just another action movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched Out For Justice again for the first time in more than 15 years and it's surprisingly different from how I remember it. I've seen a lot of Seagal's other work since then mostly his more recent and more disappointing stuff but mostly I'm struck by how much more abrasive and violent his character is. I mostly just remember that last fight scene with Richie and the part where he rescues the puppy that some guy dropped out of his car. But contrary to his normal fashion Seagal's character is rough and violent and doesn't care a bit about the rules.Granted Seagal has a tendency to play guys who don't care about rules go it alone cops and whatnot but in this movie he spends a lot of time throwing the first punches in situations where all he has to go on are suspicions. By now Seagal has discovered that the revenge theme is something of a cash cow for a guy like him and it shows in Out For Justice. He plays Gino Felino a Brooklyn cop whose best friend gets shot to death in the opening minutes of the movie in broad daylight in front of his wife and kids. Complicating matters is that Bobby his friend was shot by Richie Madano a brutal gangster with whom Bobby and Gino have been enemies since childhood. Gino sets out on a mission to find him and avenge his death. During his search for Bobby he interrogates all of Bobby's crew on their own turf. Waltzing right into bars and smacking people around. Highly satisfying Seagal fare I have to say but a little out of character in the way he punches first and asks questions later. Or asks questions while punching that's pretty effective too.At any rate it doesn't help that Gino had a tough childhood his father struggled to provide a knife and scissor sharpening service in a time when more and more people were switching to disposable knives and scissors although I guess those never really caught on leaving Gino and his family pretty broke until a local friend of the family Mr. Madano gave Richie money so he could go to the amusement park with the other kids. Now he is hunting for Mr. Madano's son and plans to kill him. Oh what a tangled web we weave.Richie by the way is a brilliantly vicious and heartless performance by William Forsythe and is arguably the best villain in any Steven Seagal film ever made. He's brutally violent and completely unhinged no doubt because of a tremendous crack habit and clearly doesn't care if he lives or dies making him all the more dangerous. Forsythe's performance almost overshadows even Seagal's and that's saying a lot given that this might be Seagal's best film ever. Out For Justice pulls no punches. It is tremendously violent there is a scene involving a bad guy getting shot in the leg near the end of the movie that's one of the most graphic and disturbing images I've ever seen in an action movie ad yet has character development and an interesting story. Seagal in his prime! Enjoy!".

Their activities take place in Brooklyn  the borough where they both grew up. Now as adults their incompatible lifestyles must face off preferably in the final reel please.This film shows Seagal as a kind of Death Wish type character and he is intent on tracking Ritchie down. So much so that he is leaning on anyone who knows anything about him. These are probably the best scenes in the film  where Gino confronts Ritchie's brother in a great bar fight sequence.Although the film is a little bit unbalanced in it's pacing and the criminals are too comicbooklike for my tastes this film does make use of it's background setting well. We are taken to all sorts of downmarket dives hotels mobboss meetings and brothels. It's a living slice of New York.Seagal is surprisingly convincing and his naturalistic style here really does work for the film. Again like elements of Marked for Death there is a slight echo of that Walking Tall idea where a man singlehandedly cleans up his own territory  against the odds and at any cost.".

With that sais this one ranks amoung Seagals best. Seagal is Gino a gungho cop from Brooklyn who decides to take matters into his own hands when a violent ganster kills his partner think A Bronx Tale mixed with Hard to Kill and Above the Law for good measure. Gino seems to cause trouble everywhere he goes as he uncovers a ring of corruption and lies that go a lot deeper than Gino had suspected. But with only a shotgun and his fists of steel he dispatches his own kind of street justice on everyone who gets in the way of him finding Richie the man who killed his partner. There isn't as much martial arts mayhem as in previous Seagal outtings and the fights that are here don't seem as glorified as past Seagal works but nonetheless the violence meter is through the roof there is a nicely entertianing car chase and there is also an unusually high level of profanity. Even though most of the film is a no brainer Seagal still finds time to get a postivie message in there when he picks up a dog that someone through out their car window in a garbage bag. The film also ends on a humorous note as Seagal encounters the man who did that to the dog. Seagal has never been the greatest actor but he manages to put some heart into his work here with a suprisingly uplifting story about his father and also gets to crack out a few amusing oneliners. The major downfall here is the miscasting of William Forsythe as Richie who doesn't really live up to the hype that surrounds his character. In the end what we have is a highly entertaining and always thrilling little actionsuspense film that fans of Seagal will love and maybe even a few nonfans will get into as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll guess that you either love Seagal or hate him.I certainly loved him in his Warner Bros. era not forgetting 'Marked for Death'. And in particularly this movie. It reminds me of 'Above the Law' because he once again plays a spaghetti cop with a grudge. This time it's just goes all in on bone crushing violence. Seagal is not out for justice  he's out for good old ice cold an eye for an eye swift and brutal vengeance! And he gets it! With meat cleavers cue balls sticks shot guns to the ground aikido beatings and a fing corkscrew! He crushes smashes and slices his way through the bones teeth and flesh of the bad guys accompanied by bullets from his preferred sidearm. The story is not more than what a 90's action flick need to have. Seagal is let loose by his superior Jerry Orbach to catch the crazy would be mafioso Richie Madano who just killed Seagals best friend. Like in 'Above the Law' Seagals character with the once again clingy Italian name Gino Felino has friendly ties to the Italian mob and soon he has kicked his way to some information about the whereabouts of his former childhood acquaintance turned drug head lunatic and the climatic showdown can begin. There is not much to say about the acting cause Steven basically just beats anyone and anything in his surrounding on his way to get Richie. Seagal himself plays Seagal like in any other Seagal movie only adding a bad Brooklyn accent. And that's how it should be done. At the age of 10 I would hate the actor if didn't liked the character he would portray Childs logic. I really hated William Forsythe! So I guess it's my way to acknowledge his portrayal of the dope dealing crazy drug head and wannabe mafioso Richie Madano. Even with the rather small amount of screen time he still succeed in bringing a bit more mad craziness in to the character than you usually would find in those types of movie bad guys. So when he finally gets his must deserved whooping you almost find yourself cheering for Seagal to breaks his bones. I really like this movie. Especially due to the degree of brutality in the fight scenes. It takes it a step further than the other action movies of that period. The fighting scenes will most definitely make you slip a ''whooa!'' or ''ooouch!'' once or twice!I like Steven Seagal for his on screen persona actually being one of the few action heroes of his time without any soft edges like the macho style of Bronson and Eastwood before him. He is a no bull sht man who always wins because he IS better than his opponents. There is no need for you to take a serious beating like JCVD in all his movies if all it takes is to break the guy's neck. And that is was you can count on Seagal to do! And in this movie he does so very well. One of his best and one of my favorites.".

It reminds me of 'Above the Law' because he once again plays a spaghetti cop with a grudge. This time it's just goes all in on bone crushing violence. Seagal is not out for justice  he's out for good old ice cold an eye for an eye swift and brutal vengeance! And he gets it! With meat cleavers cue balls sticks shot guns to the ground aikido beatings and a fing corkscrew! He crushes smashes and slices his way through the bones teeth and flesh of the bad guys accompanied by bullets from his preferred sidearm. The story is not more than what a 90's action flick need to have. Seagal is let loose by his superior Jerry Orbach to catch the crazy would be mafioso Richie Madano who just killed Seagals best friend.

He's never had the muscular physique Ahnuld had he doesn't have the style of Van Damme he doesn't have the actual acting skills of someone like Stallone but the one thing he does have is sheer brutality. In this one he hacks people up with a meat cleaver takes off someone's leg with a shotgun hits people's teeth out with a billiard ball breaks an entire human body worth of bones I guess this movie isn't good by any real standards but it's a mighty fun ride. It also helps that this was the era where Seagal still genuinely gave a damn constantly getting angry and raising his voice until you almost understand what he's saying. He whispers for dramatic effect here not because he's too obese to catch his breath.

	schema:reviewBody "Date Movie is a movie that spoofs romantic comedies. The movie follows Julia Jones Alyson Hannigan as she goes through all the events that take place in order to marry her prince Grant Adam Campbell. This process involves meeting the parents breaking up meeting the exgirlfriend planning the wedding and everything else that the romantic comedy genre has thrown our way. Laughs are supposed to ensue Just when you thought Hollywood has reached an all time low comes Date Movie a movie that proves that anything can be made into a film in Hollywood and no matter how bad something is people will dish out their hard earned money to see it. Date Movie is by far the worst pile of crap I have seen in several years and can possibly go down in the history of film as being one of the worst movies ever made.This movie contained zero laughs none of the spoofs were even remotely funny. It was an insult to anyone who dished out any kind of money to see this film. The saddest part about all of this is that I knew before seeing this movie that it was going to be bad but I didn't think it could ever be as bad as it actually was. All the jokes fell flat and half way through its groundbreaking 75 minute running time I wanted to find a way to end my life so I wouldn't have to sit through another second of this horrid movie.There really isn't a positive thing I can say about this movie. The first question that comes to mind though is who the hell came up with the idea. Why spoof comedies? Comedies are already funny so why spoof them? This is a question I wondered when I first heard about the movie and now after seeing Date Movie I know it can't be done and shouldn't even be attempted. While Date Movie only runs 75 minutes they try to spoof everything they can including Bridget Jones's Diary Kill Bill Say Anything My Best Friend's Wedding Napoleon Dynamite How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days My Big Fat Greek Wedding Hitch The Bachelor Meet the Parents Sleepless in Seattle Rize King Kong Wedding Planner and so many more. You would think that one joke would work but in all honesty not a single one did. You just sit there staring at the screen losing your brain cells and wondering how on earth someone got money to produce this pile of garbage.I guess you should know that a movie is really bad when it's not screened for critics and the trailer tries to sell you a movie by saying from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie but there is always that small part of me that says it can't be as bad as it looks but in this case it's worse than it looks. It's a train wreck and if anyone finds this movie funny I am sorry but there must be something seriously wrong with you or you are just so incredibly immature.This movie took 2 people to write and two people to direct. If I ever meet Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer the writers and directors behind this crap I will demand that they give me my 6.75 back for paying to see this movie. These guys have no right what so ever to make a movie when they put out a movie like Date Movie. There should be a law in Hollywood that if your movie is hated by both critics and audiences alike that you should be placed in a cell and beaten until you write everyone who watched your film a huge letter of apology. I really wonder what crap can come out of Hollywood next that can be worse than this film.So to sum it up Date Movie sucks plain and simple. Even if you see it with little or no expectations you will be disappointed. I despise everyone who was involved with this movie from the entire cast who somehow read this script and said this is going to be good to the interns who didn't walk off the set after the first day of shooting. Why is it that we have to suffer through movies that are this bad? And Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are going down because when you pay 610 to see a movie like Date Movie I can totally understand why people aren't going and would be leery of what Hollywood puts out. This is the worst film to come out of Hollywood in years even worse than Gigli Batman and Robin and You Got Served. MovieManMenzel's final rating for Date Movie is a 0 out of ten. This movie doesn't even deserve a 1 because nothing worked at all and people shouldn't have to be tortured like this when they see a movie.".

With once having sat through twelve hours of constipation I have yet to sit through a dump that was more excruciatingly painful than watching this two hour film. The worst part is it isn't even two hours it's eighty minutes but it makes you feel like you must have aged four or five years through this. I feel they must have added in Sophie Monk and Carmen Electra not because of their amazing acting talent but because they felt the humor was so poor they needed to wake people up from this painfully dumb movie. The audience's reaction to the film provided more laughs than the actual movie itself. I can't decide whether I find it comical or depressing that this film managed to parody movie scenes and make them worse. Truly the people saying these writers aren't talented are wrong it takes an art to be able to make something this bad. The movie is a complete non sequiter too. In one scene after the family has toasted at the rehearsal wedding dinner table Lil' Jon comes in and says What? Yeah. Okay. and that's the punch line. Seriously Hotel Rwanda was funnier than this movie. The film also contains tons of gross out humor with a man coughing up a hairball a woman with a hairy back and a cat humping a corpse. Real clever guys. This is the kind of stuff that makes angels cry and kills orphan babies. I would've walked out of this monstrosity had it not been for me hoping that maybe just maybe it might be slightly enjoyable than the previous torturous minutes. I mean you know something is wrong when the funniest part of a movie is a cat crapping into a toilet. This film is only really a mess of parodies thrown together that don't make any sense. I really have to say it's as witty as it gets when Frodo delivers a swift kick to the nads of Gandolf and he screams My precious! Finally the ending seemed to have been thrown in to make an attempt to give the male audience a boner so maybe the wouldn't come out of the theater asking for a gun. No the worst travesty is not that I spent 6.75 on this movie but that I will never be the same person I was before. This is the stuff nightmares are made of. Don't go see this under any circumstances. If your significant other wants to see this fake your death. Anyway you can get out of this movie is truly a blessing.P.S. My cellphone started ringing during the movie. Why oh why didn't I pick it up? Seriously man eating on the phone would have been more entertaining than this movie.".

It's not sufficient to just throw a bunch of stolen scenes together in the hope that the conjunction will generate humour by itself. I honestly could not see one  not ONE  original thought or idea or line in the script or direction. That in itself is something of an achievement. The whole thing plays like it was scripted by teenagers and not teenagers from the top end of the grade curve.In fact I have to wonder if this films is deliberately aimed at the lowest common denominator.

So why was this one so bad? I can't really explain.. I saw all the movies they parodied and still.. it just wasn't funny. I am absolutely in love with Alyson Hannigan. She's a very beautifal and very talented actress. Eddie Griffin is one of the funniest comedians to grace the silver screen in years. And please Lil' Jon is in the movie! What's not to like? Well the fact that basically a lot of the parodies were just word for word retellings of some of the movies. The dinner scene was an ENTIRE ripoff of the Meet the Parents scene to a t. This movie tries too hard to be funny and at sometimes its okay the Pimp My Ride scene comes to mind but honestly.. it just tries too hard and doesn't go anywhere. I can't say I was disappointed it was beyond that. If there's a sequel to this atrocious comedy I'll eat my hat.".

I managed to sit through House of the Dead but this film actually made me angry it was so unfunny. Please skip it have one of your friends go see it instead and then ask about it.

The film is packed with disgusting images that would make any decent human being sick to his or her stomach. From the cat humping a nearly mummified corpse to Eddie Griffin spitting out a mammoth hairball in slow motion the humor in this movie is downright distasteful. Sure everyone needs a dumb comedy to laugh at once in a while but there is nothing funny about the family cat raping Grandma's freezedried remains.There are several moments in this movie that could be funny were they not dramatically overdone. For instance when the cat is sitting on the toilet with diarrhea for two whole minutes. It was comical for the first thirty seconds but after that you start to impatiently wonder when this scene is going to end. Even more so is the opening sequence when Alyson Hannigan is dancing through the street in a fatsuit. No offenseI'm a bit on the heavy side myselfbut no one wants to see a soaking wet obese woman dancing on her hands and knees. In the dinner scene Adam Campbell's orgasmic and continuous shouts of YES! are awkward to watch. Judah Friedlander plays Nicky a fat slob covered from head to toe in grease stains who states one of the most disgusting lines of the film When I think about the honeymoon my sac gets all tingly and st. That's just nasty. Carmen Electra's parody of Paris Hilton's car washing commercial for the Hardee's thick burger is sickening and it is shown in at least four flashbacks throughout the film. It's simply overkill.To its credit this film does have some key elements that most audiences enjoy in a movie. Boy meets girl boy thinks girl is beautiful boy and girl fall in love boy and girl face obstacles in their relationship boy and girl overcome said obstacles and they all live happily ever after. Sadly this film could have been something enjoyable but it instead we are faced with this warped piece of trash that only the most sick and uncouth can laugh at. This is a movie that will mean absolutely nothing to future generations if it even exists to them at all. Yes it had potential but it turned out to be something repulsive.Really Date Movie doesn't deserve the attention it's getting from me writing this review. I'm trying to impress upon all moviegoers what a saddening waste of time this film is. I heard warnings from friends critics and fellow movie buffs but like an idiot I watched it anyway. Don't make the same mistake I did. And if you are so curious that you decide to watch it against your better judgment don't eat before doing so.".

Wow talk about funny. Ha. Ha. My gut just busted. I better see a doctor.A girl sticks a cherry stem in her mouth and pulls out a carousel and I'm supposed to laugh? Hardy har har.

That was it.The best they could come up with for a clever tag line in the poster art was From 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie. Uh okay. Well why'd you keep these two? It was honestly like they didn't even try. I could write a better parody than this and since I'm not a good enough writer to be hired by a studio I just have to assume that the writers are capable of better.There was nothing original. They were drawing such a creative blank that they spent a good five minutes having the camera watch a handpuppet cat squirm around on a toilet seat. They interspersed fart sounds and quick shots of facial expressions from the stars. Oh yeah that made it better.A good parody will take the existing content it is lampooning and present it in a humorous way by providing ironic twists. Here they simply made sets costumes and situations similar enough for you to recognize the source material and then either laid vulgarities or toilet humor on top of it. There's no thought in that. Just pitiful.Comedy of this nature almost always demands a straight man. In silly parodies the straight man is often the least absurd of the various characters. In the Scary Movie series star Anna Faris carried this role well. She's not up to a Leslie Nielsen standard yet but she's getting better with each installment. Her delivery her deadpan her timing are all very nice. In Date Movie Alyson Hannigan cannot do this at all. She used a total of two facial expressions to convey her character's reaction to each situation. It just became annoying.I think Hannigan has proved herself to be a charming actress not without talent. So I'll assume that the problem here was the two writers. Hopefully they'll now go join the other four.".

And best of all the film was really short roughly 73 minutes.The bad The is film is nothing more than 50 other movies mostly romances or chick flicks strung together in a very exaggerated way. So if you are looking for something unique this is the last place you want to check. The acting is also rather poor and the soundtrack seems to be just Kelis and the Pussycat Dolls repeated over and over. I would not take a date to see this date movie unless she was 12 but then I'd have bigger problems than this movie.The good I sadly must admit I enjoyed the cat using the toilet. At first it was stupid but they stretched the scene way beyond the time necessary. Sometimes when you repeat a bad joke long enough it becomes great. For me this was that moment. Also this film featured two of my three favorite Buffy actors. Alyson Hannigan was beautiful and fun and less obscene than in the American Pie movies. And Tom Lenk shows up in a cameo appearance as Frodo Baggins a scene that makes no sense with the rest of the movie but I found to be juxtapositionally hilarious. If only this film also had Michelle Trachtenberg.The ugly The disgusting parts were actually much less than in the Scary Movie series. Other than pimple joke I think the only really gross thing was the way this film portrayed fat people. A fat joke here or there I can understand but they stretched the jokes to the limit with this movie and it was rather nauseating.Don't rent this movie. Although if you like the stupidity that passes for humor these days this might be up your alley. Heck I deplore this film and still confess I laughed out loud at least twice. But don't tell anyone I said that because this movie is not good.".

Although if you like the stupidity that passes for humor these days this might be up your alley. Heck I deplore this film and still confess I laughed out loud at least twice. But don't tell anyone I said that because this movie is not good.";

This one is probably the funniest of them with its obvious references to the past 10 years or so of romance comedies that have graced and disgraced out screen. The story is about Julia Jones a lonely girl who just wants the perfect romance but her father wants hr to marry a ChineseGerman Jew or something like that. She then meets the love of her life and all is well until his ex fiance comes into the picture. I recommend this film over Epic Movie and Meet The Spartans for it is funny and direct but they still can not get away from thinking that dancing from famous characters is really funny. Oh well just watch this movie and TRY NOT to think for a change is that too hard.".

They could have made this into like 2 or 3 different movies and expanded. making it more original. But every scene was taken from something else. The scenes just made no sense when you watch them all as one movie they even had movie spoofs of films that came out literally like 6 months ago. Some of the actors did not even seem to have any life to them they were just there to be fillers. They should have taken more time to make this.To sum up this movie sad just a sad poorly done film.".

	schema:reviewBody "People really need to realize that in order for a parody to be good it has to be cheesy and in other words bad. I know it's a paradox but that is the only genre it is actually applied to. I was surprised to see the average rating of all newer parody stuff on IMDb Date Movie Meet the Spartans Epic Movie Vampires Suck etc. They all have 2.something average rating and it's mostly because people are not well informed on the whole concept of this genre.For a parody to be successful it has to take elements from real life andor moviesother media that are seemingly serious but cheesy little overrated over the top inaccurate ignorant full of prejudice... etc. So the good mocking of this just HAS to go a bit further to make the vague inaccuracies more obvious and laughable. I think that this movie succeeded in that. Everything that is bad or over the top is INTENDED to be so hence planned and I like it.Alyson Hannigan and Adam Campbell have good chemistry and acting skills and I enjoyed their performances very much. Adam is an underrated actor and he needs more recognition overall. Also the cast is full of talented parody performers like Jennifer Coolidge Eddie Griffin and Tony Cox.For anyone who doesn't particularly find romantic comedies good and considers them cheesy and overrated this is the film. It's particular 'victims' are precisely romantic comedies mostly My Best Friend's Wedding Meet the Fockers Wedding Planner Hitch Bridget Jones' Diary My Big Fat Greek Wedding and most wedding films.Alyson Hanigan's character is named Julia Jones parody of Bridget Jones and Julia Roberts and Adam Campbell plays Grant Fockyourdaughter parody of Hugh Grant and Fockers. Sophie Monk's character is parody of Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding and typical 'bitch' characters Tony Cox is Hitch Julia's family is mostly parody of My Big Fat Greek Wedding family with all national prejudice in it. All the characters are hilarious and deliver their puns on time. I was laughing all the time it's so on spot about all romantic clichs. The moment at the end with all the most cheesy love declarations ever is my favorite I can't restrain from laughing hard at that point.Also the films contains Jinxters the most disgusting cat you just have to LOVE! Let's just mention he doesn't restrain from gerentophilia and necrophilia. His scenes are so disgustingly nauseous but one of the funniest ever! I will probably never get tired of watching this and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves good laughter and mocking romantic clichs.It's 910 in everything it was supposed to be no matter what critic say!".

It's simple enough I guess but there's so many random things that just don't make sense the random weird flashbacks during the Kill Bill sequence for one. I don't know if it's just that the parody genre is being stretched so thin that there isn't anything left anymore or if this movie was just bad writing. The acting isn't terrible though some is cringe worthy. I think they tried so hard for going over the top that the jokes turn out disgusting offensive gratuitous and just plain not funny. Nearly every sequence with Jinxers the Jones family cat are horrid and disgusting. Nearly 98 of the jokes I had to tell my sister I would explain to her when she was older. And to complete it all I was in a theater full of teenage boys and not one of them laughed once which goes to show how much the film falls on its face. The only time the audience gave a halfhearted chuckle was during the Mr. and Mrs. Smith sequence. So save yourself the time and money. Skip this absolute zero.".

Why Alyson Hannigan decided to star in this movie is beyond me. Sophie Monk was the only decent actor and put on the American accent well in her first movie role despite being cast as eye candy for the male audience. The remainder of the cast whilst possibly talented had so little to work with they would fire their agents if they ever see this trash. I saw this movie because it was free like the rest of the cinema goers at this particular session. No one was laughing and I am sure I could hear tumbleweeds rolling through the cinema at various times. In all I counted about 4 scenes which made me laugh I won't spoil them for you so that if you do happen to get dragged to this flick you will have some comic relief. My advice is to stay clear well clear. Scary Movie 2 was better than this.".
