	schema:reviewBody "To the newcomer especially to a work like Love Affair or The Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator it might appear that the filmmaker Dusan Makavejev has attention deficit disorder. The guy isn't interested in stories like your Pappy filmmaker John Ford was. He comes from a country that has been through the war and revolution but he's well aware of what the moving image can give to the intended or unintended viewer. His style goes from one thing to another in a snap without fair warning. This is why perhaps the best entry point into his career is the scandalous hilarious politisex docudramacomedy WR The Mysteries of the Organism. Once you get through that and you want more you can go on to his earlier works such as this one.In a way it's similar to WR in that it tells a very conventional some would say ubermelodrama story of a averagebutpretty switchboard operator who meets a rodentcatcher aka sanitation worker and they have a love affair. It has this but Makavejev also cuts in clips from a sex doctor espousing about the nature of sex and phalluses in art and how an egg is more than just an omelet and faces the audience directly with this. And on top of this we get every so often a fact about rodent overpopulations and some political imagery and workers marching the in the street for good measure. For the filmmaker this story of a girl and a man having a fling mostly happy and only sad towards the end of their affair when an unintentional betrayal occurs on the part of the girl is just part of the woodwork and we can take what we will what it means in context of rodents and sex... or a murder mystery for that matter.Some of the film is amusing in its sudden movements and cutaways. Take the scene where Isabella is trying to work late and the guy that runs the switchboard keeps teasing her sexually trying to have his way. She finally gives in very reluctantly and we see her face is devastated. Immediately this cuts to a very scratchygrainy film stock showing Adam and Eve a naked man and woman in a circling movement in various sculpturelike poses. What does this mean? Why does Makavejev throw this in here? Perhaps as a practical joke or as one of those selfconscious beats akin to Godard. But for him it could mean everything or nothing. We get some blatant nudity but none of the sex is too graphic it's about average people then made nonlinear by a somewhat average murder case and then made extraordinary by its editing style and fresh outlook on Yugoslavian love and work.In other words expect a freewheeling film that mixes real romance and satire real documentary footage and breakingthefourth wall melodrama and tragedy. It's not always exciting and a little rough around the edges. For even the somewhatfan of the director's it's an anarchic treat.".

On one hand Switchboard Operator is a simple tale of love betrayal and tragedy in Belgrade and as such captures some touching details about trapped lives in a totalitarian society. However director Dusan Makavejev clearly under the influence of Godard adopts an offhand approach to his narrative and introduces extraneous material at tangents to the main story.  Most of this stuff is fascinating particularly when he uses archive footage of Yugoslav history.  Less successful are the interjections of two tedious academics a sexologist and a criminologist whose stern pronouncements jar against the film's capricious tone.  Nonetheless this is invigorating filmmaking which reaches into some strange regions.  Despite an economical running time of 69 minutes the film even finds time for a brief history of how the grey rat infested Europe!".

In one hour and nine minutes its main thread concerning a Hungarian switchboard operator who meets and falls in love with a Muslim who soon moves into her apartment much to the jealous chagrin of an imposing postal worker intruding some touching intercuts of archive footage that give impressions of lives ensnared in totalitarian society a brief history of how the gray rat infested Europe and a sexologist in his study talking about the history of sex. Even the central train of thought is deconstructed into ambiguity as seemingly at the same time the police are investigating the drowning of a young woman.Director Dusan Makavejev seems to have simply made a multifaceted montage of Yugoslavia and reflections based on its time 1967.

A young Hungarian woman and an older Serbian man enter into a relationship under the internationalist multiethnic midtwentieth century culture of communist Yugoslavia. This work contains scenes of beautiful deeply moving intimacy and sexuality. The contradictions of this culture are made plain within the movie by reference to scenes from a Russian revolutionary film by Dziga Vertoz Committed communist masses dismantle an old Cathedral their cause is clearly popular and democratic yet it is intolerant of an institution that has itself embodied intolerance for millennia. Revolutionary scientific humanity remains constellated within a dialectic of resentment. Ultimately human frailty destroys both the Hungarian and the Serbian. Misunderstanding and jealousy cause the lovers to turn on and destroy each other within the the terms set forth by this revolutionary society. Progress creates the illusion of enlightenment.

With his brilliant genre bending masterpiece Love Affair he crafts a simplistic beautiful and devastating portrait of one of film history's most tragic romances. Of course Makavejev's vision is not limited by the boundaries of conventional storytelling and tone. Spliced in between the romantic tragicomedy are interviews with a sexologist and a criminologist as well as various bits of stock footage depicting Yugoslavian politics.This often weird and humorous version of a brutally sad tale is among my new favorite films thanks to its entertainment value stunningly unique vision wild sense of humor and strong emotional impact. Makavejev pulls no punches he allows the tragedy to burst in a chaotic explosion of tears refusing to hold back. By the end i was so struck with melancholy that I could hardly believe what I had just witnessed. This is a film that combines so many themes and genres and yet manages to portray a semitradition story that anyone can follow. Sprinkling bits and pieces of the charmingly surreal and avant garde all over this saddening love story Makavejev forms one of the finest most unfortunately underrated and obscure cinematic romances of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Film for me is a matter of apprehension of temporal experience of who you are relative to what is playing before you. So I don't care about a historicist or cinematic scholarly approach to films in that film and history by itself is nothing a carved artifact. This is my way of saying that there are probably several reasons to find this interesting as token of 60s Yugoslav mores and 60s New Wave admire the technique which is wonderful in its freedom and placing. But for me none of that matters when it doesn't enliven me.A sexologist opens the film by humorously explaining the hidden omnipresence of sex in all we do establishing the essence of the film as something to be secretly whispered and discovered.The film follows a relationship between a rat exterminator and a blonde switchboard operator around Belgrade the ups and downs. Salad days captured with deliberate languidness.

	onyx:emotionText "Film for me is a matter of apprehension of temporal experience of who you are relative to what is playing before you. So I don't care about a historicist or cinematic scholarly approach to films in that film and history by itself is nothing a carved artifact. This is my way of saying that there are probably several reasons to find this interesting as token of 60s Yugoslav mores and 60s New Wave admire the technique which is wonderful in its freedom and placing. But for me none of that matters when it doesn't enliven me.A sexologist opens the film by humorously explaining the hidden omnipresence of sex in all we do establishing the essence of the film as something to be secretly whispered and discovered.The film follows a relationship between a rat exterminator and a blonde switchboard operator around Belgrade the ups and downs. Salad days captured with deliberate languidness.

	schema:reviewBody "It's been two months since I've been with a man  and that's a long time for a Hungarian woman.  Eva Ras professional HungarianAnd then Aligrudic mentions that his colleagues at work constantly make jokes about easy Hungarian women. I wouldn't be surprised if Eva had suggested this part for the dialogue. Not that she is proud of her heritage as much as her whoritage.A scandalous film at the time features for the first time a nude actress in a YU movie and I mean completely nude  and in lots of scenes. The only reasons any sane person would want to check out this laughably pretentious art film are the timemachine factor of watching an old YU movie the nostalgic factor and of course the opportunity to see what Eva looked like half a century ago  and in the nude. And there sure is a lot to see she had a great body especially the boobs. There is so much nudity in this 60s flick that some western censors wanted to play this in sex theaters.It turns out that Aligrudic didn't kill Eva intentionally but sort of accidentally bumped her into the well after she'd been literally flinging herself onto him for a while in what is a tremendously stupid scene. A totally idiotic plottwist that sort of neatly wraps up this pointless artcrowd mediocrity writtendirected by an overrated artiste who undoubtedly knelt in front of his Bunuel and Fellini posters for years before finally getting a chance from the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to do his own crap. Is that why there are totally irrelevant scenes with Marxist imagery? You bet. It was quite obvious that Aligrudic killed Eva but this never was meant to be a whodunit. It's more of a hudinit  a phony magic act intended to sell random themes meshed together as art.Aligrudic falls into an alcodepression when he finds out that Eva is pregnant  and that she doesn't want the kid. And who could blame her? The kid is either from Aligrudic or Ljuba Moljac either way she loses. I mean have you seen Aligrudic's real son? He is a carbon copy of the actor a toptier Serb politician a corrupt liar a former member of the country's ruling Far Right party called DSS. I have personally seen that man stumble around Vracar downtown Belgrade in a halfdrunken stupor which has a kind of poetic irony to it. His party is infamous for its barfly intellectuals. Did Eva get pregnant from Moljac or from Aligrudic? Did Aligrudic find out that the kid may not be his? We don't know the answer to any of that because the director is far more concerned with urgent matters  such as giving the viewer a history of the European grey rat and a reminder that even Rembrandt drew the sexual act. Somehow all of this is connected to rats and sex. Yes rats have lots of sex one ratpair produces 1000 in a mere year we are told. And this connects to Eva's life and murder how exactly?There are many artfart BS scenes in this vague movie. Scenes and subthemes are thrown in almost randomly and the viewer  afraid that he might embarrass himself that he didn't understand the movie's point  has no option but to conclude how good the movie was despite being confused by it and despite maybe not even liking it. THAT is how wannabe art films function they BLACKMAIL the easily bullied viewer into declaring the movie a success. It's peer pressure that's all it is just like on a school playground.Eva Ras is tailormade for these kinds of indefinable plotfree weirdforthesakeofit roles because she doesn't have to act in the literal sense of the word. Her breasts do the talking in this kind of a film while her synchronized mouth and the irrelevant stuff that comes out of it is subjected to a supporting role. The director is more concerned with throwing in stories about rats and Rembrandt or speeches by college professors  whose mere presence somehow isn't supposed to make this movie more stupid than it already is. The director isn't really interested in characterization. We don't really find out that much about them. Maybe Eva and her boyfriends are a metaphor for rats? Look give me a break I'm doing my best with the guesses. Eva's trademark moronic and insincere smile somehow suits these kinds of superficialcharacter portrayals. Give her a role in a proper movie with proper characters and she is lost she has no clue how to play them so usually she ends up reciting the lines like a robot. She's a bad actress.The only reason I didn't give this nonsense less than a 410 is because it has that nostalgia factor that I spoke of. If I'd seen this back when it was released I would have found it insufferably dull  aside from the nude scenes. Don't kid yourselves there is no plot here to speak of. This is the type of director who is much more concerned with international notoriety and respect with getting nominated for dumb awards at dumb European film festivals than providing the viewer with a proper finished product. Which one of you thought that watching Eva prepare and serve a meal was exciting to watch? Did anyone experience spontaneous cinematic orgasms from watching a boiler being installed in a bathroom? I assume you've prepared meals yourselves right? Perhaps you even had the amazing privilege of watching the installation of a boiler and in even more detail! Those are all irrelevant nonsensicalities we get from filmmakers too lazy or incompetent to get down and dirty and create a story worthy of the big screen. Lars von Trier yes that means you too.".

Although all opponents are deeply bad people Chabrol succeeds in giving them things that make them human beings and recognizable characters. Including all supporting and even onelinecharacters. Watch Killmans Bodyguards for example. Watch how Chabrol begins and ends scenes  very unusual. Watch the juxtaposition of Killmans life as a judge and her private life. I won't say much about the film itself as it is good to know nothing about it before. It's a wise film La Piovra in a cinema version and much shorter dealing with a topic that is most important in our western industrial countries  silent corruption.

	schema:reviewBody "L'IVRESSE DU POUVOIR which was oddly retitled as A COMEDY OF POWER for the North American market I saw it under LUST FOR POWER on cable is a very good French flick about corruption in the government and a magistrate's attempts to bring the bad guys to justice. The magistrate is played by the sublime Isabelle Huppert. One could say that the film can viewed as some sort of black comedy about how controlling the corrupting qualities of power is ultimately futile. The film is played straight. There are no big Hollywood moments in it which for many will turn off most viewers. The film can be described as dry. Very dry. There are no mushy sentimental moments. No sex. No violence. Very little swearing. The dramatics are very low key. Heck the music is almost nonexisting. The direction is so minimalistic that it creates a tension of sorts in that I expected the director to shock us with something really bad just waiting to happen at any moment and ready to derail the whole controlled tone of the film.The dialogue is spoken quickly and even though I understand French the subtitles were good in keeping track with the rapid fire exchanges.Aside from the assured direction the main reason to watch L'IVRESSE DU POUVOIR is Isabelle Huppert's laser sharp performance. She's so good and direct not a wasted moment or emotion in her entire performance. It's something to behold. Watching the petite woman with her red gloves and purse corralling all these corrupt folks is unforgettable and it's what remains in your head days after seeing the film. A very satisfying movie that's a nice change from the usually overthetop approach most films take these days.".

The flawed protagonist Huppert lives shamelessly in front of the camera. She is very human as well as idealistic. And her idealism is personal and competitive as well as moralistic. Chabrol has captured grand corruption in a simple narrative about people alone and in conversation. Never slick always homely and familiar. Isabelle Huppert's performance is tempered and unusually restrained. Her aptitude for endowing her characters with mannerism and eccentricity by using simple gestures and facial expressions is in full play here.

Anybody who expects Huppert to turn in even a mediocre performance is seriously stupid and here she is right on top of her game well supported by Francois Berleand who only a couple of years ago played her husband in Les Soeurs fachees and here proves as they used to say in Zenda an opponent worthy of her steel.

The graft money laundering and granting of political favors for which these men were convicted extended into the upper reaches of the government as well so the scandal served a concomitant salutary purpose of finally laying bare that nation's longestablished practice of statesponsored corruption.Comedy of Power is famed director Claude Chabrol's very fictionalized take on the ELF scandal. Yet while most of the names and many of the details have been changed or even fabricated for the movie the themes and concerns are obviously very much in keeping with the spirit of the actual event. The always mesmerizing Isabelle Huppert plays a nononsense judge who is unrelenting in her pursuit of corporate corruption obsessed with bringing the culprits  no matter their position or standing in the community  to justice. Refusing to buckle under to pressure from equally corrupt higherups who believe she is going too far in her investigations Judge Jeanne CharmantKillman zeroes in on her victims refusing to let go until she gets what she wants. Chabrol and Huppert together create a woman of conviction and strength who nevertheless knows her limitations and can even acknowledge what a strain her singleminded determination is placing on her personal life and marriage whether or not she chooses to do anything about it is another matter.It's true that Comedy of Power feels a little underdeveloped at times and the somewhat inconclusive and lackadaisical ending may well leave some in the audience feeling dissatisfied and cheated. For while there is a certain bravery in not succumbing to the need for a pat resolution the movie leaves us wanting to know more about how everything turns out in the end. Yet despite this drawback this is an interesting and at times even gripping little drama that gives us a chance to watch a beautiful dynamic actress in action. It is Huppert's multilayered portrayal of a moral crusader who is also very much a flawed and vulnerable human being that rivets our attention and helps us wade through all the arcane trivia of the corporateworld plotting. Chabrol keeps the film moving at an expeditious pace with a tasty mixture of both humor and suspense thrown in for good measure. But it is in the confrontation scenes between Huppert and her various high profile targets that the film truly engages our attention.In addition to Huppert Chabrol has elicited uniformly sharp performances from Francois Berleand Patrick Bruel Marilyne Canto Robin Renucci and Thomas Chabrol the son of Chabrol and the great actress Stephane Audran. As an ensemble these gifted performers bring the larger issues into focus while keeping us thoroughly engrossed and entertained at the same time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few things are as satisfying to hear as Do you know who I am? when the person saying it is a selfassured business kingpin and the person he's saying it to is a prosecutor who is about to publicly nail the kingpin's hide to the courthouse door. All those swaggering peertopeer dealings  private exchanges of huge amounts of money stock manipulation cheating employees of their retirement funds obscene executive salaries back dating options boardroom favors living the good life on the shareholders' nickel think of a 6000 shower curtain  suddenly have consequences that the company's highpriced legal teams can't rationalize away. In the case of Claude Chabrol's Comedy of Power Ivresse du Pouvoir L' massive corruption reaches to the top of a quasiGovernment corporation. These funds are at the disposal of political leaders. It's only normal and it happens everywhere says one worldly cigar smoking official. The person who plans to pull down this corrupt heap by going after the leaders is Investigating Magistrate Jeanne CharmantKillman. Her nickname is the piranha. Isabelle Huppert plays her with charming relentless amusement. The film gradually moves from the immensely satisfying techniques of senior executive humiliation to our slow involvement with CharmantKillman as a person. All the confidant comfortable aging men in their wellcut suits many with the red thread of the Legion of Honor sewn in their lapels attempt to bluster or flatter or condescend their way out of her office. She delights and so do we in reducing them to selfpitying prison inmates. Jeanne CharmantKillman is a woman with issues but we're all for her even when her relentless drive begins to affect her marriage. Her husband a doctor from a good French family for some reason doesn't appreciate being referred to as Mr. Jeanne Charmant Killman. Those issues may have to do with men in power but there are larger issues too. It's not the image of justice I care about she says at one point to her more flexible superior it's justice. It's not too long before the brakes fail on her car her office is vandalized she has bodyguards and we all learn that the corruption goes higher than simply a company's executive suite. How do things end? Let's just say that sincere outrage is usually boring in a film. With Comedy of Power we have witty disillusionment to be satisfied with and with the hope that this world has more Jeanne CharmantKillmans. Claude Chabrol as the director and Isabelle Huppert as CharmantKillman give us a vastly entertaining black comedy of venality and schadenfreude something that's dark witty assured and not completely cynical. What could be better than that? Well how about nailing all those politicians who earn modest salaries as our elected representatives and then wind up as millionaires shortly after they retire from office. Somebody send for Jeanne Charmant Killman. The DVD transfer is fine. There is an interesting extra which discusses how the movie was made. The idea came from the Elf Aquitaine scandal in France which was uncovered in 1994. The executives of this huge oil firm were caught in the middle of the biggest fraud since WWII. They used the firm as their own piggybank spending huge amounts of the company's money on everything from political kickbacks to expensive mistresses jewelry and villas. French magistrate Eva Joly uncovered the rock and smashed a large number of the scurrying bugs. Chabrol says at the start with tongue in cheek I think that any resemblance to actual events and people is entirely coincidental.".

The film follows a chronicle that we all have heard of before except this time Chabrol thinks he can make magic out of Huppert. The story line best as follows is about a lazy french judge A rotten Isabelle Huppert who tries to bring down the corruption of a very powerful company. This one's a long slow ride down an all too familiar road. One of the films main problems is the talkative dialogue even though it's French there are so many useless scenes of non stop talking that you can go to sleep wake up and you would have missed nothing. While some of the scenes are easy to go along with most of the film is pure familiarity. For Claude Chabrol and Isabelle Huppert however this probably could be named the funnest movie ever made in between them. But unfortunately the viewer is the one that suffers for their fun.".

This could in itself constitute a disappointment for discriminating viewers but a minor work though it is I cannot say I was bored during the film's nearly twohour runningtime.Constituting the seventh collaboration between director Chabrol and his female star Isabelle Huppert since 1978's VIOLETTE NOZIERE the film boasts another fine turn from the formidable French actress as a dreaded Judge dubbed The Piranha investigating a convoluted series of financial transactions involving various international conglomerates. Huppert's first 'victim' is allergyridden businessman Francois Berleand later a celebrity middleman and even a supposed suitor of Huppert's. Her uncompromising stand soon sees her treading on bigleague toes and she is given a couple of promotions and an initially antagonistic female partner to throw her off the scent of the misappropriated funds.Back home Huppert's family life is no bed of roses either her husband is often relegated to the sidelines not just by her allimportant workload but also by his own charismatic livein nephew played by the director's own son Thomas. To top it all off Huppert's offices are broken into she has a traffic accident and is briefly hospitalized Huppert quits her husband who subsequently leaps albeit not fatally out of the window and Huppert's loyal secretary is at the very end of the film discovered to have been the mole all along! While the narrative may seem busy enough from this synopsis the film's talky nature makes its pace a fairly slow one however as I already intimated earlier on Chabrol's unwavering professionalism and consummate elegance and the solid performances on display ensure the viewer's interest in the proceedings despite the possibly unappealing milieu of financial intrigue.".

You never really get warm with Huppert's character firstly because the camera is very distanced and just observes and secondly because of the character itself. She never has the chance to show emotions every sign of it would be considered a weakness and would be exploited by her enemies. This being the way to survive in her job it seriously harms her private life. Her marriage is destroyed by it and friendship is hard to get with many sneaky one's trying to use her.

Her daughter provides moments of comedic relief and there is tension between Catherine and Guy Pearce  should she win the money at any cost allow herself to fall in love what is in the afterlife? This was entertainment based on Houdini a platform to tell a story which I thought was well done.".

It was enjoyable had beautiful cinematography elements of humor a story of love and life...however implausible it may be it does not detract from elegance of watching Catherine Zeta JonesMary McGarvie try to support herself and her daughter matching wits with the great Houdini.Catherine displays a grace and style combined with fire and drive. Her daughter provides moments of comedic relief and there is tension between Catherine and Guy Pearce  should she win the money at any cost allow herself to fall in love what is in the afterlife? This was entertainment based on Houdini a platform to tell a story which I thought was well done.";

	schema:reviewBody "There's nothing death defying about Death Defying Acts. This is a pretty conventional motion picture that doesn't try to do anything new with the genre it's portraying. There's nothing terribly wrong about this but there isn't anything particularly original about the movie either. While it's been pretty maligned in some circles  maybe this is why it never was released in the States and it arrived two years late in Peruvian theatres  it's not a bad movie it's OK I guess but nothing spectacular. This is the hardest type of movie to review  the kind of film that didn't make an impression on me but that isn't that bad either. This will definitely be a short review.The film tells the story of megafamous magician and trickster Harry Houdini Guy Pearce  Memento. He's arrived on Britain as part of one of his tours  he's looking for a magician or psychic that can be able to guess  or see  the last words his mother uttered before dying. You see this is all part of a scientific experiment he wishes to conduct. Something unexpected happens the moment he arrives at Scotland though  he falls in love with psychic Mary McGarvie Catherine ZetaJones whose daughter and apprentice Benji Saoirse Ronan approached to accept his scientific challenge.If that small plot summary sounded simplistic that's because it is. The movie is not particularly ambitious and that's maybe why I was left overwhelmed by it  there's so much to say about a figure as famous and recognizable as Houdini and the film decides to focus on something decidedly dull. The film actually starts with some promise  I liked Ronan's voiceover and it almost seemed as if the film was to focus on something interesting. But then of course I started to discover this was going to be a romance  a very clichd underdeveloped romance at that  and I shuddered.If there's a reason why the film is not bad it's because of some solid performances. Guy Pearce is one of the most underrated actors working today  see his work in the aforementioned Memento if you don't believe me  and although the screenplay doesn't present a particularly threedimensional version of Houdini he makes him believable and humane. Catherine Zeta Jones is pretty good too sporting a credible Scottish accent ! and trying to portray Mary as a sympathetic figure despite the fact that the writers' don't seem to like the character. Timothy Spall  as Houdini's manager  is great as always but the real standout is Saoirse Ronan. Who was also really amazing in Atonement by the way. It's not only that she portrays the most developed interesting and fun character it's also that she brings it to life  Pearce and Zeta Jones' performances are precisely that performances but Ronan seems to be inhabiting her character definitely putting a lot of passion into a project that arguably doesn't deserve that much.Despite the fact that Death Defying Acts is already available on DVD and BluRay in most countries I got to see it in theatres. I can't say I regret having paid for this particularly theatrical viewing experience but I won't enthusiastically recommend the movie either. The screenplay while not terrible is pretty ordinary and the direction is all right. Cinematography is gorgeous though and the score is beautiful. Performances  especially Ronan's  are what save the film from entering the realm of mediocrity but if you really want to watch a magician's flick I'd recommend either the Illusionist or The Prestige.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Death Defying Acts";
	schema:reviewBody "What had drawn me to watch Death Defying Acts is that it's a story with Harry Houdini arguably the greatest illusionist and escape artist of our time. A few days ago I was browsing through a book which revealed the secrets behind his brand of death defying acts and really he's a man of science engineering and most of all a performer to bring to life the act of fooling an audience into believing his stunts. Sure there's an element of danger but with proper risk assessment and safeguards they strip away all the mystique that serves to confound.But contrary to the title there's nothing really death defying about the movie as it treaded on safe ground and doesn't dwell any more on the illusions that it has to. In fact you can count the number of stunts which involve Harry Houdini and the filmmakers left that for another biographical movie that someone else should pick up on. What we have instead are glimpses into the man's personal life and Guy Pearce provided quite an intense and charismatic Houdini with personal demons of his own to do battle with though the story seemed to rein him in from dwelling too much on that aspect and preferred to have a more romantic tale weaved in.The romanticism of the movie is not with his illusions but with a single parent who's a psychic of sorts relying on her street smarts to get her own act going. Catherine ZetaJones plays Mary McGarvie who has to rely on her wits to build credibility for her stage character. Together with daughter and sidekick Benji played by Saoirse Ronan of Atonement fame the mother and daughter team tries hard to make a living from their acts but realize that they're by no means close to Houdini's widespread fame and fortune.However Houdini himself throws a gauntlet to all psychics far and wide that whosoever can accurately reveal what his late mother had last said to him will inherit US10000. His purpose it seems is to reveal that the majority of these soothsayers are tricksters in disguise until of course he meets the luminous Mary and affairs of the heart throws him off course. Naturally Mary and Benji find themselves up against the best in the business but when your back is against the wall there's nothing much to lose it seems.As mentioned earlier this movie's more of a character study of the master magician and explores things like his guilt because of dedication to his craft and performance as well as his questionable motives in being attracted to the fictional Mary McGarvie. Narrated by the character of Benji we see things through a child's eyes and perhaps therein lies the loss of some pathos in the romantic angle of it. On one hand it isn't your classic romantic story while on the other it doesn't seem to want to preach the method rationale and mindset of Houdini himself.So what emerged is a mixed bag. Beautifully shot but again falling on the emptiness of its effort in trying to allow the audience to feel for the characters. At least Timothy Spall who plays Mr Sugarman Houdini's manager allowed for some light moments as the guarded and wary person that he is. And credit goes to keeping the ending quite right too.".

I often find myself asking at the end of the movie  what was the moral of that? What message can I identify with in the real world?This seemed like a delightfully creative little fictionalisation to me. The movie has been represented as creative fantasy so no need to take it too seriously. I didn't mind the title at all. Afterall Houdini's show life was based on Death Defying Acts. But this movie turns out to be a love story with an element of the very spiritualism he was trying to debunk. I couldn't help feel that Houdini always wanted to pay someone that prize money. I suspect deep down he was always hoping he would find that inexplicable connection to the afterlife even though he knew it would be unlikely as he was most qualified in the tricks of that trade.Those rare few individuals that have the wonderful talent to tune into visions or cosmic consciousness or whatever are the first to concede others will call it a delusion and science will always find another explanation. Usually.So street tough and street wise Mary Catherine is focused on the scam of a lifetime. The character is obviously supposed to be a beautiful woman practiced in the art of beguiling men. Catherine pulls it off for me. I find her exquisitely beautiful. Houdini's Guy interest is a little peculiar kinky? perhaps.

Their idol is Harry Houdini Guy Pearce and when they learn Houdini is coming to Edinburgh to 'perform' they discover Houdini is promising 10000 to anyone who can prove they have the ability to look into the future or past. Houdini's manager Sugarman Timothy Spall arranges Houdini's water tank escape acts and other acts of 'magic' and when Mary and Benji arrange to meet Houdini Sugarman is aware they are charlatans. How Mary and Benji work their way into Houdini's belief system and love life with their con game forms the meat of the sparing. The atmosphere of the film is well captured by cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos who understands who to balance the mire of the streets of 1926 Edinburgh with the gorgeous fantasies used during Houdini's escape acts. The musical score by Cezary Skubiszewski is a terrific mixture of Scottish tunes and instruments with solid melodramatic mood music. Pearce ZetaJones Spall and Ronan turn in excellent performances. This is an unjustly overlooked film that while not being a masterpiece serves up a fine story well told. Grady Harp".

Third i haven't watch the illusionist but i have to say this is richer in detail and thus better than the Prestigea film which displays too much magic 'action' but no depth to the characters or the plot at all like an eggshell without the yoke inside...Lastly this is a decent film where everything is wellmade well presented well acting performances exception of Catherine's dramatically 'fake' acting at times and a good score".

While I enjoyed the acting abilities of Catherine Zeta Jones Guy Pierce and especially the young Saoirse Ronan the script was such an affront to the true Houdini that I almost gagged. In fact I spoke up and asked a very uncomfortable question to Gillian Armstrong during the question and answer period. How do you answer to the legacy of who Harry Houdini really was  a skeptic who spent his life energy successfully debunking anyone offering supernatural claims... inspiring such people as the great James Randi who like Harry offered large sums of money to anyone who could prove under scientific conditions the existence of supernatural phenomena. To this date the money has not been claimed... Harry championed the rational scientific approach to studying phenomena. How do you justify the blatant spirituality shown in your movie? The answer was vague. Ms. Armstrong pointed out that if Harry was such a skeptic why was he so obsessed with the afterlife. Moreover at the end of the film there is a title card that describes the sances that have tried to contact Harry after his death all with no success. Okay. Right. People are going to remember a few lines of text and NOT the angels swimming through the water the visions of Harry's dead mother as he hung upside down in the Chinese Water Torture tank... the lights going out as little Benji writhed on the floor speaking perfect fluent German the psychic connection Mary had to Harry the moment he died incidentally Harry died at Detroit's Grace Hospital of peritonitis from a ruptured appendix at 126 p.m. on October 31  Halloween  in Room 401 1926 at the age of 52! Does Guy Pierce look 52 to you?. Ms. Armstong even did an informal poll of the audience  she asked How many people here think that Benji was really channeling Harry's mother? To which about half the audience raised their hands. Yikes. Do these people also believe in the tooth fairy? Yes this is a Hollywood fantasy. However it treats Harry as an unfaithful visionseeing pseudo psychic. It is an affront to everything Harry stood for. As a piece of fiction it is enjoyable. If you can stomach its historical desecrations you will enjoy wonderful acting and great cinematography. If you know anything about who Houdini was or value what he stood for you will be frustrated by this blatant attempt to make our world even more demonhaunted than it already is.".

One must be warned that this film is fictional and thus Pearce's Houdini does not bear much resemblance to the real one. This one lacks the enigma that made the real Houdini so fascinating. Nor does 'Death Defying Acts' stay true to the historical facts. The focus is much more on the psychic aspects which wasn't that well explored either. The romance between Houdini and Mary is a little repetitive as it moves back and forth between trust and mistrust and then it becomes confusing. There was something lacking. On the plus side Timothy Spall Saoirse Ronan and Catherine ZetaJones perform well. The sensual ZetaJones does part of a scintillating dance as well. Guy Pearce performs good sometimes but he looks confused in many other scenes. The visuals and cinematography are stunning. The background score is whimsical and pleasing. Overall it is an average movie that could have been better. One ought not to watch 'Death Defying Acts' as a true account but rather try to enjoy it as a work of fiction.".

Pearce works hard as Houdini but never gets to grasp the tormented angle of the man while Jones is miscast and not even her pretty face can light up a dull performance. Ronan is sprightly enough and Spall shows some emotive verve as Houdini's concerned manager. The moments of trickery perk things up a bit but even then the makers think it's wise to debunk the mysticism. The romanticism of the era and that of Houdini's place in it is well crafted onto the screen but the flatness and confused thematic threads elsewhere leave this well below average. 410".

And Catherine Zeta Jones in the lead female role does a surprisingly great job in spite of being Welsh. Unfortunately Guy Pierce manages to make one of the most intriguing figures of his team seem boring with his shallow performance Timothy Spall playing Houdini's manager seems surprisingly illatease in a role you might have thought he was made for and struggles throughout with his accent while role of the conwoman's daughter is written as wholesome where a little malevolence might have spiced up the plot. In fact this character provides a narration that seems wholly unnecessary. except to cover up the paucity of actual happenings and pad out the film. The story has notes of whimsy the con artist in spite of being a successful public entertainer lives in a bizarrely Arcadian graveyard but is never quite fanciful enough to work as fantasy as a realist story it's duller than it's premise suggests.".

And Catherine Zeta Jones in the lead female role does a surprisingly great job in spite of being Welsh. Unfortunately Guy Pierce manages to make one of the most intriguing figures of his team seem boring with his shallow performance Timothy Spall playing Houdini's manager seems surprisingly illatease in a role you might have thought he was made for and struggles throughout with his accent while role of the conwoman's daughter is written as wholesome where a little malevolence might have spiced up the plot. In fact this character provides a narration that seems wholly unnecessary. except to cover up the paucity of actual happenings and pad out the film. The story has notes of whimsy the con artist in spite of being a successful public entertainer lives in a bizarrely Arcadian graveyard but is never quite fanciful enough to work as fantasy as a realist story it's duller than it's premise suggests.";

	schema:reviewBody "I am still wondering why this movie was made. It tells the fictional story of Mary a single mother Catherine Zeta Jones who struggles to make a living as a psychic in a cabaret using her good looks artful deceit and pickpocketing skills more than actual psychic powers to entertain the working class crowds. She is assisted by her daughter Benji Saoirse Ronan from 'Atonement' whose main purpose seems to be to bombard us with the most redundant and annoying narration I've experienced. Mary and Benji make it a point to meet the great Houdini played by Guy Pearce so good in Memento and gain financially from the encounter. Of course what begins as deceit turns into true love. Never mind the wife at home and the fact that Mary lives in a grave yard. This a misguided effort from Gillian Armstrong an uneven director whose best films My Brilliant Career High Tide and Hard to Handle were too long ago to redeem her reputation after'Charlotte Grey'. She is not aided by the script which is actually worse than Brothers of the Head Tony Grisoni and the Interpreter Brian Ward who cowrote. Magicianillusionist stories are notoriously difficult to make interesting and Death Defying Acts is no exception.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a travesty ! Houdini's character and life is already fascinating enough Why bother to fictionalise to such an extent with unconvincing characters and an unbelievable story ? Wrapping this poorly told and flimsy fabrication in a narration that belonged more in a Disney or Hallmark product than a film by a much  awarded and deservedly acclaimed director didn't help much either. Zeta  Jones and Ronan were unconvincing and severely lacking in chemistry as a mum and daughter. Pearce was excellent but there was a woeful lack of conviction in his relationship with both Zeta Jones and Ronan. Why would Houdini get involved with such an obvious con  artist partnership when he dedicated so much of his life to exposing fake mediums and psychics. The film also did great disservice to Houdini himself by showing that he deceived his audiences as willingly as the shysters he exposed. I saw this film last night at its Brisbane premiere and was frankly staggered by the extravagant compliments paid to it's director and the film itself by both her interviewer and audience members during the question and answer session following the screening. It's good to be polite but a little criticism wouldn't have gone astray even in the director's presence. One brave soul did hazard to ask why fictionalise to such an extent and Gillian Armstrong replied that her film was more about the eternal truth of love than the great illusionist himself. She also seemed very eager to point out that she wasn't responsible for the script or the storyline. Compared to the 1953 film Houdini starring Tony Curtis Death Defying Acts showed very little evidence of progress in over 50 years of commercial film making and certainly wasn't worthy of either it's leading man Guy Pearce or director Gillian Armstrong.".

	schema:reviewBody "Someone on this board wrote that this is the weakest of the Magician movies meaning the Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale entries. I would agree except that this isn't a magician movie.This fictional story draws on grains of truth. Houdini was after psychics and spiritualists and exposing them as fakes. Here he offers 10000 to any psychic who can tell him the last words his mother spoke to him on her deathbed. I'm not sure he did this in real life. I know when he died he promised to come back and give his wife a message. It's controversial whether or not he did. Allegedly psychic Arthur Ford revealed the code that the Houdinis agreed upon to Mrs. Houdini in 1929 but later she denied this. There is a film during which the Catholic church pressures her to say it didn't happen.While performing in England and extending his challenge in the 1920s Houdini Guy Pearce meets a fake psychic Mary McGarvie Catherine ZetaJones and her daughter Benji Saoirse Ronan. Mary and Benji live by their wits and Mary thinks she can somehow suss this out by breaking into Houdini's hotel room and researching the mother.Houdini is taken in by Mary's beauty and despite herself she's taken with him. They fall in love.This is a romance though we see Houdini do a few tricks. It's nothing like The Prestige and The Illusionist. Ever since Tony Curtis played Houdini we've been seeing Houdini played by hunks in glossy versions including Paul Michael Glaser and Jonathan Schaech. Houdini was no looker and he was short. Guy Pearce has to play Houdini as a person instead of just as a performer and he does a good job. He plays the role as a tough plainspeaking charismatic man and a loving man at heart.Catherine ZetaJones is stunning whether on stage as an exotic psychic in the clothes of someone with no money or in expensive outfits. She shows us a Mary who is tough determined and fearless. My favorite scene was in Houdini's hotel when she glides in wearing a gorgeous coat which she took from a costume rack and heads for the elevator as if she owns the place. The man at the desk takes one look at her worn shoes and knows she's a fake and hotel employees start chasing her. Great scene that shows her cleverness.I actually found the last scenes very moving and found the daughter's denial of her gifts interesting.The photography is beautiful.Though this isn't a great film it's an absorbing one. The details at the end as Houdini meets his public are true but some license was taken to make it more dramatic. I can definitely recommend it as a rental.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gazpacho with Spaghetti Western coproduced between Spain and Italy  though this time with production mostly Spanish and plenty of violence  crossfire and elements of Greek tragedy . A Confederation corporal named John Warner George Hilton deserts his unit at the night before a major battle during American Civil War 18611865  after receiving an important message from Sandoval's son . John along with other rebels Albert De Mendoza Antonio Pica escape  later on  unites to bunch a motley band of characters Jose Luis Martin  Leo Anchoriz  Gustavo Rojo . Meanwhile John heads across the border to Mexico to marry his pregnant girlfriend before she gives birth . Her father named Pedro Sandoval the recently deceased Ernest Borgnine had forbidden their marriage but the corporal is determined to marry her . Circumstances change when John Warner learns a surprise and he becomes into an outlaw who vows vendetta on everyone involved in his misfortune .Director Julio Buchs achieved in A bullet for Sandoval possibly his best work of a modest career  with some memorable scenes and good camera movement as the initial prologue and first part in which we see the deathstricken the main star furthermore the ending duel in Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid style and that makes only can say that this movie seemed to be a true surprise . The story is wrapped in an aura of sadness  a tragic event on the metamorphosis of Warner  a good man turned into a crazed psychopath . Worthwhile watching for a demonstration of the deep hating among two protagonists . It will lead a tragic ending  which is underlined by the idea of fatality the inability to change his own fate . It's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the main star Hilton and the enemy Ernest Borgnine and his hoodlums . Uruguayborn George Hilton is fine as the hero  villain of this thrilling story . Hilton is fine he ravages the screen he jumps shoots  bounds and leaps hit and run  and finally kills . His performance is astonishing  above average to level of these films . George Hilton as the suffering and avenger gunslinger  in possibly her most important role that was able to defend in a Spaghetti . During this process  the protagonist John results to be a character initially positive  but he will degenerate to become a bloody and despicable gunman without feelings and inability to love . While Ernest Borgnine in a topnotch performance  is a rich  arrogant overbearing and vindictive Mexican rancher unable to admit the affair between his daughter and a miserable foreman who has dishonored him and he will be victim of its own code of honor . Alberto De Mendoza is the tough but likable outlaw partner and although he doesn't reaches the level of Hilton  is also quite restrained  with some looks that say it all . Many other familiar faces from ChorizoSpaghetti  there appears ordinary secondaries in SpanishItalian Western such as Jose Luis Martin as a nasty rapist  Leo Anchoriz as a Friar Tuckalike  Manuel De Blas  Luis Barboo  Lorenzo Robledo  George Rigaud  Alfonso Rojas  Dan Van Husen  Tito Garcia and several others. A special mention I want to highlight is the soundtrack of the film Gianni Ferrio creates melodies that manage to finish to give the story a point even more dramatic and disturbing making the images gain strength with the chords  a highlevel work similarly the great composers of the genre . Acceptable photography by Francisco Sempere  though being necessary a right remastering  filmed on location in Las Rozas  Madrid  Lucainena de Las Torres Andalucia and of course  Almeria . The movie was produced by Atlantida FilmsJose Frade productions that financed several Western during the 60s and early 70s such as Cuatreros  Mestizo  Challenge of McKenna  The mercenary  Los Compaeros twenty dollars for seven and Saddle tramps  among others. The motion picture was pretty well directed by Julio Buchs who also wrote the script along with Federico De Urrutia  sometimes it is falsely claimed the movie was codirected by Lucio Fulci but this is not true actor George Hilton has stated so in many interviews . Julio Buchs was an expert on thriller as he proved in Salario De Crimen Alta tension and Trumpets of Apocalypse and Spaghetti such as Los Desesperados I'll kill him and return alone also titled El Hombre Mat Billy Kid and Mestizo or Django does not forgive . Along with A bullet for Sandoval the Buchs's best film was Encrucijada Una Monja with Rosanna Schiaffino playing a similar character to Audrey Hepburn's The nun's story  both of them were well directed by Julio until his early death at 46 years old .".

Despite a starring role for Ernest Borgnine this wasn't enough to elevate this movie to anything other than a timepasser for those obsessed with the genre.The film begins with an idiot being told his girlfriend is about to give birth to his baby. Despite this being during the Civil War and the man being in the Confederate army he just runs awayand so it's hard to really empathize with the guy even though he wants to return and marry the lady and do the right thing. When he arrives however he finds that his girlfriend is dead! And her father threatens to kill him unless he leaves and takes the baby with him! He and his partners leave and try to find lodging and food but because a Cholera outbreak has occurred folks are very unfriendly and refuse help. The baby soon gets sick and dies and the man vows to make the towns and the baby's grandfather pay. Now this was actually a pretty good idea for a film despite the whole AWOL angle. However the man and his friends went far beyond exacting revengethe gang grew and they terrorized EVERYONE. Because of this you really had no empathy for him or his nihilistic cause. On the other hand the father Borgnine wasn't exactly likable...and in fact NO ONE in the film was the least bit likable or multidimensional. They were all either scum or victims! Because of this and the film's not taking advantage of a decent plot idea I found myself happy when the whole thing ended and on a very very downbeat note.".

	schema:headline " A Bullet for Sandoval";
	schema:reviewBody "George Hilton has a big role in this spaghetti western where he portrays an embittered Confederate deserter whose infant child dies of cholera and starvation due to the apathy of others who deny him milk for the baby. In retaliation all those who he blames for the death of his child especially one Don Pedro..portrayed by a unsympathetic Ernest Borgnine who hates Hilton's John Warner so much he denounces his own daughter's existence because she fell in love with him a wealthy man who practically owns the village of Los Cadres the place where the cholera broke out whose disease has created a widespread panic plaguing the surrounding areas. Evolving into a remorseless outlaw with a growing pack of cutthroats and dangerous gunmen joining him Warner sets his sights on destroying Don Pedro Sandoval in every way possible blaming him for the death of his child.I think the major mistake of A Bullet for Sandoval is establishing effectively I thought Hilton's Warner as a legitimate tragic hero only to transform him into a murderous thug. I never personally thought Hilton was as good as some loathsome killer gathering a brood of gunfighters as he was a mistreated soldier stripped of any form of dignity due to leaving his regimen before their battle against a major Yankee outfit because he took off with Don Pedro's son who had informed him of his beloved's sickness and the child he never knew he had. Seeing a pitiful Warner in a hopeless quest to find a sympathetic figure to provide him with milk for his baby really tugged on my heartstrings and I certainly found his situation devastating. Then the film after the baby's death strips him of his humanity and he becomes some outlaw collecting his own personal army..I never bought Hilton as an effective heavy and believe in switching his personality costs the film some major dramatic punch. Borgnine while attempts at showing a remorse for losing his daughter while at the same time hating her for the love affair with Warner never earned an ounce of empathy from me and I imagine others will have just as hard a time caring about his fate. If anything the film removes anyone to care about. That is a mistake in my mind that the film never recovers from. Almost every time he's on screen Don Pedro is berating someone loudly barking at others for allowing Warner to roam free failing to accept his responsibility for what transpires.As you expect the movie prepares you for the eventual showdown between Warner and Sandoval. It's really about waiting and fate. How long will Warner and those he associates himself with last as a unit? When Sandoval and other ranchers plea with the Confederacy for manfirepower will Warner be able to successfully avoid a court martial or certain death? Can Warner and those men not killed by the soldiers attempting to flee a setup after one of their own betrays them survive in Mexico? Will they attempt to reenter America? You just know that Warner and Sandoval will meet face to face to settle their differences. The major bugaboo that bothered me was the reason Sandoval hated Warner so much to begin with. There's mention that Sandoval thought Warner was only interested in his wealth and ranch but to hate him with such guile the film doesn't seemed too worried to address this very important question with great detail.There are some action scenes but most of them lack vigor and punch. And there are several buildups to staredown gunfights which never reach the level expected for this genre. There's lots of potential for A Bullet for Sandoval but for some reason directorwriter Julio Buchs doesn't wish to stage full scale shootouts which is a standard for any great spaghetti western. There's also enough story here to build from if Buchs had stay the course. Too bad.".

Without the resources to take care of the child it dies and soon the soldier sets out for revenge. This film has a great revenge story going for it but by the time it ended I was pretty mad at the movie because it could have been so much better. The film has several subplots and none of them are as interesting as the revenge story so these subplots get in the way and in the end they really pull the film back some. The film's main story is still good enough to make this worth watching as it features some great action sequences as well as two good performances by the leads. Hilton is very good in his mainly silent role and Borgnine delivers a maniac style performance. The ending is very strange and bizarre but it works well with the film even though the revenge takes a few different turns.".

Rosa dies giving birth to there child a boy who dies due to Sandoval's rage and jealousy and as well as the towns people's lack of help due the child being from a town having cholera. This last act makes warner turn outlaw punishing everyone who did not help. It is a great little story of revenge and hate that makes one of Hilton's best spaghetti roles ever. The ending is one of my favorites. A real comparison to the ending of The Wild Bunch. The music was good and the acting and character profiles of the Warner gang was fabulous.".

Her father Don Sandoval a Mexican lord despises Warner and blames him for his daughter's death.Well Rosa died not necessarily because of childbirth but probably from cholera. Don Sandoval is played by American actor Ernest Borgnine. So you have a Hispanic playing an American and an American playing a Mexican. But wait there's more. Warner reaches Don Sandoval's home comes in sees Sandoval and is about to leave when Rosa's brother begs his father to let Warner see his infant son. So Sandoval tells Warner to take the baby and leave. Warner hides out with the infant and tries to get some milk for the baby while visiting a town but the townspeople turn him away. Eventually we don't know whether the baby died of starvation or from cholera. But Warner swears that he'll get revenge for his son's death. So for the rest of the movie you see Warner and Sandoval plotting revenge against each other. But in the end Warner's involved in a bloody shootout and let's just say that Sandoval never got his.".

Both men are gearing up for a confrontation that they cannot avoid as both of them have lost their souls...We all like Ernest Borgnine right? You can't go wrong with him here as a stubborn but honourable man consumed by grief. George Hilton too does a nice turn as the loved up soldier turned blankeyed killer and it's the fact that both characters have more depth that carries the film.

	schema:reviewBody "I was in the GoetheInstitut when I accidentally stumbled across this film. I went to IMDb and found good references about the film and its director and as an added attraction it featured Maria Schell in the main role. And the story seemed interesting.A German nurse Helga Maria Schell is kidnapped by Yugoslavian partisans. Their doctor has died and they need another one. Helga has medical training so she's forced to go with them. At first she goes with them unwillingly. She doesn't like them and they don't like her. As the time goes by she begins to see them as they really are not anymore as bandits but as human beings that need her help. And while they are going through mountains and crossing rivers a new understanding of the people and the land dawn on her. Sometimes they are attacked by German forces. And Helga begins to suspect that maybe things are not so simple as she once thought. She's doesn't know anymore where she belongs.This subject could have easily led to a maudlin or preachy film but Die Letzte Brcke avoids these traps. Die Letzte Brcke manages to convey emotion through a skillful use of images and words  closeups on Maria Schell's face on other faces the mountains the rivers the bridges. When partisan commandant Boro Bernhard Wicki and Helga are passing by a cemetery he says to Helga Here are buried the German soldiers and then with a wide gesture showing the landscape mountains and all he says and there are buried our people my people our land. As you see images and words work together the emotion conveyed by them is deep but the film is not at all melodramatic.Die Letzte Brcke is a refreshing change from the Hollywood diet that we are forced to swallow. The world war 2 movies made in Hollywood are usually simplistic and shallow. This film will raise many questions for those are still able to think. And Maria Schell's acting is simply superb. Highly recommended!P.S.  Some Germans of the older generation thought that Italy's armistice with the Allies was a betrayal. An Italian character that appears in the beginning of the film is shown in an unsympathetic light. A little later on when the Italians are celebrating the armistice a German officer comments bitterly on the opportunism of the Italians. Was this character expressing Helmut Kutner's opinion? I don't know. Anyway as most people on seeing the film won't probably even notice the things I'm talking about this is not so important. More food for thought!".

	onyx:emotionText "I was in the GoetheInstitut when I accidentally stumbled across this film. I went to IMDb and found good references about the film and its director and as an added attraction it featured Maria Schell in the main role. And the story seemed interesting.A German nurse Helga Maria Schell is kidnapped by Yugoslavian partisans. Their doctor has died and they need another one. Helga has medical training so she's forced to go with them. At first she goes with them unwillingly. She doesn't like them and they don't like her. As the time goes by she begins to see them as they really are not anymore as bandits but as human beings that need her help. And while they are going through mountains and crossing rivers a new understanding of the people and the land dawn on her. Sometimes they are attacked by German forces. And Helga begins to suspect that maybe things are not so simple as she once thought. She's doesn't know anymore where she belongs.This subject could have easily led to a maudlin or preachy film but Die Letzte Brcke avoids these traps. Die Letzte Brcke manages to convey emotion through a skillful use of images and words  closeups on Maria Schell's face on other faces the mountains the rivers the bridges. When partisan commandant Boro Bernhard Wicki and Helga are passing by a cemetery he says to Helga Here are buried the German soldiers and then with a wide gesture showing the landscape mountains and all he says and there are buried our people my people our land. As you see images and words work together the emotion conveyed by them is deep but the film is not at all melodramatic.Die Letzte Brcke is a refreshing change from the Hollywood diet that we are forced to swallow.

	schema:headline " Maria Schell is astounding in this heartwrenching Kautner classic.";
	schema:reviewBody "'Die letzte Brucke' is the second movie that I have been fortunate enough to view from the canon of German maestro Helmut Kautner. 'Des Teufels General' is a hugely admirable and evocative piece of work featuring a commanding central performance from Curd Jurgens but in my opinion 'Die letzte Brucke' stands above even that. It displays a special mark of inspired brilliance that confirms to me Kautner's position as one of the preeminent directors in the history of German cinema.Maria Schell in one of her breakthrough leading roles is quite unforgettable as Helga. Adding an effective touch her shifting emotions throughout the movie are conveyed by closeups of Schell's face. Helga is a doctor but volunteers as a nurse in wartorn 1943 Yugoslavia because of shortages. She is carefree and being romantically pursued by a young German soldier named Martin. She certainly appears a little naive about the nature of the Nazi war machine. Her untroubled existence is suddenly shattered apart when she is kidnapped by Partisans and forced to provide the ragtag bunch with medical care.'Die letzte Brucke' is in essence a fish out of water tale and a movie about one woman's journey of selfdiscovery amidst the horrors and inevitable tangled loyalties of wartime. Helga indeed gradually finds herself softening in her opinion of her captors who fight as guerrillas to defend their ancestral homeland. Helga gains an everdeeper understanding of the people the land and their history and in this cultural aspect the movie is evocative and admirably observational. The influence of Italian neorealism is evident throughout. The movie was filmed in and around Mostar with a Yugoslav supporting cast and there is a sparing but hauntingly effective use of traditional folk songs that certainly add to the local flavour. As the Partisan leader Boro extends his palm out over the landscape we appreciate in some way the deep affinity these people have with their land and why the will to resist Fascism burns so brightly in their hearts. Kautner makes full use of the landscape and succeeds in creating a palpable undercurrent of lurking hidden danger. The challenging terrain the mountains the river and the last bridge of the title are utilised simply but compellingly to create an atmosphere fraught with fear uncertainty and menace.'Die letzte Brucke' stands as a stirring and moving triumph and a fitting tribute to the irrepressible beauty of humanity. It is a timeless ode to a woman's selflessness and inherent integrity in the face of great personal and exterior conflict. 'Die letzte Brucke' was in a way Kautner's comeback movie after a string of financial flops 'Der Apfel ist ab' 'Konigskinder' 'Weisse Schatten' 'Kapt'n BayBay' and it is a fitting movie with which to return to success. Maria Schell received special mention at Cannes for her extraordinary performance and Helmut Kautner was recognised with the German Film Award for best direction. 'Die letzte Brucke' is a movie I shall treasure in my collection. It is one of the great war movies and is in that august company thanks to skillful directorial utilisation of the surroundings and the haunting compassion of Maria Schell's Helga.  As a footnote it is interesting to consider that Bernhard Wicki who does a good job portraying the gruff Partisan leader Boro would go on to direct the acclaimed 1959 antiwar movie 'Die Brucke'.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die letzte Brcke or The Last Bridge is an Austrian Germanlanguage movie from 1954 the year Germany became football world champion. But that's just a side information to depict how long it's been since this was made namely over 60 years. It is unsurprisingly still in blackandwhite and was directed by Helmut Kutner also one of the writers credited with this film. And just like so many other films from that time it deals with the events from Nazi Germany and World War II. This one here was actually made when these events weren't a thing of the past yet for 10 years even. But sadly this proximity in terms of time is not enough to make it a good watch. The film runs for approximately 100 minutes and stars Maria Schell as the main character. Her male colead Bernhard Wicki is also known to German cinephiles today. Kutner Schell and Wicki received lots of awards recognition at the Cannes Film Festival and the German Film Awards. But I cannot share the praise. Inmy opinion it is a very forgettable outcome and I cannot see why people loved it so much back in the day. Maybe it just hasn't aged too well. Overall I cannot see any redeemable factors that make a difference compared to other Germanlanguage films from that time that revolved around the same subject. I do not recommend the watch.".

	schema:headline " Neither Better Nor Worse";
	schema:reviewBody "Dirty director Chris Fisher's cynical police corruption melodrama Street Kings 2 Motor City shares some narrative threads with its superior theatrical predecessordirector David Ayer's Street Kings. Meaning this straighttovideo potboiler qualifies as an innameonly sequel. None of the main characters reprise their roles. The setting has been shifted from Los Angeles to Detroit. Grizzly Mountain scenarist Jeremy Haft and freshman scribe Ed Gonzalez rely on Fritz Lang's 1953 crime thriller The Big Heat for the revenge part of their plot. Ray Liotta's presence as treacherous narcotics detective Marty Kingston and the majestic urban setting of Detroit are the only two things that distinguish the predictable often unsavory Street Kings 2. Aside from Liotta and Shawn Hatosy the cast makes little impression and the hardboiled dialogue is forgettable. Nobody says anything worth quoting. The shootouts generate neither suspense nor excitement. Fisher and his writers blow the killer's identity about 30 minutes into this halfbaked whodunit and murderer's identity is no revelation. Spotting the killer is rather easy since the filmmakers provide red herrings so obvious that you know they are distractions.This formulaic murdermystery opens three years before a Detroit cop killing spree. Metro Narcs swap lead with angry drug dealers after they blow their cover. Marty Kingston Ray Liotta of Goodfellas shoots a cokedup thug. Marty's slugs don't stop Mikey Tim Holmes of Asian Task Force who disarms him and then shoots Marty in the right thigh before backup arrives to blast Mikey. Marty and his crew confiscate 3 million dollars. This brief prologue serves to introduce most of the primary characters namely the narcs. The contemporary story begins thereafter with the homicide of undercover narc Sal Quintana Scott Norman of The Art of Power who Internal Affairs has had under close scrutiny for accepting bribes from strip clubs. After a drunken Quintana exits a strip joint a hooded assailant in another car pulls up shoots him in the neck and later rams him with his car shooting him two more times. We're told that Quintana was Marty's partner in narcotics for eight years. A pesky Internal Affairs cop approaches Marty after Quintana's funeral and asks him if Quintana was on the take. Marty defends Quintana as a good cop. Afterward Detective Tyrone Fowler Clifton Powell of Norbit and Detective Rogen Kevin Chapman of Unstoppable approach Marty and Fowler utters a snide comment about Marty's new friend a reference to the Internal Affairs sergeant. Rookie detective Dan Sullivan Shawn Hatosy of Public Enemies is assigned to the case. He wants nothing to do with Marty but he is forced to work with him. Sullivan's back story is that an unknown assailant murdered his policeman father at a simple traffic stop. Eventually Sullivan and Marty come to tolerate each other. Later Sullivan questions Fowler and Rogen but gets nothing out of them. At a secret rendezvous Fowler rants at Marty about Sullivan. Marty approaches Sullivan about Fowler. It seems that Sullivan had discovered Fowler's connection with Quintana from Quintana's own landlady at the Lap of Luxury Apartments. Fowler and Quintana were friendly enough for Fowler to bounce a check for his rent. Anyhow Marty learns to his surprise that Internal Affairs is poised to question them. Suddenly Fowler dies outside a massage parlor after shooting it out with a hooded character inside. Later Rogen breaks his neck at a wharf while fighting an assailant. Sullivan tells Marty. Got three dead cops. All killed before they talked to I.A. Something bigger going on here.Police chief Captain Walker Linda Boston of Stone wants the murderer apprehended at any cost. As far as she is concerned all criminals can run free until the police arrest the cop killer. The authorities snag something of a break in the third narc's murder. Rogen dies as he is wrestling with the killer within the view of a surveillance camera. Naturally the killer is bundled into a hoodie so his features don't stand out prominently enough for identification purposes. Haft and Gonzalez let the cat out of the bag early when the villain takes down another corrupt cop. As it turns out our heroic villain used his share of 'dirty' money to pay for his wife's cancer treatments. Had Marty not taken his loved one to Mexico she would have died. Marty comes clean to Dan after he learns that Dan has found out about his wife's hospital visit in Mexico. This is the moment in act II and the first in act III. Ironically Dan is about to relent until contrived plotting breaks and enters. Street Kings 2 Motor City gets a lot of visual mileage out of Detroit as a setting. The change of scenery from the usual Los Angeles or New York City locales imparts a spontaneity but nothing is refreshing about its conventional unimaginative plot. Sadly Fisher doesn't stage any complicated shootouts. He keeps everything pretty basic. Not surprisingly this lackluster law  order saga takes itself very seriously with only a modicum of humor. Ray Liotta dons a McGruff CrimeDog costume for an amusing scene at his son Casey's Detroit school. We catch him for a moment in church on his knees where he should be spending a lot of time. Marty believes that family comes first. Marty is a paranoid personality. Moreover he believes that the ends justify the means. Once a threat emerges he responds with shortsighted fervor. What Fisher cannot capture with stunning action setpieces he tries to compensate with using suspense and atmosphere. Thematically he explores the morally murky terrain that the meninblue patrol and makes it a convincingly dangerous looking landscape. Marty and Dan amount to twodimensional characters with everybody else just blending into the scenery. Believe me Street Kings 2 Motor City is no better or worse than past standardissue cop versus cop movies. The unrated version of this copkiller epic boasts brief nudity some violence and bloodshed suspenseful situations and profanity.".

	schema:reviewBody "'STREET KINGS 2 MOTOR CITY' Three Stars Out of Five Sequel to the 2008 dirty cop film 'STREET KINGS' which was directed by David Ayer who wrote the similar themed films 'TRAINING DAY' 'DARK BLUE' and 'HARSH TIMES'. This one is directed by Chris Fisher who also directed the crooked cop film 'DIRTY' and another direct to video loose sequel 'S. DARKO' and it's written by Ed Gonzalez and Jeremy Haft. It stars Ray Liotta and Shawn Hatosy and the only returning cast member from the original is Clifton Powell as Sergeant Greene. The film once again deals with police corruption and an investigation into multiple police murders. It's set in Detroit rather than L.A. and is really just a sequel in name only. As far as direct to video sequels go of this nature it's surprisingly entertaining and at least somewhat well made.Ray Liotta plays veteran police detective Marty Kingston and Shawn Hatosy plays rookie detective Dan Sullivan. When Marty's partner is murdered he's put on assignment to head up the investigation with Sullivan. A series of clues lead to the possibility that the murder was an inside job and a police detective is the culprit. Dan is expecting a child with his young wife and he soon finds his family in danger as well as his faith in the job.The movie is pretty routine and predictable and there's definitely no big surprises. There's of course nothing groundbreaking or too memorable about the film but it is well made none the less. Hatosy and Liotta are good like always and their characters are relatable and mostly believable. The action scenes are decent and somewhat thrilling and if you like the genre you'll definitely be interested and involved in how it all works out. Nothing great or outstanding but it is an enjoyable and well made cop thriller all the same.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vYUO9yN8WE".

You're asking for to much. If I saw this in the 5 box at Walmart I'd buy it. If you like Southland The Shield Law and Order or other cop shows check this out it's worth the watch.And stop comparing it to the Keanu Reeves version. It wasn't supposed to be a conclusion or part of trilogy it was just the same name in a different city. I wish people would criticize crap like Fast and Furious 5 for being predictable or having the same name but nope...Check this out it's a good flick.".

Great great shots of the city from a wide array of angles including from across the river in Windsor. Just superb. If you've ever lived in Detroit or even just visited then you'll see what I mean especially compared to the mid70's when I lived there. And even if you've never been there what a pleasant treat to watch an action cop flick that wasn't filmed in the same ol same ol NY Chicago or L.A.The score was excellent as well and really set the mood. The acting was solid and Ray Liotta fans won't be disappointed.If you've got HD and a decent sound system allow yourself to sit back and be mesmerized and never mind the hackneyed plot and predictable storyline.If you're more into witty dialog memorable oneliners suspense surprise twists and all that then by all means take a pass.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cop thrillers are a dimeanddozen probably because it doesn't cost too much to make one and the fact that we can't help but be intrigued by our meninblue. The latter is probably also the reason why most cop thrillers inevitably revolve around the theme of corruption since the very nature of dirty cops goes against our very intuition of the kind of people we want enforcing law and order on our streets.David Ayer's 'Street Kings' was no different it packed the grittiness that has become a prerequisite for the modernday cop thriller and it had a compelling plot courtesy of star writers James Ellroy L.A. Confidential and Kurt Wimmer Law Abiding Citizen Salt. This direct tovideo inname only sequel however tries very hard to be gritty but the lack of a gripping plot written by newbies Ed Gonzalez and Jeremy Haft means that it comes apart pretty quickly.Once again this sequel pairs a cleancut rookie Keanu Reeves in the former Shawn Hatosy in this movie with a veteran cop Forest Whitaker in the former Ray Liotta in this movie with the veteran teaching the rookie the ways by which cops on the beat go about their business even if it means taking a little on the side or turning a blind eye. Here Hatosy's rookie is a certain Dan Sullivan who is assigned to work with Liotta's Marty Kingston after a Narcotics cop is gunned down in cold blood.The case intensifies after two other cops both Narcotics officers and former partners of Kingston also turn up dead. If you're guessing if the killer is a cop or a thug don't bother Gonzalez and Haft seem to have so little confidence in their story that they reveal who the killer is just half an hour into the movie. Of course it really isn't much of a surprise too but the revelation still deflates much of the suspense that should accompany a movie like this.Indeed once we know the killer's identity it's only a matter of time before Sullivan puts the pieces together and tracks him down. Director Chris Fisher tries to make this about the dilemma Sullivan faces taking down one of his own but the attempt at injecting complexity into the mostly perfunctory proceedings is hardly engaging enough. And since the characters aren't fleshed out properly even the ending which retains the original's irony comes across limp and uninspired.The performances here are mostly just mediocre Liotta has been in so many such genre stuff that he seems content to just sleepwalk through the role while Hatosy is passable as the rookie forced to learn the ropes the tough way. And besides them the rest of the supporting cast including Clifton Powell and Kevin Chapman as Kingston's former partners are mostly wasted.While 'Street Kings' was a sufficiently gripping cop thriller this sequel is no more than a runofthemill addition to the genre that will quickly be forgotten after all you will probably get the same and more in an episode of 'Law and Order' or 'The Shield' on TV. Even with lowered expectations for directtovideo sequels this is still a disappointing attempt at trying to replicate the success of its modestly successful predecessor.www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:reviewBody "While I am normally not a fan of bizarre movies I found this one fascinating. I saw it with the director present  so a few things were explained that would otherwise not be obvious. It is the story of a family who live in a house close to a yettobefinished highway  very close like right at the guardrail. There is absolutely nothing else in the area. It is not clear whether they own the house or are squatters. They have incorporated the highway into their daily lives e.g. the son rides his bike back and forth and there is an easy chair out there where they can relax. The authorities decide to complete the highway  and their lives change that's putting it mildly. They go from a family who seem very happy in their bucolic home setting to an existence filled with traffic incessant noise and pollution. In an attempt to get some muchneeded quiet they wall themselves into the house. The idea for the story came from the writers' observing houses along highways that are incredibly close to the road and wondering what life must be like both for the people who live in the houses and those who have abandoned the houses. And instead of the people on the road observing the life of the people who live there it's the people who live there who are observing those on the road.Since the location is so strange it turns out that the house and highway are actually in Bulgaria although a number of other countries were scouted. And the ending which may appear obvious to many people can actually be open to interpretation.".

While watching this movie I became like a member of the householdworrying for them like they were my ownfelt sad when they lost their privacy in their own home because of a traffic jam and even thought I was having problem breathing as they were walled up in the house.

Well the artists who made Home certainly have and the answer they've come up with makes for a fascinating oneofakind cinematic experience that even more than most movies has to be seen to be appreciated.The family in Home leads a relatively carefree and decidedly unconventional lifestyle. Their house stands adjacent to an abandoned freeway which they use as their own private recreation area. They also view bath time as a communal experience this being Switzerland and all.All is going reasonably well despite some mild familial tension here and there until one day and without any warning the roadway is reopened to traffic shattering the family's oncepeaceful existence with the sounds of whooshing cars and honking horns the penetrating odor of exhaust fumes and fossil fuels a diminution of privacy especially during traffic jams and a nonstop assault on the senses. Even getting to the other side of the road  to school or to work  becomes a daily deathdefying game of chicken with speeding vehicles whose drivers have no intention of slowing down for bothersome and unwelcome pedestrians.This tremendously odd little film is obviously intended as a parable about the oppressiveness and chaos of modern life as it encroaches ever more forcefully onto the peace and tranquility of a rural existence. The family members become increasingly illtempered paranoid neurotic even violent as the outside world inexorably presses its way into their onceplacid lives.But far more than the characters and themes it is the astonishing miseenscene that ultimately works its way into the viewer's psyche and that makes it hard not only to avert one's eyes during the course of the movie but to get back to one's own reality once it's over. Director Ursula Meier's work here is reminiscent of Luis Bunuel in one of his less playful moods as she focuses on a group of everyday people trapped in a surrealistic nightmare from which they are unable to awaken. It is definitely a case in which the scene becomes an integral reflection of the psychological states of the characters.Isabelle Hupert and Olivier Gourmet play the parents Madeleine Budd and Kacey Mottet Klein their two children and Adelaide Leroux Gourmet's nubile daughter from a previous marriage who spends most of her time sunbathing for the highly appreciative motorists and truckers who keep whizzing on by.Unique and unforgettable.".

	schema:reviewBody "A marvelously sad movie that is entirely misinterpreted again and again here.It is about paradise lost. And the tragic steps a father takes to keep his family together in eternal peace. Heart rending salvation through destruction.A newly activated highway destroys a family's tranquil life. They cannot stay because there is no peace there. They cannot leave because despite the oppressive traffic their roots remain there.The husband gradually seals them in in a bid to keep the noise from an outside world they no longer recognize out.By my interpretation the mother dies there powerless to stop the loss of her idyllic family. The father decides to complete the wallingoff of the home as the mother sleeps despite the fact that his car is being towed away outside as he no longer has any need for such material objects and despite the fact that the opening obliterated by the final brick was their final means of ventilation. He gives his young son a sleeping pill and tenderly carries his limp body to bed. His younger daughter does not wish a pill. A rapid scene change makes her means of sleep ambiguous. But it is paced with a sense of finality tragedy and desperation on the part of the father not of violence nor of physical suffering.The daughter who left home briefly returns only to find the home a crypt figuratively and literally I maintain with no doors or windows. No way in or out. And she leaves.Interpreted in this light the ending makes perfect sense. The mother suddenly awakens from her sleep immediately sledgehammers the cinder blocks covering the door and emerges into the sunlight followed by her family. The traffic sounds now seem distant and quiet as they walk together in the fields happy in the sun the highway never in shot paradise restored.But why is the highway suddenly quiet? Because the family are no longer there. Their physical forms are still entombed but their souls are free and together back in the pristine fields that they loved when the highway was vacant. It is their spiritual forms we are watching absent of all material possessions walking together happy and free forever back to the existence they recognize and love. The tone is not of triumph over obstacles overcome but of tragic bliss achieved at a heavy price.All this imagery is on screen as a lovely cover for the Bowie song Wild Is The Wind plays. A love song whose chorus features the line My Love Don't you know you're life itself? And so I maintain this film is about the question Is a life that has its foundation of love destroyed really any life at all? A wonderful ending subtly bittersweet makes this a film worth watching.".

The film describes the changes that take place into an ordinary family who lives next to a highway.One day the highway is opened and still life turns into a nightmare.Each member of the family deals with the problem in a different way. All of them try to keep on doing the same things in their own way but things go wronger day by day.The cast play such excellent roles that you can feel the anxiety as they do.I was asking myself during the film Why don't they leave ? But there are no answers only questions. Enjoy the film and try to find why.".

	schema:reviewBody "It will be easy for audiences to dismiss this film. In fact the ambitious project by FrenchSwiss director Ursula Meier demands a lot from the casual viewer. It is obvious Ms. Meier wanted to say a lot about the disintegration of a family at the center of the story that we first meet on a happy playful note.One always wonders about those houses built so close to a highway or train tracks. The noise alone would drive the inhabitants mad. As this tale begins the place where it is located seem almost an idyllic place in which to raise a family. True the house is situated a few meters away of what appears to be a highway under construction or perhaps abandoned. The children are able to cross the road without any problems. Michel the working father leaves the car on the other side of the roadway and Marthe the mother can tend to her work without anyone looking at her.This is a family where the bathtub is shared by parents and children without any question of modesty on anyone's part. Judith the older daughter loves to sunbathe in the space next to the house clad in a bikini. Judith object when a conservative swim suit arrive for her sister Marion. The younger brother Julien loves to run freely in his bicycle.On the surface everything seems to be well with the family. Unfortunately one day workers arrive to resurface the highway. With that an infernal traffic drives the family into a frenzied state. Gradually the inner fabric of what made these five people stick together begins to erode. Judith is the first one to decamp when a traffic snarl stops traffic in front of the house. The others try noise stoppers in their ears to no avail. Michel in desperation begins to fix the problem by replacing all doors and windows with cinder block hoping to isolate themselves from the outside noise. Marthe who has been the most affected by the changes in their lives wakes up one day and begin to take free herself and the others from the madness they have endured.Home in spite of its premise doesn't feel claustrophobic at its darkest moments. Ms. Meier wanted perhaps to make a statement for the obvious changes that progress by way of a new highway brings. After all don't we all want to escape to other more interesting and quieter places? The family's foundation is shaken by the advent of outsiders looking in on them. They were fine by themselves but now even the most menial things like hanging clothes to dry take a different meaning.The film is worth a view by serious fans. Isabelle Huppert one of the best actresses around makes us feel her pain and guilt in her heart. Oliver Gourmet is also effective as Michel. Adelaide Leroux Madeleine Budd and Kacey Mottet Klein are seen as Judith Marion and Julien.The cinematography by Agnes Godard draws us into the oppressive world Ms. Meier created. Ursula Meier is a serious director who likes to explore for her audience simple things one wouldn't even think about which is the key to understanding this bizarre tale she has created.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this at the 2010 Palm Springs International Film Festival where writerdirector Ursula Meier was on hand at my screening for an audience QA following the film. Meier explained that she got the idea for the film by seeing a house near a busy highway and letting her imagination run away with what kind of people would live there and the effect of being so close to a highway on them. I think we have all wondered about the inhabitants of homes we've seen while riding in a train or car and seeing homes without freeway barrier walls exposed to the noise of the traffic. In this story a family of five live in home where a major highway has been built running through their front yard. this major thoroughfare was never completely finished or opened to use so it has sat unused for years. The family uses the pavement for their personal use and has all their lawn furniture etc. on it. One day the family learns the highway will be finished and opened at last and the result has a dramatic effect on their lives. They have lived there for 10 years. The mother has a fear of going out in public the father is claustrophobic the oldest daughter wants to escape from her boring existence at the isolated house the youngest daughter is a mathematics and statistics whiz with an accelerated phobia for toxins and the boy is a pretty normal kid who likes hanging out with his friends. This is a strange and quirky film and pretty good as a debut feature for Meier. It was Switzerland's official submission to the 82nd academy awards for Best foreign Language Film. Some very good films come out of Switzerland but I don't think this warrants a BFLF submission. This may too slow and strange for many so I can't recommend it to a general audience but it's different and I would give it a 6.5 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " quirky movie claustrophobic and oppressive";
	schema:reviewBody "It is not the relaxing soothing movie one would like to see on a sultry summer night it is certainly an odd movie that however leaves some thoughtprovoking hints. It's the story of an eccentric family living alongside an abandoned highway whose life is completely turned upside down when the highway is suddenly opened after 10 years and traffic pollution and intolerable noise start to undermine the physical and mental balance of each member. It's a movie that makes one reflect upon the oppressive condition of people living alongside trafficked roads and it gets to convey this idea of oppression only sometimes relieved by a jazz and classical soundtrack and by some scenes which prove funny see the one with the refrigerator. There are however some unhealthy traits inside this family even before the opening of the highway mainly concerning too much intimacy shared by its members which I really did not understand and by the way found disturbing. The mother too very well interpreted by Isabelle Huppert who is always at ease in roles such as this seems to be incapable to face the world and afraid of any contact with anything outside the house and does seem completely mentally sane.

	onyx:emotionText "It is not the relaxing soothing movie one would like to see on a sultry summer night it is certainly an odd movie that however leaves some thoughtprovoking hints. It's the story of an eccentric family living alongside an abandoned highway whose life is completely turned upside down when the highway is suddenly opened after 10 years and traffic pollution and intolerable noise start to undermine the physical and mental balance of each member. It's a movie that makes one reflect upon the oppressive condition of people living alongside trafficked roads and it gets to convey this idea of oppression only sometimes relieved by a jazz and classical soundtrack and by some scenes which prove funny see the one with the refrigerator.

It gets noisier. The drivers leer. The drivers honk. The noise becomes nonstop. There is a traffic jam and people get out of their cars and stare. The family cannot deal with this and slowly go mad cementing up the windows. The little boy is the only sane one in the movie. He handles all this as just so much adventure. One daughter is the sort you love to hate full of herself selfish totally absorbed with her appearance idle rude. The other is just plain crazy. Mom and Dad are a very loving caring patient couple. It is a movie where the circumstances gradually deteriorate. I think of Roman Polanski's Repulsion for a similar effect. It is like a horror movie  unpleasantness for the sake of unpleasantness. There are no murders or zombies just frayed people who cannot cope with the situation. There is quite a bit of nudity but I just put that down to a difference in the way the French view nudity within the family. It is not sexual. The ending made no sense to me. It just ended things in mid air without any sort of resolution. The whole movie left me queasy and wondering if perhaps it were some great metaphor than went right over my head.Kacey Mottet Klein who plays the little boy Julien is an amazing actor. Not once did I notice he was acting. He was completely believable. In one scene he begged his Mom to let him out of being locked in the bathroom. It was heartmelting. I could not stand that frail little character entombed with the rest of that wacko family.".

If not all '1000 and one' permits are met the work has to stop especially when in the middle of protected nature nearby living area's. The people are no squatters it is their family home the children where born there. The parable is great to be cut off from your existence as you know it even after years of getting 'warm to the fact this will happen'. This is 1 apart movie not great but not small to.

	schema:reviewBody "Ursula Meier's Home 2009 is a very well thought out and very well executed film with much artistic merit. It is also a very thought provoking film rooted in the deep and profound symbology at its core. The house in an utterly isolated and desolate location the once abandoned highway adjacent to it the now opened highway adjacent to it the once seemingly happy family the now seemingly unhappy family the attempts of the family to protect itself from the now opened highway the overly educated middle child Marion the sunbathing oldest child Judith finally abandoning the family the radio station incessantly broadcasting traffic reports seemingly only about the highway adjacent to the house and the casual nudity of all the family members except for the mother are just a few of all the interrelated symbolic elements present within a carefully constructed matrix. The interpretive unraveling of this integrated and complex symbology provides much potential fodder for intellectual and artistic analyses for the viewer inclined to traverse the paths of such reflective thinking. Although the complete explication of all the possible interpretations of this very complex film could consume many pages of text I would hint at some of the possible paths of interpretation that I myself would traverse by suggesting alternate suitable titles for this film. Such a list of alternate titles might include The Womb The Refuge The Failed Escape A Prison Of Our Own Making The Dysfunctional Family In Disguise The Family Home As An Insane Asylum Let's Pretend It's Not Real and Let's All Pretend That Mommy's Not Crazy. After viewing this film a couple of lines of lyrics from an old Eagles song kept surfacing in my mind We live our lives in chains Never knowing that we have the keys that can set us free. Isabelle Huppert once again delivers an utterly brilliant performance and once again of a mentally deranged woman of some type. Do these seemingly strange roles find her or does she actively seek them out? Either way Huppert obviously has the proclivity and the ability to portray very strange women indeed. 20 Stars !!!".

As the plot goes on we follow the family facing the change this big monster the highway brings in the day by day life. The focus is the institution of family relationship inside and how the change is managed. The director Ursula Meier is extremely accurate in providing details of family situation which grow the feeling of anxiety and claustrophobia. Even the monster is changing along the time as the limitation of the family habits increases. At first the problem is crossing road then the limitation of their privacy when drivers stuck in traffic watch them in their home then again pollution and noise. What impressed me much was the attitude the family face this change with. From outside is easy to think cynically to leave the house where the old fashioned life is no possible anymore. But in reality I think in every real family this does never happen. So people act patching step after step the ongoing emergency till they found themselves trapped inside without even possibility to breath. Whatever the monster to face is the director seems to tell us the relation between family and home and moreover the way it works is a bomb ready to explode. The family depicted here is a little weird to say the truth. Sometimes is a normal one but not the one you'd say a 'typical family'. Even if you can say it a western family you can not guess where they live. Sometimes they recall me the Simpson. Sometimes you find yourself to think they hide a secret.

The Selectors from Cannes Film Festival should also be punished with watching this movie 10 consecutive times. People in prisons are happy because they cannot see this movie even by chance. Just baaaaaaad film.... terrible... Ursula Meier  one bad lousy director. I don't know what else to say to make you understand how bad it is. I pity the producers who gave the money to this project. I don't pity the distributors who bought this movie because they apparently have no idea what the audience would actually like to see in cinema.";

	schema:reviewBody "Home the directorial debut from young FrenchSwiss hopeful Ursula Meier is a film about communal captivity the disenfranchisement of an archetypal family unit and in many ways it's the 'road movie' of directionless modernity.This Csar nominated drama follows a dysfunctional family who live beside an abandoned motorway somewhere inbetween two French cities. Although the house is an uninspired concrete block their surrounding landscape is rather bucolic in stature with the kids using the roadway as a garden to sunbathe take a dip in the blowup pool or play street hockey across it's straight uninspired grey surface. Although we never get the conclusive hows and whys of their unconventional living situation it's implied that it was a decision of desperation on behalf of the agoraphobic stayathome mother Marthe the enchanting Isabelle Huppert. When her doting husband Michel Olivier Gourmet returns home from work one evening to break the news that the road project is going to reconvene he is in distress and determined that the family should leave immediately. Marthe is less intimidated resolute on staying in the unlikely place she has made into an idyllic family home. With cars soon filling the motorway day and night the risk of pollution causes friction to emanate from within the family and soon their paradise retreat turns into a tarmacked prison.Devised by a four piece writing team including Meier and fellow upcoming European auteur Olivier Lorelle Days of Glory it's perhaps no wonder how every character in the family is fleshed out. All play an integral role in the group dynamic how it will soon be tested and to an extent shattered. The suffocating mother Marthe who is afraid she'll lose her family to the outside world the stoic rock father Michel the typically angsty eldest daughter the indifferent and paranoid middle child Marion Madeleine Budd and most sympathetically the young curious and adventure seeking son Julien Kacey Mottet Klein. The cast are all pulling their weight here particularly Haneke's muse Huppert in an atypically austere maternal role matched with Dardenne Brothers' regular Olivier Gourmet as a compassionate father reaching the end of his tether.As the family's proximate relationship intensifies the ecoparable is verified and the drone of cars whizzing past their kitchen window becomes unbearable Meier resorts to feverish melodrama with a lifethreatening consequence. Cinematographer Agns Godard manages to make the transition from warm open landscape to claustrophobic crazy pretty aimlessly but the drastic shift in narrative tone removes any sympathy we once had for the barmy quintet replacing it with utmost frustration. Why can't they leave? What's so special about the house? Not only implausible the stircrazy psychological torment in Home's witching hour ends up compromising what would otherwise be an astoundingly accomplished feature debut.httpwww.366movies.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Claude Chabrol still has it in him to craft a relationship drama with trust in the dark corners of the characters and make it seem reasonably realistic. He's working from a novel by Ruth Rendell and I can only guess how much more detail there is in there compared to here but it feels like vintage Chabrol with some updates for technological bits like cell phones as he takes a romance to very peculiar twisted lengths that somehow the audience buys completely because of the characters and the actors playing them. In The Bridemaid he opens on Philippe Magimel an accountant of some sort who has a kind but mixedup family that's getting ready for Philippe's sister's wedding. As if in a slight update on Le Boucher Chabrol has the setup at the wedding for the two main players as Philippe meets bridesmaid Senta Laura Smet and after the wedding she arrives at his house drenched in rain and they have a lustful encounter.It's pretty close to immediately after this that Senta confesses her love for him unquestionably as if she knew it totally on first sight and that now he is her's and so on. Upon this one might think sarcastically 'this can only end well' as love at first sight save for a Disney movie always leads to trouble.

But aside from this the fan of Chabrol whose been tracking his career for however long it's been going since the late 50s early 60s with the other Cashier du cinema team will hopefully be pleasantly surprised to know he's still got it in him to make compelling dramatic cinema with the usual Hitchcockian angles ampedup to a certain sinister and ultimately tragic glee. 8.510".

	onyx:emotionText "Claude Chabrol still has it in him to craft a relationship drama with trust in the dark corners of the characters and make it seem reasonably realistic. He's working from a novel by Ruth Rendell and I can only guess how much more detail there is in there compared to here but it feels like vintage Chabrol with some updates for technological bits like cell phones as he takes a romance to very peculiar twisted lengths that somehow the audience buys completely because of the characters and the actors playing them. In The Bridemaid he opens on Philippe Magimel an accountant of some sort who has a kind but mixedup family that's getting ready for Philippe's sister's wedding. As if in a slight update on Le Boucher Chabrol has the setup at the wedding for the two main players as Philippe meets bridesmaid Senta Laura Smet and after the wedding she arrives at his house drenched in rain and they have a lustful encounter.It's pretty close to immediately after this that Senta confesses her love for him unquestionably as if she knew it totally on first sight and that now he is her's and so on. Upon this one might think sarcastically 'this can only end well' as love at first sight save for a Disney movie always leads to trouble. In this case Senta is adamant that Philippe despite also confessing his love however true or not is a curious part of the Bridesmaid I wasn't sure was a character flaw or a flaw in the story prove his love for her. This includes two easy things and two outofthequestion plant a tree write a poem kill someone and have sex with the same sex.

LA DEMOISELLE D'HONNEUR THE BRIDESMAID succeeds as a art work on so many levels that the viewer is inclined to forgive some of the dangling missing pieces in character and plot development that prevent this film from being Chabrol's finest. The setting pacing cast and concept are intriguingly seductive that is enough to make the film work well.The Tardieu family is in the midst of preparing for the wedding of one daughter Sophie Solne Bouton learning to accept the new love affair of the mother Christine Aurore Clment to a wealthy newly divorced man Grard Bernard Le Coq becoming used to the edgy antisocial behavior of daughter Patricia Anna Mihalcea and all the while being cared for by the successful contractor son Philippe Benot Magimel. On the television is the report of a murdered young woman and the disruption of a television show frustrates the obsessive Philippe in his work to keep the family focused. We jump to Sophie's wedding to nerdy Jacky Eric Seigne whose cousin Stphanie Senta Bellange Laura Smet is the bridesmaid of the title. The strange but sensuous Senta captures Philippe's eye and a rather torrid love affair begins. Senta is passionate and makes Philippe agree to four demands to prove he loves her the last two killing someoneanyone and having sex with a same sex partner jolt Philippe but he throws his usual caution to the wind and proceeds with the pairing. A homeless man who lives at Senta's grimy cellar lodging door repulses her and when a police report that the man has been found dead Philippe falsely 'confides' to Senta that he is responsible. Senta then promises to kill Grard as her half of the bargain Grard has avoided Philippe's mother and Philippe feels animosity toward anyone who would disturb his beloved mother. The plot thickens then boils the 'murders' change from reality to mistaken identity to heinous ends. Philippe has become immersed in Senta's madness leaving an ending that remains 'in media res'.Chabrol leaves strange clues scattered about for the astute eye to discover at times in retrospect and it is this trait that makes the story so fascinating. The cast is superb with Benot Magimel proving that his success in 'The Pianist' was not a fluke. He is a gifted actor and maintains an electrifying screen presence. This may not be Chabrol's best film but it is twisted enough to keep the viewer tensely focused on the very strange story and on the complexly interesting set of characters in this very French film noir!

In Sophie's wedding Philippe meets her sexy bridesmaid and Jacky's cousin Stphanie Senta Bellange Laura Smet and they have one night stand. Despite the odd behavior of the unstable and apparently imaginative Senta Philippe immediately falls in love for her and suggests four weird things to prove their love planting a tree writing a poem having homosexual intercourse and killing a person.

On the next morning when he wakesup Senta tells that she had murdered Grard to please Philippe and describes her crime in details. Philippe decides to visit Grard to find the truth about Senta.La Demoiselle d'Honneur is an engaging thriller of Claude Chabrol that slightly recalled me Alfred Hitchcock style in Strangers on a Train. The story has many subplots to divert the viewer and the twists are excellent. This is the first movie that I have seen of the sexy and gorgeous Laura Smet and I loved her performance in a totally different type of psychopath. Like in other films of this director the ending is open to interpretation and I believe that Philippe has indeed called the police but will try to help Senta during her imprisonment. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Dama de Honra The Bridesmaid".

	schema:reviewBody "There are a couple of good plot twists near the end of The Bridesmaid but in general this movie can hardly be classified as a thriller  it's more of a slowburning psychological drama. Still it remains interesting throughout mostly thanks to excellent performances in every role no matter how big or small as you would expect from a Claude Chabrol movie. At first I thought Benot Magimel was slightly miscast as a normal sensible guy drawn into a bizarre new world but soon I realized the character he plays has his creepy hidden sides as well  especially his never fully explained obsession with a stone head that resembles both his mother and his new girlfriend. Speaking of the new girlfriend Laura Smet must be one of the most atypically beautiful and promising actresses of the new French generation here she makes her character's warped to put it mildly morality seem casual and she mixes the sick with the sweet. This movie is definitely worth seeing as long as you don't expect many thrills. 12 out of 4.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is yet another take on Chabrol's ongoing exploration of French suburbia and on balance it's no better or worse than most of his others. From the outset  Philippe Tardieu returns home to find his mother and sisters watching a news report involving the mysterious and possibly tragic disappearance of a young girl and turns the TV off  it's obvious that Philippe Benoit Magimal is destined to wind up on the TV himself having descended from an initially healthy to an ultimately unhealthy state of mind so that all we need now is a catalyst. Chabrol makes us wait and doesn't introduce Senta Laura Smet until about 30 minutes into the movie. From that point it's a case of watching as Senta eats into Philippe's brain the way maggots eat into a cadaver for to all intents and purposes Philippe is a dead man from his first encounter with Senta. Chabrol likes to take his time and dallies over a situation involving Philippe's widowed mother Christine Aurore Clement and a possible replacement Gerard Courtois Bernard Le Coq. Chabrol clearly sees Le Coq as 'heavy' material in his last film Fleur du Mal Le Coq had a much bigger part as a much bigger villain and Suzanne Flon suffers a similar fate segueing from a main supporting role in Fleur to little more than a cameo here. Benoit Magimal is the kind of French actor I've never been able to warm to a kind of Vincent Casselllite seething with contained violence trying for 'cool' and emerging as 'sullen' though in fairness Magimal here gets nearer to playing an essentially 'nice' guy than Cassell managed in L'Appartement. Laura Smet is excellent as the notquite beautiful but very sensuous with it Senta as well she may be given her pedigree  the daughter of the great Nathalie Baye and somewhat improbably Johnny Hallyday. Overall it's a pleasant if not gripping enough entry one which I've now seen twice and will possibly see again.".

	schema:reviewBody "About ten years before he decided to venture again in Ruth Rendell universe Claude Chabrol had transferred to the screen a Judgment in Stone entitled la Crmonie 1995. It was his last great masterwork although he somewhat betrayed the novel. The choice of Sandrine Bonnaire for the main role was illadvised. Afterwards his career followed a creative downswing with rather mediocre works such as au Coeur Du Mensonge 1999 or Merci pour Le Chocolat 2000. So could a new excursion in Ruth Rendell territory boost his career again?Alas no and the title of my summary should give you an inkling about my thoughts on the Chabrol 2004 vintage. However there were some good elements to make the film compelling and to grab the attention. The first sequence showcases Benot Magimel and his family in front of the TV news that reveals a murder. Perfect to weave an eerie climate. The big imposing eerie house in which Laura Smet lives seems to shelter dark secrets and the bridesmaid lives in the basement. Chabrol was also interested in the games of truth and lie that link his two main actors and real suspense lies in Magimel's personality dangerously attracted to the bridesmaid. The filmmaker's touch is also discernible at the wedding ceremony where he ridicules its crucial steps. See the church sequence and the feast which echoes to the one in Le Boucher 1970. While I'm evoking this meal the gastronomy dear to Chabrol has three sequences devoted to it in the whole film. But let's come back to the bulk of the plot. Like a Judgement in Stone La Demoiselle d'Honneur was an exciting novel to read and again Chabrol skipped over some important points notably the reasons which prompt the hero to steal the bust from Grard Courtois Bernard Le Coq. In the novel he stole it because he thought that Courtois was a vulgar man but here Magimel's motivations to steal the bust remain blurred.The thrust of the novel and so of the film is a man who gradually loses the control of his everyday life facing a sensual attractive disturbing young woman. However things aren't looking good because there's an absence of unnerving climate and the scenario seems to have been sedately written especially near the end. In another extent I know what I'm going to write is questionable but I do think that Chabrol contemporary films suffer from the choice of the actors see bland Jacques Dutronc in Merci pour Le Chocolat or Jacques Gamblin in au Coeur Du Mensonge and sadly la Demoisele d'Honneur isn't an exception to the rule. Magimel's character isn't credible at all. He should get bogged down in madness as he's deeply in love with Smet but it isn't discernible on the screen. Laura Smet Johnny Hallyday's daughter has a monotonous acting while Bernard Le Coq's part is underwritten. Michel Duchaussoy who was brilliant in Que la Bte Meure 1969 is relegated to a minor tramp role unworthy of his wide acting skills.So an absence of interest for this story of manipulation is surely due to its actors and also because like for la Crmonie Chabrol made dull Rendell's novel. Mr Chabrol let's put it this way the best of your work is far behind you in time roughly the dusk of the sixties and the dawn of the seventies and you will probably never reach this scale again. How about contemplating retirement?".

	onyx:emotionText "About ten years before he decided to venture again in Ruth Rendell universe Claude Chabrol had transferred to the screen a Judgment in Stone entitled la Crmonie 1995. It was his last great masterwork although he somewhat betrayed the novel. The choice of Sandrine Bonnaire for the main role was illadvised. Afterwards his career followed a creative downswing with rather mediocre works such as au Coeur Du Mensonge 1999 or Merci pour Le Chocolat 2000. So could a new excursion in Ruth Rendell territory boost his career again?Alas no and the title of my summary should give you an inkling about my thoughts on the Chabrol 2004 vintage.

Also Benot is handsome after recent doses of Depardieu and Yves Montandthis is a relief.Good adult entertainment. Both the main characters are strong actors.

On the other hand I think the film fails primarily because Rendell's story doesn't work well in a French setting. If I'm reading the film correctly I think that Rendell wanted to get at class distinctions as a central topos of the novel and this theme would play out superbly in an English setting where class differences are part and parcel of the social fabric. In Chabrol's film such distinctions are so understated as to be lackluster if not plain dull a thematic failure that is only made the worse by characters who are lifeless and lacking in the telling character traits and hardscrabble wisdom one expects of certain class types. Everyone in Chabrol's film is bourgeois bourgeois bourgeois and therefore just plain boring. The acting is not so great and I felt that the casting decisions were flawed. Finally Senta is a ridiculously deranged young woman wouldn't you too hear the stylus skipping across the LP if someone said they loved you and that you were the person for whom they had been waiting forever after one afternoon of sex? so it's difficult to imagine anyone taking her very seriously. Let's not forget the absurdity of Senta's mother and the mother's lover played by untrained dancers it's very obvious who spend their waking hours practicing the tango in awkward and clumsy moves. Why didn't Chabrol do something else with them other than film the pair practicing steps they can never hope to master? I would not recommend this film.".

For me this film appears to be too loosely constructed to provide much more than very casually related scenes which appear to go nowhere. For example director Clausd Charbrol in a written interview in the special effects section of the DVD says  In my films the plot is not terribly significant. I try to get it out of the way in the first reel. One is left wondering why there is a wedding anyway? Why is there a bridesmaid? Why so much emphasis on the bride's mother doing hairdressing in her kitchen? Charbrol wants the audience to identify with Beniot but identify with what? Charbol claims Phillipe's character is 80 sex and 20 passion. From this the director expects the audience in his wordsto be strong enough or crazy enough to reject their whole mental makeup. Phillipe drives a new car in the film apparently because the auto agency delivered it to the set by mistake so his boss Nadeau lets him drive it for six months until his own driver's license is reinstated but he admonishes Phillipe to bring it back in one piece. The beach scene is an clearly stated as being an illusion to FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. There is also a clear illusion to PSYCHO. Of course the absence of plot as the film progresses seems to allow the story to go out of control. Chabrol explains You have to ask funny questions at times. The only funny question I can think of is Why would anyone want to see this film? I find no merit for recommendation.".

The child playing AsiaAia also acts really well with the other characters.The story is very simple but it doesn't need to be more complicated than it is. The movie worked well for me as it didn't fall into the usual clichs towards the ending as many other similar movies would have done.".

The movie is actually not about the twoyear old baby but it's about the people who live in the trailers. There's no acute dramatic elements in this film but it leaves you with a subtle melancholy. The audience is exposed again and again to their substandard yet noble way of life and the presence of the twoyear old baby merely accentuates it. The characters seem at ease with their trailer lives but what makes them really noble is that they do not want that kind of lives for the children. Their compassion is evident throughout the movie and that's what makes the movie so touching. The ending leaves you a little bewildered at first. But it does make sense because the movie is about the people who live in the trailer park and not really about the baby. The movie definitely goes slow but it's worth a watch.".

Instead she and the others simply keep the child more or less as any parent would do with the movie going nowhere for more than one hour and a half. The cute little child is funny at times as are most children that aren't spoiled but the film is utterly lacking in story acting directing and photography.

The first part on land before the sea voyage was filmed on location in Burma with some really fine British actors particularly the actor who plays the older captain who gets him the job I'd like to know who that is. The photography especially the use of color and light is extraordinary and Wajda captures the sense of a real place and time. It really should be seen on the big screen. This is about one of those Conrad voyages where nothing goes right. It's a young man's first experience as captain his ship becalmed an ailing crew and a halfmad first mate who claims the ship is jinxed by the former captain. While the essence of the storya dead calm and nothing happeningis a difficult subject to film Wajda is up to the task and the film is engrossing throughout. And the dialogue isn't plagued by the tinear that than can occur when English is not the director's first language. Just a terrific job all around.".

	schema:headline " Intelligent Conrad Adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Shadow Line' is about an able intelligent young seaman who resigns his position only to receive unexpectedly the command of another ship after the death of its captain. This early landset section is perhaps a little plodding. The interaction of the narrator with various other characters and the details of how he comes to assume his captaincy serve in Conrad's novel to deepen our understanding of him to see both his strengths and weaknesses and observe how he was both ill and wellprepared for leadership. Wajda tends to err on the side of mere scenesetting failing to invest scenes that could easily have been reduced without affecting the essential narrative with the thematic and psychological significance achieved by Conrad. An additional mild annoyance is the overthetop mugging by John Bennett as the supine keeper of a boardinghouse fortunately it's a small part and compensation is provided by Martin Wyldeck an actor quite unknown to me who is very enjoyable as a wily old mariner with a rather donnish demeanour.Once the story takes to the seas all reservations fade for what follows is superb cinema. It manages to capture the sense of being at sea as well as any movie I know including the excellent 'Master and Commander'. What makes the difference here however is that whereas most oceanset films either depict the ship's struggle against the awesome hostile elements of storms and towering waves or delight in the bracing freshness and freedom of having a fair wind at the sails 'The Shadow Line' tells the story of a becalmed ship barely drifting through the water its crew sweltering in the oppressive heat and laid low by illness their fate possibly in the hands of the malevolent spirit of their late captain. It's an unusual proposition for a cinematic entertainment stillness silence and accumulating claustrophobia. In lesser hands the result could easily have been dull. But the fine performances including that of a young Tom Wilkinson  although he looks middleaged even here and the sharp cinematography sometimes vivid to the point of unreality enable the power of Conrad's tale to be conveyed surprisingly successfully.The performance of Marek Kondrat in the main role is extremely impressive authoritative yet retaining the sense of doubt and inexperience so crucial to Conrad's selfportrayal. Taking the form of a retrospective 'confession' the book deals with the emotional development of the protagonist his traversing of the 'shadow line' between youth and maturity  a change that entails both loss and gain. Conrad's narrator is significantly anonymous this gesture towards universality is strengthened by the frequent use of impersonal 'one' as in 'one thinks' 'one does' etc. At the same time the author allows us to the read the tale as a coded autobiography with the figure of the young seastruck Pole a version of his own younger self  and the older wiser narrator looking back on his rite of passage as a version of the 60yearold novelist. The story's significance is thus simultaneously general and particular both universal and individual. The film adaptation pushes the autobiographical element further by naming the hero 'Joseph Conrad' and I wonder if the lead actor's name is entirely coincidental the youthful captain's conduct in command is a presage of the literary genius to come. Conrad's entire oeuvre including the other books such as 'Heart of Darkness' that Wajda considered filming is thus in part a product of these early experiences the passage into leadership and maturity though not necessarily wisdom the passing of the shadow line is the crucial development that enables great literature  and great cinema  to be created. If only more literary adaptations displayed such intelligent engagement with their source texts instead of being content merely to illustrate them according to the genteel standards of decorum and respectability.".

The theater was filled to capacity. Well the theater was full before the movie began but by the time the movie ended and the lights came up. PEOPLE disappeared I'm not being funny... more than 23 of the people vacated the theater. This movie was HORRIBLE! Now this is coming from someone who KNOWS Films. To prove it. No film was wasted because it was shot on a Canon XL1 by using the factory electronic lens instead of a manual lens where the DP could have better control. The actors portraying Jay Z Damon Dash and Sean PDiddy Combs were all inside jokes where the script was paperthin. Not having the actual characters who are so well known put the actors in place of having to go over the top in their portrayals of these hip hop icons. Some portions were over exposed like on the ball court. Did anyone use a monitor or check the Fstop settings? The jump cut editing when Damon Dash was on the phone was trite and frivolous. The Asian girl coming out of nowhere had no back story nor purpose other than screaming You lookin' at me? was further proof that this film had no character development. The script was weak because it had no storyline other than a fake story to Dave who is a parody of The Source magazine which is a nonstory in and of itself. Not even the music was worthy of my time. The direction was nonexistent and I'm not certain if it's because of the lack of script or vision but it looked as if someone freestyled every scene and had a guy with a Canon XL1 put it on tape. I found myself anxious and going from wanting this film to succeed desperately to wanting to join the 23's leaving enmass to get the get the hell out of the theater. Nevertheless I stayed hoping it would get better. It did not. The JMJ cameo and Aaliyah's salute were the ONLY causes for applause in the film. Yet if you think about it you do GOOD work for someone you're saluting not the worse Godawful thing since Russell's 'Tougher Than Leather' fiasco. I'd have to put this in that category egodriven non talented piece of decadence that is messing it up for REAL talented young filmmakers that could have used that budget and that cast to make something GREAT  FUNNY or at least GOOD.".

	schema:reviewBody "House of Wax was one of the few films made in 3D which was a huge success. This may have more to do with the fact that it had a good strong story and great acting and did not rely solely upon it's 3D special effects.The late great Vincent Price is Henry Jarrod a sweet and dedicated artist who creates lifelike mannequins for a wax museum. His statues  depicting everyone from Marie Antoinette  Joan of Arc to John Wilkes Booth  are loved by Henry as much as if they were his own children. When he objects to creating more horrific sculptures to attract more paying customers his partner sets the museum on fire hoping to collect a tidy sum in insurance money. Henry supposedly perishes in the flames trying in vain to rescue his beloved wax friends in a scene which is truly heartbreaking. Some time later Henry reappears wheelchair bound and just a tad bitter. He has opened a new wax museum which features realistic scenes of murder and horror many of them taken from current headlines. Unfortunately some of them are just a little TOO realistic one looks like Henry's expartner who was found hanging in an elevator shaft. Was it really a suicide or something more sinister? Joan of Arc bears a striking resemblance to Cathy Gray a young girl who has gone missing from her room. And Cathy's friend Sue looks exactly like the lost Marie Antoinette the pride and joy of Henry's former exhibit. Soon a horribly scarred monster is chasing Sue through the foggy night time streets. Can the police and Sue's artistic young suitor solve the mystery in time? Or will Sue wind up as yet another display in the House of Wax?This is a wonderful creepy scarefest with great sets beautiful colors and strong performances. Vincent Price as Henry Jarrod is both lovable and horrifying as the kind man driven mad. Charles Bronson in a very early role is super freaky as Henry's mute and morbid assistant. Carolyn Jones in her preMorticia Addams days is blond pretty Cathy the squeaky opportunist with the heart of gold. Phyllis Kirk is the sensible Sue a slightly uptight but genuinely believable victim. The scene where she must run through the deserted fogsoaked streets is very convincingly creepy. When Sue actually stops long enough to remove her noisy and cumbersome high heeled shoes which give away her every step on the cobblestone road I very nearly applauded. The 3D effects are an added bonus to an already wonderfully fun movie  watch for the classic paddle ball scene!This is one of Price's best starring role films. It is everything that a good horror film should be  funny without being ridiculous scary without the gore and fantastical without being far fetched. 10 stars!!! Don't miss it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Professor Henry Jarrod Vincent Price is a sculptor who works in wax. He's living in New York City in the late 19th Century and he's displaying his handiwork in a wax museum. When his partner Matthew Burke Roy Robertreally his primary investorbalks at Jarrod's receipts and tries to talk him into moving in a more commercial direction perhaps with a Chamber of Horrors Jarrod protests that he's creating meticulous works of art not cheap sensationalism. Jarrod tries to interest a new investor but when the prospect says he can't make a decision for a few months Burke says he can't wait. He suggests torching the place and collecting the insurance money. When Jarrod refuses Burke torches the museum anyway and the two fight. Jarrod supposedly dies in the fire leaving Burke to collect. However when a mysterious disfigured stranger shows up the resolution may not be so simple.The debate that Jarrod and Burke have in the opening scene of this remake of Mystery of the Wax Museum 1933 is particularly ironic in light of the film's history. House of Wax was made as a 3D filma fact made more than obvious from the film's opening credits which are presented in a font made to look like it is bursting forth from the screen.In the early 1950s movie theater box office receipts were down because of television. Film studios and movie theaters were looking for gimmicks that would make films seem more special. They were looking to do things that television couldn't do. According to film editor Rudi Fehr The House of Wax was made because the theaters were empty people were staying home to watch television. In order to lure the audiences back to the theaters Warner's came out with 3D. While this wasn't the first commercial 3D film1952's Bwana Devil holds that honor this was certainly one of the more popular ones.Studio head Jack Warner told Fehr that he would have five weeks to edit the film after shooting was done. Fehr said they could get it done even quicker if director Andre De Toth would shoot the film in sequence. So Warner demanded just that despite De Toth's protests. Shooting in sequence is unusual and can make the onset crew's job much more difficult. But it certainly didn't negatively affect the performances or De Toth's direction which are both outstanding despite a couple strangely truncated bits of exposition.Like many 3D films there are a few shots in House of Wax that might otherwise be inexplicable. The most prominent example here is a huckster who stands in front of the revamped House of Wax doing tricks with three paddleballs. We linger on him much longer than we normally would so that he can bounce the ball into our face. This shows part of the difficulty of 3Dit's difficult to reconcile the most impressive effects from the audience's perspective with narrative needs. Viewed now in simple 2D on a television screen the obligatory 3D shots of House of Wax play as quirky campy curios. For me that adds to the charm of the film.Price has an unusual role here in that he plays a good portion of the film with disfigurement makeup halflimping hunched over covered in bulky black cloaks in a manner that somewhat prefigures John Hurt's turn as John Merrick in The Elephant Man 1980. De Toth is excellent at building atmosphere especially in the external shots which frequently feel more like we're watching a version of the Jack the Ripper story set in London.Most of the script by Crane Wilbur based on a play by Charles Belden which also served as the basis for 1933's Mystery of the Wax Museum of course is deliciously flagitiousdegenerate in a more over the top manner than was usual for the period. The conflagration at the end of the opening is particularly unexpected and twisted as is Jarrod's modus operandi throughout the film. It's only too bad that the selfenforced Hollywood moral code at the time could not have allowed for a more nihilistic ending. I for one was cheering on Jarrod and his assistant Igor played by none other than Charles Bronson in one of his earlier roles when he was still using Charles Buchinsky.Although it's difficult to say whether Belden Wilbur or De Toth intended a message or subtext it's easy to read a number of interesting angles into the film. To begin the use of the name Igor for the assistant suggests a number of twisted turnabouts on Dr. Frankenstein. Jarrod is even more depraved than the good doctor as he creates death out of life in the service of art. At least it seems depraved if you're not an artist. If you are you might simply note that one must suffer to be beautiful. That's more than just a flippant remark as Jarrod suffers financially for beauty early in the film and Cathy Gray Carolyn Jones suffers physically for beauty as she nearly suffocates herself to make herself thin. And of course there's the literal sinister sense in which the artist makes others suffer to create his beauty. There are also very interesting subtexts available related to goals of realism in art and of course the ironic messages noted earlier in the beginning of the film where we are debating aesthetics versus financial or more material considerations.Although House of Wax was popular at the box office in 1953 there was no shortage of critical devaluations of the film as a cheap gimmick and no shortage of complaints about image quality and eyestrain when trying to view the film in 3D. 3D was only prominent for another year or so to make periodic returns later often for number 3 films in series but House of Wax is a much better film than it was given credit for at the time. It's not Vincent Price's best but it's well worth viewing.".

	schema:headline " A horror classic which every fan of the genre should see. Vincent Price's horror persona begins here!";
	schema:reviewBody "I love Vincent Price my all time favourite horror actor. 'House Of Wax' is an important movie in his career because it was his first legitimate horror film after thirty something pictures in a variety of genres. This really is where the Price persona fans know and love began. He made nonhorror pictures after this it was a few years later that he made 'The Fly' and the William Castle movies which made him a horror star something cemented later in the 60s with Roger Corman's Poe movies. But you can see Vincent Price horror icon right here. He's terrific as Jarrod and he would draw upon this role for 'The Mad Magician' and later the Phibes movies and 'Theatre Of Blood'. 'House Of Wax' is a remake of 'Mystery Of The Wax Museum' made twenty years earlier. In that one Lionel Atwill played the Price role different name but same character. Atwill was great but Price is even better as is the movie overall. 'House Of Wax' sticks pretty much to the earlier movie but with a few changes most notably the absence of the girl reporter character that Fay Wray played in the original. In this the policeman played by Frank Lovejoy 'In A Lonely Place' takes on a similar role. Phyllis Kirk is good as the female lead better in my opinion than Glenda Farrell in the earlier picture. The supporting cast also includes Carolyn Morticia Addams Jones and an early appearance by Charles Bronson who plays a deaf mute named Igor. 'House Of Wax' was made specifically for 3D so there's a few gimmicky shots but that doesn't spoil the movie which to me is a horror classic that every fan of the genre should see.".

	schema:reviewBody "HOUSE OF WAX established Vincent Price as a horror film icon.  He's never hammy here.  He's best when describing gruesome details like torture or murder with a slight grin as if he's building to a punchline.    Crane Wilbur's screenplay has well researched details regarding how wax sculpting works the effects of chemical burns for example improves on the 1933 original.             Here Vincent Price plays Henry Jerrod a wax sculptor whose first try at a wax museum meets the same infernal end as Atwill's museum in the first film.   12 years later Jerrod opens a new museum.  One of his intern sculptors dates a model Sue Phyllis Kirk who is hounded by a mysterious man with a distorted  face.            In the original film version made in 1933 Fay Wray plays a beautiful but uninteresting damsel in distress.  Phyllis Kirk fills Fay Wray's part here and man is she even more boring!   But don't worry you have plenty of Vincent to make this DVD worthwhile.    It's easy to find in a bit part young Charles Bronson billed here as Charles Buchinsky as one of Jerrod's s interns.           HOUSE OF WAX's most famous element is that it was made in 3D. This new gimmick meant to lure television viewers back to the box office was novel but it had it's kinks.  Warner Brothers improved the process a year later with the 3D release of Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER and yet another period horror film PHANTOM OF THE RUE MORGUE.  The most amusing 3D moment in HOUSE OF WAX has almost nothing to do with the story.   A carnival barker played with crowdpleasing energy by Reggie Rymal constantly whacks a paddleball outside the wax museum while heralding the museum's opening night thrills.    He faces the camera meaning us and says You! With the popcorn.  Hold still.' and he proceeds to repeatingly whack the ball at the camera.            HOUSE OF WAX is a lot of fun and was a big hit at the time. The DVD does not come with a 3D Process but it does come with coverage of HOUSE OF WAX's Hollywood Premier.  It's attended by Bela Lugosi and friend Jack Warner and Ronald Reagan See even Presidents watch horror movies!".

The studio's confidence is borne out by the film itself a sensational  and sensationalized  remake of Michael Curtiz's MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM 1933 in which sculptor and wax museum curator Vincent Price is driven insane after being disfigured in a fire set by his greedy business partner Roy Roberts eager to reap the benefits of a generous insurance policy.

Today the storyline may seem a little predictable even for those unfamiliar with Curtiz's original but the narrative unfolds at a rapid clip and contains more than a few hairraising setpieces most notably the opening fire sequence in which Price looms uncomfortably close to the raging inferno the discovery of Roberts' corpse in an elevator shaft Price's cloaked villain stealing a corpse from the morgue at midnight and pursuing Kirk through the fogshrouded streets and the climactic faceoff around a vat of boiling wax.

However while the characters may be bland and unremarkable the film succeeds by virtue of its spectacle and recent festival screenings to celebrate 50 years since the first 3D boom have been sold out on every occasion reaffirming its enduring appeal as one of the finest movies of its kind.Reviewers often claim the film is 'just as good' when screened flat and while there's no denying the production's many virtues the 3D version is a REVELATION!

	schema:reviewBody "Every element works from script to art direction to cinematography to direction and acting.But let's face it it's Gordon Bau's horrific makeup for the disfigured Vincent Price that still today over 50 years later is every bit as frightening as Dick Baker's makeup for Linda Blair in The Exorcist. Crane Wilbur's script and Andre De Toth's direction enacted in Stanley Fleischer's brilliantly designed sets and shot and lit by two of the best Bert Glennon and Peverell Marley still provide a thrillride of tension and shocks  with or without 3D.The early set piece of the fire in Vincent Price's studio operates on several levels to motivate everything that follows. As designed and filmed it begins with greed and violence and destruction between two human beings Price and his benefactor Roy Roberts then proceeds to a vicious assault by fire on Price's art  his magnificent wax sculptures of historic figures.The flames leap from one sculpture to another melting them in shots that are haunting and disturbing simultaneously  almost as if we're watching notquitehuman beings burned alive. We're scared sad unsettled and tense at cinematic visuals no audience had seen before. Of course this sequence foreshadows Price's OWN disfigurement and motivates his revenge. An explosion climaxes this sequence.From then on HOW moves from brilliant set piece to brilliant set piece as Price stalks his victims.And Price is magnificent  particularly as his disfigured self. He's a human who's been made a monster by another human's terrible betrayal. It's extremely difficult to act under heavy horror makeup to convey real emotions particularly sympathetic ones with only one's eyes and body language requires more expertise than horror actors are generally given witness Boris Karloff's incredible performance as the Monster in Frankenstein under similarly restrictive makeup.Price's silent slouching lame footdragging body movements enhanced by Howard Shoup's cape and hat costume almost gave him the feeling of a wounded bird of prey or insect. Whether his movements were developed by him alone or in conjunction with director De Toth is impossible to say. What IS possible to say is that no monster had ever moved quite this way on screen before. And his makeup back in the day was genuinely shocking. It still is.It's astonishing the range of emotions Price was able to express and evoke under all that camouflage.Even on repeated viewings even in 2D it's remarkable how much tension HOW generates. And once Phyllis Kirk breaks Price's waxen mask to reveal the hideous burns and scars beneath  the tension is nonstop.As other comments have noted it is perhaps the subtextual layers that make HOW a timeless classic. Art versus Greed sensitivity versus violence beauty versus deformity love versus hate altruism versus revenge Life versus Death.For all its action and horror HOW is also a philosophically dense conflict that operates on almost subliminal intellectual and emotional levels  whether intended or not. It's hard to see how these were NOT intended since the story and script are so flawlessly constructed. HOW was a landmark film when it was made and certainly a landmark film for Vincent Price. It's still an effective classic today.".

	schema:reviewBody "For me House of Wax is a very good movie but I am not sure if it is Price's best horror film. I did prefer the CormanPricePoe collaborations Pit and the Pendulum The Raven The Fall of the House of Usher and especially The Masque of the Red Death. The story occasionally loses bite and Phyllis Kirk is a rather bland female leadthough in all fairness her character is as well. Conversely the Gothic sets look gorgeous and add a real sensual beauty to a lot of scenes. The photography is just as lavish. On the subject of visuals I had the pleasure of watching House of Wax in 3D I am not a fan of 3D and find it distracts from the film and doesn't focus on the story enough. In the case of House of Wax however not only does the 3D look good but it enhances the scares without making them gimmicky. Igor appearing to have leapt out of the audience was a standout. House of Wax is fine in 2D but even better in 3D in my view and I thought I'd never say that. The music is haunting and robust the writing is sharp and the story is suspenseful and mostly exciting. There are some very effective scenes such as the sight of the figure in the cloak Jarrod chasing Sue down the alleywayspure suspense and horror the murders especially that of Jarrod's partner the heartbreaking scene where Jarrod tries in vain to save his wax works and Sue strapped nude on the table in the climax. The wax works are very creepy as well. The pace is brisk and the direction handles the atmosphere very well. The performances are very good on the whole Carolyn Jones went on to do better things but is interesting to see. Frank Lovejoy is great at just playing it straight Reggie Rymal provides another of the 3D's finest moments with the paddleball and Charles Bronson is wonderfully creepy even without uttering a word. Best of all is Vincent Price in his first array into horror and for me still one of his best roles his makeup is exceptional and he is very malevolent and sympathetic a type of role that always saw him at his best. Looking at him also you'd never guess that it was his first horror role he looks as though he'd done it for years beforehand. In conclusion a very good film and a great 3D experience. 810 Bethany Cox".

Thought long since dead Jarrod resurfaces apparently wheel chair bound and with horribly burned hands. Opening up a new museum his new figures made by his protg under his instruction look ever more lifelike than before could he be responsible for some despicable crimes in the area?.This marvellous film is a remake of the 1933 chiller The Mystery Of The Wax Museum directed by Michael Curtiz. Here this film is taken on by Andre de Toth originally filmed in 3D with the then bonus addition of Warner Phonic Sound it's a picture that thankfully holds up real well even in its basic flat format. The reason it does hold up well is because director de Toth didn't get carried away with the gimmick it's used sparingly so the narrative never gets lost amongst any trickery and thus House Of Wax's excellently creepy story comes to the fore.Having the ever supreme Vincent Price as your leading man Jarrod will always help your horror genre picture here he two folds the performance brilliantly. At first his Jarrod is charming and carrying a grace about his dedication to his craft but then devilment takes control as Price pumps creepy ardour into Jarrod's fractured mind. Quite a turn from Price who most definitely suffered for his art during the shoot forced to do his own stunts the 3D process needs more than one camera he was involved in an accident that set him on fire and almost saw him crushed!. Then there was the long and often painful make up sessions to get the desired effects of a burns victim layers of rubber strangling his skin to the point of passing out oh yes Vincent earned his money on this one!.We even get one of the earliest credited performances from Charles Bronson here under his real name of Buchinsky as Jarrod's assistant Igor whilst fans of The Addams Family TV series will no doubt enjoy the performance of future Mortica Carolyn Jones. The film was a big success on its release and hugely popular with critics and it's not hard to see why because today it still stands proud as one of the finest exponents of classic horror both as a story and as a technical construction. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a pain beyond pain!' Vincent Price menacingly says to his leading lady Phyllis Kirk towards film's end. This was in my view the highlight of Price's breakthrough role that of the tortured Prof. Henry Jarrod as the horribly disfigured and criminally insane sculptor of wax likenesses. House of Wax was indeed Price's breakthrough role. It redefined how horror was presented and how we the viewing audience perceived it for almost 20 years. It was not until 1973's  The Exorcist that the horror genre experienced it's next substantial metamorphosis. Vincent Price was 42 years old in 1953 the year of House of Wax's release and he had until this time experienced a busy but unspectacular career. House of Wax changed all that catapulting him into the international stardom he so richly deserved.Many have imitated but never duplicated this film which is a true masterpiece. That it holds up well 50 years after it's release date is a tribute in itself especially for a 3D horror film. Price portrays the mad Jarrod done dirty by a business partner and tragically burned as he attempts to keep said partner from burning his studio for insurance money. Surviving the fire the now mad Jarrod goes on a killing spree to find models for his new wax figures. The thing is they are not figures they are the actual victims under a thin layer of wax causing the viewing public touring his  new studio to believe he is a wax genius. He is a genius all right a mad criminal genius. One of his victims is the friend of Sue Allen ably played by Phyllis Kirk whom I wish we would have seen more of during her screen career. Ms. Kirk joins the list of ladies I admire as scream queens' and she plays the role of anguished gal pal with impressive emotion. Sue figures Jarrod out early on and much of the film is spent with Jarrod trying to do away with her. The scene where we see Jarrod chasing Sue down the dark alleys of New York is pure classic horror and is one that has been duplicated too often to recount. The always pleasing Frank Lovejoy portrayed Police Lt. Brennan but another thing of personal interest to me were several other members of the supporting cast. Dabs Greer was Sgt. Jim Shane and younger readers may remember him still going strong in 1999's The Green Mile filmed 46 years later. A very young Charles Buchinsky AKA Charles Brandon was Igor the mute servant of Jarrod. House of Wax has a fairly stock ending but that is OK. Young Sue is rescued from the wax vat just in the nick of time to be happily reunited with her boyfriend portrayed  by Paul Picerni. A word should be said about director Andre de Toth. de Toth had only one eye and limited depth perception. It is a fine credit to him that he was responsible for one of the best 3D pictures ever made. House of Wax is a remake of 1933's Mystery of The Wax Museum and in turn resembles 1966's Chamber of Horrors. By all means rent or buy this one it is true classic horror.".

The circus that links all the facts is a example of decadence in its greens and reds that many advertisingstyle filmmakers would kill for to get the same effect to show beauty. Ophls is subtle and the most elegant director that has ever lived. He is one of the fundamental cinema masters in the same category of Griffith Chaplin Eisenstein Buuel Renoir Welles Bergman Ford Hitchcock Wilder Visconti Mizoguchi Truffaut etc and probably the less seen of them.Lola Monts received poor critics at the time of its release but was recognized as great art and a summing up of Ophls themes by the French nouvelle vague critics. You find in it some interesting comments about the way the society created by men destroy women and their paths to happiness. Ophls was an author not a historian. He wasnt interested in Lola as a historic figure but as a celebrity humiliated by her public just because she tried to be free. Ophls has decided to make the movie after noticing how press used to treat the crisis of Judy Garland and Zsa Zsa Gabor affairs.If you want to see other incredible films of the director watch to Libelei Letter from an Unknown Woman and La Ronde.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is not entirely fair to recommend Lola Montes so highly or admire it so since even the version that screened recently at the Film Forum in NYC purported to be the definitive restoration is still a truncated version. The original director's cut that premiered in France in 1955 and then to immediate withdrawal after its disaster of a reception at 140 minutes is no longer available. At the least it's a saving grace that so much has been saved in this 115 minute cut considering how many version there are and how they vary with the running time.And for Pete sake if by some chance you can see it on the bigscreen it's soon to leave the Film Forum for its second run following the rerelease last October and its repremiere at the NYFF do so. The filmmaker Max Ophuls in what was his unintentional swan song he died at 55 shot the hell out of this picture with director of photography Christian Matras taking the 2351 frame with new Eastmancolor by the horns and shaking it for all it could be worth within the context of a vibrant 19th century costume melodrama biopic. The colors all jump off so splendidly with such a force that compels one to not have too long of a blink as to do so would be to miss on little surprises little things that Ophuls uses in his frame which he careens and swivels and moves around with the freedom of a curious pleasantly intoxicated fowl. It's one of the first masterpieces of the widescreen color film.But it's not just a great film in technical terms. That would be too easy perhaps for Ophuls who uses this backdrop of the sweeping and sensational to pierce through other deeper things going on with the characters. In Lola Montes his character is someone who relives what has happened in her relatively short life relatively since she's not really old in the sense of being tucked away from the public's gaze as a main attraction in a French circus.She's an object first and person second in this context which as one can imagine bustles and throbs with excitement and fun as only something of a cousin to Fellini could be. And yet as a person she's had quite a journey to where she's at from aristocratic daughter given away to a marriage she has to run away from unfaithful husband figures with a wife who is about as beautiful a being as could be in the immediate vicinity then becomes a ballerina her childhood dream and then... well a topic of gossip and scandal such as romancing a conductor all ending in Bavaria with her hopes of possibly settling down squandered for good. Hence the circus gig.It's a story that's given that same kaleidoscopic view as in Citizen Kane but this time with the twist that the protagonist isn't given the sort of luxury of already being dead as the story of a life is sifted through and given a LARGERthanLIFE context. Lola's story is a spectacle sometimes farce sometimes legend sometimes one of those toomuchtobelieve sagas that keeps those glued to their seats while Lola also entertains with trapeze work! And yet under the blue lights under the costume changes and other mockups and even the QA sessions that the ringmaster holds with the audience and Lola the soul of this woman is about as there as a nearempty gas tank. She may still be alive but it's a kind of limbo that would be too insane if it weren't true and played out to full spectacle and extravaganza.As said this is a work of true technical mastery and there's one amazing camera move or one amazing little direction I just smiled ear to ear seeing in the opening how the circus performers rolled out and it stayed for a solid five minutes. But too Ophuls has an engaging wonderful actress on top of having a complete knockout visually Martine Carol who I'm not sure I've seen outside of this film pulls out a performance that wavers between weepy flustered driven elegant tortured calm and hiding back hysteria. It's half diva and half substantially undermined human soul and she pulls it off like it's the performance of a life. Good marks also go to Peter Ustinov as the Ringmaster chugging along through a script that he knows almost too well we get very amusing asides with one of the little people in the red costumes trying to get their change back from him midact and the actor who played the Bavarian king. In Ophuls hands they're not just other pieces of the set but actors who work so diligently to make this all one cohesive piece.And really that's what makes Lola Montes ultimately so remarkable. Ophuls has moments of melodrama maybe so much so that one will have to really love costumeperiodmelodrama flicks to really appreciate it I actually don't usually this is an exception and at the same time they all work as part of this story about what lies behind the pomp and circumstance. You can get lost from time to time in this movie and it's thrilling to get wrapped up in it. And as well as an artistic achievement of considerable proportions it's a really fun movie to boot.".

	schema:headline " Max Ophuls Final Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "With 1955's Lola Montes director Max Ophuls concluded his long career. He died shortly afterward. In many ways this is his greatest film. The first film he used Technicolor was also his last. The cinematography at its time and in France especially was new and innovative. By the mid 50's Technicolor was all the rage. However only few directors could make a colorful film dramatic and not just fluff. Ophuls adapted the historic account of 19th century world famous courtesan Lola Montes to a fictionalized drama of her life. In the end of her life Lola Montes is the feature attraction at a circus headed by the moneyhungry P.T. Barnumlike ringmaster played by the excellent actor Peter Ustinov. Through a series of panoramas and stunts her life is retold. The movie is mostly her flashbacks though not necessarily in chronological order. She recalls how her mother sold her to a man she did not love. She ended that marriage and became a dancercourtesan. A sex icon of her time she drew many famous lovers. Among these was the mesmerizing pianist Franz Liszt who rocked the world of classical music in the 19th century. Liszt abandons Lola who does not take long in taking up new lovers each more powerful than the last. Her ascent  showcased by climbing ladders up to the suspended cage above the ring represents her social climbing as a courtesan. At the height of her career she was the mistress of the then politically troubled King Ludwig of Bavaria the Mad King played successfully and effectively by Anton Walbrook.Lola is played by Martin Carol a French model and actress who in real life died tragically. For this role Carol did not accentuate the sensuality or free spirit of the eponymous heroine who was known to be quite liberal independent and highly sexual. This would be because it was the repressive 50's and sex was definitely not accepted on film or on television. Carol portrays Lola as a dignified woman adding a touch of class and even pathos. She's even a victim of a maledominated and cruel society. She's a quiet submissive object of beauty as still as the Odelisk painting she poses for en rose or in the nude. The sad finale makes us feel very sorry for Lola. While we think she will die from that high jump to the center ring especially because she has just relived her hard life through memories and endured much public inspection by shameless spectators. However she lives but barely as a sad resigned woman who is possibly living her last days as the object of attention though this time to her own detriment. Her glory days behind her she's nothing but a sideshow now where men pay for a kiss from her. My favorite scenes Lola as a young girl on a cruise with her mother who is bent on marrying her off Lola dancing at the Paris Opera Ballet Lola and Liszt Lola and her indiscreet affair with the married conductor of the Tivoli cabaret Claudio Pirotto. And of course the scenes with the King Ludwig. And that finale still gets to me.".

This would be because it was the repressive 50's and sex was definitely not accepted on film or on television. Carol portrays Lola as a dignified woman adding a touch of class and even pathos. She's even a victim of a maledominated and cruel society. She's a quiet submissive object of beauty as still as the Odelisk painting she poses for en rose or in the nude. The sad finale makes us feel very sorry for Lola. While we think she will die from that high jump to the center ring especially because she has just relived her hard life through memories and endured much public inspection by shameless spectators. However she lives but barely as a sad resigned woman who is possibly living her last days as the object of attention though this time to her own detriment. Her glory days behind her she's nothing but a sideshow now where men pay for a kiss from her. My favorite scenes Lola as a young girl on a cruise with her mother who is bent on marrying her off Lola dancing at the Paris Opera Ballet Lola and Liszt Lola and her indiscreet affair with the married conductor of the Tivoli cabaret Claudio Pirotto. And of course the scenes with the King Ludwig. And that finale still gets to me.";

At other times you would swear that Josef von Sternberg made a 50s comeback in color so packed are the frames and so obstructed are the sightlines the only thing missing is the Sternbergian closeups. Then you might wonder if Bertolt Brecht had a hand in the screenplay so alienated are we from the emotional core of this woman's life.The film seesaws between a circus act starring the middleaged title character Martine Carol and flashbacks to her past. In the circus setting ringmaster Peter Ustinov presents a series of impossibly lavish tableaux which depict points in Montes's scandalous life. The flashbacks include her first marriage her dalliance with King Ludwig I of Bavaria Anton Walbrook and her relationship with a Bavarian student Oskar Werner. In reality Montes never appeared as the star of such a circus act but this film's creators have chosen to present her life in these terms in order to cast her as a metaphor of the celebrity freak no different in essence from a circus animal who jumps through hoops or a daredevil who engages in public spectacle. She is almost always seen from a distance as if to emphasize her actual insignificance. The parallels to our contemporary celebrity culture are obvious.But beyond this commentary on celebrity and the technical virtuosity of the busy sets and panning camera there is nothing much here. There is certainly no compelling drama. The central character is so distanced from the viewer that she can only be grasped as a concept not as a human being.And I have to agree with others that Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge comes to mind but even that endless Carnival Cruise Ship commercial had a clear central love story.".

Before she sells out to Ustinov Lola lives for love exploits it for all she's worth and is exploited for all she's worth. In despair she turns to Ustinov's show where she daily and literally recreates her fall from the heights of romance to the tawdry center ring where her life is exposed to question and ridicule from the cheap seats. Not a bad flick. I thought the cheesy storytelling techniques  the flashbacks the elements of predictability of course she's going to meet the King of Germany her dangerously weak heart and the concerned doctor  were ham handed by design slyly selfmocking.

The movie is nice to look at with rich colors and interesting circus scenes. I wonder if the film has been worked on because it literally glows. It's the self importance of Carol and the tiresome people who seem to bring it down a bit. I never felt sympathy for her character her arbitrariness just lost me. Franz Liszt looks like the second place winner in a Fabio lookalike contest. Then we are to feel great sorrow for her because she needs to stay in a dormitory for a short time on an ocean voyage. Because she feels slighted she begins to get this crust about her and begin to use people. She is a courtesan in the true sense. Carol just doesn't work. Now Marlene Dietrich. There you go.

A millennium viewer's eye is unkind to this era.I am one of many who see this film as a clear precursor to Baz Lehrman's MOUIN ROUGE. Lots of spectacle with a story behind it  sometimes literally behind it seeping through like a remembered waltz. It should be clear from the circus setting that we are in for a heavily artistic analogy that is jokingly selfreferential. This is a story of woman who has not only sold her life story to the rabble but sold herself as well. Beauty is a commodity with a limited shelf life and life is to be lived while you're young. The inside joke that this dancer had very little talent but was world famous certainly still could be applied to many stars  or  ahem  children of stars who have their own coattail careers.Many of today's audiences don't see the appeal of Martine Carol but she is exactly the prototype of the 1950s glossy ideal. Many men don't like all the makeup but she is undeniably a beauty and the bust to waist ratio is still the kind that makes men stop and stare the 1950s word was stacked. Far from being wooden she is playing a beauty trapped by her looks. The acting style is an older more presentational style but that was still being done in the states in many films at this time too. Given that the context here is a circus performance and that a lot is physically being required of Ms. Carol she deserves more grace from modern audiences..Ustinov makes the most of his stage presence in this role and overall this film gives us a wonderful interplay between the layers of being onstage backstage asides and aborted conversations and the interplay of memories with what is currently happening. It is a confectionery layer cake that is rarely attempted on film. When you notice that a hard boiled clown is running the show without a care whether his performers die this clearly is not a story to be viewed only for its surface.Meanwhile the surface is early Technicolor lovely brisk and bright with tremendously artistic imagery and sweeping music. The bedroom scene with Lizst and Lola shot through a wrought iron frame surrounded by red curtains these are film images that live in the mind that can not be denied. The subtle echos between the Circus sets and the real sets are both silly and smart  the latter often being obviously fake sets as well. This is part of the layered reality. The art design echos elements of the silent film Les Enfants du Paradis. This would have been more obvious to film fans in France in 1955.This film has been called subtle it could also be called unclear even nihilistic. This philosophy was certainly in vogue in '50s Europe. We are left to ponder if all gilded cages are still just cages and if any road leads to a happy ending. More than anything it is the closing of this film that makes LOLA greater than the sum of its parts and makes you sit back and think.".

Plus although the actress playing Lola was not completely unattractive I had a very hard time imagining men falling for her.";

	schema:reviewBody "Restored to its original form for the first time since 1955 Lola Montes made an immediate impression on critics' circles nationwide after its screening at this year's New York Film Festival and for good reason Max Ophuls' largely forgotten swan song is a work of art rooted in oldfashioned Romanticism yet at the same time crafted with such cinematic power that its content and characterizations have barely aged.Directed by Ophuls and starring French actress Martine Carol in the leading role Lola Montes is equal parts classical melodrama and groundbreaking cinematic exercise. Ophuls' camera glides effortlessly through the air introducing us to the film's setting in grandiose fashion. As the circus sets the tone of artifice flashbacks begin to act as the primary storytelling device As the ringmaster Peter Ustinov promises the most sensational act of the century costumed performers take the stage to reenact the life of Lola Montes the Irishborn dancer who set out to conquer the hearts of men.The film's depiction of Lola's brief tryst with renowned composer Franz Liszt is more or less true to history. So is her welldocumented seduction of King Ludwig I of Bavaria a relationship that eventually led to the latter's fall from grace and abdication in the midst of revolution. A telling conversation between the two affirms Lola Montes as a tragic character study You like my dancing? Lola asks eagerly her eyes lighting up. The King's blunt answer all but encapsulates Ophuls' flawedheroine subtext Not at all he says. But you know how to trigger a scandal excite an audience. And that is the most important thing. Though the film feels significantly slowpaced for its twohour running time it is no short on content. Breaking away from conventional narrative structure is nothing new to Ophuls and it is seen here in Lola Montes to an astonishing degree. Between the elegance of the flashback sequences and the squalidness of the circus the film hints at the transient nature of time blurring the distinction between memory and reality. The cyclical nature of the film reveals itself as Lola's relationships blossom as quickly as they deteriorate. In Lola Montes Ophuls presents the heroine as a woman to be reckoned with a persona that in the end brings her both pleasure and despair.Yet there is still more about Lola Montes than what meets the eye. It is a director's film in the truest sense and any evaluation of it should be taken in the light of the history of the medium itself. Ophuls himself alternated between a celebrated career and relative obscurity though his cinematic contemporaries held Lola Montes in high regard filmgoers at the time shunned it for what they perceived as a hollow and artificial attempt at commercial moviemaking. Tellingly both Ophuls and his subject are now more remembered for the dizzying heights they once reached than for the missteps that led to their intermittent downfalls.But no matter scaling heights means next to nothing for femme fatales like Lola. In a key sequence near the end of the film our heroine stands breathless at the top of the circus beams her eyes vacant devoid of seduction starving for attention. As part of the final aerial act Lola prepares to take a dangerous leap of faith. Will she accept the protective net underneath or risk her own safety by falling freely into a void of uncertainty where life and death are equated by chance? The audience holds its breath for her response but she leaves them hanging. What other choice besides the riskier alternative would one expect from Lola Montes?".

Less evident are the abilities of George Auric and Christian Matras soundtrack composer and cinematographer respectively who having worked on many of the finest French films of the period clearly did not put their best efforts into this project.The flaws here are too numerous to list.  Foremost among them are the utter ineptitude of Martine Carol as Lola Montes a disastrously twodimensional screenplay with an anticlimactic ending the series of intrusive flashbacks a corny stereotypically romantic French score the use of a painfully vibrant Technicolor palette Ophuls' everpresent annoying use of the moving camera.  Only the inclusion Maurice Chevalier or Cantinflas could have made this film worse.  It is amazing to think that this was the first film on which Marcel Ophuls director of The Sorrow and the Pity cut his teeth as a 28 yearold assistant director.The virtues of Lola Montes on the other hand are too few to list.  Even the credits are horrible.  It is a debacle of the highest order and one ought not to waste two hours of one's life on it.  The very fact that certain critics include it on top ten lists does not speak to Ophuls gifts but rather the lack of taste among supposed film cognoscenti.

Actually this motive was appealing to Ophuls in general  lost earrings the dance of the masked man and down the line but here it uses a life as its opening premise. Actually the film is not really concerned with the title character as with the men whose lives it touches. In that capacity Martine Carol fulfills her role quite adequately. There's not much to see in Lola  she is portrayed in two dimensions throughout the film and her character was never intended to come to life. The men around her on the other hand are a wonderful lot with totally different responses to Lola's seductiveness and this is at the core of the film. The colors of the circus are fabulous and the season's of Lola's life depicted in some of the most sophisticated color schemes I've ever encountered. The wintry blues and whites in the palace with the snow depict the end of one man's life while the autumnal shades of her affair with Liszt were breathtaking. Someone reported that Phuls had actually painted the ground around the carriage to simulate the end of an affair. My only objection in the entire film is George Auric's overuse of his beautiful opening music at the film's beginning. It outlasted its welcome unfortunately.

This is the only color movie he did and the last movie he completed as well after passing away way too early in 1957. It's a beautiful colorful looking movie that has some of the usual typical Max Ophls ingredients in it as well.I can definitely understand people finding Max Ophls boring ones to watch. They are not just movies for just everybody especially not for todays usual type of audience. Luckily the majority of people still seem to be able to appreciate his movies and his more slow but very stylish and strong way of storytelling.It's narrative is probably the movie its strongest point. It isn't necessarily the story itself this time that makes this movie stand out. It's a movie that follows a plotline set in the present combined with another story that of Lola Monts life told in flashbacks. It's an approach that works out so well and interesting for the movie.I wouldn't exactly call this movie a real biopic since it only focuses on some of the early years of Lola Monts her life. In all honesty I think her real life and character was much more interesting and complex than the one that is being told in this movie but that would had simply made an entire different movie. So it really doesn't matter that this movie takes a lot of liberties and only tells a small part of Lola Monts her entire lifespan. This was simply not the approach that had been chosen by Max Ophls who simply tried to tell a good compelling compact story about an intriguing woman. Max Ophls always seemed to have had a fascination for female behavior and especially for those that didn't simply went with the flow and did other things than were expected from them. He did this even with movies that were about simple housewives and was not afraid to show people how they often really are and that not everything is always black and white in life.Like basically every big Max Ophls movie this one is a period piece which means that is has some great looking sets and costumes that this time even catch more attention since it got all shot in color. But that doesn't mean that it distracts from the story or all of the other typical Max Ophls elements that make most of his movie so incredibly effective and compelling to watch with this one included.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Being German I was especially impressed by the passage set in Bavaria because at that point it became obvious to me that it was not just Lola's story Ophls was telling but he sort of identified with her.There is this storyline when the king and Lola are still focusing on art while the selfrighteous revolution is breaking out and though I did not know at the time I realised that it must have been the same for Ophls when he was a director in Germany and the Nazis were gaining power. The king's longing look out of the window at all that was lost haunted me. Then there is this scene where Lola gets saved by the students fleeing Munich in the middle of the night just like Ophls left Berlin at the last moment. When I was at the Parc de Bercy in Paris to watch the restored version I sensed the great silence in the audience. Maybe like me they were thinking of all these people who had not been so lucky.I'm so sorry that this masterpiece was not regarded as such when it was first released and even more at the fact that it was butchered subsequently. Sorry also that Ophls himself witnessed this but yet again grateful for the effort displayed in restoring it to its original beauty.".

	schema:headline " Not just a onewoman show";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is often billed as a 'onewoman show' a study of an extraordinary character Miss Jean Brodie played by an excellent actress. However the movie is much more than that. It is a study of charisma and influence of teachers and students and presents a complex and fascinating comingofage story. This study takes place through the movie's doublefocus on both Jean Brodie and her most precocious student Sandy. Sandy is the strongest and most independent of Miss Brodie's students and eventually she rebels and rejects her teaching completely. However she is also truest to her teacher's expressed goals. Miss Brodie supposedly wants to teach 'her girls' to be like herself powerful independent individuals free from the shackles of authority and groupthink beyond conventional sexual morality. In fact she preys on the weakness and insecurity of her students punishes independence and rewards slavish loyalty to her and to her personal plans and ideals. The film's more subtle concern with fascism and authoritarianism echoes this theme fascism elevates great individuals and praises their strength just as it demands total obedience and slavishness from the rest. Sandy by recognizing and rejecting Miss Brodies's actions and plans becomes her truest student not only sexually adventurous but bold independent and confrontational. The final scenes illustrate this beautifully. Miss Brodie has truly put an old head on Sandy's young shoulders and she truly is hers for lifethough not in the way originally intended. In this way the movie presents a profound sophisticated and realistic account of the way powerful individuals influence one another.".

And then ... against the greys of the girls the greys whites and blacks of the staff  wonderful houndstooths and glen plaids especially on the headmistress  Miss Brodie impossibly slim and hipless in radiant plums flame colors paisleys and asymmetrical jackets. If only I could have a tailor like that.

My jaw actually dropped when we saw her with the painter did they film over a period of years I wondered? How could that little girl be THIS young woman? Going back and watching  the schoolgirl uniform the tousled short hair the whole expression look in the eyes everything. The oversized glasses. The most convincing precocious12yearold performance.

Hey I do remember being 12 and yeah it was like that! 5 That incredible dance scene the 2 girls tangoing while speculating on doing it. Fantastic blocking. And funny and charming as hell. I especially like Sandy's aggressive cranking of the Victrola. I personally detested the painter  the whole notion of the father of 6 tomcatting about well yuck  and his manhandling of the ladies is simply vile. But those were the times I suppose.

	schema:headline " My extended review of the film";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' is a film that is rich in ideas. It tackles themes such as favouritism stereotyping sexuality ontology and questioning. But more important than these issues that it explores well the film is highly multilayered and it manages to look at how things appear on the surface against what they really are. The film is a brilliant piece of work however it is almost impossible to praise it without spoilers. So much of the film's power depends on the contrast between the start and finish of the film. This is emphasised by the use of the same type of scene at the beginning and end  with all of the emotional events wedged in between. Please do not read on any further unless you have already seen the film. I would hate to spoil the extraordinary experience of watching this film without knowing what is going to happen.It is an amazing achievement for a film to make you love the protagonist at the beginning then hate her at the end and this film does that. It is not because Smith's character changes that we start to dislike her but rather because our perception changes in the film. On the surface Miss Brodie appears to be an affectionate caring woman who is fun to be around. But we eventually sink beneath the surface and realise how manipulative she is and how she is stereotyping and confining her girls when she praises them on their individual virtues. She doesn't care for the girls as children of her own but more so her own tools. As Sandy points out in the final confrontation Miss Brodie sees an individual function and narrow objective with each of her pupils.The film explores ideas about love too but it is actually more so manipulation in the end. The way that Miss Brodie draws men into her like she is using them when she sees fit. She says that she is in her prime because she is at a stage in her life when she can control all elements  including the headmistress. She likes being around young minds because they are so easy to influence and with the male teachers at the school she uses her 'feminine charms' to entice them. She does not however have any means by which to control the female adults and therefore she is not on friendly terms with any of them.The acting in the film is excellent by all concerned. Maggie Smith is cunningly brilliant as the heroinevillain combination of friendly wit and below surface ideas that are almost sickening like trying to create a younger version of herself in Jenny to satisfying her lovers. But it is really Pamela Franklin's film. Her character matures in the film defies stereotyping and sees beneath the surface. There are not words to describe how perfectly she plays Sandy and considering that she was 19yearsold at the time she plays a 12yearold girl with amazing realism. She justly won the National Board of Review award for Best Supporting Actress and it is certainly one of the performances that I have seen of the decade if not of all time.The technical side of the film is not strikingly amazing however some shots in the film are very carefully composed and it seems more as if the director has decided to emphasise the script and performances rather than try to create a visual feast. And there are deeper reasons for this too because the film is about things on the surface not being as they seem. On the surface the film has the look of any typical 1960s drama but if you look beneath you should find a stunning thoughtprovoking film that will stay in your mind long after the final credits.".

She says that she is in her prime because she is at a stage in her life when she can control all elements  including the headmistress. She likes being around young minds because they are so easy to influence and with the male teachers at the school she uses her 'feminine charms' to entice them. She does not however have any means by which to control the female adults and therefore she is not on friendly terms with any of them.The acting in the film is excellent by all concerned. Maggie Smith is cunningly brilliant as the heroinevillain combination of friendly wit and below surface ideas that are almost sickening like trying to create a younger version of herself in Jenny to satisfying her lovers. But it is really Pamela Franklin's film. Her character matures in the film defies stereotyping and sees beneath the surface. There are not words to describe how perfectly she plays Sandy and considering that she was 19yearsold at the time she plays a 12yearold girl with amazing realism. She justly won the National Board of Review award for Best Supporting Actress and it is certainly one of the performances that I have seen of the decade if not of all time.The technical side of the film is not strikingly amazing however some shots in the film are very carefully composed and it seems more as if the director has decided to emphasise the script and performances rather than try to create a visual feast. And there are deeper reasons for this too because the film is about things on the surface not being as they seem. On the surface the film has the look of any typical 1960s drama but if you look beneath you should find a stunning thoughtprovoking film that will stay in your mind long after the final credits.";

You think she is going to be the hero of a sentimental romance as she bucks the backward and narrowminded establishment...but she turns out to have some dark corners of her own.Her love of flair and romance has led her to admire Mussolini and Italian fascism. That may sound strange for a liberal teacher but it was typical in 1930's Britain. The left had embraced proletarian realism so visionary artists like T.S. Eliot and D.H.

Of course this was a delusionary paradox for none of these artists and certainly not Miss Brodie would have fared well under a fascist regime.She takes great care to see that her pupils her gairls get the best possible education in the spheres she cares about  truth beauty and romantic history the practical details of life receive less attention. Her idealized enthusiasm for Franco in the Spanish Civil War causes one of her more vulnerable and suggestible pupils to volunteer to go and fight for the fascists in Spain  where she is killed in an airraid as soon as her train crosses the border. This part is not as unrealistic as viewers have complained there was active profascist recruitment in Ireland and Quebec so there might have been in Edinburgh.Spoiler At the end the most sober and practical of her gairls Pamela Franklin confronts her and exposes the falsehood of her pretensions  you're a dangerous woman Miss Brodie. So she probably is but that's only because the system is so stupid and backward that an imaginative and energetic soul like Brodie can outshine everybody else even though she is morally misguided.This is an examination of a complex personality so stay away if you are looking for good guys and bad guys.

Both men want her to marry them but she is too flirty she'd say independent to do so. None of this sits well with the prim head of the school Celia Johnson  the sad heroine in the classic Brief Encounter. It also does not sit well with Ms Johnson that Brodie has developed a minor cult of personality with those girls who have her as a teacher. She constantly refers to the students as her gails and boasts she transforms them into young women by opening up their minds.Actually she does open them to appreciating art life love  she encourages them to experiment with men but she is closing them to modern realities. Like many people in Great Britain in the 1930s like George Bernard Shaw for awhile she appreciates the firm let's get things done attitudes of Fascists on the continent like Mussolini and Franco she does not mention Hitler however. She believes them far more superior than the seemingly drab upholders of constitutional government like Stanley Baldwin the current Prime Minister in 1936 or Ramsay MacDonald the previous one. That the latter two in the long run did less harm than her heroes did is something she never gets a chance to talk about. In the novel and in a longer television version on Masterpiece Theater back in the 1980s Jean does get her view thrown into her face  a refugee from the continent is invited to tell about how wonderful the Fascist revival is there and the young woman gives Jean and her students an angry earful about how wonderful these leaders really are! She does have a bad affect on one chubby somewhat slow girl named Mary MacGregor. Mary is convinced to run off to Spain to fight with her brother. But Mary happens to join Franco's side and is killed. Her brother was fighting Franco.Johnson in the end is assisted by her school spies one is a silent wormy little woman whose brother is a local Presbyterian church elder and by one of the girls who seems to come to her senses. In the end Jean is forced to leave the school and confronts the girl who turned on her whom she labels an assassin.Actually the event are a little complicated here. The girl is having an affair with Robert Stephens and sees he still carries his torch for Brodie. Fed up she is determined to get her vengeance on Brodie and she tells Stephens why he will always be a thirdrate painter. She is triumphant over Brodie but she is aware that her character has been shown to be selfish and sneaky and will never change. Johnson does get rid of Brodie but has to be truly underhanded to do so. And Brodie for all the shame of being forced out by these two still has her own sense of selfworth comparing herself at the end to her ancestor Deacon William Brodie the Edinburgh carpenter cleric and town councilor who was also a burglar at night and was hung publicly on a gallows he had constructed. Brodie might be down for the count as the film ends but she will survive. Possibly better than her assassin will.Deacon Brodie's story is better known to most people than we think. Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Tale of Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde was based on this tale.".

Jean Brodie is a teacher in an Edinburgh girls' school in the 30s her unconventional ways endear her to her students if not to her superiors in the Presbyterian capital. But her students come to realize that her love of art and admiration of Mussolini have blinded her to the real implications of romantic idealism. Note also excellent performances by Pamela Franklin as the leader of the girls Sandy Stranger and Robert Stephens as the married art master Teddy Lloyd who can neither escape his attraction to Jean nor protect her from her eccentricities.

Celebrated British actress Maggie Smith had performed the role of Miss Jean Brodie on stage and was the first choice to play the role for the film with terrific reason. She won the Oscar for Best Actress 1969. The film is set in 1930's Edinburgh Scotland before the onset of WWII as Fascism rises in Europe. Smith portrays Jean Brodie an eccentric idealistic emotional artloving freethinking and influential schoolteacher for a conservative private school for young girls. She is essentially a free spirit a liberated woman who in her own words puts old heads on young shoulders and teaches young girls to blossom into individual independent and adventurous heroines who think for themselves and who inspire others. But her methods  namely extracurricular activities such as outdoor picnics boat trips attending art galleries and the opera are contrary to the principles of the school. Moreover her constant lectures about nonconformity to the status quo sexual freedom and discovering one's self is completely out of tune with the repressive conditions of the time. In effect she's preaching the same things which were to be found in college campuses in the late 1960's. This causes controversy especially when she butts head with the school headmistress Miss Mackay wonderfully played by veteran British actress Celia Johnson. Things become even more difficult when she becomes the center of a love triangle. She is loved by two men  the shy musicvoice teacher Gordon Lowther and the marriedwitchildren art teacher Teddy Lloyd Robert Stephens. She was formerly Mr. Lloyd's lover but she has now become Mr. Lowther's lover. Her class of young girls at an age in which they become curious about sexuality discover Miss Brodie's love affairs though keep it to themselves. While most of the girls follow her blindly one girl  Sandy Pamela Franklindecides that she will not conform to Miss Brodie's teachings this occurring when she develops into womanhood and finally thinks for herself. So ultimately the story's theme is about the relationship between teacher and pupil. Miss Brodie admires Fascism something which seems to have happened after her time in Italy under the rule of Mussolini. When she passes on the spirit of zeal and fervor to her most impressionable student  Mary Jane Carr it results in Mary leaving England to find her brother who has gone to fight in Spain. Due to misinformation she seeks Franco's army to fight along with them but dies tragically. This finally strikes a blow to Sandy who betrays her teacher telling the administrators that she was responsible for teaching sedition and radical politics. Sandy's betrayal is at once a seemingly spiteful act and proof enough that she is possibly her most dependable student who has learned and applied her own teacher's lessons. Though it was not quite as Miss Brodie wanted Sandy has proved to be her own woman and has freed herself from conforming. Everything has backfired. Miss Brodie is quite Fascist and dictatorlike in her own way teaching independence and liberalism but only as long as the girls grow up to be quite like her. Maggie Smith and Pamela Franklin take the lead in this drama both having terrific chemistry especially noteworthy is the final confrontation scene. This is possibly Maggie's Smith greatest role and one she must be very proud of. Wonderful script and bittersweet music by Rod McKuen which won another Oscar for Best Music The Title Song Jean. Filmed on location in England and Edinburgh. This is a mustsee film for fans of Maggie Smith and those who love engaging drama.".

	schema:headline " An Idealistic Fascist";
	schema:reviewBody "Jean Brodie is a teacher at an exclusive Edinburgh girls' school in the 1930s. She is a complex character embodying attitudes which today seem contradictory. She embraces progressive educational ideas at odds with the school's conservative ethos preferring to interest her girls in art culture politics and philosophy rather than the official syllabus. She stresses that the word education is derived from the Latin educere to lead out seeing her role as leading out her pupils' own ideas by encouraging them to think for themselves. The teaching style of the headmistress and other teachers she characterises as intrusion from intrudere to thrust in the stuffing of heads with useless information. In the twentyfirst century these progressive ideas might now seem outdated in their turn but in the thirties they were daringly radical.Her politics however seem incompatible with her educational philosophy. She is an unashamed Fascist an admirer of Mussolini and Franco even encouraging one pupil to fight for the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. Yet she is not a wholly unsympathetic character.It was highly controversial for Muriel Spark the author of the original novel to give a Fascist sympathiser positive qualities. It is normally an unwritten convention that such characters can only be depicted as outright villains. Communist sympathisers can be portrayed as romantic idealists even in stories set at the time of the Stalinist purges like Barbra Streisand's character in The Way We Were but Fascists never. There was however a time in the early thirties when Fascism seemed to many to be a viable system of government if only because the alternatives seemed so unappetising. Liberal capitalism during the Depression seemed to offer only mass poverty and mass unemployment Soviet Communism only mass terror and mass starvation. For those like Jean Brodie Fascism was not what it seems today the political expression of irrational hatreds but rather an idealistic belief that the choice between the Hooverville and the Gulag between the Jarrow march and the Ukrainian famine was no choice at all and that there must be a third alternative.Jean's educational philosophy is clearly inconsistent with her political one. She never considers whether teachers who distrust authority and encourage pupils to think for themselves would be tolerated under a Fascist regime. As her lover Teddy points out she is a romantic idealist who projects her own ideals onto the leaders she admires if she had to live under their regimes she would probably be bitterly disillusioned as she is a natural rebel against authority. Despite her views on education she always refuses to seek a position at a progressive school.Quite apart from her politics Jean has a number of weaknesses. Her educational philosophy is elitist concentrating on a select group of favoured pupils at the expense of the others and promising to make them the crme de la crme. Her love life is unconventional for a spinster schoolmistress of this era she is the lover of two male colleagues one of them a married man. He is unable to leave his wife for her because he is a Catholic but one who follows his Church's teaching on divorce far more faithfully than he does that on adultery. She is however devoted to her girls who mostly repay her devotion in full. When one of them betrays her to the headmistress we can sympathise with her.Although Teddy and Jean's other lover Gordon play important roles the main dramatic conflicts are those between the female characters between Jean and the headmistress and between her and Sandy the girl who denounces her for her political views. In her dealings with the headmistress our sympathies are with Jean Miss Mackay is a sourfaced reactionary who bullies anyone who crosses her and is amazed when Jean stands up to her. Although Miss Mackay objects to Jean teaching politics in the classroom she shows her own political sympathies by putting up posters of Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin.In Jean's dealings with Sandy our sympathies are more mixed. Sandy is a rather serious girl very sure in her ideas an attractive girl but one who hides her attractiveness behind thick pebble glasses. She objects not only to Jean's political ideas particularly after the girl who goes off to fight in Spain is killed but also to her style of teaching and the fanatical loyalty she attracts from some of the other girls a loyalty Sandy sees as dangerous. Yet Sandy who is a rival for Teddy's affections may also have personal motives for her act of betrayal.Two things about the film need to be mentioned. One is Rod McKuen's haunting theme song Jean replaced in some recent versions by an orchestral arrangement. The other is director Ronald Neame's use of colour. The predominant colour apart from a few outdoor scenes where the green of vegetation predominates is grey of the buildings of Edinburgh of the classroom walls of the girls' uniforms. This tone however is relieved by the bright colours reds oranges pinks and purples favoured by the more freethinking characters such as Jean and Teddy. Conservative ones like the headmistress dress very much in monochrome. When Sandy is shown dressed in a bright colour it signifies her growing independence of mind except in her case the colour is blue a colour otherwise not much used in the film.Maggie Smith well deserved her Best Actress award for her portrayal of Jean which brought out all the many facets of her complex character. Her Scottish accent also sounded very convincing. The other remarkable performance in this film is from the teenage Pamela Franklin as Sandy it always surprises me when watching this film that she did not go on to become a major adult star. Although the film was not itself nominated for an Oscar I have always regarded it as one of the most intelligent and significant British films of the late sixties. 810".

Even as they move to higher classes they remain Brodie Girls and frequently spend their free time with her and her artist coteacher. She has assigned each of them their life's choice  one will be a great beauty and take a love at an early age another will become a great revolutionary another is destined to become a spy. What Jean Brodie does not realize is that one of her charges Pamela Franklin in an oscarworthy performance is not only rapidly learning Miss Brodie's lessons but is coming to understand just how dangerous Miss Brodie is to young impressionable girls. The finale is dramatic. If there is a mar to the film it's that Rob McKuen actually sings the words to his pop song over the credits.  The music without the words would have been better. This is one of those movies where one can read the book afterwards and not be disappointed.".

She has assigned each of them their life's choice  one will be a great beauty and take a love at an early age another will become a great revolutionary another is destined to become a spy. What Jean Brodie does not realize is that one of her charges Pamela Franklin in an oscarworthy performance is not only rapidly learning Miss Brodie's lessons but is coming to understand just how dangerous Miss Brodie is to young impressionable girls. The finale is dramatic. If there is a mar to the film it's that Rob McKuen actually sings the words to his pop song over the credits.  The music without the words would have been better. This is one of those movies where one can read the book afterwards and not be disappointed.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie hit an entertainment trifecta so to speak. A successful novel by Mary Spark a successful Broadway play with a 379 performance run in 196769 and finally an Academy Award winning film you can't do better than that. Not to mention the Tony Award it won on Broadway for Zoe Caldwell. The starring title role is a choice one it garnered both a Tony and an Oscar for the two different actresses who played it.On screen once you see Maggie Smith play the headstrong teacher Jean Brodie from a girl's school in Scotland in the Thirties you will not forget her. If you've seen the Alfred Hitchcock classic Rope you have some idea what Jean Brodie is all about. In Rope James Stewart plays an iconoclastic teacher who talks about superior beings and later on he sees what kind of influence he's had on impressionable youth at the fancy prep school he teaches at when Farley Granger and John Dall do a thrill killing because they've convinced themselves they're somehow superior.Stewart's students do damage to others Maggie Smith's charges do damage to themselves. Smith's students drink a little too deeply from her advice about being adventurous women and exploring the world. She's also an admirer of 'superior people' who become leaders and her example is Benito Mussolini in Italy who was legendary for making the trains run on time in his country. She also encourages her students to explore their sexuality initiate themselves with an affair with an older man all in the name of becoming worldly and modern females. That does not sit well with principal Celia Johnson who vows to get rid of Smith. In the end Johnson has ample ammunition to do the job. Young Jane Carr as the naive girl who takes Smith all too seriously goes off to Spain to fight in the Civil War there. Carr's brother is already there but Carr listening to her teacher extol the virtues of that superior leader Franco goes and enlists on his side. She gets herself killed in Spain.But not before Pamela Franklin decides to lose her virginity to art teacher Robert Stephens who Smith was involved with. She also becomes a sadder and wiser girl way too young. But she delivers some really biting lines at both Smith and Stephens exposing the pretensions both have.One thing that American audiences might not get is a small bit where Smith covers the portrait of Great Britain's Prime Minister at the time Stanley Baldwin. Baldwin was the Tory Prime Minister in his third ministry at this point and he was first elected with the exciting slogan of Safety First. That could mean many things but what it was taken by the British public to mean at the time was a calm and quiet leadership a British version of Calvin Coolidge. Hardly the kind of guy that Jean Brodie would admire like Mussolini or Franco.Jimmy Stewart finds out and realizes just how his philosophy has effected his pupils but for Miss Jean Brodie she remains absolutely clueless to the end. Nevertheless Maggie Smith's bravura performance of this clueless teacher won her a deserved Oscar.The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie also got an Oscar nomination for Rod McKuen's song Jean in the Best Song category. But the Academy voters gave the award to Burt Bacharach and Hal David for Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head. They were clearly the best songs in 1969's field.Though Maggie Smith got the Oscar a lot of the other performances were also unforgettable. Celia Johnson Pamela Franklin Robert Stephens and Gordon Jackson who played another teacher that Smith was involved with are memorable you will not forget Jane Carr as the touching and naive young girl who dies in Spain trying to impress her idiotic teacher. She should have been nominated herself in the Best Supporting Actress category.Jean Jean you will not forget clueless Jean Brodie once you've seen the film.".

The title character is a 30something teacher who adores breaking the rules and teaching her girls about things that are often neglected in schoola love of learning and a lyrical outlook on life.This is an interesting film as it does NOT take a black  white view of Miss Brodie and her teaching methods. In other words the character has both admirable qualities as well as disturbing ones and is quite humansomething I did not expect to find in this film. On one hand she is a wonderful teacher in that she instills a love of learning and does not just simply drill the students as the school would have her do. She is educating the girls to thinksomething quite rare in the teaching profession I'm a certified teacherdon't get me started on thisjust believe me that many teachers simply teach AT the kids!. She is also fun and loves lifewonderful lessons for the girls. However on the other she is a fervent admirer of Mussolini and Franco not so unfashionable back in the 1930s but Brodie is almost orgasmic in her praise of them and practically turns many of these young minds into lovers of Fascism. In addition she has many lapses in her moral judgment and seems to need the children because they were so suggestible and devoted to her. In some ways her unconventional morality isn't always such a bad thingshe is a genuine free thinker and doesn't blindly follow. But on the other hand she is a fool and takes many unnecessary chances around the girls with her affairs one with a married manand it's not surprising that eventually the girls would be pulled into these peccadilloes.As you can see from my description of Brodie this film is one that might bother some viewers. If you are looking for a film where the characters are clearly good and bad this film will challenge you. It is full of interesting but flawed characters. For example while the reasons for Miss Mackay's vendetta against Brodie are suspect Miss Brodie clearly poses a risk to her studentseven while she inspires and educates them in the world. In the end Brodie is a complex and rather pathetic charactermaking this a movie that you cannot soon forget.The film is full of fine performances and is a topnotch film. In particular I loved the scene with Pamela Franklin Sandy and Brodie Maggie Smithespecially because young Franklin did a wonderful job playing this supporting rolethe only one in the film who could stand up to and best Brodie. I am actually surprised Franklin did not receive an Oscar nomination for her performance though Smith won the Best Actress award.Finally one thing that surprised me about the film was the chronology. While the film begins in 1932 and seems to take place over only a couple years part of the film concerns the Spanish Civil Warwhich began in 1936. While not a serious error I was surprised that they didn't catch thisparticularly as the film was only made three decades after the conflict ended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I whole heartedly agree and its a shame that the motion picture industry has digressed to nothing but safe. This film is first and foremost a character study enhanced by Maggie Smith's performance in the lead role. Following just two years after Sidney Poitier's popular and dynamic turn in To Sir with Love this film presents a somewhat more complex portrait of a teacher. Here the teacher is not completely heroic. Although Miss Brodie ultimately is as Sandy determines dangerous her philosophy of life and her dedication to her profession are both very admirable. One can only hope that the students who aren't selected as Brodie girls learn as much about goodness and  beauty as Sandy Mary Macgregor and the rest of the group. Pamela Franklin gives a stunning performance and its too bad she didn't get a career similar to Jodie Fosters. Jane Carr is also very good as the sweet stuttering Mary. I think Jean Brodie's life philosophy is actually a very good one. It's just that she teaches it too zealously and comes in contact with some very impressionable young minds. But it is still hard to hard to argue when she labels Sandy an assassin. If you enjoy this picture then definitely see To Sir with Love and Conrack starring Jon Voight. They are three remarkable films about three remarkable teachers.".

Her innocence and naivete some might find implausible sort of a cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland.  I can buy that critique but she's still fabulous partially because she's unlike anything I've ever seen before.This film is unbelievably beautiful filmed by Eric Gautier and part of what is so unique about this film is how it doesn't ever show what you'd expect. It's always surprising and despite it's length the film never reveals more than it needs to.  At 163 minutes it's extremely concise to a fault I'd say which is one of the wonders of this film. It's filled with brief moments which are simply stunning some of the best you're likely to see all year and all these moments add up in the end to an extraordinary film experience.  The family moments are unique Ian Holm is brilliant and what this film has to say about the theater hasn't been seen in films since Cassavetes' Opening Night  or perhaps Chaplin's  Limelight.

As everything else in this film her acting is unique  it is completely her own  neither British nor American nor anything else I have ever seen. There is something mesmerizing about it.The lengthy unbroken natural shots are wonderful reminding us that we have become too accustomed to a few restricted ways of shooting and editing.";

Watch out for cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins and the dark lord himself who has a fetish for KG. So much overthetop fun and the songs are so catchy. The car chase was by far my favorite scene. I know this will earn cult status right away and win over some new Tenacious D fans just like me. I hope this does well in the theaters.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw The D's new film tonight at a special advance screening and I was so blown away by its sheer greatness that I felt I had to come onto IMDb and get the word out. Admittedly I was already a huge fan of the D's work  I loved the HBO series and listen to their music weekly there's nothing better to sing along to but this appreciation actually made me more apprehensive going into to tonight's screening for we've all been disappointed one time or another by something we love when it attempted to make the jump to the big screen. With Tenacious D's The Pick of Destiny this is not the case.Simply put this film rocks harder than anything I've seen and is funnier and more majestic than anything Peter Jackson Pixar and Will Ferrell together could produce. It tells the story of the D before we came to know them setting up intriguing histories of Kage and Jables' upbringings their comings together and how they were inspired to write songs about such things as Lee Sasquatch and Dio. Most importantly they reveal the true inspiration to the Greatest Song In The World Tribute and how it came to be which is different than the HBO Series' version. After you've witnessed it you probably won't be able to remember it hence the Tribute but your mind forever be changes by its genius.I don't go out to movies very often anymore due to the high ticket price and the hassle of getting parking paying outrageous concession prices etc. but I usually make exceptions when it's starring someone I really love or concerning something of the the same variety. The Pick of Destiny was so good that I have no qualms going back to see it again when it releases nationwide and I plan on convincing all of my friends to go too. Last week we saw Borat and loved it but this is honest to goodness TEN TIMES BETTER. For anyone who truly loves rock music and comedic brilliance see this film. These guys' talent is so great you should have no hesitation supporting their cause. You will not be disappointed and the Rock Lords will smile upon you favorably.".

I had a decent respect for Tenacious D before seeing the movie and now I am MAD about them. I will most definitely buy their album when it is released on the 14th and will see this movie again.If you were on the fence about seeing this movie GET OFF AND GO SEE IT!! It is worth the extremely expensive price of movie tickets these days as you will surely bust a nut laughing during the whole thing.Aside from the comedy the glorious and divine music that flows from KG's guitar and JB's voice is awe inspiring. The audience is left in a stupor that such beautiful harmonies and amazing riffs can be created in conjunction with such ridiculous and hilarious lyrics. If for nothing other than the music itself this movie is worth the price of admission.With a wonderfully coherent storyline tying in almost all aspects of the traditional D history and hallmarks great new songs hilarious comedy and some pretty awesome cameos this movie ranks up there with the best!

Even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long i still wanted more at the end  also there is a scene after the credits which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie!! I suggest this to anyone who loves a good comedy and Definitely suggest it to fans of The D or Jack Black.

The movie is hilarious and delivers nonstop laughs. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work perfectly together having been real life friends and coworkers for over 20 years. The film is in part a musical. All or most of the music was written and performed by The D. All of the songs are new material and many of them are classic. The soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. This film will be mostly appreciated by fans of Tenacious D but if you are not a fan of The D I still think you will enjoy the movie. If you are a fan of the D then you must see this movie. The acting isn't as bad as you may think and the laughs and crudeness never stop coming. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to get their socks rocked off and laugh as hard as they have laughed in a long time. Look out for cameos by Dave Grohl Ronnie James Dio Meatloaf Ben Stiller Amy Poehler Tim Robbins John C. Reilly and Neil Hamburger. Also stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits.".

The humor reminds one of Something About Mary in that they often go places you'd thought they wouldn't but it lacks the scatological humor of South Park.

It starts off with a metal song and a young Tenacious D running off to Hollywood to become a rock star promising an entertaining film at the least. But things go rapidly downhill ever since Kyle Gass appears on screen. The film loses focus at times and shifts to silly subplots here and there. The soundtrack is great and that's what kept me watching along with Jack Black who is good while the rest of the cast are annoying. Having watched 'School of Rock' not too long ago perhaps I was expecting something on that level but to me the humour in 'Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny' did not work and I found most of it irritating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very mild spoilers a basic plot outline no real details IF you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations. I saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in Maryland and the only reason I agreed to go...was because it was free. I expected a few chuckles but as I have never been a huge fan of Tenacious D not much more then that.The first ten minutes of the film are hilarious as we are given a look at Jack Black's humble Christian origins in a Midwest American town. The film then takes us years into the future to the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name. Finally as the title suggests the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled Pick of Destiny. Again the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face. That said there were times it felt a bit long it's only 100 minutes but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter. The story is every bit as absurd as it sounds and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot. Which is fine except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss...and when they miss they miss bad. Same thing with the songs it is a musical but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so...then kept going anyway.I will say that the Rrating really saved this movie from bombing The D's humor simply couldn't work without cussing sex and drug references. But unless you're a real fan of the band or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy I would recommend you save yourself some money and rent. Pick will make you giggle a bit...but is it worth 9 bucks? I don't think so. I was tempted to rate it a 6 but since I do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres a 7 seems more appropriate. Just be sure it's your style.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny The concept of writing a film review for the Tenacious D movie may seem slightly unnecessary as just about anyone upon hearing about the film most likely already had a sense of whether or not it would interest them. Fans of the duo's rockcomedy album and cult classic television show or the incessantly energetic Jack Black will have jumped at the prospect of an hour and a half of unfiltered Tenacious D madness and those who generally would not gravitate towards such forms of entertainment will have already uttered a groan and discounted any possibility of seeing the film. And while the film will prove highly entertaining for those who would normally take to this sort of thing it falls short of being strong enough to win any fans outside of its existing demographic  those who were fans of Tenacious D already will be satisfied but those previously unimpressed are unlikely to change their opinions very drastically after experiencing the film equivalent. Director Liam Lynch seems for the most part content to sit back with a camera rolling leaving Black and Gass free to do what they do best  namely pull the infectiously energetic and likable slacker rocker schtick which exposed them to the public eye in the first place. What is unfortunate is the consistent feeling that the material feels too watered down to really excel as a film and reach the full comedic potential the premise originally boasted. While the occasional comedic gem may float along for the most part it feels like these occasional high points are too inundated in mediocre sequences to be truly memorable. It's hard to pinpoint exactly where the problem lies in terms of content the film plays upon the same themes and plot points which made Tenacious D so crudely enjoyable in the first place but the material feels a touch too familiar by this point coming across as still enjoyable but merely cute or chuckle worthy rather than the real belly laughs which should have been evoked. Another crucial component of the band's charm the music also sadly falls short of the duo's previous material. While the film boasts a superb opening sequence and song explaining Black's oppressive religious home life and his determination to break free and become a celebrated rocker after the opening credits the music sadly never rises above anything more than satisfactory. However the orchestral music backing up the band's music at crucial plot points was an inspired touch adding to the faux 'epic' feel to the pair's overzealous quest as do the tarot card transitions between plot points  another clever touch. Traits like these are what make the film ultimately rise above mediocre and add style and class to what otherwise might have fallen apart at the seems if not packaged effectively. While the film is unquestionably centered around Black and Gass themselves while both are sufficiently entertaining to carry the film even though its weaker points simply by their raucous charm neither can boast the film to be among their most comedic or entertaining performances to date. And while none of the background players have very much to do whatsoever it's in the wonderfully injokey cameos that the film really excels. Tim Robbins in particular is flat out hilarious as a mysterious and unsettling 'Stranger' also in search of the fabled guitar pick and Ben Stiller is the funniest he has been in years in an excellent bit part as a guitar store employee equipped with garish amounts of rocker hair. It's also nothing less than a scream to see the legendary Meatloaf poking fun at his hard edged persona by playing Black's vehemently religious father in the film's opening scene as well as singing on screen for the first time since Rocky Horror Picture show. Foo Fighters musician Dave Grohl is memorably badass reprising his role as Satan from the band's music video and John C. Reilly makes an almost unrecognizable appearance as a flying sasquatch in an unsettling drug induced hallucination sequence. While the film may not win Tenacious D many new fans for those who previously enjoyed their work it is still easily worth a watch. There may not be a whole lot of new material and the songs may not be quite as caustic and catchy as in the past but Black and Gass's collective enthusiasm is enough to guarantee that the legend of Tenacious D will keep on rocking for quite some time. Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny may not live up to its boast of being the greatest motion picture ever made but it does certainly guarantee a highly enjoyable albeit forgettable hour and a half of inspired madness and head banging rock music. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Contrary to what the trailers would have you believe Tenacious D in 'The Pick of Destiny' is not the greatest movie in the world. It is just a tribute. The new movie directed by Liam Lynch Sarah Silverman Jesus Is Magic and going into wide release on Nov. 22 is truly a film for the fans of Tenacious D. The movie starts out promising with a young JB played by Troy Gentile who also played a young Jack Black in Nacho Libre defying his parents and calling to his hero Ronnie James Dio of Black Sabbath for help. After this he heads out to Hollywood and by the time he reaches the right one he is already grown up. Here is where the adult JB Jack Black King Kong Saving Silverman meets the slacker KG Kyle Gass Elf and is initially rejected by KG who claims to be an accomplished rocker. From this point forward the movie somewhat slowly progresses with a few funny bits thrown in as JB and KG become friends and form their band. The funny bits are mostly references to songs off their original CD so the band's fans will eat it up while others may find the sequences stupid or pointless. After a lackluster performance at a local club they discover that all the great bands seemed to have used the same guitar pick they go to the local music store to investigate. Luckily for them the music storeowner happens to know everything about the pick which cannot be purchased anywhere and gives them information to get them on their way. So the duo set off for the Rock n' Roll History Museum in Sacramento to find the 'Pick of Destiny' a magical guitar pick made from one of Satan's teeth. On the way they break up JB more interested in getting the pick and KG more interested in attractive coeds and JB heads out on his own while KG goes to a Sorority party. When JB is on his own he eats some trippy mushrooms and gets to meet Sasquatch leading to one of the film's funniest sequences while KG tries and fails to impress the college girls at the party. After this JB and KG happen to find each other at the Rock n' Roll museum where they search for the pick. Once they are finished there a predictable car chase occurs followed shortly by the climatic showdown between the D and Mephistopheles himself who has taken a sexual liking to KG. This scene embodies a lot of what the whole movie should've been like and ends far too quickly. Overall Tenacious D in 'The Pick of Destiny' seems to be just another mediocre entry into the 'stoner comedy' genre. It lacks a lot of the charm and laughs of the short lived HBO series about Tenacious D and doesn't ever live up to the rock musical that one would expect from the opening scene. The new music by Tenacious D was definitely a plus but it would've been nice if they played some of their classics in the film as well. The film also had plenty of cameos by the likes of Ben Stiller Tim Robbins and Meatloaf but most of them didn't add much to the movie. Fans of Tenacious D will appreciate this film as it gives JB and KG some much needed recognition but most others will likely find the laughs too few and the plot too stupid to truly appreciate it. Then again as Tenacious D once said it doesn't matter if it is good it only matters if it ROCKS! The Pick of Destiny definitely fulfills that promise.".

He teamed up with his mate Kyle Gass and together the two of them created a 'cult' band.Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny is a film about the fictional account of how the band formed.The film starts off with a hilarious song sung by Jack Black depicting his life as a child in a religious family who think of rock as The Devil's Music. Rock is JB's life and he feels that if his family won't accept that then he will run away from home. And he does just that. Many years pass as JB travels through LA he meets a street guitarist KG. Thinking that KG is a famous rock star JB decides to 'audition' for KG's socalled band. The two soon discover that fate has lead them to each other through unusual circumstances.Thereafter the film takes a giant leap into absolute ridiculousness. The new partners in crime go on a quest for 'The Pick of Destiny a guitar pick that has allowed all the legendary rock stars of today to play outstanding music that they had never heard before.The soundtrack features songs by Tenacious D and is a great addition to the film. Obviously this film is not meant to be taken seriously but I did not think it was executed very well.Jack Black has been a real disappointment to me lately. He is a comedic genius yet he is wasting his time on rubbish films. His most recent The Holiday dumbed him down so much that it was hard to believe that this was actually Jack Black. He was not allowed to show off his comedic abilities and was just in the film for lame comic relief.However this film was obviously made for fans of Black and Gass's band Tenacious D and will surely be loved by all of them. With its crude humour and offensiveness Tenacious D definitely won't give Borat a run for his money but will still entertain fans of the D.510".

Packed with catchy tunes punchy wit and some of the best visual gags check out Tim Robbins scenes and the powerslidei have seen in a while this is a must for any D or jack black fan.The storyline is perhaps not to be taken seriously....at all maybe. The idea of the pick that makes rock and roll bands the greatest is certainly hilarious though. Jack Black and Kyle Glass are fantastic as are the deranged cameos from both fellow frat packer Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. Both are incredibly funny and provide some great scene stealing moments. Liam Lynch directs with competence and manages to capture the life of the band as he has done in the music videos. The film is just bursting at the seams with laughs and had me laughing the whole way through.I cannot recommend it enough any person who is in to rock music in some extent should appreciate the rock and roll history museum and the film on the whole. Great just great and I feel privelaged to have seen this before it came out SCORE!".

	schema:reviewBody "A film which starts perfectly using the animated Kage and Jables seen in such classic videos as FHG and Classico spoofing THX with the power of Farts.As much as i hate fart jokes gosh darn it when they are done by slackers and not by animals damn they rule. From this we get into an ultimate rock opera named Kickapoo with young JB rocking out about Christina family and his uptight father played by Meatloaf who really wails on the song. And when Sabbath's Dio sings to JB to keep him informed of what to do via a poster wow it's ultimate classic rock no Nirvana in sight well not for an hour and a quarter because of course Dave Grohl the Nirvana drummer reprises the Devil for the film.After a brilliant start the music keeps going as the credits are done using Tarot Cards some which i have due to the deluxe version of the soundtrack. I rule hee hee. And then we enter the story with young JB now being JB and meeting KG on Venice Beach where JB interrupts KG's brilliant guitar work with an improvisation over Bach and there they hate each other and we see Lee for the first time.Now if you have never seen the show Lee is their fan he's the person who really likes them has a website for them but fears them when they become obsessive and fears for his life. Lee here is just a simple Pizza dude but heck he's not too important in the film it's just it's Lee he gets recognition.KG soon tolerates JB after a parody of what seems to be getting as hip as Scarface A Clockwork Orange but i can't see how a lot of people will recognise the spoof rather think it's just a skit but nonetheless the comic disturbance of seeing Jables being beaten by Americans pretending to be English in white suits is nice and with a Training Montage following it to level the pace any uncomfortableness is forgotten.I haven't talked much about the music of a lot of it mainly Kickapoo but the music is top notch rude crude classic and also you rehear songs from the series mainly History and the opening tune and the first strummed part of Explosivo but it's still amazing especially on a huge screen.The story of the film is just crazy to pay the rent JB and KG after finding their band's name Tenacious D on their arses try to make a song that will win them the cash at Open Mic Night. It starts off like Episode 1 The Search For Inspirado but teeters onto crazy classic ness when they spot that every great rock band had the same Pick forged from the tooth of the Devil in the Middle Ages as we are told by Executive Producer Ben Stiller's Guitar Store Dude and that the Pick is in the Rock and Roll museum in Sacramento.From this they travel to Sacramento where they meet Tim Robbins' brilliant Tramp character as perfectly done as anything complete hilarity. From this we get into the greatest call back to the TV series during a drug trip in which JB finally meets Sasquatch.It's a road trip of a lifetime with less road less trip and more guitars but it's pitch perfect continuing the brilliance of the TV series the film gets every joke it wants to in and has more laughs than Black claimed there were more than 1 Orgasmic jokes here and just watching KG and JB on the big screen is epic but wait there's the amazing ending to talk about.Having had to re film it as test audiences didn't recognize the Blues Brothers parody yet Clockwork Orange was noticed? it had to be re filmed and as much as i'd love to see the original this is fantastic.Dave Grohl reprises his role as a Demon here the Devil from the video Tribute he is offered KG if he wins a rockout but otherwise would have to stay in hell AND pay their rent we get an amazing song to end it. Grohl lays it out in a harsh voice that's piercing to the eardrums as we get KG and JB making plans and a synchronized and held very long Fuuuuuuuuuucccccccc and hilarity ensues. Great lyrics to a brilliant song reveal what is the best song in the world that Tribute is based on and believe me it's pretty much there in my eyes.134 minutes long starting and ending with fart gags and including Cck push ups and laser deactivation with genitalia scenes Tenacious D is obviously not a film for the whole family nor for Commercial Black fans but for Fans of the series it's the ultimate movie clever stupid brilliant rocking and has great cameos. Fast fun and pitch perfect i urge every fan to see it not so much the rest though you won't get it.One more thing they even mention Rocket Sauce that's how special it is. 1010 easily and the best cult and comedy movie in the last 20 years!".

Except to his assistant Nula what he hasn't told his work colleagues is that he is gay and that he is in a long term relationship with a sports lawyer named Sam. Eric feels that he can't be openly gay as an exhockey player or as a public figure still associated with professional hockey.

I was fully prepared not to like it at all as most gay themed films of the last several years have been so disappointing.Yes it is a little predictable in the sense that you ultimately know how a story like this is going to turn out. Novelty for the sake of novelty doesn't help stories either and this is a solid well told story. The small turns of the story were not predictable though. I particularly liked that this Canadian production did not reach for the obvious over the top emotional climax an American production would have. For example it resolves Tom Cavanaugh's work conflict with far less drama then I would expect from a gay themed film. The script deflates the situation in an interesting and realistic way recognizing that the film is foremost about the relationship between Eric and Scot and not about Eric's closeted work situation.The acting is really really solid. The cast feels like an ensemble not a group of actors vying for screen attention. It takes awhile to realize that Tom Cavanaugh with his usual nonshowy performance is the adult lead. Noah Bernett as Scot hits it exactly right. A very tough character for an actor of any age to get right. Some criticize the script saying that the character is way too flamboyant for a boy this age. But that is exactly the center of the book and the film for this character to be so unapologetically out there and flamboyant that he challenges gays even more than straights. He's not supposed to be a typical gay kid. In fact part of that challenge is that he and we do not even know for sure what his ultimate sexuality might be. As it is he is sort of a child genius of fun fashion and cosmetics. His character is supposed to make us uncomfortable and challenging to our assumptions.Cinematography and production design are first rate. I heard that the overall budget was well under 4 million if so then bravo to the production crew it looks like more.".

Never before have I been so touched by a film as I was by 'Breakfast With Scot'.Obviously not being a movie critic my mind is having issues putting the feeling I have into words. The acting was superb with very believable characters. And the children! Oh the children! Every single one of those kids really took over their role and although I didn't see as much of them as I wanted to they each made me feel like there could be a whole movie just about them. And yes I even liked the slightly homophobic but in a cute way neighbor boy. He was actually my favorite character out of the whole thing.The main thing I can say is that this is a beautiful movie. Everything about it felt real. This is a movie you can relate to whether you're gay or not. It shows how not only the gay community is evolving but how the world is evolving right along side it. The story unfolds in a way where you find yourself relating to the ideals and logic of each of the characters in turn and in the end you will most definitely leave embodied with a sense that the world is as simple as you could ever want it to be.

Also the ending credits with the pictures on the fridge and matching names was very memorable too. I guess I would call it a chick flick for all types of chicks male and female gay and straight. Based on this movie these Canadians are portrayed as bitchy compassionate unpredictable charming and sensitive and hilariously funny people. Good ensemble cast. Tom Cavanaugh's performance was spot on. Noah Bennett was very expressive and showed real depth of acting range. Wonderful script also. Very refreshing take on parenting and what it means to be in a modern family. Relationships take work and this movie depicts the real life stress involved in keeping every member of a family content. Each character has to compromise. Great movie for the Holiday season. I wish more movies like this were made today.".

Everything else seemed like that's the way it would happen given that circumstance... The acting was fantastic and the plot itself was just so unique and refreshing.And of course having watched it with zero information I had no idea there was any kind of gay theme whatsoever until the plot revealed itself. This movie is not about being gay  it is about relationships. The 'gay' part of this movie should hold no bearing on whether to see it or not. I am not gay and I LOVED it. I bought a copy. In fact I bought two copies and gave one to friends of mine that I felt might be not openminded enough to see it on my simple recommendation. They enjoyed it too.Everyone should see this movie.

Tom Cavanaugh is one of the most watchable comedic talents anywhere Ben Shenkman who reminds me a lot of Harold Ramis was equally superb and young actors Noah Bernett as Scot and Dylan Everett Ryan really shined in their roles as well. There are plenty of laughs and poignant moments in equal measure with the underlying theme of accepting and loving others for who they are. Hockey is a major focus in the film but it can be enjoyed by those who aren't familiar with the game.

The lives of Eric and Sam turn upside down with the boy and Eric gives his best efforts to give a father's influence to Scot. Breakfast with Scot is a funny and corny gay movie with a predictable story. It is funny to see the gay Eric trying to educate Scot as a man since the boy is also gay. My vote is six.Title Brazil Uma Famlia Bem Diferente A Quite Different Family";

There is NOTHING here that we haven't seen before done better. Second  it looks and feels more like a television series comedy rather than a real film... all that's missing is the laughtrack which maybe would have been a good idea as I saw NOTHING in this film that was even mildly funny... Third this is supposedly a gaypositive story... yet uses every single clich imaginable. The kid wears makeup has a feather boa and just generally comes across as the most flaming queen since Divine. I'm sorry but no kid that I have ever known had EVERY clich down pat. Also how many gay men who are afraid to let ANYONE know they are gay would be living with another guy openly in a committed relationship?? You have to have gone through a fair amount of gayconsciousness to allow that to happen... Oh and the kiss between the two men at the end of the film was the most perfunctory sexless emotionless useless kiss between two guys that I have ever seen on film. There is NOTHING in this film that is even mildly believable. The dialogue sounds pat and scripted not lived or realistically felt. The camera work is adequate but certainly not memorable. Of all the Canadian films I have seen over the years this one is the most tired boring badly scripted piece of crap I have ever seen.If anyone on this site wants to see truly GOOD Canadian writing and directing go see C.R.A.Z.Y  a French Canadian film with true heart honest laughs a REAL sense of family and a much better representation of anything gay.".

That being said if you want everything themes character development etc. to be a surprise I advise all readers to stop reading and watch the film for themselves.Drama  The protagonist of this film is seen by everyone else as a prime example of a masculine man what with his past as a Toronto Maple Leafs player and the child he and his partner are supposed to take care of is rather feminine wearing makeup being fashion conscious etc.. This contrast is a great source for the conflict needed to move the plot.  Not to specify any part of the plot but I found the Fun and Games beat takes a while everything after Fun and Games happens in the last 25 minutes.Spectacle There really isn't anything good or bad in this department I can say other than that hockey not ice hockey just hockey otherwise it's not being respectful to the sport is always a big thing in Canadian culture personally I'm sick of it but I'm not a sports person anyway.Substance  As you could guess from the Drama section gender expression and parenting are the main topics in this film and I feel that they are well handled i.e. Is it right to deny someone else's freedom of expression for the sake of societal conformity? What if that someone else is a child you are supposed to take care of? Is doing so considered necessary parenting? These are questions that form the change for the protagonist throughout the film or last 2530 minutes to be more accurate.  I have to ask is it necessary to present masculinity and femininity as extremes in this film particularly the latter? I can see teenage or young adult men wearing makeup for femininity's sake but not necessarily 10 year old boys I could be wrong since I've never met a 10 year old boy wearing makeup. With the this sort of extreme situation which I don't feel to be entirely justified in the movie I think this film will have a harder time connecting to audiences and people from the real world.Overall as much as this film is flawed I still find merit this film has to offer and I didn't feel like my time is wasted.

The focus on the film is the child named Scot and his living life to the fullest regardless of how society sees gender roles. I liked that it was not the worn out theme where straight guy is uncomfortable with a kid or person not conforming to typical male gender roles rather this was about a semicloseted former pro hockey player that learned about his own internalized issues while learning to love this new child in his life who he becomes a dad to.

	schema:reviewBody "At its heart Breakfast With Scot is a story about acceptance and being true to who you are. This is one of those feelgood movies that I could watch again and again and I do!. There were a couple moments where it fell a little short and I feel like they could have done more in a couple of the speeches etc. but the point still gets across. Noah Bernett Scot does a great job portraying the campy ambiguously gay tween who is struggling with the recent loss of his mother and navigating the confusing waters of what is and is not considered acceptable in society. Helping or hindering is one of his temporary caregivers Eric played by the charmingly adorable Tom Cavanagh. Cavanagh expertly plays the quickwitted fasttalking straight laced nononsense former NHL enforcer who believes that his private life is exactly that. Of course however Scot comes along and turns life as Eric and his partner Sam Ben Shenkman knew it upside down and Scot ends up teaching the grown ups a life lesson or two. The gayest thing about this movie is Scot who happens to have a preference for wearing his mother's makeup and jewelry but aside from that it's nothing for anyone to truly get uncomfortable over if that's a worry you might have about either watching it yourself or with someone else. There are a few curse words here and there but aside from that pretty clean fun. If you love a good Indie film or are just looking for something in the LGBT category to watch I would definitely recommend Breakfast With Scot. It's sweet and endearing.".

I think Scot should have his uncle Billy Colin Cunningham and his beautiful fianc as his second step parents too because they look to be nice folk. Even if Billy is such a womanizer he would be the best father figure in my opinion haha!The scene I didn't understand in the movie was when Scot hit his best friend on the Hockey pitch he didn't apologise straight away in which normally films have people apologise in what they did wrong. It's a good Film and funny too!".

Scot recently orphaned after his mother dies from an overdose is unexpectedly dropped into their lives. He is very flamboyant and the total opposite of his new caregivers.

The boy is trapped. But no pity please we've run out of tissues.Luckily the stepfather being in Brazil the boy Scot has to be entrusted to someone and that's the brother of that Brazilian stepfather the brother and his boyfriend.The film is funny because of the disturbance it introduces into the daily life of these two men who have to learn how to take care of a child of a boy take him to school make him socialize introduce him to sports and the neighbors teach him how to fight to defend himself and his reputation when he is accused of being gay with a nice little ugly word for it and when the men who are taking care of him are also accused of being gay with another nice little ugly word for it.Then the film becomes interesting because the boy Scot little by little gets tricked and then trapped in his new life without actually denying what he is or what he feels. He learns how not to kiss everyone especially the boys or how not to hug everybody especially the boys for no reason whatsoever.Then the rest you'll have to discover. The ending is slightly mushy because the director wants it to be pink and nice but it is so improbable that we have to suspend our disbelief so much we get vertigo. But that's all right provided you accept the idea that it is supposed to teach the bigots a lesson. But does it really? Entertaining though maybe too rosy to be true.

Did these primitive neverdeveloped images really exist? If so where are they?  Why A? It's an alphabetical choice. Every filmmaker remembers the first time he looked through the viewfinder of a camera. It is a moment that is not so much the discovery of cinemabut the discovery of the world.

The atmosphere of the film is admittedly extraordinary aided by the terrific cinematography of Giorgos Arvanitis Angelopoulos' collaborator since Reconstruction 1972.But the incredibly dense philosophical context of the film does not stop there as Angelopoulos depicts the tumultuous history of twentiethcentury Balkans with extreme precision and artistry.Harvey Keitel gave the best performance of his career even managing to speak a few sentences in Greek without sounding too awkward. Maia Morgenstern as symbols for Penelope Nausikaa Circe and Calypso in her multiple roles and Erland Josephson are also quite good while Thanassis Vengos gives a tragicomic note to the film with his performance as the taxi driver.The fact that I am Greek and therefore I am familiar with the political situation and able to identify with events better admittedly played a major part in my interpretation of Ulysses' Gaze and nonBalkan viewers may find it difficult to identify with the film.

	schema:headline " An obsessive search";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER insofar as some final scenes are mentionedFor me an Angelopoulos experience is unlike anything the contemporary cinema has to offer.  His work has a grip that totally mesmerises and leaves me unable to think about much else let alone see another film for several days. Although the pace of this passionately committed cinema is slower than most artists would dare to adopt the fast forward button is an option I would never contemplate.  I embrace the adagio tempo as I would the slow movement of a great symphony for here indeed we have the time to ponder on what we are being shown to search for meanings that are not always readily clear. I suspect the reason so many viewers misinterpret the Greek master's work is impatience.  Several viewings are essential to unravel these multilayered visual poems.  When Eternity and a Day came to our local art moviehouse I had to rush back to see it on a second evening not enough to assimilate it fully or venture to say what it meant but sufficient to give me the feeling that together with Landscape in the Mist it could be one of the most profound experiences in any art form in the last quarter of the 20th century.  I would not make a similar claim for the rather uneven Ulysses'Gaze but at least closer familiarity gives me the confidence to question many of the interpretations I have read.  Although it takes the Balkan conflict and in particular the plight of Sarajevo as much of its background it is not a war film.  Neither is it a story of a man's journey to find himself.  However anyone observing the different behavioural patterns of men and women will have picked up on the obsessiveness of men with their hobbies as opposed to women.  Unlike girls boys swap cards in the playground to obtain sets.  This mania for collection often develops into adulthood until a point can be reached when it might mar a man's relationships with a women.  The cinema is littered with examples from George Cole's obsession with kites in the British Quartet to the young man's anger when his wife messes up the order of his record collection in Diner. In Ullyses' Gaze we have the profoundest exploration of man's obsession with one enthusiasm to the detriment of everything else in his life.  The central character's search for the missing reels of the earliest Balkan film footage is made without regard for his safety through war zones to the extent that he hardly knows where he is at times.  Is this Sarajevo? he bewilderingly cries to people whose only concern is to escape sniper bullets.  Although he meets several women always played by the same actress during his odyssey he is unable to make lasting relationships.  In possibly the most revealing scene in the entire film he weeps as he embraces one of his companions  Why are you crying? she asks.  Because I cannot love you is the reply.  In the background is a huge statue of Lenin about to be shipped on a barge down the Danube for a collector we never see undoubtedly the hero's alter ego.  At one point he takes refuge in the memory of his mother again the same actress and family.  During a remarkable held shot of a room in the family house in Constanza five years of history are chronicled through three New Year's Eve parties.  It is the most marvellous use of truncating time without breaking action that I know. The penultimate scene of the massacre in the mist is sickening.  It is about as awful as the ending of Zanussi's Constans possibly more so because of the false hope that precedes it.  But although this forces the hero to question his obsession there is no indication that he has conquered it.  At moments as dreadful as this the obsession almost becomes a solace.".

In possibly the most revealing scene in the entire film he weeps as he embraces one of his companions  Why are you crying? she asks.  Because I cannot love you is the reply.  In the background is a huge statue of Lenin about to be shipped on a barge down the Danube for a collector we never see undoubtedly the hero's alter ego.  At one point he takes refuge in the memory of his mother again the same actress and family.  During a remarkable held shot of a room in the family house in Constanza five years of history are chronicled through three New Year's Eve parties.  It is the most marvellous use of truncating time without breaking action that I know. The penultimate scene of the massacre in the mist is sickening.  It is about as awful as the ending of Zanussi's Constans possibly more so because of the false hope that precedes it.  But although this forces the hero to question his obsession there is no indication that he has conquered it.  At moments as dreadful as this the obsession almost becomes a solace.";

However working in several languages takes it's toll and much of the english narration is weak and clumsy.  That said he still paints some great pictures and the themes are mostly well developed.  The scene where dialogue is played out in a misty screen for 4 minutes is great  while the huge Lenin statue is mesmerising.However the english is weak and other flaws creep in.  The use of the same woman to play several characters is an art movie clich and just annoyed me as it seemed to serve no purpose.  Keitel is not very good.  He looks distracted at times  like the fact that he doesn't understand the language affected his ability to relate to those speaking it.  His english dialogue is clumsily written but he does well for many key scenes.Overall this didn't deserve to beat Underground as it is too long has scenes that don't work and dialogue that is clumsy rather than poetic.

Rather than the unwinding of the complex narrative itself it is the visual power of the images that Angelopoulos offers us that make this work so disturbing and beautiful. You have to watch the film as a series of paintings poems installations and performances rather than a conventional movie. The acting is superb especially Harvey Keitel's performance one of the best that this great actor has ever delivered. Especially memorable is the scene in which an old woman is taken for a ride to her hometown in Macedonia by Keitel. The woman left Macedonia before the advent of Communism and is now returning to her country for the first time in decades. Since her absence her place has been transformed in a nightmarish communist city filled with gray impersonal concrete buildings. We see the woman helpless and bewildered in an environment that she no longer recognizes while Keitel goes away. A powerful metaphor of the fast and tremendous transformations suffered by the Balkans during the 20th century. This is above all a lesson in history. A poignant monument to the memory and fate of Europe.".

Not that the Underground was a bad movie. But the Gaze is better. The Gaze touches the source of the problem in the Balkan region. Balkans is a very beautiful region with wonderful landscapes and people with long history. There is where the problem is. There is too much history in the Balkans. Too many cultures too many religions and too many political conflicts. The lost innocence of the Balkans which the hero the director A is looking for throughout the movie is offered to the viewer through the movie's wonderful cinematography. There you see the best of Northern Greece Macedonia Albania Serbia Bulgaria and Romania. Many cities have different names in different languages.  Many people fight with each other too. What remains in the end is the bittersweat taste of a region where virtue and malice go hand in hand.    One final remark. I agree with many critics who pointed out that the movie has some technical flaws including its extremely slow pacing. Yes the movie could have been faster a.s.o. But hey have you ever seen a better glance of the lost innocence of the Balkans?People who have visited or lived in this region can surely appreciate this motion picture even more.".

Angelopoulos' characteristic long takes in this instance serve more than giving the film a poetic atmosphere. It is necessary for his goal of looking carefully on individuals' lives and describe their joys and sorrows.

Now after viewing the compelling and stunning Ulysses' Gaze I can highly recommend both the music and the film. The music and the movie are exquisite partners. The cinematography is truly breathtaking. I was taken with the intense yearning and empathy of Harvey Keitel as the Ulysses of the quest but especially struck by Maia Morgenstern as the female focus of the film. She is brilliant. And the great Erland Josephson is wonderful to watch. Although the movie is quite long its richness and unusual perspectives are impressive thoughtprovoking and profound.

The scenes are an interaction between your mind and the screen.  An image is produced and the director leaves the image for you to contemplate.  Images shouldn't be beamed into minds as 10 second clips like Moulin Rouge.  So many people explain to me their love of movies as a form of entertainment and escapism. Movies are an art form but like everything in this postmodern age they cannot exist without the deep intellectual objective view point dividing the subjective experiences.  Ulysses' Gaze does not REQUIRE patience it rewards contemplation and understanding.Storywise the plot is just as basic as The Wizard of Oz.

	schema:reviewBody "Up until 1995 all of Angelopoulos' films had for their subjects Greece Greek history and Greek myths. He continues somewhat with Ulysses' Gaze but this time the filmmaker travels beyond the Greek borders into the neighboring Balkan countries. Angelopoulos was not trained in the method of the Actor's Studio. More importantly he believes that shooting in the actual locations of his stories enhances his sense of actually participating in the film itself and therefore produces better outcomes. Except for the scenes taking place in Sarajevo which were shot around Mostar Vukovar and in the Krijena region all the other scenes were filmed on location in Albania the Republic of Skopje Bulgaria Rumania and Serbia.Angelopoulos wrote the script with the collaboration of Tonino Guerra. In Ulysses' Gaze history is present but contrary to The Travelling Players where it was the theme and the group of players rather than any individual character was the star of the film in the present film history is now relegated to the background and since A's odyssey through the region is the main story we see a more conventional character in the personage represented by Harvey Keitel and also in the different characters who cross his path. However the dialogues are often stylized and this gives the actors especially Keitel a somewhat mechanical delivery with the exception of Keitel's last monologue. This is in keeping with Angelopoulos' intent to occasionally distance his viewers from their emotional responses forcing them to study and explore the identities of the characters. The Romanian actress Maia Morgenstern plays the parts of the four women. These women can easily be identified with the women Homer's Ulysses came across during his voyage. They also represent all the women whom A had loved and lost in past. Erland Josephson's is as always up to snuff.Giorgos Arvanitis Angelopoulos's long time collaborator is responsible for the stunning cinematography. Many of the scenes are long shots that are also long takes lasting several minutes Angelopoulos' undeniable signature. On several occasions during some long takes there is a shift in time emphasizing history's continuity. The film's first scene on the quay of Salonika is particularly remarkable in its lyrical construction.The music is by Greek composer Eleni Karaindrou. Her compositions for the cinema transcend the soundtrack's conventions. Her music does not merely accompany the story it is an essential element of it. The score is a counterpoint to the cinematic action and establishes an emotional climate combining with the image to express what cannot be said in words.As the title of the film announces Angelopoulos is taking us on a journey through the tumultuous Balkan region and on a timetravel through its 20th century history. It is after all where the Great War started in Sarajevo where the film ends eighty years later among more massacres and mayhem. Angelopoulos considers himself a historian of 20th century Greece who likes to bring lessons of the Hellenic myths into his discussions. I would like to emphasize that it is useless and even detrimental to the enjoyment of Ulysses' Gaze to try to see in this film the retelling of Homer's Odyssey in a contemporary context. Angelopoulos does not try to recount the Odyssey. Rather the Odyssey is merely a reference point and the missing films become the journey's Ithacan destination.On one level Ulysses' Gaze is a search for the roots of the cinema of the Balkans and more generally of the cinema itself. Ulysses' Gaze considers the importance of film in recording history and its potential in influencing its future development. Angelopoulos also suggests early in the film through the events taking place in Florina that film not the Hollywoodtype schlock but thoughtprovoking film such as his can influence people's lives.The second theme is of course the odyssey of A through the Balkans and as Ulysses was A must also be clever to overcome all the journey's obstacles in order to reach his goal the lost film reels. But this journey is actually the individual nostalgic journey of a man in search of his past his loves and his losses. A a GreekAmerican left his native country thirty years before. It is said that of all the immigrants who come to the United States the ones who long the most for their native country are the Greeks. Many eventually return home and A is just one more of them. Finally the film is also a Balkans history lesson. The voyage goes on its long and weary itinerary over this hostile region and as it proceeds we learn about past but also about present events which tore and are still tearing this area apart. Although Angelopoulos' political stand is well known the film stays clear of any political moral regarding the Bosnian war. Angelopoulos cannot help but be pessimistic in that respect. In Homer's epic poem Ulysses returns to Ithaca kills all the suitors and most likely lives happily ever after with his Penelope. But in Ulysses' Gaze Angelopoulos knows his history well the real Balkans are not nor have they ever been a heaven of peace. So the war goes on and A although having attained his Ithaca is still trapped in Sarajevo with all of his friends dead. For A the odyssey continues as he recites Homer's optimistic lines which are aimed at the future When I return. What has meaning to Angelopoulos is not so much the goal of the journey but the journey itself The story that never ends. Angelopoulos' films tend to be monumental and slow with striking images and a dreamlike rhythm. His films require audience participation through the viewer's memories thoughts and feelings. In these respects Ulysses' Gaze is undeniably an Angelopoulos film and certainly one of his masterpieces. Notwithstanding most American reviewers such as Roger Ebert who described Ulysses' Gaze as a numbing bore I highly recommend this film.".

That search takes him on a journey around the Balkans during the war. Angelopoulos wants to show us that just as we have lost our innocent gaze towards films there's no possible innocent gaze in a war no objective approach. There's too much history behind too much baggage too much hate. There are no good or bad sides everybody kills each other. That's why the final showing of the Mannakis tapes is so touching.

Yet in every scene the director chooses high selfcongratulatory concepts over plot not to mention subtlety.  Harvey Keitel is in a catatonic daze throughout the film  to the extent that I think he must have thought it to be acting simply to not break out in laughter at the pretensions of the director.  Despite some stirring and even a few intentionally humorous images this film is not worth the time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greek filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos's 1995 film Ulysses' Gaze To Vlemma Tou Odyssea is the first of that director's four films that I have seen that is not unequivocally a great work of art. Yes there are arguments that can be made in favor of that claim but at 173 minutes in length especially it takes the most out of a viewer especially considering that it's the least poetic of his films I've seen which include Landscape In The Mist Eternity And A Day and Trilogy The Weeping Meadow. This does not mean it is a bad film nor that it lacks Angelopoulos's trademark visual poesy it has that. But there are some missing narrative elements some poorly scripted moments and a too slow dramatic movement especially in the latter third of the film which takes place in the city of Sarajevo.The basic tale is that a nameless exiled GreekAmerican filmmaker played by Harvey Keitel and referred to as 'A' in the DVD credits and in many reviews although nowhere in the film is the character's name mentioned returns to the Balkans after thirtyfive years and is seeking to find three lost reels of footage from the earliest known extant Greek film made by the Manakis Brothers Yannakis and Miltos in 1905. They seem to be nearmythic figures who represent something akin to what D.W. Griffith was to American cinema although they were documentarians logging for decades the travails of the Balkans and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the first half of the Twentieth Century.Keitel's character seems to have more personal reasons for making this sojourn and several possibilities are hinted at in flashback scenes wherein Keitel simply wanders into his past or a dream sequence involving the claimed death of one of the brothers. Keitel speaks mostly in English while most of the other characters speak in Greek or the other native languages. The film does not rely on typical narrative to reveal Keitel's quest rather on a barrage of slowly developing images that subsumes the story into an emotional upwelling. Often the camera of cinematographers Yorgos Arvanitis and Andreas Sinanos slowly pans ahead of Keitel then back toward him or pulls away from a scene turns 90 or 180 degrees then swivels back and peers even more deeply at whatever scene it just left as if to signal that what seems the same is different which pulls a viewer into a closer reckoning of stasis vs. changeOverall this is a very good film. It also has a magnificently effective score by Eleni Karaindrou especially with great viola passages by Kim Kashkashian which seem almost organically part of Angelopoulos's visuals. Angelopoulos's film scores are perhaps the only ones which are the equal of the great Werner Herzog's films. This film's main flaws however lie in its screenplay. The film was penned by Angelopoulos longtime Fellini and Angelopoulos collaborator Tonini Guerra Giorgio Silvani and Petros Markaris but goes on a good 40 or so minutes too long. Some trimming of more pedestrian scenes by editor Yannis Tsitsopoulos some neat Ozulike elisions which Angelopoulos makes expert use of in other films and this film would have been a great film if just shy of a masterpiece due to several small forced moments of overacting and soliloquies tinged lavender in their prose 'If I should but stretch out my hand I will touch you and time will be whole again' uttered by Keitel. The film came in second at the Cannes Film Festival that year winning the Grand Prix not the Palm D'Or but it has taken a beating from some critics. In this country the most virulent review came from none other than that noted lover of Spielbergian tripe Roger Ebert who among other things wrote What's left after Ulysses' Gaze is the impression of a film made by a director so impressed with the gravity and importance of his theme that he wants to weed out any moviegoers seeking interest grace humor or involvement.It is an old fact about the cinema known perhaps even to those pioneers who made the ancient footage A is seeking that a film does not exist unless there is an audience between the projector and the screen. A director having chosen to work in a mass medium has a certain duty to that audience. I do not ask that he make it laugh or cry or even that he entertain it but he must at least not insult its good will by giving it so little to repay its patience. What arrogance and selfimportance this film reveals. Would that Ebert was so assertive about the vomit that the many Hollywood schlockmeisters he praises put out. Yes this film is not a laugh riot but there are some humorous moments such as Keitel's interactions with an old Albanian woman he lets share a Greek cab with him. As for grace interest and involvement? Well it's there even if it requires a bit of intellectual cogitation on the part of a viewer something that most Americans and American critics are unwilling to give. This is best illustrated by an anecdote Keitel's character tells of taking a Polaroid photo of an olive tree that when he watches develop shows that the tree was not really there. Yet we never see this anecdote's stunning imagery play out it's only related via words or the imagination therefore all the more effective in the way a great film like My Dinner With Andre is. Would that more people had that quality which Angelopoulos so manifestly owns in the best moments of this work and his other masterpieces for then even flawed but excellent films like this would get their proper due.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jennifer Anniston gives a beautiful heartfelt performance in The Good Girl' a film totally in tune with the rhythms of everyday life. Anniston' Justine Last is just one of the many people inhabiting this Deep South Bible Belt town who find themselves leading lives of quiet desperation imprisoned by the dreary sameness of their daily routines.  Justine works at one of those generic fiveanddime drug stores that so define the culture of Middle America.  Yet Justine's job and work environment are not the only sources of her frustration.  She is also married to a wellmeaning but dull blue collar worker who would rather spend the evening sitting on the sofa getting stoned with his partner than engage in any meaningful relationshipbuilding with his wife.  At the age of 30 then Justine is ripe for some kind of lifechanging experience when in walks Holden Worther an introverted obviously disturbed young coworker who sees in Justine the very soul mate he has been searching for all his life a person who will understand him and share his hatred for the life they are both leading.The Good Girl' is really about the contrast between what we would like our lives to be and what they really are.  Justine knows that the easy' choice would be to pull up stakes and simply run away with Holden abandoning a town a marriage and a husband she has come lately to both abhor and despise.  Yet something keeps Justine rooted to the spot something that makes her understand that any decision she makes will end up hurting someone in the end besides herself.  Perhaps she sticks around because she realizes that for all his faults her husband is in reality a pretty decent guy overall and that he really does love her.  Perhaps she also realizes that Holden is more mentally disturbed than she is willing to admit and that whatever life she might have with him would only mean exchanging one set of troubles for another.  Credit the Mike White screenplay with exploring the complex nature of the film's characters and relationships.  We never quite know where the story is headed or how all the issues will get resolved  if at all.  As in real life the story here keeps bumping up against new and ever more challenging complications and because we can identify with the messiness we are eager to go along with it wherever it chooses to take us. The film also does a fine job showing how life takes wholly unexpected turns at times such as when a fairly major character dies unexpectedly.  The casual suddenness of the death throws us for a loop since we so rarely see death portrayed that way in the movies.Miguel Arteta's deadpan matteroffact directorial style brings out the black comedy richness inherent in the material.  Amid all the pain and sadness there are a surprising number of genuine laughs in the film as we see our own lives reflected in the people and incidents there on the screen. Actually the film reminds us a bit  in its music its use of voiceover narration and its unromanticized view of rural life  of Terrance Malick's great 1973 film Badlands' a landmark in independent American filmmaking.Anniston who is probably in every scene in the film carries the picture with her rich and highly empathetic performance.  Even though her character is a woman slowly becoming deadened to the world around her she still retains that spark of life and that absurd hope for the future that make her worthy to be the centerpiece of an intimate drama such as this one.  Jake Gyllenhaal makes Holden both strangely appealing and a little frightening so that as Justine does we come to admire his uniqueness' of spirit he has adopted his name from the main character of his favorite book Catcher in the Rye' yet fear his increasing possessiveness.   John C. Reilly as Justine's husband Phil and Deborah Rush as Gwen Jackson Justine's sometime confidante at the store also provide memorable telling performances.  In fact there is nothing less than a superb performance in the entire film.The question of whether or not Justine is really a good girl' is as it should be left up to the individual viewer to decide.  Some may feel she is others may feel she's not.  What really matters though is that The Good Girl' doesn't try to impress us with the slickness that generally defines mainstream commercial filmmaking.  Instead it lets its drama unfold in an unforced believable manner so that even its moments of greatest absurdity seem somehow strangely real and lifelike.  It is a film that in its own quiet subtle way manages to get under your skin  and keeps you thinking for a long time after you leave the theater.".

What really matters though is that The Good Girl' doesn't try to impress us with the slickness that generally defines mainstream commercial filmmaking.  Instead it lets its drama unfold in an unforced believable manner so that even its moments of greatest absurdity seem somehow strangely real and lifelike.  It is a film that in its own quiet subtle way manages to get under your skin  and keeps you thinking for a long time after you leave the theater.";

	schema:reviewBody "Justine works at a supermarket in a small town and is married to her underachieving painter husband.  She feels trapped and unable to deal with the stagnant pool that is her life.  When a mysteriously dark young man begins to work at the supermarket she gets involved with him as a way out of her normal life into something more exciting.  However things get much more exciting that she expected.Rented by my wife as she searched for something in a sort of comedydrama. As always she has pretty good judgement and better taste than I give her credit for.  I had heard reasonable things about this film but I wasn't sure if it would just be another Friends clone comedy.  Happily my fears were not realised and this film is actually quite a brave shot at being a character study rather than another one of her hollow romcoms.  The plot looks at an ordinary woman who is living a life that is far below what she thought she wanted.  It is not spectacular but it works well on this level.  We see her pursue her supposed dream but only getting sucked into other things that she doesn't want for her life.  Not all the drama works as well as others and some twists and scenes are a little too much for such a lowkey film.The film has some laughs in it but not so many that it hurts the main drama of the film.  At times the comedy works well to compliment the main thread but occasionally it is misjudged and threatens to take away from it a bit. The fact that the film is quite down beat and lowkey might put some off as it doesn't really set the screen on fire however what it does do well is develop the character of Justine as you watch the film.As such the film does rely on the acting and the majority of it is very good.  As much as I dislike her performance in Friends and thus every repeat she's done in the films Aniston does very well here and her Justine is as far from her Rachael as is needed.  Likewise her character is as far from any life she has ever lived but she brings it to life and does develop well while still keeping it down to earth and relatable.  Reilly and Nelson have good roles that get better as the film goes on and they give good performances.  Nelson has the harder job of keeping his character within some sort of relatable reality and he does it well.  Gyllenhaal's character is harder to get and is not treated as well by the film but in essence he is the driver for Justine's journey and is developed well enough to do that. He plays him well and with Donnie Darko is in danger of only getting the weirdo kid' roles.Overall this is a good film that is maybe too downbeat and understated to be really called enjoyable.  It is good to see a Hollywood star make a film that is driven by her character and she rises to the challenge and gives a performance that although not earth shattering is certainly better than all the stuff she's been doing of late.".

I thought of him while watching The Good Girl a movie about a very ordinary person trapped in a hum drum existence. I've noticed some discussion in these reviews as to whether The Good Girl is a comedy or drama and I would suggest people stop trying to label the movie. The Good Girl clearly isn't trying to be either but simply a movie that captures the life of someone who feels trapped portraying both the drama and comedy inherent in life. It's a small studied intelligently written movie that's well worth watching.

Jake Gyllenhaal's role as a Holden Caulfield wannabe is well pulled off. I particularly liked how depressingly un attractive his drunken dramas were. You could see so many emotions in Justine trying to ignore what she didn't like about him trying to find something to love about him. Though my all time favourite aspect of the movie is the painfully realistic awkward sex and kissing. With an extreme but none the less effective ending I'd easily give this film a biased 910!

Here she everything but Rachel from 'Friends' and that is a very good thing. She is really acting and it is one of the best performances of 2002.The sad story is very good as well and there is some fine comedy especially with another worker at Retail Rodeo names Cheryl Zooey Deschanel. She insults customers all the time and says the strangest things the customers hardly notice. Funny sad and very good is what 'The Good Girl' is in the end.".

She works as a clerk in a supermarket and none of her dreams has come through. She quit schooling just before going to the college she got married very young she got trapped in a small town in a job without any perspective and even her expectation of being mother is not being accomplished. Her husband Phil John C. Reilly an excellent and underrated actor is a house painter who gets stoned most of the vacant time as a form of escaping his life with his colleague and best friend Bubba Tim Blake Nelson. Their entertainment is watching a noisy TV at night. One day Justine meets her new colleague Holden Worther Jack Gyllenhaal a strange exaddicted and drunken guy who wants to be a writer. Justine feels a type of attraction for him which grows to a crush ending in an affair. The cuckold and naive Phil does not suspect of the situation. Then the screenplay presents many plot points alternating dramatic situations with a very black humor. This is indeed a deep movie with very well developed characters. Basically all of them have a sort of frustration in life like all of us which is revealed along the story. The black humor is proportioned in doses to relieve the tension in many situations. Jennifer Aniston proves that she is an excellent actress able to conduct and carry out a dense movie. Many persons just know her work as Rachel in Friends' and just expect her to perform foolish roles. For them I suggest for example to watch The Object of My Affection'. I am very suspicious to write about Jennifer Aniston since I am a great fan of her but she has a great performance in this film. Of course the supporting actors and actresses and the direction are also superb. It is ridiculous the classification of comedy for such a movie. This type of classification certainly misleads the viewer and affects the evaluation.  This is a movie that deserves to be watched more than once. My vote is nine.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Good Girl was heavily touted as the film that would help Jennifer Aniston break from her Rachel persona and make the leap to dramatic film actress. There was even talk however brief about an Academy Award nomination for her when this film came out. Surprise surprise but that didn't happen. And where has Aniston's film career been since? The Good Girl is leaps and bounds better than any of Aniston's other ventures into filmbland crap like Picture Perfect and that other movie whose name I can't even rememberbut it's not a great movie in and of itself.Aniston does a pretty good job but you still can't escape the suspicion that she's just playing Jennifer Aniston albeit a drabbed down version of herself. This movie's greatest asset is its supporting cast particularly Zooey Deschanel in a very funny dead pan role as a fellow worker at the WalMartesquire store Aniston's character works in and Jake Gyllenhaal who had begun his trek to stardom the year before in Donnie Darko. The gods were being kind to Gyllenhaal in 2002 as he got to make out with both Aniston and Catherine Keener Lovely and Amazing in the same year.The Good Girl is certainly worth watching. It captures that nowheresville feeling of smalltown America perfectly the antithesis of every Frank Capra movie on the same subject. Instead of a cosy town where everyone knows your name these towns are instead full of bored restless people sitting around waiting for something anything to happen.Grade B".

	schema:headline " The movie is good. The girl? Not so much.";
	schema:reviewBody "If you crossed The Catcher in the Rye and Madame Bovary and set the result in a small Texas town it would be something like this film. It has all the angst and adolescent turmoil of the former and the emotional desolation and individual isolation of the former. Toss in the work of a fine cast and the star power of Jennifer Aniston and you've got yourself a funny touching movie.Justine Last Jennifer Aniston is a 30 year old woman who got married too soon and has found herself trapped in a boring job and to a potheaded house painter. Stewing in her own misanthropy Justine is only roused from her selfpity and selfdestructive anger by a young man who gets a job at the Retail Rodeo where Justine works. The 22 year old played by Jake Gyllenhall calls himself Holden after the J.D. Salinger character and refers to the name his parents gave him as his slave name. Those two things tell you pretty much everything there is to know about him. Justine begins an affair with Holden if you can call sex in a motel after work an affair and it seems to brighten up Justine's miserable existence. But Justine soon realizes that Holden for all his overlysensitive pretensions is just an angry and unstable boy who has fixated on her as the answer to all his dreams. Then her husband's best friend uncovers her infidelity touching off a chain of events that forces Justine to choose between the life she thinks she hates and another existence she can't even imagine.I quite liked this film. It's smart and honest and has just a bit of snark while acknowledging how immature such snark usually is. The Good Girl makes you think about personal unhappiness and the choices and attitudes that create it. The main characters of Justine and Holden are terribly discontented with their lives yet as the story goes along it makes you understand that probably none of the characters are living the lives of their dreams. The difference is they aren't torturing themselves and everyone else over it. Most movies that focus on the quiet desperation of ordinary life either embrace too completely the idea that normal unexceptional lives are awful things or they are too viciously judgmental of such common angst. The Good Girl takes a more mature and measured perspective. It validates Justine's unhappiness with the life she chose by marrying the first man she really loved but holds her accountable for not making the best of that life. Her actual problem isn't her circumstances. It's her own lack of ambition or imagination to do anything to improve them.As the story unfolds you can see that the other characters have found ways to deal with their individually unsatisfying lives. Justine's husband smokes pot to escape. The security guard at the Retail Rodeo has his religious faith. An older coworker of Justine's has a stoic determination to make the best of things and a disdain for those who don't. A younger coworker uses snide sarcasm to lash out at a world that doesn't meet her standards. But they all do something while Justine and Holden just wallow in their anger and resentments.Now there's a subplot in the story involving the best friend of Justine's husband that's much more overthetop and overtly selfaware than the rest of the movie. It explicitly details some of the themes that remain under the surface of the rest of the film and you might find it either bracing or off putting. I suppose it depends on your tolerance for a smart script hitting you over the head a few times to make sure you get its point.Jennifer Aniston got a lot of praise when this movie first came out and it was deserved. She's able to convey the subtle nature of Justine's passivity so that you can empathize with the character even when she's not all that sympathetic. Jake Gyllenhall is also very good with the dual nature of Holden. On the one hand you can see how Justine was attracted to him as a kindred spirit but on the other hand Gyllenhall always keeps the stunted emotional side of Holden in view of both Justine and the audience. John C. Reilly as Justine's husband does some nice work as well. He takes a character that is supposed to be dumber and shallower than either Justine or Holden and makes him into a person and not a plot device.There have been a lot of independent films made about the ordinary lives or ordinary people. Most of them suck because they're made by filmmakers who either hate such ordinary people or see their lives as nothing more than metaphors to be exploited. The Good Girl does none of that which makes it a movie worth seeing.".

Despite some funny streaks the movie is mostly sad. Kind of like it's based on an Eva Cassidy song Maybe Bill and I someday will find a chance to get away. Jennifer Anniston is wonderful in the part of Justine a smalltown checkout girl married to a klutz. She is trying hard to come to terms with the unlived lives she has left behind but at age 30 she just can't accept she'll be stuck at the Retail Rodeo for life. Says Justine in a weary Texas drawl I saw in your eyes that you hate the world. I hate it too. Director Miguel Arteta uses very little offscreen music carefully designed sets washedout colors and lots of illfitting outfits to create a world so bleak it's hard to believe the characters manage even to get up in the morning. They lead the kind of life that makes them wonder what they would have missed had they never been born. I suppose the ending is happier than it could have been but that doesn't say it's a happy ending. Watch out for the slightly creepy guest appearance by scriptwriter Mike White as Corny the Bible Study guy. Fine performances even in the smaller roles most notably perhaps by John C. Lynch of Fargo fame in the part of the store manager and by Tim Blake Nelson one of the original Soggy Bottom Boys as Bubba the Loser.".

Her ticket to salvation is Holden beautifully portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal. He's a rebel who doesn't know what he really wants until he meets Justine in the store where they both work. He brings into her life an excitement she's definitely missing from the life she leads with a boring husband. He strikes the right chords in her soul and she responds to him.The rest of the cast Tim Blake Nelson Deborah Rush Mike White and Zooey Deschand are very effective.In the end Justine is just as happy to accept her fate and get into what is expected of a good girl to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "After having read several user comments it strikes me as weird that noone mentioned the obvious conservativeness of the plot. Young girl in a dead end job with a no good lazy husband sees an opportunity to free herself. But beware of those craaaazy free thinkers who promises a life beyond what you already have they might seem interesting but following them and believing in their promises will only lead to certain disaster. So in conclusion stay with what you've got cause it's better than the alternative.It's hard to know where exactly to start. Hogging the independent feel of movies like Happiness and American Beauty certain scenes are pure ripoffs this movie is a tour de force in conservative propaganda. It's funny though to witness how little understanding the creators have of the vibe that makes the aforementioned movies little masterpieces. Holdens' character is hilariously badly written an example on how writers with no depth should stick to writing screenplays for teenflicks and action movies. And the dialogue in general  with no exaggeration  some of the worst I've ever heard.I would have enjoyed this movie for its' obvious pretentiousness if it hadn't been for the fact that I fear movies like these poison our world with shallowness stupidity and conservativeness. Even most of the reviewers gave it descent reviews which I find absolutely incredible  or maybe not sigh. Well maybe it's just you who's off then!. Well maybe but I still urge people to give it an extra glance before joining either the it's boringside or it's brilliantside.It's just really really stupid and commondenominatordemoting.".

	onyx:emotionText "After having read several user comments it strikes me as weird that noone mentioned the obvious conservativeness of the plot. Young girl in a dead end job with a no good lazy husband sees an opportunity to free herself. But beware of those craaaazy free thinkers who promises a life beyond what you already have they might seem interesting but following them and believing in their promises will only lead to certain disaster. So in conclusion stay with what you've got cause it's better than the alternative.It's hard to know where exactly to start. Hogging the independent feel of movies like Happiness and American Beauty certain scenes are pure ripoffs this movie is a tour de force in conservative propaganda. It's funny though to witness how little understanding the creators have of the vibe that makes the aforementioned movies little masterpieces. Holdens' character is hilariously badly written an example on how writers with no depth should stick to writing screenplays for teenflicks and action movies. And the dialogue in general  with no exaggeration  some of the worst I've ever heard.I would have enjoyed this movie for its' obvious pretentiousness if it hadn't been for the fact that I fear movies like these poison our world with shallowness stupidity and conservativeness. Even most of the reviewers gave it descent reviews which I find absolutely incredible  or maybe not sigh. Well maybe it's just you who's off then!. Well maybe but I still urge people to give it an extra glance before joining either the it's boringside or it's brilliantside.It's just really really stupid and commondenominatordemoting.";

This made me understand why she started an affair with Holden  also wonderfully played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Holden comes off as a dark and disturbed character who is also fed up with the way his life is going even though he comes off this way he is still a very likable character. All of the characters in this film seem to be frustrated and trapped in some way and that's where i think all of us can relate to the film in one way or another.Its hard to tell whether the film is a drama or a comedy.

Since most reviews of the film are negative that's created an unfair bias against it. That's a shame because this film is a pleasure to watch.The plot is like a Rubik's Cube. Just when you thought you had it figured out WHAM!! a twist comes out of nowhere and confounds the viewer. That's one of the films' pleasures.The stylish photography is another plus. A key part of all of Crichton's films is the flashy stylish photography and that's no exception here. Shot by Paul Lohmann in Panavision Looker often looks and feels like Westworld mixed with Coma polished with lemon pledge. It's atmospheric and great to look at.The performances are another key. Albert Finney entering the horror cycle of his career with this and another 1981 release Wolfen which contains many of the same elements that make this so good projects fear and calm every scene he's in and it's another strong performance from one of our most underrated actors he's never won an Oscar a thought that boggled the mind. It seems fitting that he's paired up with another underrated actor James Coburn. In a time where he was making one horrible film after another until his renaissance in 1997 it's good to see him in a good film for a change.I have some problems with the plot mostly things that are left unexplained the American TVEuropean theatrical version restores 15 minutes of story that fills in these holes Now that I think about it that's a good thing. Crichton wants us to be confused just like his hero and part of the fun is figuring everything out as he does.Looker is a film that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Westworld Coma and The Great Train Robbery. It shows impeccable skill and masterful direction that lesser talents have shown in bigger hits than this. It's worth a look. out of 4 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Larry Roberts Albert Finney is a top Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who finds himself embroiled in a sinister mindcontrol conspiracy. After three of his patients are killed in suspicious circumstances Larry takes it upon himself to protect the apparent next victim Cindy the beautiful Susan Dey and also solve the mystery.Looker' is possibly director Michael Crichton's most criminally underrated film. Admittedly the screenplay often leaves a lot to be desired but the initial premise is both intriguing and fearprovoking. Crichton's script makes some rather fascinating and in hindsight rather perceptive comments about how corporations can abuse both the media and the general public simply through the use of television. Towards the end a particularly pertinent speech is made by John Reaston James Coburn on how the general public is willing to submit automatically to the enormous power that television possesses. However much of the power that Looker' could have potentially possessed is lost with poor pacing inappropriate and unrealistic dialogue and a couple of major plotholes. In fact some eminent questions remain unanswered and the movie ends on a sort of anticlimatic note.Crichton's direction appears to be somewhat disjointed as the pace of the movie alternates constantly. To begin with Looker' has the correct proportion of suspense to action and is quite thrilling to behold. Unfortunately certain scenes such as a car chase drag on and become somewhat tedious. One particular sequence of events towards the end of the movie drags on for fifteen minutes and while to begin with is compellingly suspenseful the sequence begins to feel old and certainly spoils what could have been an effective ending. Looker' also suffers from some particular bland performances particularly from central actor Albert Finney. His performance was predominantly lacklustre and featured uninspired sequences in which Finney would avoid gunfire by unenthusiastically throwing himself across the floor. That being said Finney did seem to fit the role of Larry Roberts and was fairly entertaining to watch. Susan Dey and James Coburn were both enjoyable in their respective roles and one wonders why more was not done with their characters. Had more time been spent trying to develop these characters then maybe something more could have been done with the movie.Surprisingly despite all its flaws Looker' is still somewhat compelling. It is certainly not Crichton's best film but is still vastly underrated in my opinion. The opening sequence is suspenseful and intriguing which is occasionally echoed throughout the rest of the movie though unfortunately not enough. Looker' is blessed with some wickedly delightful black humour particularly towards the end and a bizarre yet mesmerizing electric musical score from Barry de Vorzon. Some fans will be happy to know that there are unnecessary scenes of full frontal nudity including one from Susan Dey. The humorous overtones of that particular scene undoubtedly shine through. The ideas of hypnotic and subliminal messaging are what make Looker' compelling even though the film is still heavily damaged by the lack of decent characterisation and storytelling. I think Looker' is worth watching but is most certainly not to everyone's taste. My rating for Looker'  6.510.".

After asking around using that scene as my only guide I was finally able to get someone to tell me.After watching it again I was very interested in the movie's plot despite how ridiculous it seemed. For example why would RI security officers be at the scene of a car accident? Why didn't DMI use computers to generate locations as well as models? Or why did the mustachioed man suddenly remember he had those special glasses in the car chase scene only AFTER being shot by the LOOKER gun? There are others.But it has it's redeeming qualities as well. The music is captivating and helps to build on the excitement of some of the action scenes. And I don't believe I've seen a more passionate kick to the groin than the one given by Albert Finney. All in all Looker would probably not stand up next to today's movies but it has a charm about it. It must have made some kind of impression on me as a child to remain in my head for the past 25 years. Recommended rental. Buy it if you like offbeat quasimainstream movies. I bought it and plan on getting good use out of it. Perfect for unsuspecting house guests.".

It was a novel idea at the time.Well  So what? asks the sophisticated viewer. Is that all there is to it? No. The CGI corporation is run by the evil James Coburn. Not only does he now create commercials out of nothing but he has learned how to insert a hypnotic ray into the pupils of his CGIs. Bad enough when you're selling mouthwash. A disaster when you're producing political ads for a candidate who promises to rid us of inflated government and bureaucratic bloat and return to us the freedoms bestowed on the nation by the Founders. Oh he's against pollution and big corporations too so no need to read any messages into it beyond those carried by any commercial production including Spend money on this movie and make us famous and rich.

There is a car chase of course only the weapons are not machine guns or shotguns but those flash rays. And the final sneaking around with Finney and a couple of villains creeping into commercials being shown to a select and amused audience of Big Wigs is a little sluggish.

It stands as a classic underrated film and a fond memory of my childhood. I took two points off though one for each of the two problems I have with it First they didn't provide enough motivation or explanation for killing the models. One of them seemed to have figured out what was really going on so that makes sense. But the others? Was it just to avoid paying out their contracts? They made a point of saying how rich the RI company was so the cost would seem to be trivial in comparison to murder.Second it struck me as odd that they could accurately digitize human beings but they still shot the commercials on a real set. That doesn't make a lot of sense. Even today it's much easier to model a kitchen than it is to model a human being.Overall though it's still a solid and enjoyable flick.

	schema:headline " Who is Killing the Great Models of Los Angeles?";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite being splendiferously tacky ineptly scripted and petrifyingly dated this thriller about corporate manipulation of the masses through television manages to be fully entertaining and more than a little prescient. Finney plays a hotshot Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who has had a string of models make use of his services each with extremely specific requests about the changes they want done. Shortly afterwards they begin dying off! He attaches himself to one of the most recent ones Dey and begins to investigate what is happening even though he is being framed as a prime suspect. Coburn plays the head of a massive conglomerate and is assisted by the rather icy TaylorYoung. This pair is the chief focus of Finney's legwork. Standing in his way is hit man Rossovich who wields a futuristic and baffling weapon which causes time to stand still for the victim. Soon Finney's own life is in grave danger as he tries to unravel the secret shenanigans of the folks who are making models flawless and then offing them. Finney does a okay job though he's hardly the most desirable leading man with his trousers yanked up to his sternum. Dey who is horribly miscast is adequate but has a sketchy role with little to do except seem concerned. Coburn tries to inject some wit into his role but like so many other folks in this movie is just a pawn in the bigger picture of technothriller with a message. TaylorYoung who is undeniably gorgeous goes through the entire film with little expression and one eyebrow raised much higher than the other which almost seems an unintentional comment on the dangers of cosmetic surgery. In her final scene she looks like someone who is desperately sad she didn't get to play Mommie Dearest with her shoulder pads severe hair pearls and even the requisite FM shoes! Harewood has another one of the cop roles which dominated his career at the time and winds up having little to do of interest. Rossovich is a kick as the hitman billed as Moustache Man!! His kinship with Tom Selleck in real life is more than obvious here and his look dates the movie more than anything else. The film is often uproariously funny but in this case a lot of the humor seems to be intentional. Little quirky bits of irony emerge along the way for example a product called Spurt is advertised as a character has blood gushing out of his chest! The featured weapon silly as it is sometimes presented allows for some really interesting and eyeopening sequences. Made at a time when excess and tastelessness were about to explode as never before it wallows in idiocy and illogic but is rarely dull. One death from a balcony is shown in slomo with the crotch of the victim front and center as the body flails to it's eventual death. The lame script has so many holes in it it's downright ridiculous but somehow the movie still works as light entertainment and is able to get a few points across. This is one time when a film could have been better if it were allowed to be a little bit longer. The addictive title song is about as close to deliriously bad 80's heaven as one can get. This film has many similarities to director Crichton's Coma but without that film's darker edge and without Jerry Goldsmith's nervejangling score! The preposterous climax of this film is notably bizarre and hard to forget with the villains doing more harm to themselves than to anyone else as they find themselves living inside virtual commercials! It's a musthave for fans of good bad movies.".

The trail leads to a conglomerate run by oily James Coburn and his sexy goon Leigh Taylor Young. What he uncovers is a pretty clever plot to replace the models with computer generated replicas thus allowing them to work forever without aging or getting paid. Unfortunately the leaden pacing of the movie does it in. Finney seems surprisingly engaged but Crichton has directed nothing. In fact his direction here as it was with COMA is so without personality it has a deadening affect on everything. Coburn is fine in an all too brief role and Susan Dey is terrific as one of Finney's luckier patients.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Crichton's Looker certainly isn't a hopelessly bad film but it is pretty forgettable and way too ambitious for an early 80's thriller that superficially looks like a brainless horror effort. The VHS cover art as well as the supercheesy title song make Looker wrongfully appear like an ordinary by the numbers stalkslash film. An often encountered and unjustified praising is that Crichton's screenplay is intelligent and far ahead of its time. Well the basic premise may be clever but the film features a countless amount of obvious flaws and to me the whole just looked like putting together leftover ideas from Crichton's previous and much better scripts for Westworld and Coma. The story revolves on media tycoon John Reston whose newly founded company Digital Matrix developed hypnotismtechniques that increase the impact and awareness of ordinary TVcommercials among the viewers. The beautiful models that star in these commercials therefore have to be 100 perfect and thus surgically altered to the millimeter. When three models die in mysterious circumstances the police immediately suspects Dr. Larry Roberts who performed the plastic surgery on all of them. I can't really give a listing of all the flaws and illogical aspects without giving away essential spoilers but I can say that the story never gives an apparent reason why exactly these fashion models have to die or how Digital Matrix plans to endlessly reuse holograms of dead models without raising suspicion.Oh well maybe I've been analyzing the credibility of the plot too much whereas I should've paid more attention to the entertainment value. Looker undeniably contains some professionally mounted suspense sequences and introduces a couple of very ingenious gimmicks such as the 'denuralizer'gun I don't know how else to call it and the perfectionmeasurement techniques. Michael Crichton also successfully captures the highsociety world of Beverly Hills where plastic surgeons drive around in expensive sport cars and live in fancy beach houses and where young models only care about their looks and dating wealthy doctors. This is not a gory flick but there is at least one disturbing and beautifully shot deathsequence that involves a model falling down from the balcony of her apartment. Albert Finney and James Coburn are both terrific and even the lesserexperienced female beauties give adequate performances. Looker may perhaps be a tad bit underrated but it sure isn't a gem that urgently needs to be rediscovered.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all about the sentence where many people from different countries come to Lathuania. What kind of country is Lathuania? Maybe it is a new way of mixing two different countries which though have things in common Latvia and Lithunia. The events take place mostly in Latvia and only a little bit in Lithuania. I thought it was very important to say this as I am Latvian and do not like mixing up the two countries or even saying a wrong name of our country. Nothing personal please. This movie for me as a Latvian was very exciting from the very first moment. I suppose it is more interesting for those who represent the nationalities involved in the movie like Latvians Lithuanians Russians English Americans Germans Austrians French and even Chinese did I forgot anybody?. I liked the way Latvians and other nationalities were represented. Good humor really!".

Maybe it is a new way of mixing two different countries which though have things in common Latvia and Lithunia. The events take place mostly in Latvia and only a little bit in Lithuania. I thought it was very important to say this as I am Latvian and do not like mixing up the two countries or even saying a wrong name of our country. Nothing personal please.

A group of British firemen are in search of the magic fern two brothers hatch a plan so those damn capitalists will stop raising gas prices a French woman picks up flirtatious men as she's on her way to distribute her late husband's ashes a sexcrazed stewardess is on the prowl for Mr. Right Now an American and his taxi driver are trying to find his halfsister and then there's a kangaroo...This is a good film that is very funny and beautifully shot. The vivid colours and great use of candles lights and fire in every scene balance out the dark of the shortest night of the year with the quirky characters perfectly. Has night time ever been so brilliantly captured in a film? I doubt it. It's the type of film that is just so pretty you don't want to look away despite the absurdities and randomness of the situations. They did all this with just a low budget and without being ostentatious like big Hollywood films.I could have done with a few less characters there's probably even a dozen that I have forgotten to mention but the more that I got to see of them the funnier they became. At the center is Curt in an excellent performance by Orlando Wells reminiscent of Dallas Roberts able to play the comedic straight man and bring a whole lot of sympathy and depth to a character that at first seems to be just a bitter and arrogant American. Not to be outdone is Gundars Abolins as Oskars the funniest taxi driver you will ever meet.Midsummer Madness falls a little short on its underlying theme of love and in actually defining all of the characters and their adventures. By the end I really only liked two of the characters enjoyed a handful more but then forgot about the rest. It does however live up to the madness in its title and it fully delivers on the unity of all nations coming together in Latvia and in the promotion of its beautiful country. I want to go now although I might steer clear of some of their parties and traditions.".

When I went to Latvia I pretty much stayed in Riga but the rest of the country looks beautiful. In one scene the taxi driver tells the visitor that Latvian male names end in S such as Gundars boli. Thanks to Wikipedia I've seen that when male names from other languages get written in Latvian they add S on the end.The movie itself is OK not great. The best part is the focus on the relationships between the characters. We get to hear Latvian English French and Russian spoken. The cast includes Orlando Wells Susannah York's son Maria de Medeiros Butch's wife in Pulp Fiction and Dominique Pinon who always appears in JeanPierre Jeunet's movies. What a mixture for a celebration in the former Soviet republic. If I ever go back there  along with Estonia and Lithuania  I'll make sure to go to the countryside. Dievs svt Latviju!".

	schema:reviewBody "Boom' is a blast!  This is one of the most fun of the Burton  Taylor films. Boom is also a gassy misfire that draws one into the veiled world of aging homosexual desire disguised as a heterosexual struggle between an aging dying woman and the unattainable youth in the angel of Death.This is story wearing a beard. Taylor's role is really that of an aging rich gay man who is trying to hang on to youth and the beauties that great beauty attract. After all her name is Sissy'. Burton's role is that of the hustler who is all that is left for the old queen to attract. But as with so many Williams works it all must be encrypted and coded so that the America of the late 50's and early 60's could handle his true intentions the soft underbelly of his plays. Burton is too old for the role that was written for a man in his twenties and Taylor is too young and too healthy looking to be the dying Sissy. But despite that the story of a struggle of great wealth against the inevitable grows from loopy strangeness to a compelling and moving ending.  Here Taylor gives one of her oddly finest post Virginia Woolf studies in a dramaticcomic performance. There is in fact so much subversive humor in her performance that she is at times hilarious.  Her vocal range dances from the shrill to the silly to the grand dame and all to serve her imperious and ultimately terrified Sissy Goforth.  In the last desperate half hour of the film she does some of her finest work.  Burton is rather cool and distant at first but builds his Angelo De Morte into a truly fine character study. In particular listen to his fine delivery of the speech about the old man in the sea.Particular note should be made of the cinematography which is gorgeous and the stunning sun washed bone toned opulent glamour of the sets.  I understand that the Burtons owned the house in Sardinia for a while after the film was completed. The spare and haunting score by John Barry is an added delight to his impressive repertoire.  And for you jewelry fans there is plenty of Miss Taylor's own jewelry on hand.  So get out your copy of My Love Affair With Jewelry' my Elizabeth and thumb along as she parades her diamonds in the Mediterranean sun.Campy? Yes! Great? Maybe we will know about that in another 40 years. Is it worth your time? Only if you like a challenge and are willing to let the Burtons take you into the world of Tennessee Williams camp classic.".

So given the chance to see Boom for the 1st time I said Sure! Well Boom got ole Granny all shook up! I LOVED it! If someone disparagingly says Camp! to describe this movie it isn't me. I watched the movie with complete seriousness took the story and characters literally and came away from the experience very moved! Liz Taylor is at her luminous beautiful best. So she's a little chunky. I was mesmerized by her famous deep purple eyes and thick black eyelashes. But it was her acting in this film that really knocked me out. Yes her accents vary  but that is Liz being true to the character. Sissy Goforth is a grand lady now but her lapses into vulgarity suggest humbler beginnings.I think Liz' acting is superb throughout. After all this character IS overthetop. Liz goes from grandiose viciousness to moving pathos and I found her believable at all times.As for Burton that sexy devilangel  who cares if he was a little old for the part. To this 62yearold he looked delicious and that mellifluous voice really moved me.The spectacularly beautiful scenery of Sardinia and the magnificent mansion provided an awesome setting  and Liz' costumes and jewelry were to drool over.What a treat to see Noel Coward. Who cares if this movie was beneath him. He looked like he was having fun! Of course there's a message to the movie but to me it was secondary to all the glorious glamour and glitz Oh. Did I just describe camp?".

Flanders is strangely attracted to the mad Mrs. Goforth who's looking to have one last fling before she goes out for good.

Coward or the Witch had so many bloodtransfusions over the years that he doesn't have a single drop of his own blood left in his entire body. The Witch is also very privy to who Flanders really is the Angel of Death and knows of a number of persons now all dead whom he had visited over the years.Flanders dressed courtesy of the lady of the house Sissy in a dark and ominous looking samurai outfit together with a razor sharp samurai sword is not at all fooled by Sissy's wild and crazy actions knowing that her time of earth is fast coming to an end. He also archives the odd and almost unenviable distinction of being the first and only man in the glamorous Sissy Goforth's life to refuses to jump into the sack with her after she invited him into her bedroom! A feat that must have taken almost Herculean will power on his part.We learn from both Flanders and the mysterious Witch of Capri Noel Coward that he was just an ordinary man trying to make a living writing poetry until some time back in California. Then Flanders helped a rich old miser from a local nursing home kill himself by strolling into the Pacific Ocean who like Sissy just couldn't take the pain anymore. Later coming under the influence or wing of an old Indian or Native American mystic Flanders then found his true reason and role in life and that was to be at the side of rich and dying men and womenlike Flora Sissy Goforth.

Richard Burton was a bit to old at 42 to be playing the young and wondering poet of the Tennessee Williams play Chris Flanders and his wife Elizabeth Taylor was much too young at 35 to be playing the much older Mrs. Goforth who had already been married six times. This took a lot out of the authenticity of the two parts that the leading two actors in the film played. The beautiful photography of the Mediterranen coast with the sea waves majestically crashing into the rocks did make the movie Boom more then watchable. There's also Miss. Taylor in an unforgettable scene dressed in a mindblowing allwhite Japanese Bobuki outfit at a private dinner with The Witch of Capri which was so eye popping that it would have turned heads and stopped traffic even at the very accident prone Indianapolis 500.".

It was only director Joseph Losey who having plummeted the depths with Modesty Blaise and Boom some may wish to add Secret Ceremony managed to recuperate and in 1970 create his best work the wonderful GoBetween.Saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams. From the midforties until the early sixties Williams penned a number of plays which have gained classic status remaining in theater repertory throughout the world many becoming much praised films. When William's muse deserted him probably owing to his notorious substance abuse it deserted him for good. Williams at his best is an actor's dream providing many unforgettable performances. Were Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr ever better than in Night of the Iguana ?  Taylor in particular shone in both Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Suddenly Last Summer. There is an anecdote in which supposedly Taylor asks John Gielgud whether he would teach her to play Shakespeare to which he replied if you will teach me to play Tennessee Williams. Had Gielgud seen Boom he would have held his tongue. Taylor simply has never been worse turning in a cringe inducing performance. Despite her face photographing well she is decidedly podgy. Besides the physical decline from this time onwards she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a string of completely forgettable and worse roles to her credit.Much the same could be said of Burton. Following his short lived theatrical stardom he won fame and fortune in Hollywood. But the body of his work from this point onwards 1968 would be unremarkable to say the least.Noel Coward had long ceased being a force in the theater where his drawing room comedies had been replaced by the likes of Williams and the British angry young men. He seems to be enjoying himself camping it up but barely manages to amuse that from the man who claimed such a talent.The only cast member who maintains her dignity is young Joanna Shimkus who in a few years would forego a promising screen career to become Mrs. Sidney Poitier.Boom reeks of self indulgence it's simply out of control. A rather sad pointer to careers gone wrong rather than a camp fun fest as some have suggested.".

	schema:reviewBody "If death comes to those that bray then Elizabeth Taylor's Flora Goforth will be going forth sooner than she thinks. When Richard Burton's stranger approaches her secluded island compound yelling out her name it appears that destiny has come aknockin'. The nasty Flora has a vile temper screaming at servants and trespassers with great glee but underneath her delight in her vile personality is a truly unhappy lonely woman. Burton is attacked by her guard dogs put into a guest house and worms his way into Mrs. Goforth's life. Noel Coward making his entrance on the shoulders of a young man is a nasty gay character known as The Witch of Capri and boy is he quite a piece of work. Warning Taylor of Burton's reputation Coward obviously has his own lusts for the younger man who isn't really all that desirable Burton having greatly aged since his first appearance with Taylor five years before in Cleopatra.Not so much pretentious as it is audacious it is easy to see why that this has inspired years of both criticism and praise for its obviously deliberate camp elements. The play The Milk Train Doesn't Live Here Anymore was much more subtle in its storytelling with Flora an aging eccentric writing her memoirs and dealing with uncompleted lusts. The character is greatly youthened while the character of the Angel of Death is oddly aged. A strange tale like this could only come from the mind of someone like Tennessee Williams who seemed to have a fascination with old ladies on the verge of death facing their disappointments and their destiny with delusional lust which takes that deadly sin into a level of degradation that results in destruction.We're eating their eggs. It cuts down on the population Taylor says urging Coward to have a seagull's egg as an appetizer while she sits across from him wearing a spiked hat that Cleopatra would have tossed into the Nile. Taylor still gorgeous is far too young for this part. It was originally played in an Off Broadway production by eccentric character actress Hermione Baddeley flopped and returned briefly with none other than Tallulah Bankhead in the part. I saw the recent OffBroadway production with Olympia Dukakis in the role and while the play was far from perfect the performance of Ms. Dukakis made it seem so much better.It's obvious to me that unless the leading lady is perfect in the role it will bomb and Taylor screeches every line as if she were a combination of every braying character she had ever played. At least even as Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? she added subtlety in spots but her Flora shows absolutely no softness making her twice the shrew than Shakespeare's Kate a role la Liz had just played to great success the year before. Burton seems around to just carry on the teaming and is totally miscast. Perhaps Daniel Massey who received an Oscar Nomination the very same year for playing Noel Coward in the musical Star! would have been a better choice and it would have been ironic to see him and Coward rolling around on the bed together.This is an extremely hard film to get through even if you are curious about the outlandish costumes terribly gauche sets and eyerolling performances. Had it been a foreign film perhaps directed by Fellini or Bergman it might have been a lot easier to take and even done more subtly but the attempts to turn this into an artistic metaphor of the sordid lives of the rich and ridiculous just becomes very heavyhanded and absurd. Williams plays tend to be mostly unfilmable and other than his more accessible plays The Glass Menagerie A Streetcar Named Desire don't hold up well for the most part on screen.".

Perhaps Daniel Massey who received an Oscar Nomination the very same year for playing Noel Coward in the musical Star! would have been a better choice and it would have been ironic to see him and Coward rolling around on the bed together.This is an extremely hard film to get through even if you are curious about the outlandish costumes terribly gauche sets and eyerolling performances. Had it been a foreign film perhaps directed by Fellini or Bergman it might have been a lot easier to take and even done more subtly but the attempts to turn this into an artistic metaphor of the sordid lives of the rich and ridiculous just becomes very heavyhanded and absurd. Williams plays tend to be mostly unfilmable and other than his more accessible plays The Glass Menagerie A Streetcar Named Desire don't hold up well for the most part on screen.";

Tennessee Williams came to know a truth which cannot be expressed in literal terms and so he wrote the original play which is even more stylized and fabulous literally like a fable than the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "That's right . . . BOOM! This movie had such a loathsome reputation that I had to watch it and I must say it didn't disappoint. Ghastly as it is Boom! is a great cautionary tale. Lesson 1 fame takes its toll. Poor Liz Taylor was only in her mid30s at this point and still more voluptuous than fat. But decades of stardom had warped her personality and a long career of erotic vagrancy had rendered her an overexposed selfparody. Therefore she is tragically convincing in Boom! as a shrewish washedup old hag. Her performance is shrill monochromatic and dreadful but her persona was so close to her character that any acting is gratuitous. Lesson 2 homosexuals even brilliant ones wind up in exile. To watch Noel Coward as a character idiotically named the Witch of Capri being toted up the beach on the shoulders of a beefy manservant is to watch the tragic end of a stellar career. It's an image that resonates with Oscar Wilde's sad decline from a widely acclaimed wit to a sick broke exconvict Truman Capote's deterioration from literary genius to silly talkshow guest or even Coward's downward journey from Shaftesbury and Broadway to the Vegas strip and this lousy cameo. Lesson 3 at some point you have to stop trading in on your name and give up. Tennessee Williams wrote a handful of classic plays and dozens of dreadful ones. The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore which is the basis for Boom! must have been his tenth failed attempt to retell the story of Streetcar Named Desire a young stud stirs the passions of a vulnerable woman subtext gay man with dire results. And Lesson 4 a rich voice and a regal bearing doth not an actor make. Richard Burton is ugly and pompous here all the moreso for appearing oblivious to the fact that he's far too old for the role of a sexy dangerous young poet. Coward seems more his peer than his potential corrupter when Coward propositions Burton by inviting him back to his island you think he's suggesting they catch the Early Bird Special at Denny's. In fairness it's hard not to be ridiculous in a film that asks you to say Boom! every few minutes apropos of absolutely nothing. But Burton one of the most mannered actors in history says Boom! with the smirking selfsatisfaction he brings to every role. Boom I have a talent for disaster or that wasn't very nice Martha it's all the same. It's all Burton and it's all horrible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adaptated by Tennessee Williams from The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore he obviously pulled in a few of his old friends to get this done. It's a genderbending allegory with Liz Taylor as rich dying Sissy Goforth a badtempered recluse in her remarkable clifftop Mediterranean villa. Along comes Dick Burton a freeloadercumGrim Reaper figure who sees it as his mission to help ladies in extremis.Neither of them are right for their roles but that only adds a certain fascination  a totally earnest rendition would be dull and pretentious. Taylor lets rip here and it's a riot. The highlight is her dinner with Noel Coward playing a role originally meant for a woman.

	onyx:emotionText "Adaptated by Tennessee Williams from The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore he obviously pulled in a few of his old friends to get this done. It's a genderbending allegory with Liz Taylor as rich dying Sissy Goforth a badtempered recluse in her remarkable clifftop Mediterranean villa. Along comes Dick Burton a freeloadercumGrim Reaper figure who sees it as his mission to help ladies in extremis.Neither of them are right for their roles but that only adds a certain fascination  a totally earnest rendition would be dull and pretentious. Taylor lets rip here and it's a riot. The highlight is her dinner with Noel Coward playing a role originally meant for a woman. She is wearing an utterly outrageous kabuki outfit while Coward camps it up like there's no tomorrow which is no doubt the film's theme.The script is full of naff psychology Taylor is shrill and unpleasant Burton looks like he's on vacation.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film about the superidle superrich and the people who participate in their deathwatch.  The film is minimalist in nature having only a cast and a set that supports the deathwatch theme.  It is probably a difficult movie to watch because it has absolutely nothing to say about life and living.  William's script creates a Danteish abstraction of a death journey with incredibly tight and sharp dialogue that is matched by the director's use of space and time.  The only problem I have with the production is the totally inept lighting direction.  Here we have a Mediterranean sunwashed villa as the set of the final human drama with very little sense of light and heat.The whole cast what there is of it are essentially giving solo performances.  Even when they are in each other's arms they seem to be issuing soliloquies.  This produces a very interesting effect of who's on first.  Everyone has such a good part with such good lines its hard to tell who to focus on.  The real treat was the TaylorCoward jousting at the dinner table.  I've never seen Noel Coward before and this part seemed to be written for him. Taylor hated her part in this film but it appeared the director was allowing the cast to develop their parts themselves judging from the reading flubs that were left in the final cut.I'm not going to say anything about the story.  It should be seen by those who are looking for a Tennessee Williams interpretation of death at the top. Suffice it to say in response to the waves crashing on the rocks below boom...the shock of each moment of still being alive.I rate this a 5 out of 5.  I would have rated it a 4 out of 5 if there was no closeup of Taylor's eyes.".

These credits alone should promise an awardcaliber prestige film but unfortunately the production of Boom was flawed from the beginning and arguably one of Elizabeth Taylor's finest latecareer performances was buried when the film bombed. The foundation of a film is its screenplay and based on one of Williams's lesser known lesser quality plays The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore the film is slow often tedious difficult to fully comprehend and hard to sit through. Taylor and Burton were fresh from career highs with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and The Taming of the Shrew and their decision to appear in such an uncommercial endeavor is mystifying. Boom was among the first of these missteps that led to the couple's demise at the box office.Flora Sissy Goforth is a lonely woman of immense wealth who reigns supreme over her servants and a nurse upon a rocky Italian island evidently quite ill Sissy is demanding and often cruel to those around her. Enter Chris Flanders a sometime poet with an address book whose pages list the names of deceased women also known as the Angel of Death Flanders washes up on the shores of Sissy's island. For some bitchy spice Flora's flamboyant friend the Witch of Capri arrives and is carried on the shoulders of a muscular servant up to the villa. Taylor is much too beautiful young and vibrant to be a dying recluse although she is excellent in a part that echoes her Oscarwinning Martha. Burton is always worth watching and his magnificent voice gives some of Williams's lines the poetic justice they deserve. Coward is Coward and is amusing in his few scenes.The visuals are often striking the Sardinian scenery is magnificent and a white Mediterranean villa perched atop a cliff and filled with striking art works makes a suitable backdrop for the actors who are garbed in outlandish Japaneseinspired costumes. However Barry's music is intrusive and inappropriate at times and unfortunately Joseph Losey's direction is selfconsciously arty and he uses much symbolism even beyond Williams's obvious Goforth Angel of Death and Witch of Capri monikers. Taylor is always dressed in white while Burton is wrapped in a black samurai kimono and often carries a sword. Burton references the film's title several times which is taken from the boom of the waves against the rocks below the villa. Boom is generally slow pretentious ponderous talky and difficult to recommend to any nonfans of Taylor Burton or Williams. However for TaylorBurton devotees the film is essential viewing and they will not be disappointed by Taylor's performance or Burton's reading of William's lines.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this beautifully filmed fable would have delighted Sigmund Freud. If you are really uncomfortable with the theme of incest albeit unwitting do not watch this movie because it is central to the plot. As in Oedipus Rex a grim fate hangs over and destroys the hapless characters involved. It is fascinating to watch this archetypal drama playing out in the context of a superstitious Shinto world view.But this is not the only theme driving this complex drama. The interplay of the traditional and the modern is consistently in the forefront and the film sees the good and the bad in both. The irreplaceable art of Japanese papermaking which is shown in some detail comes out of the same traditional culture that fosters destructive superstitious beliefs. Similarly the forces of progress and modernity work for both good and bad purposes. A plan is afoot to cut down the beloved forest to make way for a big modern country resort destroying what is good in the traditional culture including the papermaking art and yet the modern spirit of reason seems to be the only hope for freeing these villagers from the destructive superstitious beliefs that enslave them. The traditional world of Shinto is full of ghosts and deities of beauty and horror and it does not easily coexist with modernity. Nothing is simple here.These are some of the themes at play in this complex fable. The film invites repeated viewings. There is much to see it is very beautiful and the acting is excellent. It is full of surprises and is highly entertaining. When you watch be careful to note the family connections of the characters. The family tree is important. Director Masato Harada has created something memorable and unique and it cannot be easily classified in one genre or another.".

	schema:headline " A clash between ancient myth and rapacious modernity in rural Japan.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a remarkable film and narrative for a number of reasons.First the photography of the Japanese forests and mountains is exquisite. Some of the forest scenes for example are amazing in the way director Harada uses the camera as though flying or drifting through upper branches circling swooping down and then around to focus on a young couple walking. Or tracking along a pathway coming up to large boulders zooming up the face and then above and to look down directly upon a young man sitting on the top. Or again drifting through the mists of the forest rising and falling as though traveling with the breeze. It was for me entrancing to watch and admire the skill of the shooting.Then there is the soundtrack  a delightful combination of Western and Eastern pieces that suited every mood that the story attempts to convey. I didn't take note of the closing credits but there were many excerpts that were quite familiar including some from Verdi. And having an interest in Japanese culture I have taught Shotokan karate for nearly thirty years it was also a delight to witness a lot of the process of making rice paper. I know that won't appeal to others as much as to me but the practice is an integral part of the story also acting as a counterpoint to the encroaching evil of modernity in the form of a planned harvesting of much of the forest to make way for the development of a golf course...Add in now the actors none of whom I'd seen before. Not that it mattered they all performed their roles flawlessly even though others might think some of the actors may have been overacting particularly Kazurhiro Yamaji who played the belligerent husband and incestuous womanizer Takanao. Yuki Amami who played Miki Bonomiya is just sublime as the main protagonist of this drama  one that surrounds the myth of the Dog Spirit that is a curse upon the Bonomiya family of the village of Omine. All of the village's troubles surface when the new teacher Akira Nutahara played by Atsuro Watabe arrives to take up a new job at the school. He's much more than what he seems to be and unhappily for all he falls in love with Miki with startling and surprising results. And in the background lurks a local hunter who has killed 999 wild animals  and he's waiting for the right moment to bag number 1000...It's a complex story that mixes ancient myth and ceremony incestuous family ties jealous and unrequited lovers and a gradual descent into murderous horror. For those who enjoy the idea of ghosts or spirits there is also the Dog Spirit a loose translation of the title. Inugami however has a literal translation of 'god dog' which is a palindrome in English looks and spells the same either way. And that I think is curiously appropriate considering the true nature of Miki and her mother Tomie played by Shiho Fuimura. So for those who delve or dabble in Freudian psychology this story is a treat for others less inclined it tends to be confusing especially if you pay little heed to the family connections. The subtitles however are up to scratch  but I did skip back a few times just to make sure I was following the story okay. Overall however the whole experience appears to move quite slowly so some viewers will chomp at the bit wondering why nothing much seems to be happening at various times. All I can say is patience is a virtue.My only real criticism is that the story ends ambiguously appearing to remain rooted in fantasy instead of psychology.And finally I was interested to note Harada had directed Kamikazi Taxi 1995 a thriller I saw ten years ago now. I quite enjoyed that as I have Inugami. The difference between the two in genre pacing narrative and miseenscene however is so great it amplifies the skill Harada shows as a director. I think Harada is therefore a director to watch no pun intended and monitor.Not recommended for children of any age the graphic sex scenes and violence are just too much for immature minds.".

In fact it's truly befitting for the movie to be patient in its storytelling. The camera works and cinematography along with the pacing help to reign you in to the world of the Omine village. A village and people seemed to be locked in world between the traditional and the modern.Time seems to work at a different tangent there where a feudal family's life is tainted by an ancient curse its members torn between traditional duty and self liberation.The acting is top notch the setting is near perfect and the music blends in with the luscious mountain forest in a mystical way. The horror element is so subtle and sparse that this could have been a purely drama film without the supernatural element. In fact the most horrific things are the cruelty and twisted bondage of tradition and paranoia that envelop the Bonomiya family and the Omine townsfolk.Shikoku considered a spiritual haven by many Japanese plays the silent witness and a sort of mystical catalyst to the spiraling tragedy that unfolds through the movie. Its natural presence seems to reverberate with a disturbing presence and foreboding doom in the director's hand.The editing is choppy at times and it seems Masato Harada didn't really want to make a horror movie or could have done a better job with a bigger budget.Overall I really enjoyed Inugami and it's a nice treat if you love Japanese countryside and folktales. It is not your typical Jhorror film and there is a disturbing taboo that plays as a central part of the narration. Beware!".

	schema:reviewBody "INUGAMI is an interesting yet drawn out film. Though there are many wonderful aspects to the film location cinematography directing they just don't save the film from many bouts of tedium. The most overdone aspect being the Tomie character. However for those who do give this film a chance they will surely be treated to an above par thriller set in a quiet village virtually disconnected from the rest of the world. Here not only does everyone know each other's name but they know their secrets as well. This concept alone is easily fun to play with and we are treated to it quite nicely as we the viewer learn the secrets of the village along with Akira a school teacher and outsider who has just arrived in the town.Personally I felt the film should have omitted a few of the middle scenes of the movie involving Takanao. He had a certain mystique about him near the beginning but with each additional scene involving him I felt a lack of interest growing. Also I couldn't help but feel bored around every group meeting which took place in the film of which there are many. For some reason it just didn't feel like they were getting anything accomplished asides from restating the basic purpose of the Bonomiya. These scenes were just so disinteresting especially nearing the end.Also from a western point of view the whole idea of loyalty to a certain job no matter what the cost seems trying at times. This is basically a problem most westerners have with many Asian films. The sense of honour and commitment seems to also be a foreign thing to North American audiences. I have watched other Asian films less engaging than this one. While watching the other films I found myself very interested and downright intrigued by the honour aspect. But here in INUGAMI honour is certainly not essential. Even morality is utterly useless as the depraved truth is revealed.I really wanted to love this film as I mentioned before there were good things going for it. However I'm to conflicted by so many other things about the movie. This film is definitely not for everyone especially those who are attracted to the film due to it's underlying horror theme.You don't see any ugly demons strolling the streets you only see the ugliness of human beings who have steeped themselves in tradition and the past. The two things which have been responsible for the downfall of so many organizations societies and people.Oh and the music was rank!".

Don't ask me why I came out like I stared at a wall for two hours. Even when I tried to make some sense of it nothing worked. In its essence the movie talks about a family whose women are cursed. But perhaps it's me the story is quite difficult to follow. The people seem to wander around I didn't understand any of it. But I respect it afterall there are people who liked it. Anyway luckily they won't catch me seeing this one again.".

	schema:headline " If it were French Americans would be singing its praises";
	schema:reviewBody "If Houndog were French it would be praised as a worthy study of a child on the brink of adolescence. But because it's American it gets attacked primarily for its subject because the majority of Americans are uncomfortable with on or offscreen sexuality unless it's the crude American Pie kind and uncomfortable with depictions of other Americans that don't adhere to their idealistic perceptions of themselves  as winners.Deborah Kampmeier's understated film is not about winners and losers it is about finding a safe personal harbor. Dakota Fanning who slips into the skin of her character and never sheds it plays a precocious young girl living in an impoverished Southern town who is fixated on Elvis Presley and his imminent tour of the region. Unable to afford tickets to his concert Dakota is given an opportunity to perform Hounddog for a local teenager in exchange for tickets. Instead she gets raped. Three carefully chosen shots illustrate the act. None are explicit.Laden with the weight of disappointment and betrayal Dakota becomes solemn and depressed but is gradually eased out of her state and into her safe harbor by the kindhearted Charles Afimo Omelami and his love of blues music. Of course there is a lot more to Hounddog than what I've described. It is a gentle understated study of childhood curiosity and exploration. Dakota's character is sexually curious in the way all of us as children once were. Her behavior and performance is natural and unforced. David Morse who plays her father is striking as man who journeys from aggressive deadbeat to passive simpleton after he is struck by lightning. Piper Laurie playing an older less extreme version of her Margaret White from Carrie achieves the perfect balance as Dakota's Mother. Rounding out the cast is the subdued Robin Wright Penn as a woman whose grasp on life is tentative at best and the excellent Cody Hanford as Dakota's young friend with whom she is testing the anxietyridden waters of adolescence. The cinematography of the stunning Southern shantytown and some moody interiors by the everreliable Ed Lachman and two other contributors is excellent as is the score by Meshell Ndegeocello.Though this doesn't achieve the emotional resonance of similar films like the Czech The Crow the Japanese Muddy River or the French Le Grande Chemin it is a fine achievement that has much in common with European cinema and little in common with contemporary American cinema Lawn Dogs and Bastard Out of Carolina excepted.".

The real problems with this film lie in the directing the script and the pacing. It's poorly filmed though beautifully lensed the script panders to too many stereotypes to even enumerate and even though it's very short it crawls along.All the controversy about the rape is unfounded too because it actually is only a very small piece of the movie. You see her face twice and her hand once and you hear her. I'd say it was 45 seconds. Maybe not even that long.Anyways color me disappointed.

	schema:reviewBody "Hounddog must be one of the most boring and sexually depraved films ever made. For some reason the people involved with production seem to think it's important and will raise awareness instead of trying the art line they are now trying the moral tactic. We are now supposed to see this film because rape happens often and happens to children often and none of us are aware of it.Is there any moral purpose of this film besides raising awareness? Which one could get from a newspaper article anyway. Apparently not. There is no message to rape survivors about how to survive there is no closure or justice or even really the start of something better. In fact this isn't really a film most people can relate to given the unusual and irrelevant nature of Lewellen's life no mother idiot father poor in the oldfashioned Deep South and she is constantly behaving precociously  not because she thinks it is fun as poor Fanning seemed to think but because she is a wrecked traumatized who doesn't really know any other. We are constantly treated to shots of Lewellen's underwear Buddy shirtless and barefoot and then there's the pointless scene where naked two children are tied together with a live snake and threatened at gunpoint. It makes you feel dirty just watching the film.The behavior of Lewellen is disturbing but there is this nasty sense that she is asking for the rape given that she is constantly engaging in sexual behavior and then performs a striptease right before the rape itself. As this is not the most likely way in which girls aged 912 are going to be raped the story seems silly and with no relation to today. It is not something modern young girls would identify with and is another reason why they shouldn't watch this film.The film is cruel it is strange it is entirely about sex and it is boring and badlywritten and made.".

They didn't see the film I did for sure. There is no gratuitous or graphic violence or sex and the only bit of nudity comes courtesy of David Morse's behind. If anything a little more sex or violence might have enabled more of today's jaded audience to actually get the point of this movie.As I understand it the story they are trying to tell in my opinion unsuccessfully but more of that later is of an adolescent girl who over a short period of time due to a sequence of unfortunate events goes from expressing herself through the voice of Elvis to eventually being able to express her true self with her own voice with help from Charles Afemo Omilami.As a story it holds water is certainly  unfortunately  true to life and the central role is played with much maturity and sensitivity by Dakota Fanning bar her mandatory screamingfornoreason scene who may or may not have overegged her performance I don't know what was and wasn't said by her but she is the one carrying this film and it is not her fault that through clumsy editing and a weak screenplay the story kinda gets lost in the overall dullness.None of the supporting characters are particularly well described and just when we do think we're getting to know them ... cut to a completely different scene. It's almost as if this was a vehicle for a 1213 year old Dakota Fanning which is not doing her her costars or the film any favours. It perhaps should have been longer and less time devoted to the relationship with her father which isn't particularly relevant to the story I think they're trying to tell.My advice is watch it and make up your own mind but don't expect to be shocked disgusted or entertained. The brief glimpses of humour and happiness are lost amongst the monotony of dull sound and scenery. Where's the rock'n'roll where's the blues? Where are all the characters that surely must have been in the story in the south in the 1950s? A worthy attempt to tell a powerful story but lacking in flair and direction.".

Here are just a few of the clichs to be seen they are typical of a film set in the midlate 50's in a rural southern town aggressive alcoholic cad of father who's always angry. Parents unmindful of children's wellbeing. Ramshackle homes in disrepair. Dirty barefoot children left unattended. Kids buying andor drinking beer. Overzealous religious nutjobs. Abused women who accept mistreatment. Trampy chainsmokers. Perverted pedophiles. Playing in the crick'. Soulful black people in oppression. Granny with a shotgun. Horrible homemade fashions. Blues and soulful music. Family love triangles. Home grown foods. Kids getting whoopin's. Dangerous critters running amok. Pitiful characters. Creepy characters. Old myths and legends. Mutt gets shot. White plantation home. Corn fields. Sage older black man. Broke down rusted vehicles. A fiery church service... trust Me I COULD keep going. It is through these devices that we get a real feel of the crude existence of some within our civilized society at different places and times.At least they spared us the usual overworked southern accents and graphic displays of domestic violence!Let's face it. Some of these stereotypical clichs are completely necessary for a story of this type. You can't make biscuits without flour southern pun. Fact is many of these things were true fixtures at that time. My grandmother and aunts can testify as much. Fanning's performance is the feature presentation here. It's almost award worthy almost. Perhaps it could have won if in a different movie. She is convincing and displays just the right amount of intensity in this serious role. She is bearing the weight of a timeperiod drama of a sensitive nature and does so remarkably well for someone of her age and career experience.Even when Lewellens actions are not wise we understand that she's still a naive child full of hope and wonder. Lewellen is indeed precocious and independent but she's an innocent and illequipped to perceive why others will hurt and disappoint her. Family support is nonexistent. What family she has is threatening and harsh. Family kills her dog abandons her on a whim can't provide can't offer comfort or affection makes her feel guilt and isolates her from her friends. Her friends and peers aren't very good either when they can betray her maliciously.What Lewellen does have is music a love for Elvis and his songs. Although such things are demonized by her grandmother Lewellen finds a safe place to express herself within them. Performing Elvis' songs brings joy a sense of pride and something for which to dream in an otherwise depressive place.We want to see Lewellen succeed and have some happiness the audience cares for this character and her plight. We wish her predicament weren't so bleak and the people in her life weren't so utterly worthless save one exception. There was an ominous cloud lingering around the father during the whole movie it was as if he may lose control at any moment and abuse his daughter. Every scene with the two of them together was uneasy even though the daughter didn't behave apprehensively. I thought the sets on this film were pretty good so sure they need some cinematic showcasing. There's reportedly some goofs dealing with cars but since I'm not an antique car expert I was never distracted. The editing could have been better tailored I can't quite pinpoint the specifics that could have been improved to make this film a classic... several production values are just off a little bit. I did not find the snake imagery obtrusive. It conveyed the message of being strangled by sin depravity and shame. It represents the differing types of venom that poisonously consume a person... this message was depicted in various other ways throughout the film. One could easily sift through this film for life lessons and spiritual significance and not be disappointed. The films ends leaving you unsatisfied but at least it ends on the appropriate note.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and was very very disappointed. First up let me say the rape scene was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story  it seemed very much out of place and like it was just inserted to generate controversy. The film had some tolerable aspects  I like parts of the cinematography  but the music seemed badly chosen and there were a few scenes where the editing didn't seem right  it seemed choppy done in a hurry maybe to cut out bits which would have been offending and pretend they were never shot. Dakota is an astounding actress but this was one of her weakest roles yet probably because the inexperienced director was unable to guide her performance. I thought the same about Robin Wright Penn. The other child actors appeared to have been equally badly guided and they don't have the experience of Fanning to be able to give good performances.

First up let me say the rape scene was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story  it seemed very much out of place and like it was just inserted to generate controversy. The film had some tolerable aspects  I like parts of the cinematography  but the music seemed badly chosen and there were a few scenes where the editing didn't seem right  it seemed choppy done in a hurry maybe to cut out bits which would have been offending and pretend they were never shot. Dakota is an astounding actress but this was one of her weakest roles yet probably because the inexperienced director was unable to guide her performance. I thought the same about Robin Wright Penn. The other child actors appeared to have been equally badly guided and they don't have the experience of Fanning to be able to give good performances.

Dakota's character is filmed in many PreRaphaelite shots and she has that sense of calm longing on her face that has been made popular by the PreRaphaelites. In contrast two of her main antagonists her Grammie and her father appear as Medieval country bumpkins in their last scene with her. It's pretty clear there is a subtextual analogy to the Renaissance and the Dark Ages here. During her rape one of Dakota's hands are pierced with a nail. This obvious Christlike reference is strengthened later when she appears in bed with her white underwear bunched and puffy as if in swaddling clothes or even a Christ mounted in contorted agony on the cross. Snakes infest her garden of Eden. They are everywhere. The only way to survive being bitten is too spit the poison out which she does metaphorically when she takes a deep breathe and belts out the Blues. Visually this Southern eden is filmed claustrophobically. Besides tall grass and bushes even the very trees work together to obscure the sun. Some have praised the Blues players as the light in Dakota's world. One reviewer rightly suggests this is patronizing a stereotype of the magical Negroes in Vagger Bance? In any event they free Dakota from this wicked Eden. By the way Dakota's character is no Saint but a survivor. She knowingly lets her father be killed by not warning him about a snake.".

	schema:reviewBody "Curiosity got the best of me and I finally saw this controversial film recently on DVD. The controversy centered around a rape scene and whether an 11yearold girl should be acting out scenes like that. Well when you're Dakota Fanning and your parents have already placed you in Rrated movies beginning at the age of seven or eight I guess this is no big deal to them.What I found a little different than most reviewers here I thought the story was interesting  not boring the acting decent Fanning is always good and the photography good.What I found objectionable were way too many scenes with the thin 12yearold when the movie was made Fanning being seen maybe a third of the time in just her underwear with a lot of closeup shots of her. Man how perverse and stupid can filmmakers be? This must be a favorite film of pedophiles. In this dayandage or any age for that matter do you really think it's a good idea to do that? Directorwriter Deborah Kampmeier apparently sees nothing wrong with it along with giving us the rape scene and having the young girl walking around with her totally naked dad played by David Morse. Also if you read discussions on the film from people who saw the movie at the theater there were several more very shocking scenes that were not even in this DVD. There is much more nudity involving several of the kids. Kampmeier is an example of liberal extremism run amok to the point of being really irresponsible. She sees this all as sexually liberating women from an early age. That isn't just my opinion the woman talks about it at length on the interview part of the DVD.The real shame is not the movie but that Fanning's parents think it's cool for her daughter to act in films like this showing so much skin at a very young age all in the name of stretching her acting talents. Wow. And they lambasted Mommie Dearest?In an era of Internet child porn is it any wonder few theaters would show this movie and that many people walked out of the theaters during screenings of this film which were far more explicit than what's on the DVD? The only thing is all the editing that took place for the DVD it made the story way too confusing with no answers on several key issues. It just winds up being a mess.Kampmeier also hates the church as she explains on the DVD bonus feature calling it opressive and repressive. You see that in the film with the girl's Grammie played by a bitterlookingandtalking Piper Laurie who shows only a nasty side....while being a churchgoer and Believer of course! In today's entertainment business this kind of consistent bigotry is not only condoned but encouraged. Hounddog is just one more example of it. Kampmeier's previous film also has the same bias.By the way if you were wondering why all the snakes Kampmeier they represented the church. Thankfully the public isn't in tune with her radical views and the film has been pretty much ignored.....and we only saw the muchedited tame version!".

I watched it twice to really get the feel and the point that this movie was trying to present. I have always been a fan of Dakota and her acting in this movie was not a disappointment. The rape scene was well done so as not to look too offensive. The movie was showing the life of an innocent girl in a small town and how she lived playfully and without any kind of guilt or fear of anything.

I watched it twice to really get the feel and the point that this movie was trying to present. I have always been a fan of Dakota and her acting in this movie was not a disappointment. The rape scene was well done so as not to look too offensive. The movie was showing the life of an innocent girl in a small town and how she lived playfully and without any kind of guilt or fear of anything.

	schema:reviewBody "Movies that make me feel as uneasy as Hounddog did are difficult to like. With that written I really have to commend Dakota Fanning for taking this role. It baffles me how a young girl could take on such dark subject matter and pull it off so well. She is very mature for her age but sometimes I wonder if acting in such adult situations perhaps confuses a young actress while she is in the process of growing up herself. The girl does strike me as strange when she's doing talk shows and such or maybe people tell her what to say when it comes to these subjects that I'm sure happens as well. Anyhow she plays a precocious preteen Lou Ellen growing up in poverty in the deepsouth during the 1950's with her strict ruler slapping bible hiding behind grandmother played by Piper Laurie and her abusive father. Life is pretty tough for the young girl so she turns to Elvis music for inspiration and happiness. Some shocking events occur in this movie that I find unspeakable besides I don't like giving away spoilers. Add in the clich black farm hand to help inspire the girl and help her see her way and add some clich Southern Gothic atmosphere and BAM! you got yourself My Girl minus the heart and smiles meets Black Snake Moan without the ebony and ivory SM. I'll probably always remember this movie and that's what really counts but did I enjoy it?...not really. One problem with the acting is David Morse' performance as the girl's father which didn't really work as well as some of the morally depraved characters he's played in past films such as his role in Dancer in the Darkthat was great stuff. He was abusive yet it seemed producerwriterdirector Deborah Kampmeier pushes the viewer to feel sorry for the fool and forgive and forget. I'm sure Lou Ellen will never forget the bruises which is obvious by the fact that she pledges someday I'm going to kill my daddy. Overall Hounddog overcomes its dark content and delivers somewhat of an inspiring message but it didn't really achieve bringing out my emotions the way a heartfelt drama should. In the end my eyes remained dry and I was expecting much more.".

Ever since Roman Holiday Rome was pretty popular with movie audiences. Three Coins in the Fountain and Seven Hills of Rome did pretty good box office in the 1950s. But this wasn't a Dean Martin role. I think MGM probably dusted off a property they had offered to Cary Grant and gave it to him. There was no real effort to exploit the unique personality that was Dean Martin.Nicholas Brodzky and Sammy Cahn wrote four songs for Dino to sing none of them especially memorable. As if they were hedging their bets they gave him a comedy number to do with Jules Munshin who plays his valet. Kind of like the material he used to do with Jerry Lewis at Paramount.According to the definitive biography of Dean Martin by Nick Tosches Dino turned down the lead in The Pajama Game for this one. Well movie audiences did get to see John Raitt finally do one of his Broadway starring roles for the screen. But Dean would have been perfect opposite Doris Day. Not his best career move.".

The story could have been told better.And we've got a pretty good cast here too  Dino Anna Maria Alberghetti Eva Bartok and Walter Slezak. And pretty good scenery with significant parts of the movie filmed on location in Rome. A producer and director who both had any number of successes in film history. Dean's two primary songs  You I Love and Only Trust Your Heart are decent songs for the late 1950s although his Capitol recordings of the songs are better than the soundtrack versions.I think in addition to some scenes that should have been deleted or completely rewritten that the other sisters should have had their characters developed just a bit more and without question the pace of the film should have been picked up quite a bit.I disagree with a number of our reviewers who see this as a failed romantic COMEDY. I don't think it is a comedy...although perhaps that's what the public wanted to see Dean doing right after his decade with Jerry Lewis. Instead this is a romantic musical film.It's worth watching though admittedly it's a bit weak. But then again so are lots of films.

	schema:headline " Charmless fifties comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "This was Dean Martin's first solo movie after his split with Jerry Lewis and a pretty dire one it is too. He plays Hunter a millionaire hotelier who flies to Rome to oversee the latest addition to his  empirea traditional old Roman hotel acquired from its aristocratic patron.While there he becomes engaged to the youngest of the four daughters of a musician played winningly by Walter Slezak in the best performance in the movie.He refuses permission for the marriage until the other elderdaughters are wed .So Martin  sets out to locate husbands for them .Further complicating matters is the growing affection between his bride to be and his pilot as played by Dewey Martin. It helps if you are writing a comedy to include some funny lines or scenes but some 48 hours after watching the picture not one line or scene stays in my mind as even mildly amusing .Nor are the regular musical interludes in which Martin breaks into song memorable in any way . Martin is woeful in a role calling for charm he merely appears smug and self satisfied .Thankfully he was to get better at light comedy but this performance is a total misfire . Some nice travelogue shots of Rome compensate but for the most part this is trite and derisory.".

He plays Hunter a millionaire hotelier who flies to Rome to oversee the latest addition to his  empirea traditional old Roman hotel acquired from its aristocratic patron.While there he becomes engaged to the youngest of the four daughters of a musician played winningly by Walter Slezak in the best performance in the movie.He refuses permission for the marriage until the other elderdaughters are wed .So Martin  sets out to locate husbands for them .Further complicating matters is the growing affection between his bride to be and his pilot as played by Dewey Martin.

	schema:reviewBody "This is Dean Martin's first film following his split with partner Jerry Lewis.  MGM signed him for this romantic comedy.  However there is nothing funny here.  Dean Martin was one of the funniest comedians of the 20th Century.  His persona was that of a drunk sex crazed ne'erdowell who could not get through a song without either slipping up or telling a joke. Even when he was the lowkeyed partner of manic Jerry Lewis there was something silly about him.  He can tell the oldest and cheapest jokes and charm the audience into laughing with him.  None of this is seen in this film.  This is just another example of how MGM had no idea what to do with comedians.  Buster Keaton the Marx Brothers Red Skelton Lucille Ball Laurel and Hardy Abbott and Costello and Donald O'Connor were also poorly handled by MGM.  Martin is in good company there!  Dino plays the straight role of an airline pilot who romances Anna Maria Alberghetti and sings some very poor songs by Nicholas Brodzsky.  If Dean's role would have been played by someone like Howard Keel or Vic Damone maybe I would not be complaining so much about the lack of comedy.  But even reliable character actors like Walter Slezak and Jules Munshin are wasted in this bore.  Thank goodness Martin was given the chance to play a showy role in The Young Lions. Another film like this and Dino's movie career would have been over.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just watched this Dean Martin's first movie without Jerry Lewis on YouTube. He plays hotel magnate Ray Hunter who's buying a long popular Italian inn in Rome. While there he meets the Martelli family of which the head is Papa Vittorio Walter Slezak who has four daughters of which the oldest is Maria Eva Bartok and the youngest is Nina Anna Maria Alberghetti. For a while he seems interested in the former but when he meets sculptor Anton Paul Henreid and finds out about their relationship he allows himself to be charmed by the latter who's just turned 18 or 19 depending on whose statement is right. Nina is also pursued by Mike Clark Dewey Martin who's a pilot for Hunter. I'll just say that while not much happens for the first 15 or 30 minutes once the plot I mentioned kicks in it becomes an intriguing premise to see how it all ends up. And Dean not only warbles some good romantic tunes with one of them a duet with the also compellingly musically talented Ms. Alberghetti he also gets a nice comic tune with Jules Munshin as his servant Arthur. Whatever laughs come gradually builds until the climatic scene with Slezak having to deal with all the potential soninlaws. No great shakes but as Dean's first film he has to carry on his own not a bad one to start with. So on that note Ten Thousand Bedrooms is worth a look. P.S. The gorgeous lady in the opening credits is played by one Monique van Vooren.".

A gross injustice as Malombra  unlike Piccolo Mondo Antico Mario Soldati's earlier film of an Antonio Fogazzaro novel  contains not one moment of triumphalist flagwaving or Fascist family values. Oddly akin to Rebecca in its atmosphere of deathhaunted romance and voluptuous doom it reaches a peak of visual refinement of which Hitchcock could only dream.Its star is Isa Miranda famous and not without reason as Italy's answer to Garbo and Dietrich playing a headstrong but unstable young noblewoman confined by her uncle to a gloomy villa on the shores of Lake Como. A yellowed and crumbling letter found in an old spinet convinces her that she is the reincarnation of her uncle's first wife  another troubled beauty who died a virtual prisoner after being caught in a forbidden love affair. When a handsome young writer Andrea Checchi comes to stay Miranda decides that HE is the reincarnation of the dead woman's lover. Gradually she lures him into her web of sex and revenge...What more to say without spoiling the fun? Miranda gives a performance to rival any of the great divas of Hollywood. Only Davis and Stanwyck perhaps could play a bad girl so boldly without losing all sympathy. The evocation of 19th century aristocracy in its full decadent splendour is visually and dramatically flawless  a model for such later Italian gems as Visconti's Senso and The Innocent.It helped perhaps that Soldati himself was a leading novelist. Blessed with an absolute respect for the classics he adapted but in no way inhibited by them. He was also the guiding spirit of the nowforgotten 'calligraphic' movement which brought the Italian cinema to such wondrous aesthetic heights during World War Two only to collapse before the horror of NeoRealism. Can we blame Soldati for giving up filmmaking in disgust and going back to writing novels?So if you've ever felt as I do that Rossellini's muchtouted Rome  Open City is the work of an amateur...well Malombra is the film you have to see!".

When Williams escapes from the inept Sheriff Hildy seizes the opportunity by using his 260 honeymoon money to payoff an insider and get the scoop on the escape. However Walter Burns the Post's editor is slow to repay Hildy back hoping that he will stay on the story. Getting a major scoop looks possible when Hildy stumbles onto the bewildered escapee and hides him in a rolltop desk in the press room. Burns shows up to help. Can they keep Williams' whereabouts secret long enough to get the scoop especially with the Sheriff and other reporters hovering around?";

The actors are some of the finest character and bit players ever assembled on screen and the lightning dialog and clever editing is really quite modern in its speed and ingenuity.I too am a devoted fan of His Girl Friday but these are two very different films. Front Page is a masterpiece of old school ensemble character acting and without it to break new ground I don't believe His Girl Friday would have had nearly the breakneck pacing and out of the bottle genius that it is rightfully remembered for. The Front Page should take an esteemed place in film history for being the fertile breeding ground of screwball comedy in general and many of its masterpieces including His Girl Friday in particular.

The role of Hildy Johnson is somewhat bland in this one  it was the genius of Hawks in changing this role into a more worthy foil for Burns that made His Girl Friday so outstanding  but in compensation some of the other reporters get more to do here.  The supporting cast has a number of good character actors especially Edward Everett Horton as the fussy Bensinger and it's good that they were given some worthwhile moments of their own.

In a press room outside the city jail a group of newspaper reporters idly await the execution of a communist sympathizer accused of murder. Once the story heats up though the press room becomes an absolute madhouse. The hilariously cynical script adapted from the play by Ben Hecht pulls no punches. Politics the justice system communist hysteria love and marriage are all targets for the biting wit of the author. The script is complemented by a good ensemble cast. Pat O'Brien gives a good performance as Hildy Johnson the star reporter for The Post who is leaving his job for marriage. Adolphe Menjou steals the show however as Walter Burns the conniving editor who will do anything to keep Johnson on the job. The rest of the news hounds are all expertly played striking us as fun loving jokers one minute but becoming downright violent the moment they smell a story. The movie also has a rare artistic style unequaled in most films. Though most of the movie takes place in the same location the cinematography is done so well that we never feel we are watching a stage play. The cameras constantly move around the room effectively putting us in the middle of the action. Pretty much everything about this film is done well. It is funny edgy artistic and thought provoking.

	schema:reviewBody "Although Howard Hawks gave The Front Page a different twist by making Hildy Johnson a woman and giving her a romantic involvement with editor Walter Burns The Front Page still holds up well today for its biting wit.All the clichs about newspapers as portrayed on film originate with this work. Lewis Milestone assembled a great cast of character actors as the gang in the press room and the lines they toss back and forth at each other are priceless. Even better were some of the lines at the expense of the self important political and law enforcement figures they cover.I suppose it's the nature of the job that makes newsmen cynical. But this group takes it to an exponential level. Frank Capra did something very similar in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. When newly appointed interim Senator James Stewart arrives in town and they make him out a buffoon Stewart goes around punching out all of them he can find. When he does reach the Capitol Press Room the whole group of them Thomas Mitchell Jack Carson Charles Lane etc. bring him up quite short. That group of correspondents could easily have been in the press room in The Front Page. I have no doubt that Capra was inspired by Milestone's work in The Front Page.The casting of the leads is quite a story. Pat O'Brien had played Walter Burns on stage and someone in the Howard Hughes organization got their wires crossed and signed him for Hildy Johnson. O'Brien made the switch effortlessly though. Lewis Milestone originally wanted Louis Wolheim with whom he'd worked the year before in All Quiet on the Western Front. But then Wolheim died suddenly right before filming was to start. Adolphe Menjou was hurriedly substituted and he proved to be an inspired choice.When The Front Page was done on the Broadway stage the roles of Johnson and Burns were played by Lee Tracy and Osgood Perkins. I could see either of them in their respective parts. Both got to Hollywood but too late to do either part for the screen.The two female roles of note were Johnson's fianc Peggy and the streetwalker who had befriended convicted killer George E. Stone who's execution the reporters are covering. Mae Clarke as the prostitute is just fine. A tough year for Mae she jumps through a window here and gets slugged with a grapefruit later on in Public Enemy.Mary Brian is the fianc and in an underwritten part she's dull as dishwater. Not her fault because the film is about the guys. But seeing this no wonder Howard Hawks got the inspired idea to eliminate her create THE Ralph Bellamy part and make Hildy Johnson a woman for His Girl Friday.Of course The Front Page has the look and feel of the era that birthed it. But the portrait of newspapermen is still fresh and the issues raised about crooked politicians running on law and order platforms is probably even more relevant today than back then.".

It shows its age at times and some of it is wildly overacted but O'Brien and Menjou are both just great in their roles. Also director Lewis Milestone uses some very unusual camera tricks to keep the story moving and there's lots of action and running around which is unusual for an early talkie.This was remade in 1940 with a sex change making Johnson a woman. That was His Girl Friday with Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant. That one is better than this but this is better than the 1974 version that had Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and 1988 remake called Switching Channels with Kathleen Turner and Burt Reynolds. They're all good to varying degrees but this one came first. Worth seeing.".

It shows its age at times and some of it is wildly overacted but O'Brien and Menjou are both just great in their roles. Also director Lewis Milestone uses some very unusual camera tricks to keep the story moving and there's lots of action and running around which is unusual for an early talkie.This was remade in 1940 with a sex change making Johnson a woman. That was His Girl Friday with Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant. That one is better than this but this is better than the 1974 version that had Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and 1988 remake called Switching Channels with Kathleen Turner and Burt Reynolds. They're all good to varying degrees but this one came first. Worth seeing.";

After watching Front Page again after watching Girl Friday I was struck by the original's emphasis on the role of the newspaper in revealing political corruption. But the question remains who's the girl? Not the actress but the girl in the picture hanging on the wall in back of Adolph Menjou's head during the final scenes... Since the movie was released in 1931 it can't be Jane Russell. She's to busty to be Katherine Hepburn Howard Hughes' friend. The only reason I noticed it was that she appears nude and Howard Hughes probably put it there to see if the 'censors' would notice.".

Way ahead of its time the camera explores the set and Milestone and his editor know how to use editing to create pace. This is not merely a filmed play. It is faithful to the play and excellently exploits the camera's ability to go to closeups long shots etc. The acting particularly by Adolphe Menjou is as good as in any version. I am also distressed by the comments of Eye 3 who agrees with Obscura that the dialog is shouted in order to be picked up by the microphones! The actors are shouting because their characters are excited  the rapid fire dialog coupled with shouting is an element of farce and is beautifully done and in the televised version I just watched on TCM entirely understandable! I do wish someone would restore this early gem to a print with a cleaned up picture and sound but given its age it is a remarkable treasure of early sound cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the biggest problems facing filmmakers in the early sound era was not a technical one but one of what form the stories should take. Now that the spoken word was a means of expression stage plays became a prime source for movie material. The only trouble was that while the theatre is not necessarily an inferior medium if you shoot a play simply as it is no matter how good it would be in the theatre on the screen it becomes static and dull. There are ways round this problem and they demonstrate how much of a difference it makes the way in which a movie is filmed.The Front Page's director Lewis Milestone was an ostentatious attentiongrabber who liked to make every use of the technology at hand. But all his showingoff was for a purpose. As oppose to the limited dimensions of the stage Milestone is always staging things in extremes of width and depth especially when introducing major characters. A really neat manoeuvre is when a cop visits the newsroom during a game of poker. The camera sits on the middle of the small table and pans round as each reporter is harangued in turn. A man walking round a table is a fairly lowkey bit of business but this technique makes it simply whirl. There is only one point where I feel it's too much when the camera bounces up and down on the faces of the reporters as they sing a taunting song. But the great thing is Milestone also knows when to tone it down and let the players shine. He often uses a long still take for a key scene such as Pat O'Brien and Adolphe Menjou's talk at the bar.But an equally important contribution is the sense of realistic camaraderie between the principle members of the cast. The atmosphere in the newsroom straddles comedic exuberance and realistic banter and as such is absolutely in the spirit of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's original work. Adolphe Menjou shows impeccable control with movements that are almost cartoonish such as the little backward lean into his stride off after announcing I'll kill him! It's a fresh approach but one that would catch on being very much the vein of Clark Gable's Oscarwinning performance in It Happened One Night 1934. Lead man Pat O'Brien is at his most extrovert and in the process his most likable. Walter Catlett is unflappably brilliant and there is also a chance to see Edward Everett Horton honing the persona that would make him a fixture throughout the next decade.The result is probably the most vibrant and effective stage adaptation of the early talkies and it set the tone of much of what was to come straddling the gap between the wild farce of the Marx Brothers and the sophisticated comedies like Dinner at Eight. Later directors George Cukor most notably would learn to tone down Milestone's approach and create stagetoscreen adaptations that flowed smoothly and were purely cinematic but The Front Page was nevertheless an important jolt to an industry still trying to find its way and a lesson in how to make a script low on action and confined in space into something dynamic and brassy.".

Engelhoffer is a funny parody of Dr. Freud and others like him. The fact that he wants to reenact the crime with an actual loaded pistol is hilarious even more hilarious is his surprise at being shot. Gustav von Seyffertitz went uncredited in his role but he is one of the more memorable performers in this farce.And Adolphe Menjou as the newspaper company owner is terrific. His relationship with Pat O'Brien is not simply an angry boss bullying his reporter these men are friends and have been through a lot. This is reflected in their performances especially in Menjou's.The only DVD of this movie is from Madacy Entertainment's Hollywood Classics Collection. This film transfer is horrible and has no more quality than a poor videotape. The picture is bad but the sound is really a problem. Hearing what a character says is crucial in the understanding of any movie. This could have easily been cleaned up like so many other movies of the 1930s and earlier are when they are put on DVD.Madacy's DVD does have a few interesting extras such as some newsreels not from the 1930s however from Pathe News Inc.I call for a new DVD of this great classic with a pristine transfer of both picture and sound. More people would watch this movie and enjoy this movie if they could hear what the actor's are saying.In any event I really did like this film a lot. Please see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the classic rendition filmed in 1931 titled The Front Page by Lewis Milestone with big cast as Adolph Menjou  Edward Everett Horton  Mae Clark and Pat O'Brien in his film debut . Acceptable version about known story in which a reporter wants to marry a beautiful woman but his mean editor impedes it . Riproaring vintage newspaper comedy The Front Page and subsequently  1940  the best retelling titled His girl friend and acceptable acting from everyone . Cynical editor named Walter Burns Louis Wolheim was originally cast to play him  but Adolphe Menjou got the part when Wolheim died suddenly  this character was based on a famed editor wants to get a big scoop on an execution which involves convincing star reporter Hildy Johnson Pat O'Brien  whose role was based on the reallife a notorious reporter to come back to work and put off her marriage to handsome millionaire Peggy Grant Mary Brian . Walter tries to keep him in town and break up her upcoming marriage takes place against the backdrop of a botched death row . Hildy can't resist covering some good news  even when it mean helping a condemned man getaway the law as she attempts to help an innocent man is about to be executed . And the escaped convicted murderer offers the journalist an exclusive interview . Other reporters also give hilarious acting in this breathless pursuit of an exclusive with the escaped death row inmate .Great cast gives powerful performances as Adolphe Menjou as a scheming publisher and Pat O'Brien as a convincing as well as incautious journalist . Agreeable play and screenplay from Ben Hecht  Charles MacArthur about a cunning managing editor of a known newspaper and his ambitious reporter . The journalists are all based on actual reporters who were Chicago colleagues of authors Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur with most working alongside them at the courthouse  the real names were only slightly changed . Bartlett Cormack Charles Lederer's brilliantly tart dialogue overlaps story to carry the black farce along the rollercoasted speed . Attractive performance from Pat O'Brien as ace journalist who wants to quit the business and get married and likable Adolphe Menjou as an editor who finds out his main reporter wants to leave him and gets in the way . Inventive and furious screen combats in which Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien are given equal footing with staccato dialog and sparkling interpretations . Phenomenal playing from everyone  including a topnotch secondary cast such as Edward Everett Horton  George Stone  Mae Clarke  Slim Summerville and Matt Moore . Mediocre cinematography by cinematographer Hal Mohr who replaced Tony Gaudio  being necessary an alright remastering because of film copy is wornout and suffers the public domain . Professional direction by Lewis Milestone render more funny than usual  and achieved success enough . Rating  65 . Worthwhile watching . Other versions about this this frequenttold story are the followings  The play The Front Page opened at the Times Square Theater on August 14 1929 and ran for 276 performances . As Osgood Perkins  Anthony Perkins's father  created the role of Walter Burns on the Broadway stage . And Academy Award Theater broadcast a 30 minute radio adaptation of the movie on June 22 1946 with Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien reprising their film roles . In cinema a classic adaptation titled His Girl Friday  1940  it makes some memorable exchanges  directed by Howard Hawks with Gary Grant  Ralph Bellamy and Rosalind Russell with the pivotal character assigned to a woman instead a man  and do't miss this stunning adaptation The front page by the great Billy Wilder with Jack Lemmon as journalist  Walter Matthaw as managing editor and Carol Burnett . And 1988 new recounting  a modernized fourth remake titled Switching Channels in which an attractive TV anchorwoman want to marry tycoon but his mean exhusband impedes it  starred by Burt Reynolds  Kathleen Turner  and Christopher Reeve  being directed by Ted Kotcheff .".

	schema:headline " Not as Good as the 1940 Remake But Has Good Moments";
	schema:reviewBody "Most of the fans of the Hecht  MacArthur stage play THE FRONT PAGE probably think that the 1940 version with Cary Grant Rosalind Russell and Ralph Bellamy is the best. It certainly has a spunky approach that is due to the sexual tension of the the female lead with her two male partners. But the play originally had the role of Hildy Johnson as a man played here by Pat O'Brien and in the later Billy Wilder version by Jack Lemmon and so those two versions actually are closer to the actual play. Still one of the best lines of the play does not appear in this version. When Molly Mae Clarke the streetwalker who befriends Earl Williams George E. Stone confronts the reporters as a bunch of lying jackals she is shoved out of the press room by Murphy the reporter Walter Catlett here. But although her words sear the men as we see once Catlett shuts the door on her the same scene in 1940 was handled better by Howard Hughes and Rosalind Russell. Russell led the actress playing Molly out of the room shuts the door behind them and then reenters facing the men who are all shame faced. Quietly and with dignified disgust Russell says Gentlemen of the Press! to summarize how they have mangled Williams and Molly Molloy by their lying. As I said that line is in the play spoken by Hildy.This version was produced by Howard Hughes and directed by Lewis Milestone. Milestone's use of a moving camera is obvious in several scenes where we see reporters and characters moving in the reporter's room at the city prison around the central table. This is obvious to counter the fact that much of the play is static  it's a one set play. But the movement reminds one of how Milestone used a moving camera a year earlier in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT in the sequences showing doomed charges against machine gun emplacements.While not comparable to Cary Grant's Burns in 1940 Adolphe Menjou does make the editor a figure of silent control. He shows up suddenly at the reporters room after sending several phone calls earlier while everyone is facing the opposite direction making his entry properly silent and sinister in its way. Grant was more pompous in the role while Menjou is a master of psychological approach when he wants watch how he plays O'Brien to get him to type his news report. Menjou is also seen breaking a law setting off a fire alarm box to force O'Brien to come into the street.Bits and pieces of business are shown that did not appear in later versions. Slim Summerfield's Mr. Pincus a nice performance but nothing like that immortal example of kindly befuddlement Billy Gilbert's Mr. Pettibone in 1940 is seen not only dropping off the pardon from the governor but seen descending in an elevator. Edward Everett Horton believing he's going to a better job is seen trying to get a cab and finding that he has gone into Mary Brian's by accident. Molly is taken after injuring herself to a hospital cell and the reporters are there waiting to see if they can question her. The shooting of Dr. Englehofer Gustav Von Seyfertitz with the Warden's Clarence Wilson's gun is actually shown here with the idiot psychiatrist declaring the stunned Williams dementia praecox.The performances besides Menjou's are good. O'Brien is certainly at odds with himself as he sees how much he loves his career and how much he loves Brian. O'Brien is more aware of her newspaper rival personified by Menjou than Bellamy was in the 1940 film. The newspapermen are an interesting mixed bunch best being Catlett Frank McHugh oddly enough his character's name is McCue and Horton. Horton is quite the hypochondriac fussbudget Ernest Truex was not quite like this in the 1940 version constantly spraying against germs and gargling with Listerine  Catlett in disgust asks if Horton can stop stinking up the room with disinfectants! It lacks the surer touch of Hawks who again and again knew how to make successful film comedies. Milestone usually directed dramas and while he is not ham handed one misses Hawks better control. Still this 1931 film is a good version and won't disappoint the viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "I tried watching THE FRONT PAGE at least three different times. However the first two times the copies I had were unwatchablewith very very poor sound and washed out prints. The first was a videotape the second was a DVD. Only when I saw a cleaner print on Turner Classic Movies was I able to enjoy the film. This is because apparently this is a public domain filmand so many of the versions out there are in horrid condition.The reason I wanted to see the film so badly is that it's remake from 1940 HIS GIRL Friday is one of the best films of the decade and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Well now I am glad that I did finally see THE FRONT PAGE because I enjoyed this film almost as much as its remake. This is rare for me because I almost always hate remakes and I can't think of a single example where I liked BOTH about equally.For the most part the plot and much of the dialog is identical in the two films. However there are some major changes. First Hildy Johnson was a man in THE FRONT PAGE but in HIS GIRL Friday there was a sex change! Now Rosalind Russell took on the role originally played by Pat O'Brien and both did great jobs. Additionally as THE FRONT PAGE was a crude film even by the PreCode standards of 1931 you may be surprised to hear some cursing a scene where a reporter gives the mayor the middle finger and the final crude line of the film though it is obscured by the loud noise he's clearly saying a rather foul line. Even by today's very relaxed standards this is a rather adult filmnot better or worse but certainly more realistic because of this.As for the plot it's already been explained by other reviewers so I won't beat a dead horse. However the film truly excels mostly because of its very cynical and dark writing. The dialog is simply wonderful and the characters are amazingly dark as well. While the actors all did a good job they couldn't help it due to the play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur! The only minus and it didn't bother me in the least is that in 1931 films were much quieter because incidental music was almost always absentand this is no exception. However I actually think it works just fine and makes the film seem a bit more realistic and gritty.Overall any person who prides themselves on being a student of film should watch this filmit is a classic in the same league as its much more famous cousin HIS GIRL Friday.".

	schema:headline " A hilarious farce that lives up to its remake";
	schema:reviewBody "THE FRONT PAGE 1931 is a snappy quickwitted comedy about a newspaper man trying to leave the business and get married while his peers scramble to cover the story of the year. The movie is based on a stage play and the same story was adapted with some tweaks in 1940 for Howard Hawks's brilliant HIS GIRLFRIDAY starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell.I absolutely love HIS GIRLFRIDAY and wasn't expecting much from this earlier and lesserknown version. But I must say that THE FRONT PAGE is itself a terrific film that though slightly different but mostly similar is just as great as HIS GIRLFRIDAY. The wonderful humor must be inherent in the original play.The ensemble cast is superb including Pat O'Brien as the soontobemarried star reporter Adolphe Menjou as his big shot editor Clarence Wilson as the harassed sheriff George E. Stone as a condemned man and a roomful of reporters including Frank McHugh Walter Catlett and Edward Everett Horton.Made in 1931 early on in the sound era the movie certainly looks pretty old. But I thought it was great. The script is very witty and the direction by Oscarwinner Lewis Milestone is good. I particularly enjoyed the direction in the pressroom scenes with all of the reporters and all of the phones and the various snippets of conversation.Also being a precode comedy there are some bits that might have been deemed too vulgar had the film been made only a few years later. There are some allusions to promiscuity some almost swear words and even a brief instance of flipping the bird.HIS GIRLFRIDAY 1940 is an alltime classic screwball comedy. But if you enjoyed that film you're sure to love THE FRONT PAGE 1931. The story is basically the same there's less of a romantic angle as the star reporter is a man in this version but a lot of the jokes are fresh. And this version offers wonderful performances by Menjou Catlett Horton et al. Both movies are delightful comedies and it's too bad that this earlier version isn't as well remembered as its remake.THE FRONT PAGE is a classic in its own right and was nominated for three big Academy Awards Best Actor Best Director and Best Picture. I'd definitely recommend checking it out whenever you can find it.".

	onyx:emotionText "THE FRONT PAGE 1931 is a snappy quickwitted comedy about a newspaper man trying to leave the business and get married while his peers scramble to cover the story of the year. The movie is based on a stage play and the same story was adapted with some tweaks in 1940 for Howard Hawks's brilliant HIS GIRLFRIDAY starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell.I absolutely love HIS GIRLFRIDAY and wasn't expecting much from this earlier and lesserknown version. But I must say that THE FRONT PAGE is itself a terrific film that though slightly different but mostly similar is just as great as HIS GIRLFRIDAY. The wonderful humor must be inherent in the original play.The ensemble cast is superb including Pat O'Brien as the soontobemarried star reporter Adolphe Menjou as his big shot editor Clarence Wilson as the harassed sheriff George E. Stone as a condemned man and a roomful of reporters including Frank McHugh Walter Catlett and Edward Everett Horton.Made in 1931 early on in the sound era the movie certainly looks pretty old. But I thought it was great. The script is very witty and the direction by Oscarwinner Lewis Milestone is good. I particularly enjoyed the direction in the pressroom scenes with all of the reporters and all of the phones and the various snippets of conversation.Also being a precode comedy there are some bits that might have been deemed too vulgar had the film been made only a few years later. There are some allusions to promiscuity some almost swear words and even a brief instance of flipping the bird.HIS GIRLFRIDAY 1940 is an alltime classic screwball comedy. But if you enjoyed that film you're sure to love THE FRONT PAGE 1931. The story is basically the same there's less of a romantic angle as the star reporter is a man in this version but a lot of the jokes are fresh. And this version offers wonderful performances by Menjou Catlett Horton et al. Both movies are delightful comedies and it's too bad that this earlier version isn't as well remembered as its remake.THE FRONT PAGE is a classic in its own right and was nominated for three big Academy Awards Best Actor Best Director and Best Picture. I'd definitely recommend checking it out whenever you can find it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Classic preCode comedy about goings on at a newspaper. While everyone searches for a man who has escaped from death row the paper's editor Adolphe Menjou tries to stop his ace reporter Pat O'Brien from getting married. Based on a successful play it's a fantastic film that suffers only from its early talkie trappings and from the comparison to its more polished 1941 remake His Girl Friday. For my money Friday is the more entertaining film but this is certainly enjoyable too. Fastpaced with a cynical script full of snappy dialogue as well as a cast of terrific character actors supporting stars O'Brien and Menjou who are both excellent in their own right. This includes Edward Everett Horton Frank McHugh Walter Catlett Slim Summerville George E. Stone Clarence Wilson and Mae Clarke. Really great lineup. Impressive direction from Lewis Milestone who keeps things moving enough that it doesn't feel like a filmed stage play as was often the case with adaptations back then.Remade a few times as the aforementioned His Girl Friday The Front Page 1974 and Switching Channels. I've said already that Friday is my favorite version of this story however Friday wouldn't exist without this and the play of course so credit where credit is due. This is the premiere newspaper movie from this period perhaps of any period. PreCode films often have a technical roughness to them especially those that have fallen into public domain but they also have a lot of grit that many viewers prefer to the polished and sometimes oversanitized Hollywood films made after.".

Adolphe Menjou is the hard nosed editor that does everything he can to keep O'Brien from his wedding and honeymoon because the rest of his reporters are a bunch of incompetents. O'Brien not only gets the story but gets the criminal as well. In those days and to some degree today getting the scoop on another paper was first and foremost in the minds of editors and reporters. With O'Brien's Hildy he is willing to sacrifice everything. Most of the movie takes place at the newspaper and it is played extremely well as a claustrophobic ant farm with reporters taking liberties all over the place but with a dedication to doing real news stories.

These technical deficiencies came with the period and might be easily forgiven if there was something of cinematic interest to be found but this is not filmmaking. It's a filmed play and a bad one at that. Badly shot badly lit and the stagy acting style doesn't help either with just about everyone shouting their lines to the ceiling or the windows wherever the microphones are hidden. I guess the material is OK based on the later adaptations of he piece but it's almost impossible to figure it out so distracted is the viewer by the constant clamoring. I know it's an early talkie but that's no reason to ignore the far too many shortcomings of this film. If you like the material remade infinitely better by Howard Hawks as HIS GIRL Friday 1940 better but not brilliant by Billy Wilder as THE FRONT PAGE 1974 and yet again as SWITCHING CHANNELS 1988 with Kathleen Turner and Christopher Reeve.

On the other hand I was able to relate to the story of a woman who strove to be the best only to falter and be dragged down by peers.  In a sense Mona is to be applauded for her determination to shine through a life of failure and loneliness  a true testament to the feats that can be achieved though hard work.  Naturally giving up her child to selfishly pursue a vain dream is almost despicable but it makes the triumphant ending ever so much more inspiring that this confused human being triumphs not only over adversity to be crowned Miss American Miss but more importantly that she conquers her own selfcentred frailties to realise the joy to be found in loving the beautiful gift of life she already possesses.".

Although Mona does some malicious things throughout the movie such as letting her friend raise her daughter so that she can still compete and taking a pregnant woman to the hospital in a shopping cart just to get picture in the paper I think the point that Sally Fields' is trying to get across is that she had the desire to achieve her dream and she never let anything stand in her way on the road there.  It wasn't easy for Mona but she made her dreams become a reality as it is implied that many of the other Miss American Miss contestants had it handed to them.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS THROUGH I did not think Beautiful was bad so much as unstructured. One minute the audience was watching a rather serious drama the next almost a spoof on pageants. I really don't think the whole pageant movie thing has become overdone yet but most movies about this subject in my opinion just aren't very good. Beautiful has some nice moments but by and large it's all over the place as far as genres go drama comedy satire. I think it really should have stayed just a drama because the plot was interesting and the cast was good.As far as Driver's performance goes she was convincing. The problem is that so much of what takes place is such a satire that it's almost impossible to take the serious moments seriously. The character of Mona also changes so abruptly that it is impossible not to be skeptical. Instead of so much silly satire it would have been nice if more character development of Mona had gone on. I could buy the fact that she grew and matured but more time was needed in the movie to show her transition. We don't get to see enough character development of anyone and to much time is wasted on things that have no relevance to the plot such as the scheming reporter who wants to ruin Mona's reputation. What was the point with that? It did not even fit into the storyline.The best aspect of this movie was the character of Vanessa who was played not just well but with excellence. I really enjoyed her scenes with Mona and actually really enjoyed a rare few moments of this movie that had a whole lot of potential it's nowhere near as Bad as many critic reviews say in my opinion and at least they didn't throw in an unconvincing romance and make the whole thing a romantic comedy to boot. But it's like the movie gave up and decided it did not need to make a strong effort on structure and character development or something.If a bit more effort had gone into dialog if Mona's character had been a bit more developed if some of the silly stuff had been dropped and if Mona's and Vanessa's relationship had unfolded a bit more realistically this movie would have been quite something. As it stands it's about average.".

I really don't think the whole pageant movie thing has become overdone yet but most movies about this subject in my opinion just aren't very good. Beautiful has some nice moments but by and large it's all over the place as far as genres go drama comedy satire. I think it really should have stayed just a drama because the plot was interesting and the cast was good.As far as Driver's performance goes she was convincing. The problem is that so much of what takes place is such a satire that it's almost impossible to take the serious moments seriously. The character of Mona also changes so abruptly that it is impossible not to be skeptical. Instead of so much silly satire it would have been nice if more character development of Mona had gone on. I could buy the fact that she grew and matured but more time was needed in the movie to show her transition. We don't get to see enough character development of anyone and to much time is wasted on things that have no relevance to the plot such as the scheming reporter who wants to ruin Mona's reputation. What was the point with that? It did not even fit into the storyline.The best aspect of this movie was the character of Vanessa who was played not just well but with excellence. I really enjoyed her scenes with Mona and actually really enjoyed a rare few moments of this movie that had a whole lot of potential it's nowhere near as Bad as many critic reviews say in my opinion and at least they didn't throw in an unconvincing romance and make the whole thing a romantic comedy to boot. But it's like the movie gave up and decided it did not need to make a strong effort on structure and character development or something.If a bit more effort had gone into dialog if Mona's character had been a bit more developed if some of the silly stuff had been dropped and if Mona's and Vanessa's relationship had unfolded a bit more realistically this movie would have been quite something. As it stands it's about average.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is Sally Field's directorial debut in a feature film and I give her mixed reviews.  Most of the criticism I have with this film is the way it is directed.  It has a schizophrenic presentation.  On one hand it is a satire about beauty pageants and the women who compete in them.  On the other it is a serious story about a young woman trying to overcome her mother's rejection and validate her self worth by winning beauty contests.  Added to the dramatic element is a personal growth epiphany as the shallow beauty queen comes to terms with life's priorities embracing her daughter as being more important than her dream.Either of these elements could have worked alone but together they are incongruous.  The satire trivializes the humaninterest story and the humaninterest story weighs down the comedy.  Field's direction as has been recently true of her acting roles is best suited for the humaninterest angle.  In this film that is the strongest element.  Despite my being cynical about how predictable and schmaltzy this story was I still couldn't help being choked up at the end sappy as it was.  This is to Field's credit as a dramatic director.  However her attempt to fuse the two discordant elements is misguided and it detracts from the overall entertainment value of the film.The acting is generally good.  Minnie Driver is a far better dramatic actor than she is a comedian and that is reflected in this film.  In the satirical comedy scenes her acting is very forced and artificial.  In the serious dramatic scenes with Mona's mother and daughter she is compelling and believable.  Joey Lauren Adams gives a consistently excellent performance as Mona's best friend and Vanessa's surrogate mother.  Adams is lovable steady and kind and she effuses sincerity.  This film is a showcase for Hallie Kate Eisenberg the Media's latest child phenom.  A favorite in commercials and on the Jay Leno show Eisenberg shows in this film that she can really act delivering an astonishing performance as Mona's pouty but perceptive child I'm seven I'm not stupid!'.This is a good film for women.  The comedy is not that funny but the motherdaughter angle will be good for a Kleenex or two.  I rated it a 710 including a onepoint bonus for the schmaltzy but effective ending.

She manages to balance both goofy humor a dash of reality and even some dark elements of society which the movie rises above and slaps into place rather than wallowing in.  Even characters who do unlikable things come across as interesting.  This movie has layers that snotty critics may not give it credit for.  It was a great audience pleaser by the way and it is able to blatantly say things and get a laugh without coating idealistic thoughts in too much irony.

And it also helps that Minnie Driver sings her own song she has an excellent voice! in the big finale. Now truth be told the two stories do not blend together in perfect harmony and there is some dissonance ... until the aforesaid pageant scene which is pretty much worth the ticket. It is a 6hankie extravaganza. It also helps that Hallie Kate Eisenberg pretty much steals every scene not otherwise nailed down. Clever casting by the end of the film the audience suddenly realizes OMG she does look like Driver after all. Underrated and not a bad way to spend an afternoon.

The plot is somewhat clichd the acting is nothing special and yet... I find myself watching this movie over and over again. Somehow the idea of a secret military force funded by the church dedicated to fighting vampires is thrilling even though I'm not a religious man. I suppose it harkens back to the day of witch hunters. James Woods is great as the grim dedicated man sworn to destroy all vampires and as the true shocker the generic Baldwin appearing in the movie does a really good job as well!

	schema:reviewBody "I was puzzled by the low rating Vampires got it's my favorite movie of 199899. Why do I give the date in that manner? I was unfortunate enough to see this movie in the uncut version as shown in France in the US version and just a few weeks ago in the German one.But first things first  I am female and I have read so many reviews and comments telling me that I as a woman should feel disgust at the alleged misogynous undertone of Vampires. I am sorry but in none of the three versions I saw did I feel hear or see anything which might support this allegation! Crow hated practically everyone except for Montoya and the first priest Montoya  while quipping left and right  behaved quite kindly towards Lee's hooker except where she directly caused him to react violently and none of the other oneliners warrant IMO even a raised eyebrow regarding that special topic.Let me add that I also am not religious with my own perceptive view of enough past wrongs done by the Catholic church so that any of the soidisant hate directed at that church is in my opinion wellfounded given the plot. Callan's explanation of how he views god as well as several other references by Crow and Montoya underline the basic belief of the vampire hunters while maintaining their nononsense attitude.With that back to why I liked the movie so much it is in its own way as stark and streamlined as the best samples of its genre the cinematography is just perfect with the right mixture of visual and nonvisual storytelling the dialogue is engagingly humorous throughout feels real and allows each character his or her own voice there are several deeply moving scenes either visually or characterwise moving which will stay with the audience there are enough novelties incorporated to make this rendition of the vampire theme fresh and quite frankly I liked Carpenter's score a lot too.What wins me completely over is the very obvious fun all the actors had with their roles. James Woods was perfect as sardonic illusionfree Crow and his brushing campiness with the tip of a finger yet withdrawing just in time is priceless. Daniel Baldwin makes the most of his character's arc nicely underplaying his role while he still manages to convey Montoya's journey by minimal changes of expression or voice. The final scene couldn't have been done any better. Sheryl Lee gives what I consider one of the strongest supports I've seen in quite a few years whether by male or female actors especially when you count in the scarcity of means she's handed over. Ian Griffith had several fine moments and the entire supporting cast was refreshing in their nonHollywoody realistic natural look and acting. The overall impression was of people enjoying what they're expertly doing.An advice to the German audience  I noted while watching the dubbed release that the translation killed practically every single punch line and nearly all of the humor. And it could have been translated properly. The voice actors dubbing for Woods and Baldwin did so without recreating even a tenth of what both actors put into their voices in the original version. I do think that some of the disappointment expressed there is due the extremely low quality of the translation and dubbing. See the movie in its original language. I also can't see any reason for the loss of those scenes which were cut out of the US release when compared to the French one. The movie loses quite some strength this way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why is this movie so appealing? I don't know how to answer this other than what I love about it James Woods! Vampires is a movie brought to us by horror mastermind John Carpenter who almost gave up film making because he became disgusted by how Hollywood got so greedy. I'm so glad he decided to make Vampires because if not for his touch I think this movie could have been really bad or bland. I'm very sad to say that Vampires seems to get overlooked or shadowed when people bring up great vampire movies a lot. I think because Blade was also released the same year so it just got lost in 1998. However I still love this movie it's a western horror fright film that I'm sure will have you on the edge of your seat. A lot of people complain about James Woods being too camp in his rolesince when did that become such a bad thing? He's so awesome in this movie and really makes it exciting.Mercenaries led by Jack Crow rids an abandoned house of vampires in the middle of New Mexico. The sun sets and as the Slayers leave the Master bursts out of the ground outside the house. The slayers stay at a motel in the middle of a desert getting drunk smoking and partying with women as they celebrate their victory. One of the prostitutes is a young woman named Katrina. When the master vampire Valek turns up at the motel he bites Katrina and massacres the slayers and prostitutes. During this attack Valek sees Jack and calls him by name which astonishes Crow. Crow and his partner Montoya run outside and grab Katrina take a pickup truck and drive off. Narrowly escaping from Valek they keep on driving for a few more hours until dawn. While Crow goes back to the motel to deal with the remains of the team and prostitutes Montoya takes Katrina to the nearest hotel. Meanwhile Montoya has gotten another hotel room and he tells Katrina that she has been bitten by Valek and that she too will be one soon if they cannot find and destroy him. She now has a telepathic link to the Master. They are using her to find out his real plans and why and who set them up.I think between John's touch to the film it was the cast who really made this something special. James Woods brings a lot of fun to the film being almost an extreme Rambo. Not since the Frog brothers in Rambo have I seen such passion to kill vampires. I love when he walks away from the explosion at the hotel that's a few feet behind him I always have to say Yeah I know there's an explosion behind me. What you think I don't see explosions? I do every day! They bore me now!. Daniel Baldwin plays off James very well and did great being the sidekick who does stand his ground when pushed too hard. Sheryl Lee very chilling performance at times she doesn't do much in the film but when she does have powerful scenes she pulls in very well with great screams. Tim Guinee the replacement priest with no experience whatsoever I adore him playing off James Wood's tough exterior. Him trying to stand up to James but he knows he can't win with him however when put to the test he really comes through for the guys and turns into Arnold Schwarzenslayer. And the final star of the film and a very haunting performance with Thomas Ian Griffith as the vampire Vallek. Great performance by him and he is a very savage vampire who reminds you that not all vampires are romantic with cheesy accents. I love the whole style of the film it feels raw and like you're riding with the cowboys. A lot of beautiful colors of the sunset and the shadows to give you a chilling feel. This film may just require a certain taste but I think most people do enjoy this film and I'm sure somewhere down the line it will get the appreciation it deserves. Much thanks to John Carpenter giving the film industry one more try and bringing us a great vampire movie.810".

The main thing separating this picture from that forgotten directtovideo film is that it gets a better cast and director than it really deserves. John Carpenter may not be at the top of his 'Halloween' game but he is still able to do what he has all ways done best create a heightened sense of fear and atmosphere. Vampires does have some blood and gore but it doesn't cover the wallsit's ability to use these fun and quirky characters is the draw. James Woods is that main character Jack Crow. Crow leads a Vatican approved group of Vampire slayers who have met their match in the form of Valek the very first bloodsucker. Jack's crew is brutally killed and he and his partner Montoya are the only two left standing. He rebuilds his crew with Katrina who is linked to Valek throuh a bite in her neck.Woods isn't the actor I would expect to headline this project but he takes the material very seriously. I imagine the opportunity to work with Carpenter is what persuaded him and the two play off of each other's strengths. Carpenter was never someone who was strong in developing heroes for his pictures and James Woods is able to make this Crow stand out. Vampires is a High Noon western horror hybrid and Woods plays Crow as the cowboy with a dash of outlaw in him. The plot of Valek looking to find this crucifix isn't all that fun or new but the journey is.I guess the problem I have with this film is that it doesn't really have villains. These vampires aren't interesting or eloquent and they let other people do the talking for them. Valek gets some dialouge but it is little more than the filler You'll never get me. I guess I kind of wanted a Bela Lugosi who could wouldn't lose his battle to Crow in a fistfight. The follower Vampires are mindless drones meant to merely snarl. This isn't fun because it really just makes this an action film. Carpenter loves the Westerns but some of the fun of the Westerns was who the villain was.".

I have not always liked Carpenter's work but this one is up there with his older classics in my opinion. I think the reason it was not well received is that movie audiences of today especially American movie audiences have become more jaded and desensitized to the effects of horror.After all what makes horror true horror to you? Is it more blood? More graphic scenes showing disemboweled corpses in detail? The true psychological mind game? Ghosts? Monsters? What? That question is answered differently by every person you ask. Therefore no horror movie especially a specific genre of horror movie will satisfy every fan of that genre. Vampire fans in particular are discriminating creatures who demand a certain level of story quality effects quality and believability. Otherwise they will turn on the makers like a pack of rabid wolves.There are rules which must be followed or the movie loses its flavor for these discriminating and sometimes sophisticated palettes. Carpenter broke the rules in this endeavor and the lack of its success embodies the fans' contempt for his lack of respect for the main principles of vampirism.Guns were far too widely used here. They were much better utilized in Len Wiseman's Underworld in which unique bullets were used. I won't go into the details so as not to spoil that movie for anyone who has yet to see that pure work of art. Click my name to see my review of it.I liked the plot and I found this movie very enjoyable. I however am not the discriminating vampire fan. I highly enjoyed Lost Boys although I would not recommend it to another fan of that specific genre due to its mainstreamality. Honestly there are very few vampire movies out there which live up the the rigid expectations of the true vampire fan. This movie is one of those movies I would recommend merely because while it violates some of the basic rules behind vampirism and is not what I would classify as an intelligent vampire film it still has a few redeeming qualities.These vampires have an agenda. They are on a mission. They do not simply kill to feed. They are after the black cross in order to liberate their species from the prison of darkness and will kill anyone in their way. There are some suspenseful scenes and this movie does carry a degree of intensity but it was otherwise a bit disappointing for the true vampire fan.While the Master Vampire in this endeavor is purported to be the original vampire his demonstrations of vampire craft are not very impressive. According to legend those rules I mentioned earlier older vampires are accorded specific powers which young vampires are not. While he does demonstrate the legendary feats of strength that is where it stops. That in itself was quite disappointing. The potential was here and as I said there are some great elements but this movie fails miserably to live up to its expectations and potential.My honest recommendations for good vampire movies would be Underworld Dusk Til Dawn Salem's Lot the made for TV movie and not the butchered video release...beware! and Near Dark one of the best in my opinion. I being a romantic loved Interview with a Vampire regardless of the hidden subtext and omitted story lines but that is my personal choice. Fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles for the most part hated that movie for those reasons and others I'm sure and her Queen of the Damned was completely bastardized on film so I'll stand by the movies I've already named here with Underworld at the top of the list. I found that movie to be extremely good. I judged Underworld harder than most because of the high expectations I had for that movie. I was not disappointed. If you are a fan of horror andor vampirewerewolf lore check it out. It's going to be a classic one day.This movie rates a 9.310 with few slow spots and lots of heavy fastpaced action.the Fiend .".

	schema:reviewBody "John Carpenter is America's greatest living director of westerns.  Although Vampires is his first literal western JC's been turning out 1st rate original westerns from Assault on Precinct 13 to They Live and Escape From New York to The Thing.  Even though these movies don't take place in the west they have all the ingredients of a good western the lone herooutlaw the seige or attack the showdown and plenty of action. Vampires takes place and was filmed in the southwest filmed in Sante Fe NM.  Carpenter's DP Gary Kibbe captures some nice wide John Fordish western vistas and Carpenter's minimalist score capture the desolate hard nature of the place.  The real asset of this film is its cast especially James Woods as the insanely tough and foulmouthed slayer Jack Crow.  He really does some inspired improvised riffs and when he's not kicking ass Woods has a lot of fun with it all.  Jack Crow is a classic Carpenter hero all man flinty eyed  completely alone and Woods plays this unsympathetic character with such a quick wit you can't help but admire the guy.  Thomas Ian Griffith plays a great Valek the master vampire whom Jack has sworn to slay.  Griffith plays the character completely straight and it works extremely well.  Griffith is an imposing figure and you get a real sense of the nobility  savagery of Valek's character.  Compared to Woods Griffith underplays his role but still commands a very real presence of power  evil.  Carpenter stretches the 20 million dollar budget well but you can sometimes see the zipper down the monster's back.  Despite a few fake looking wounds or rubbery stakes Carpenter delivers a polished  stylish film on par with movies costing 10 times as much better in some cases.  I believe Carpenter works best with a little larger budget but he should stay away from the typical Hollywood giant budget he works best with a smaller production.  Vampires is a treat for any Carpenter fan and hopefully marks the beginning of a new standard in his films.".

John Carpenter's VAMPIRES story is interesting but it seems like there was just something missed in the overall picture. Although the places that they traveled to eradicate the 'nests' was very desertGothicism in other words it was the place you would figure they would be. The camera work the colors and the entry of the characters was juicy I truly was enveloped into the film's visual outlay. But as it went through there was just something that I felt it lacked. James Woods Jack Crow for me however always brings something different and insightful to the characterrole that he is 'in'. Whether it's the crudwhite trash in The Onion Field or his newest quest in the legal world Shark. James Woods was the actor that won the 'Saturn'award that year for best actor in a science fiction horror film. Nuff said. I always seem to enjoy the Baldwin brothers when they are characters in a story. Daniel brought his on in this one too. He was a biggood guy not a perfect goodguy but a big part of Jack's team.Sheryl Lee the female Vampire in the movie however I don't know if she did drugs then or if she was just annoying. Maybe it's me who has the problem but I just think that part was somewhat misscast. She has done other parts that were all her but for me not this one. For me and some there were a few of the lines that should have been rewritten. They were hard to swallow some lack real 'Bite'.With that said I still felt this was only really deserving of a 7'considering the talent involved and then the lack of in some of the scripting. In a wrapup though still a fun and entertaining story to see. John Carpenter is very much a 'master' in the horror genre.".

It's almost as if the films were rushed and some scenes or even shots just weren't filmed. He fades between all of his scenes... Sometimes leaving us wanting more but he just fades to the end of it. Sometimes the scenes he uses could have been completly cut out and not used with the fadetechnique whatsoever.Anyway I just had to get that off my mind. Off to the plotJack Crow is a Master Slayer meaning that he kills vampire for the catholic church and has been doing that for his entire life. After he cleans out a nest of Vampires in New Mexico his team gets ambushed my a powerful vampire named Valek. Valek kills the entire team of slayers except for Jack and his friend Montoya. They also manage to bring a hooker along with them who got bitten by the vampire. Using the hookers telepathic link with her master the two try to hunt down Valek and find out what he's up to.This film is gory. Really gory. Most likely John Carpenters goriest film to date counting The Thing. Some might think that gore is an unnecessary way of filming but in this film Gore is not used to impress or Show off. It's used as a background thing. I didn't feel that it was a way of using the gore to create terror. And if you happen to like gore you'll find one redeeming factor in this film.The acting is good. James Woods is really funny as Jack Crow at times altough Daniel Baldwin isn't really great nor is Tim Guinee. But the acting holds up. There's not much else to say other than that James Woods is funny... at times. The action in this film is quite abundant yet it's not that great. It can be enjoyable but at the same time the action is very repetive. That doesn't bode very well. Another thing abut this film is that it's too damn long for an actionhorror film. Its almost 2 hours long. They should have made it 90 minutes instead as that would be more fitting of a movie of this type.Well. The film is boring sometimes yet it has some redeeming factors. All in all I give it a six. Nothing great but if you're a John Carpenter fan you'll like it. And you might want to see how his style has changed. Dramaticly.".

	schema:reviewBody "What can I say?  I went to the theatre expecting a bad vampire movie and I got it.  First of all I'm not partial to vampire hunters...the only great one has passed on Roddy McDowall...aka Peter Vincent from Fright Night and all the rest are glorified religious nutcases who think that their way is the only way.  So I knew I was going to hate most of the characters.Okay there are two I really liked.  The main Master vampire Valek of course except that his character falls short of being able to truly like him.  We didn't get the chance to get to know who or what he was and what made him the way personalitywise he was.  All you know is that he was condemned by the Church who wasn't back then? and then turned into a vampire.  Ooh...big deal.  The second person I liked was Sheryl Lee.  Her character is the only mature character in the whole thing and the only one with any sense...As for Mr. Woods' character Jack Crow...I have never seen a character I've hated so much since watching that other travesty of a vampire movie From Dusk Till Dawn and having to put up with Quentin Tarrentino until he is thankfully killed.  Jack Crow is a leatherwearing coolguy wannabe who acts tough talks tough and gets off to beating up a defenseless priest.  Then if that's not enough he proves how much a jerk he is by spending a good portion of the film asking the question over and over that proves he's way too obsessed by that lower part of his anatomy better left alone.  His character is immature and irritating and had I been any part of his team I would have staked him out over an ant bed covered in honey and left the vampires to their business!I guess I could sort of like the younger priest...at least by the end. He's one of the few that truly believes what he preaches.  He stands up for himself finally and does it without resorting to the bullying tactics shown by Jack Crow and only at the end does he try to be like the afore mentioned Crow in showing a beginning in that anatomy obsession.  Daniel Baldwin disgusted me until he was bitten and beginning to fall in love with Sheryl Lee's character.  Only then did he begin to show some compassion instead of mindless bravado and a macho attitude that wouldn't quit.  Thankfully it did quit.I think the best part of the movie was the scenic shots of New Mexico. Having lived in Santa Fe for a year and missing it immensely that was about the only hope the movie had in winning me over.  I liked the shot of the St. Francis Cathedral brief as it was and I liked the mural across from the payphone Jack Crow was using.  The other thing I recognized was the quick shot of Camel Rock.  But that was it and I have to say that I should have just walked out of the theatre after those scenes were over.  Now I think I'll just look at the old pictures from my stay in Santa Fe...rather than even bothering to rent that pathetic excuse for a movie.".

Her character is the only mature character in the whole thing and the only one with any sense...As for Mr. Woods' character Jack Crow...I have never seen a character I've hated so much since watching that other travesty of a vampire movie From Dusk Till Dawn and having to put up with Quentin Tarrentino until he is thankfully killed.  Jack Crow is a leatherwearing coolguy wannabe who acts tough talks tough and gets off to beating up a defenseless priest.  Then if that's not enough he proves how much a jerk he is by spending a good portion of the film asking the question over and over that proves he's way too obsessed by that lower part of his anatomy better left alone.  His character is immature and irritating and had I been any part of his team I would have staked him out over an ant bed covered in honey and left the vampires to their business!I guess I could sort of like the younger priest...at least by the end. He's one of the few that truly believes what he preaches.  He stands up for himself finally and does it without resorting to the bullying tactics shown by Jack Crow and only at the end does he try to be like the afore mentioned Crow in showing a beginning in that anatomy obsession.  Daniel Baldwin disgusted me until he was bitten and beginning to fall in love with Sheryl Lee's character.  Only then did he begin to show some compassion instead of mindless bravado and a macho attitude that wouldn't quit.  Thankfully it did quit.I think the best part of the movie was the scenic shots of New Mexico. Having lived in Santa Fe for a year and missing it immensely that was about the only hope the movie had in winning me over.  I liked the shot of the St. Francis Cathedral brief as it was and I liked the mural across from the payphone Jack Crow was using.  The other thing I recognized was the quick shot of Camel Rock.  But that was it and I have to say that I should have just walked out of the theatre after those scenes were over.  Now I think I'll just look at the old pictures from my stay in Santa Fe...rather than even bothering to rent that pathetic excuse for a movie.";

He and a group of hunters carefully track down and slay the beasts. After the latest slaying at a rundown house the Master that they have been tracking is not found.They head back to a motel and party the night away. Then a master unlike anything they have seen before kills almost everybody in sight. Who is that? A monster that is unstoppable like a machine with superhuman strength.The acting by James Woods is excellent. His performance here is top notch. With conviction he is a distraught and very angry man who is determined to find the master that can be the one vampire that is possibly the first.The master vampire Valek is the most sinister vampire I have ever seen in movies. The look is excellent. With the pale white face veins on his face and the power he is the ultimate monster. Valek is cunning and smart too. As he would bury himself beneath the very dirt anywhere to avoid the light. He also has telepathy to possibly control his bitten victims and see their thoughts. He also can fly faster than ever. Like the original vampire Dracula.The plot is great. I enjoyed the story and the rough and tough attitude of the good guys and the sheer villainy of Valek. Daniel Baldwin is good as Montoya Sheryl Lee is fine as Katrina and Thomas Ian Griffin is great as Valek. Great casting.The Last Word Cool. Not great Vampires is a good movie. With good acting and a solid plot you cant go wrong. Also Valek is got to be the coolest looking vampire in the movies.".

And did I mention gore?It is nice to see that he had guts to do the film this bloody and didn't want it to be some PG13 crap without any personal touch. The effects are pretty excessive the split scene at the beginning is interesting! and effects group has made fine job. Vampires would've been far more interesting piece of horror cinema if Carpenter had included his skills in the tension and atmosphere department too. If you want brainless splatter then you may like this one..Well it could've been far worse but I was expecting little more from John. He is still one of my favourite directors and his classics will never die. I hope he will be able to do something personal again.5 out of 10.".

In the endas we also know from historythe sunking succeeds to fulfill his dreams of magnificencehowever at a high costamong the ones who payed the price being eventually the court composer himselfLully got injured while stubbornly insisting to conduct a Te Deum which his monarch didn't even honor with his presencethis injury getting infected and causing Lully's deaththis is historical factLully really died this waythe whole film beinglike in Amadeusa deathbed confession recalling the most important moments in the composer's life. Even if Lully's death appears as accidentaluseless and stupidit gave his life the ultimate meaning and apotheosisby refusing to accept the amputation of the wounded bodypart he ultimately sacrificed his life to his sovereignbeing the perfect subjectfaithful to his master till the endgiving both his work and his love for the king a noble and uplifting conclusiondefyingdefeating all the rumors and irony spread by his many rivals.";

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw the movie during a French art and culture festival in Hong Kong. It was the answer to my quest for a movie that deals with the subject of King Louis XIV's passion for dance and that of Lully's influence in the king's life. I had previously seen half a dozen movies dealing with the subject of Louis XIV but NONE even touched on the fact that he loved dancing. I was thrilled by what I saw especially Le Ballet de la Nuit performance in which the 14yearold king was dressed in the fashion of Apollo and danced a majestic dance. I am surprised none of the comments mentioned anything about the choreography.I had the fortune of meeting the choreographer of the film Batrice Massin who attended the screening. She is THE authority of Baroque dance in France after having worked with Francine Lancelot who was the pioneer in the restoration of Baroque dance into its original form. Massin works with original dance notation materials from Louis XIV's time especially the Feuillet notations which provided very detailed and exact instructions on the dance steps used at Louis XIV's court. This dance form is very important because it is the origin of today's ballet which has gone through a lot of transformations especially from that of a maleonly art form to one where the female dancer dominates the stage.During production Massin worked with the lead roles in the movie every day for three months and she has high regard for Benot Magimel. Though not a professional dancer he attempted all the dance sequences with courage never uttering the words I can't. Of course the repertoire of Baroque dance was wideranging and Massin could not possibly have included all the varieties of that era. She mainly worked in such a way to show what the director wanted. In the context of this movie the director had wanted to show the masculine power that the king wanted to demonstrate as a way to consolidate his power on the throne. So what we see in the movie comes across as very forceful masculine movements.One thing that the film has left out  what Massin feels as a mistake  is the character of Pierre Beauchamps. Beauchamps was the key dance master at Louis XIV's court and was responsible for dance education and choreographer although he was also a musician  not as accomplished as Lully at that while Lully's dancing skills would pale alongside Beauchamps'. In fact Lully Beauchamps and Molire were working very closely together. For me it is a big big regret that this movie whose theme is Louis XIV's passion and talent for dance has treated Beauchamps in such a dismissive manner the only scene where he appeared was when the king asked him to leave the room and rearrange the choreography to give it more air!.Another thing that I miss seeing is the establishment of l'Acadmie Royale de la Dance. Surely the film shows that the king announced it in a royal decree as soon as he took over all the power upon Mazarin's death. But it would have been nice to see a snippet of the academy's activities such as how the first group of professional ballet dancers were trained.Unlike what some of the commentators here have said though I think that the film does have a deep aspect. The idea that Louis XIV cared so much about the art of dance and music and Lully's concept of music being something to make the king immortal  points to the transcending nature of these arts. Although dance and music was used as much as a political tool for power as a form of entertainment at the court I personally feel that the passion for dance and music  as a pure form of truth and beauty  is powerfully expressed through the dramatic performances of the actors and actresses in this film.Anybody who loves the subject of Louis XIV Baroque music dance and ballet should go and see this film.".

At last it was on in Norwich on Tuesday 17th September and I was very impressed with the storyline acting and of course the music. It begins with Lully preparing to conduct his sumptuous music whilst waiting for the King. Being very impatient he begins without him and subsequently stabs himself in the foot which ultimately leads to his death. The film then drifts back to his introduction to the court of Louis 14th  The Sun King with all its' splendour. If you love the music of Lully you will not be disappointed. I am hoping that this film can be purchased either on VHS or DVD  I would certainly buy it.".

	schema:headline " Le Roi Danse  A Review";
	schema:reviewBody "Belgian director Gerard Corbieu's Le Roi Danse is really about two things the life of JeanBaptiste Lully composer to Louis XIV and the creative chaos inherent in musical genius. Lully was probably the most controversial composer ever to serve Louis XIV. He was a Florentine attempting to fit into a French World that did not want him but which in the end had to acknowledge his musical genius. He was a libertine who shamelessly carried on extramarital affairs with men and women at a time when a man of his station the kings and nobles were not held to such lofty moral standards was required to be prudish and monogamous. He was mercurial unpredictable unscrupulous cold and vain at a time when advancement depended on him being subservient and capable of flattery. But Lully's wild and unorthodox ways came from the same well spring as his musical genius which was why he retained the king's favor for such a long time. This is the Lully that is portrayed so well by Boris Terral in Le Roi Danse. Experiencing this movie is likely experiencing wild bursts of energy on screen. The music is often the source of that energy but Boris Terral and Benoit Magimel whose Louis XIV is the best I have seen contributes to it as well. Sometimes this film was criticized for its graphic portrayal of Anne of Austria's breast cancer surgery without anesthetic a scene which by the way was faithful to what actually happened or its tendency to clutter one event after the other in furious succession until Lully's career approaches a crescendo unheard of in the French music world. But it is important to remember that this what the 17th century world was like. Moreover we are seeing that world largely from Lully's eyes as he recalls his life shortly before an agonizing death from gangrene. For Lully the 17th century world of a music was filled with ups and downs humiliations and triumphs and the agony of it all was that each success when Lully was successful was only fleeting because Lully was only someone as long as he retained the king's favor. There is an extraordinary scene where Lully explains to his wife Madeleine that without the king he is nothing. In other words forget about all the brilliant compositions in the past or all the great work he was doing now. If Lully could not compose works that were better than his last to hold on to the king's favor his career was over and he was nothing.I could go on except I would be missing something the artistry involved in making this film. Visually this film is great to look at. Moreover it is easy to mess up a film with such a complex script as this one. But the acting in it is superb especially from Magimel Louis XIV Terral Lully and Tcheky Karyo Moliere. Finally Corbieu paces everything at an appropriately frenetic pace that we experience and understand the 17th century and all its uncertainties for a composer. In short Le Roi Danse is a truly brilliant film.".

Lully was probably the most controversial composer ever to serve Louis XIV. He was a Florentine attempting to fit into a French World that did not want him but which in the end had to acknowledge his musical genius. He was a libertine who shamelessly carried on extramarital affairs with men and women at a time when a man of his station the kings and nobles were not held to such lofty moral standards was required to be prudish and monogamous. He was mercurial unpredictable unscrupulous cold and vain at a time when advancement depended on him being subservient and capable of flattery. But Lully's wild and unorthodox ways came from the same well spring as his musical genius which was why he retained the king's favor for such a long time. This is the Lully that is portrayed so well by Boris Terral in Le Roi Danse. Experiencing this movie is likely experiencing wild bursts of energy on screen. The music is often the source of that energy but Boris Terral and Benoit Magimel whose Louis XIV is the best I have seen contributes to it as well. Sometimes this film was criticized for its graphic portrayal of Anne of Austria's breast cancer surgery without anesthetic a scene which by the way was faithful to what actually happened or its tendency to clutter one event after the other in furious succession until Lully's career approaches a crescendo unheard of in the French music world. But it is important to remember that this what the 17th century world was like. Moreover we are seeing that world largely from Lully's eyes as he recalls his life shortly before an agonizing death from gangrene. For Lully the 17th century world of a music was filled with ups and downs humiliations and triumphs and the agony of it all was that each success when Lully was successful was only fleeting because Lully was only someone as long as he retained the king's favor. There is an extraordinary scene where Lully explains to his wife Madeleine that without the king he is nothing. In other words forget about all the brilliant compositions in the past or all the great work he was doing now. If Lully could not compose works that were better than his last to hold on to the king's favor his career was over and he was nothing.I could go on except I would be missing something the artistry involved in making this film. Visually this film is great to look at. Moreover it is easy to mess up a film with such a complex script as this one. But the acting in it is superb especially from Magimel Louis XIV Terral Lully and Tcheky Karyo Moliere. Finally Corbieu paces everything at an appropriately frenetic pace that we experience and understand the 17th century and all its uncertainties for a composer. In short Le Roi Danse is a truly brilliant film.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie gives us another glimpse of the feudal life of the french King Louis XIV. Le Roi Danse shows us his obsession with dancing and how important music and dance was to him. But the main story is about JeanBaptiste Lully which is the main composer and the dance instructor for Louis. Lully falls in love with his king but this love is never returned by the emperor. Benoit Magimel makes a very strong performance as King Louis  there are incredible moments when he dances or just stare at Lully. Tcheky Karyo plays Molire  the poet and a friend of Lully. The relationship between Molire and Lully reminds me on the situation we had with Mozart and Salieri in Amadeus... Strong rivalry between the characters. Karyo is very convincing in his portrayal of the poet. The interieurs the costumes and even the music are overwhelming. The movie is a pure feast for the eyes and ears. The only minus point  as far as I can see it  is that the director expects a certain knowledge about the french history from the viewer. Some characters and situations aren't explained 'cause Corbiau seems to think everybody knows about Cardinal Mazarin and so on. Sometimes the storytelling jumps and makes a following a little bit complicating. But in general it's a movie well worth seeing!".

This is truly cinema by hairdressers for hairdressers. And it has nothing whatsoever to do with history. At no point in the whole film is the spectator given to even timidly wonder what makes a prince a king a dramatist a great playwright and a musician a genius. The events depicted in Le Roi danse have been elaborated brilliantly in at least half a dozen films and TV series by directors as diverse as Rossellini and Ariane Mnouchkine during the past 50 years. This is not one of these films. Watch this film by all meansif you really really enjoyed the extreme closeup of Haendel squashing a bug with the tip of his walkingstick in Farinelli.

This perhaps is a good thing as I can appreciate the film as a film and it is an incredibly beautiful one. However beneath the beautiful veneer is a bittersweet story of one court musician's Lully creative passion and unrequited love for the king Louis he served.As with many historical pictures the powers and machinations of the French court are apparent in Lully's struggle to gain French citizenship and acceptance as a former Italian based on his musical gifts and patronage of the king also in Louis's desire to utilise the arts for political power. Lully rises to power and as he does so his fervent devotion to the king becomes an obsession that will dominates Lully's life. As Lully tells the hapless Moliere I choose between him and you my friend. He is fickle. He loves only his glory but I love him. He's the best of me. The young king is shown as lonely and unhappy estranged within the court from his mother he indulges his passion for music and dance through Lully who makes of the king a dancer. This early bond through music is manipulated by Louis later for political ends with Louis becoming increasingly narcissistic and cruelly remote towards Lully. Louis's narcissism is well evoked for example in one scene where rehearsing a dance in which Louis is the sun Louis tells Lully to adjust the movement of the planets. The planets do not brush against the sun. They allow it to shine. The evolution of the relationship between Lully and Louis hurts both men who in turn hurt those around them. Neither are sympathetically portrayed and yet moments of vulnerability make it hard to dislike them or condemn them outright. Louis as much from political necessity as cruelty tells Lully he is not his friend as the king has no friends. This line is repeated at later intervals by Lully as he cuts ties with people in a ruthless and desperate struggle to stay important to the king.Lully loves the king. What the king feels for Lully is less clear although there are blurred lines suggesting more feeling from Louis to Lully than was expressed. The final scene of the film shows a melancholic Louis without music in his life now that Lully has died. Music functions as a thematic metaphor throughout the film for life love and bounty yet it is destructive too as first Louis and then Lully injure themselves in its service. Lully's injury proves fatal to him. The film is infused with Lully's music adding an aural splendour to the visuals on display and doing justice to his music. The dance scenes and those between Lully and Louis are executed exceptionally well. Reputed to have been one of the most expensive French productions it is easy to believe as the film is so detailed and rich.".

I expected to see more petticoat breeches over skirts and short coats on the men with the scenes in the 1660s but instead they have costumes from the 1690s long coats waistcoats!  Would someone make a movie about the 1970s and have everyone outfitted from clothes from the 1990s?";

Rape was an acceptable means of forcing a marriage. No other man would want the woman as she was no longer a virgin.But as depressing as the subject matter may be director Damiano Damiani and cinematographer Franco Di Giacomo created an incredibly lovely film with The Most Beautiful Wife. The contrast between the green lush farm lands and the crumbling city scenes is pleasing. And Ennio Morricone's score is what I've come to expect  a work of genius. It suits the film perfectly.Ornella Muti gives a terrific performance in the title role. And when you consider that this was her first film and that she was only 14 years old it makes all the more amazing. As the whole film is centered around her and as she is the focal point of almost every scene it's imperative that her performance be believable if The Most Beautiful Wife has a chance at all to work. She pulls it off flawlessly. I doubt an actress twice her age with years of experience could have done any better. It's an impressive piece of work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Damiano Damini the director of La Moglie Piu Bella two years earlierin 1968 had made a movie about la Mafia titled Il Giorno Della Civetta starring Franco Nero Claudia Cardinale and Lee J. Cobb. It was a stark tale showing the helplessness of the law enforcers in front of the resignedly accepted power of the Mafia. In 1970 he had another project about the Organization the story loosely based in real facts of the first Italian woman that refused the reparation by marriage of her lost honor. Instead she had the courage to denounce the violence that she suffered at the local police station. It was very important to choose someone special for acting the leading role. Damiano Damiani chose the teenager Ornella Muti 14 years old without previous experiences in front of the camera to play the humbled girl Francesca Cimarosa who at first is very shy and submissive but gradually becomes a strong character person fighting for her dignity even against her own parents that are frightened because of intimidation of the Mafia. It was said by Ornella Muti in several interviews that she was making company to her older sister Claudia Rivelli who was herself in search of a role in pictures when suddenly by pure chance was saw by Damiani and that was all. Overnight the teenager that was dreaming about being an actress was in front of the camera in an exigent leading role making her cinematic debut under the implacable and experienced hand of Damiani. In my opinion it was a superb choice. Ornella was beautiful shy reserved intense brave and she was capable of projecting these qualities to the screen reaching this way the heart and the interest of the audience. An authentic natural talent not always appreciated during the long career of the diva always eclipsed by the sheer beauty and sexiness of her physique. Alesio Orano future first husband of Ornella Muti in real life plays the part of the nephew of the local capo. At that time he was a heartthrob handsome long dark hair and blue eyes. He is the dream love of the young heroine but also he possesses a streak of cruelty and he is absolutely perfect in his role. Gaetano Cimarrosa is excellent acting as the intimidated father and Pierluigi Apr is very efficient as the local carabinieri a helpless but honest police officer. It was said that this film is about feminism but I consider it a story that has to do with the basic human dignity and choosing to live without fear in a society whose ethical values are profoundly twisted by the existence of the shady and stealth hand of the organized crime.".

On the other hand her courage in choosing film roles has also allowed her to endure a lot longer than a lot of American actresses who never want to risk doing anything that might be exploitative and as a result never do anything really interesting either. The director Damiano Damiani is the same wayhe's done art films like this on one hand but some the most exploitative trash imaginable like Amityville Horror 2 on the other but his films are rarely less than interesting.This movie based on true story is about a young Sicilian girl Muti who is raped by the son of a Mafia don who is trying to force her to marry him by taking her virginity but she instead goes to the police which is something women just didn't do at the time and something only a few brave souls in Sicily ever did to the Mafia. Muti is really good which isn't that surprising perhaps but so is her future husband Alessio Oranio who plays the mafioso and who I had always pegged as a talentless prettyboy. It may seem hard to believe the androgenously handsome Oranio would have to rape anyone although it seemed to be his specialty for some reasonhe also raped Jane Birkin in May Morning a drugged Elke Summer in Lisa and the Devil and Femi Benussi kind of in The Killer Must Kill Again.. It's made clear in this movie however that the abduction and rape is a matter of pride not sex after this beautiful but poor peasant girl spurns the wealthy and vain young man's proposal of marriage.I don't want to give away too much more of the plot but it is a welldirected and wellacted and ultimately very powerful film. It's not one of Muti's more exploitative roles she was only fourteen at the time but she had plenty of those too. Check this one out for sure.".

The character played by the beautiful and very young Ornella Muti is a real marvel. In her village she is one of its kind she is intelligent sensible has a strong temper sense of justice and anticonformist views. In other words she cannot easily merge in the social context she is growing in. The plot develops slowly and little by little one is sucked into the story thanks to a group of very good actors a nice score by Morricone and mainly Damiani's masterful screenplay. The end is very touching as the tears in the sensitive young girl represent the tragic but necessary result of a chain of events that it was impossible to stop. This movie together with L'istruttoria e' chiusa dimentichi Pizza Connection Confessions of a Police Captain and Un uomo in ginocchio should constantly pass through the Italian national TV schedules as the lessons is still far from being learnt.".

Like other Italian films of this period Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion the police and clergy are portrayed as extremely corrupt.The score by Ennio Morricone which attracted me to this wonderful film is spectacular  it sort of adds to the gradual build up of conflict between the sexes. Ornella Muti is bewitching as the young peasant girl who fights back. She almost looks like a young innocent witch as she slowly takes down the man who has wronged her. What an actress!  she was only 14 when she made this. She is a perfect foil for the arrogant and cruel young mafioso Alessio Orano.The film did have a rather unimaginative title sequence.

No fast guns solve problems here. I've really come to appreciate films like The Case is Closed Forget About It and Day of the Owl. Don't get me wrong  I love a car chase and a gun battle but Damiani's films have there place up there too.Fifteen or fourteen yearold Ornella Mutti here plays Francesco a peasant girl who draws the eye of local mob hood Vito. Vito looks up the local Mafia don who has just been arrested along with most of his cronies. The don wants to work with Vito as Vito was kidnapped and beaten by a rival mob but never opened his mouth. The don advises Vito to get married and Vito has chosen Francesco.After seeing off another suitor with intimidation Vito woos Francesco and a wedding seems to be on the horizon. It's also about this time that Vito starts acting like a total dick and finds himself surprised that Francesco isn't the kind of girl who is going to take any of his crap. She shames him in front of his mates jilts him at the altar and even worse the rival gang ridicule Vito using the information that a peasant girl stood him up at the altar. Vito of course then resorts to kidnapping and raping Francesco as a show of power and is once again surprised to find she goes straight to the police and accuses him of rape.This is Sicily however and people there fear reprisal from the Mafia. The townsfolk turn on Francesco and even her family do not want to speak to the police. Francesco finds herself alone in trying to bring Vito to justice...alone apart from that rival Mafia gang...It's possible that Damiani is making some sort of statement about the sexual revolution with this one. We know Francesco is in the right and yet the women of the village attack a teenage girl who agrees with her. Francesco speaks with a woman who was in a similar situation but married her rapist because that's what was expected of her. A local priest blames her parents for being uneducated and not hiding the act of sex from her. Even her parents do not want to go against the established rules and class system. Only the young seem to empathise as Francesco rebels against the town and still I'm simplifying the outcome of this on the characters of the film.This was Ornella Mutti's first film and it's amazing to see how she plays Francesco  a nave teenage girl who believes in love but will not let that stand in the way of justice or her being an individual. Her dogged attempts to bring Francesco to court are mixed with the emotions of a teenage crush as she constantly gives Vito a chance to repent which also give way to pure rage as he constantly treats her like a child.Also outstanding are two actors I thought were just bit part players  Gaetano Cimarosa as Francesco's cowardly father and Enzo Andronico from many a giallo as the slimy lawyer trying to keep Vito in check. Don't miss this one  Ennio Morricone manages to create another emotional soundtrack that adds to the atmosphere.".

The tension builds slowly as does the mystery until you're shown the knife rack in the kitchen with the one missing knife. About that time you're beginning to wish you'd opted for the Disney film. The film's last 10 minutes of frenzy are etched forever in my mind and come to the forefront whenever I try to recall truly terrifying moments in cinema.

Truly one of the most original twist since the sixth sense. Top Nauch acting from Liz who gives again another tour de force not seen since Who's afraid of Virigina Wolf?. PLOT Liz plays Ellen Wheeler the wife of a rich investment broker in London england who is not happy with her life then one stormy night when she cant sleep she claims she see's a murder in the house across the garden from hers. she becomes hysterical and her husband Lawrence Harvey calls the police and they investigate but find nothing. Then more strange things happen and Liz becomes more and more over the edge and hysterical until her husband and best friend Billie Whitelaw decide to put her away. but are hubby Lawrence and friend Billie having an affair and trying to scare liz to death or did a murder really happen? I've seen a lot of murder mysterythrillers as does my mom shes a huge Agatha Christie fan and always guesses the murdererending but neither her nor I guessed this one. one of the most original endings ever made. I wish movies today could still make such a suspenseful impact the way thrillers did back in the day. terrific scenes of the storm great atmosphere never gets dull or lets up. a must for anyone who loves great mystery thrillers. I hope it comes on DVD one day with an audio commentary by Liz. defiantly one of Liz's better films in the latter part of her career.".

After about twenty minutes you think you know exactly where the plot will end. It really seems that this is the director's and writer's fault because they give away too many clues so I almost instantly lost interest. But after the many dull scenes following the brilliant visualization of Lizzies nightmare comes the unexpected ending. And this makes the whole movie worth watching but as I've already mentioned it is mostly the nightmarescene which deserves the credit.".

Not as bad as I thought it would be.The whole point of this film as I saw it was that nothing is what it seems.  Ellen Wheeler Elizabeth Taylorwho else seems to be a raving lunatic but is she really?  She spends much of the film in an hysterical state begging people to believe that she saw a corpse in the house next to hers.  I swear I thought I saw something over there the first time I saw this movie but the second time I realized I was nuts also.  I love how she gets frustrated saying she saw him plainly when the detective asks her to describe him all she can manage is a vague description of a blonde man. Basically Why won't you believe me???  I know what I saw!  What did he look like?  Oh I've no idea.  I didn't look hard enough.  Hubby Laurence Harvey doesn't want to call the cops.  Not because there's nothing there but in the interest of being politehe doesn't want to bother them.  Oh it's dark and raining.  Forget the murder until a nicer day.  That's an odd way of doing things...Then there's Ellen's friend Sarah who has been indulging in a little sin with a fella named Barry.  Ellen seems perturbed by this but always asks where Barry is what Barry does what Barry eats.  She has her own secret reasons for this questioning and it all comes out in the end.  Ah the end. The end that my sister figured out before the beginning credits stopped and the one that I didn't figure out until the ending credits stopped. That's weirdI've seen tons more movies you'd think I'd know all the plots by now.Gripesidiotic music especially the end song.  Very romantic but I didn't know this was a romance.  The lighting was awfulduring the creepy ending I couldn't see what was going on.  There wasn't any suspense.  I couldn't see who was doing what!  I did see the vast quantity of blood though so if you're squeamish close your eyes.All in all very enjoyable.  It's always fun to watch Elizabeth Taylor freak.".

Sorry to the other reviewers on here but how can you see the ending a mile away?I mean we KNOW it is not the gardener because it is to obvious then at that point it is hard to know if it her husband or the girlfriend because no other characters were presented to suspect.The ending is even more sinister because we never really know if her husband has been having an affair with sarah or not.My only complaint is that during the ending sequence when the husband is fighting the killer I could't see anything.However the violence at the end is unexpectedly brutal even compared to some of the most violent horror films of today so cover your eyes if you are of the faint of heart.If you love psychological thrillers such as I do including that of director's such as De palma I highly recommend this film as a necessity to your collection.".

Director Brian G. Hutton is betterknown for directing action pictures like WHERE EAGLES DARE 1968 and KELLY'S HEROES 1970 and he might not seem ideally suited to an old dark housetype of chiller the probable sequence of events is that Richard Burton star of EAGLES had recommended him to his wife Elizabeth Taylor for X Y AND ZEE 1971 and she later asked for his services again on NIGHT WATCH. Sadly he only made two more films after this  THE FIRST DEADLY SIN 1980 and HIGH ROAD TO CHINA 1982  before retiring to become a plumber!Although the let'sdriveanheiressmad plot line had recently been done to death in Britain by Hammer Films following the success of their TASTE OF FEAR 1961 here we have a similar tale that harks back to an even closer degree to GASLIGHT 1940 and 1944 but thankfully cleverly adds an effective twist at the finale. Even so it speaks of the dispiriting lack of direction in British cinema at the time that with the openingup of censorship filmmakers responded by merely updating creaky old properties that were outdated even 30 years earlier with the newlysanctioned gore and nudity than letting their creative juices flow more freely! Actually NIGHT WATCH obviously unrelated to any of the films with which it happens to share its profuselyused title is based on a Lucille Fletcher play from 1972 but as already intimated earlier the standard genre thread to which it adhered had long since been established incidentally Fletcher is bestknown for penning SORRY WRONG NUMBER 1948 yet another stage property on similar lines and for having been married to legendary film composer Bernard Herrmann between 193948!Taylor is a mentally disturbed woman haunted by images of the carcrash death of her former philandering husband and his mistress  played via intermittent silent appearances by Linda Hayden married to stockbroker Laurence Harvey who is himself twotiming Taylor with her own best friend Billie Whitelaw. Insomniac Taylor starts seeing mutilated bodies propped up in a chair by the window of the neighboring dilapidated house and she keeps pestering the local Police about her 'visions' which needless to say produce no result when actually investigated  and initially a lonesome widowed gardener who used to inhabit Taylor's mansion gets to become the prime suspect of the potential foul play! The affair between Harvey and Whitelaw quite subtly depicted in spite of a fleetingly bareassed Harvey! makes them the obvious redherrings with the man's unexplained comingsandgoings and the woman constantly mixing oddlooking drinks to calm the wife's shattered nerves. Indeed the ingenious twist takes one by surprise when it comes and I for one did not recall that this was how things would play out from my sole viewing all those years ago. It should be said here that Harvey had previously costarred with Taylor in her Oscarwinning BUTTERFIELD 8 1960 besides all three leads would follow this atypical appearance in a horror film with even stranger ones Taylor in THE DRIVER'S SEAT 1974 Harvey in WELCOME TO ARROW BEACH 1974 like the film under review also A Brut Production and Whitelaw in THE OMEN 1976 her most famous role as the diabolical nanny.Although the film uses the admirable pictorial talents of cinematographer Billy Williams of WOMEN IN LOVE fame the shoddy VHS quality of the copy I acquired nullifies much of the effect  particularly in the garbled first few minutes and the frustratingly murky climax where one is often uncertain of just what is going on! Even so when these obscure but nevertheless worthwhile pictures are neglected by both DVDproducing companies and TVchannel programmers one is grateful for getting the film any which way he can! Incidentally NIGHT WATCH is also available to view in its entirety on You Tube in both English and Italian languages!".

Fortunately the art direction focused on the creepy old house next door is indeed eerily atmospheric  and this is abetted by superb photography and a really creepy music score which gives the film just the right unsettling atmosphere.

Harvey is her second husband the first died in anautomobile crash with his young mistress.Soon after moving where they are Taylor spots strange goings on like deadbodies at the place next door. But every time the police in the person of Inspector Bill Dean is called there's no evidence of anything. A lot like DorisDay in Midnight Lace. Both her husband and best friend Billie Whitelaw try to support Taylor butit's no avail she just gets worse and more hysterical and the police are justgetting more and more fed up.The film has certain parallels to Midnight Lace and also to Gaslight. But don'tthink you've guessed an ending even with those clues.As so many aging Hollywood actresses of the 60s and 70s went into these kinds of films some did more than others. Apparently Taylor was only satisfied to dip an ankle into this pool.Apparently Harvey was desperately ill with the cancer that killed him and hedoes look gaunt. There is a revealing rear shot in a shower and I'm bettingthat is not Harvey's bare backside. He does look gaunt. He had an operationthat took a lot of intestine out of him and production was stopped mid wayaccording to the Citadel Film series book on the Films of Elizabeth Taylor.The next door neighbor Robert Lang has a role in all of this. If you think youknow what will happen in Night Watch believe me you don't.".

The fact that she's actually in control of John's Harvey and his lover Sarah's Billie Whitelaw relationship makes her transformation from victim to predator chilling as well as surprising.Almost all of the movie takes place in John and Ellen's house with Sarah as a guest. If it weren't for the occasional goingson at the neighboring dilapidated house and plenty of flashbacks of Ellen's exhusband's fatal car wreck there wouldn't be much else to comment on other than the wallpaper. It's a brilliant scheme to convince everyone including the police that you're an hysterical nut who sees dead bodies next door. Then when you want to kill someone over there you're off the hook as no one will listen to your 'confession'. The problem for the viewer of Night Watch is that nothing much else happens anyway. It's an ending looking for a story.Setting this in the old house would've been much more interesting. Instead of making it a backdrop for the supposed plot to drive Ellen nuts maybe there's something in Ellen's past that connects her to it. Then she starts to unravel as she spends time there...the same ending would still work. And the old house has unlimited opportunities for horror scenes. Make Appleby a creepy caretaker to add interest.The Wheeler house is just too nice for weird stuff to happen. Appleby isn't really used effectively. Neither is Tony as a psychiatrist he could bring out some of Ellen's demons but he merely sets up a 'vacation' for her which doesn't occur. There's the makings of a good psychological horror movie here but Night Watch doesn't draw it together well enough to keep the viewer entertained.".

Is the male dominated film industry secretly afraid that when women hit menopause they will become unstable and violent? But I digress. In this case Taylor plays a woman Ellen who had a nervous breakdown when her first husband was killed in a car accident with his lover and she had to identify the body. But now she's married again Laurence Harvey. She claims to have seen a murder occur in the house next door but a search by the police finds nothing. There is a freshly dug flower bed near the old house and the police dig that up and find nothing but daisies. So the police are growing tired of Ellen calling them about every little thing that happens. And then on the night that Ellen is to leave town the story takes a startling turn. If you are used to American films where endings are wrapped up neatly and everything is explained prepare to be disappointed. You never quite know if justice was served or not. The film could have been shorter and Liz is still hot here at age 41 but she still camps it up just a bit too much for my taste. Laurence Harvey is much better here than he was when he was opposite Liz in Butterfield Eight in which the whole cast camped it up  the dialog didn't help  but poor Mr. Harvey would not get more chances to use his improved craft. He died the same year this was released at only age 45 from stomach cancer.I'd give this one a 7 if it had been shortened a bit and Taylor's performance had been a bit less over the top.".

Laurence Harvey is much better here than he was when he was opposite Liz in Butterfield Eight in which the whole cast camped it up  the dialog didn't help  but poor Mr. Harvey would not get more chances to use his improved craft. He died the same year this was released at only age 45 from stomach cancer.I'd give this one a 7 if it had been shortened a bit and Taylor's performance had been a bit less over the top.";

Poor Laurence Harvey close to death and generously reunited with his good friend and Butterfield 8 costar Taylor tries hard as the deceitful husband. The ending will satisfy the long tedious buildup.

	schema:reviewBody "Alain RobbeGrillet's 1995 film The Blue Villa exhibits the director's penchant for complex fractured narratives and metanarratives. The film begins with a voiceover describing the lifestyle of the inhabitants on a small remote island. This voiceover turns out to be the preliminary voice recordings of Nord an island native who is writing a screenplay about recent events in his life. From this point on it is often difficult to tell whether any given scene is meant to be part of his screenplay or something that actually is happening or has happened.The plot of the film concerns the death of Nord's daughter which took place around one year before the events of the film. While the police suspect that Nord himself played a hand in it he insists that her fianc Frank is responsible. Still others claim that she has faked her own death and she is in fact hiding at the Blue Villa the high class brothel where she once worked. There is also some speculation that Frank may be dead. There may or may not be a scheme by brothel employees and other officials to gain possession of Nord's considerable fortune. All this is further complicated by the fact that Nord is most certainly incapable of distinguishing fantasy from reality. In one memorable scene shown from his delusional perspective a ship and a bustling bazaar appear and disappear in a deserted alleyway. A second narrator who appears in some scenes adds even more uncertainty to the proceedings.Like ARG's previous films The Blue Villa poses more questions that it answers. It certainly lends itself to many interpretations those content to solve the film on a surface level may see it as a thriller with some nice twists. Others may focus their interpretation on the game mahjong that is played in many scenes. I prefer to see it as a meditation on the similarity between the fiction artist's creation of a false reality and the madman's complete immersion in one but I don't think this interpretation is more correct than any other. . For those with the patience for such cinematic enigma this should be a rewarding film. This is highly recommended for fans of ARG Raoul Ruiz and similar filmmakers.".

The finale is hilarious and even more risqu than was usual for the sex farces of the sixties. Probably my favourite DD movie!

He looks spectacular in a red bouffant wig and aqua satin gown and looks even more glamorous than Doris.

It's her last movie role unfortunately as she died too young.A young Dom DeLuise has a couple of funny scenes that he does mostly in pantomime. Dick Martin shows up with good reaction takes and the great character actor Edward Andrews is in fine blustering form.The stars Doris and Rod Taylor are quite appealing although looking a bit too mature for their fluffy romance.".

The glass bottom boat of the title is run by her father and provides a seperate focus for the story.

	schema:headline " Supporting cast highlight Tashlin spy spoof";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Frank Tashlin tries to do for Doris Day what he did for Lucille Ball Miss Grant Takes Richmond Bob Hope Son of Paleface and Jerry Lewis Who's Minding the Store many others casting her in a comedy full of cartoonish color gadgets and slapstick.  Not surprisingly Tashlin started as a director of Warner Brothers cartoons moved into live action as a gag writer and became one of the most stylish directors of comedies.  In many of his films Tashlin's world is full of outofcontrol vacuum cleaners remote control appliances and a struggle to cope with the fast pace of modern civilization.  In The Glass Bottom Boat the title is misleading the Catalina Island attraction is around just for the opening number Tashlin pokes fun at the spy genre most notably The Man From U.N.C.L.E. which was a popular TV show at the time.  Rod Taylor is Day's romantic interest and the intellectual and corporate head of an aerospace corporation.  He lives in a dream house with resortstyle guest rooms a futuristic kitchen and a foyer that seems to go on forever.  Doris Day plays an employee at his company who is mistaken for a spy by everyone but Taylor.  Actually she is a widow who lives with her dog he has a Russian name which adds to the confusion of her being a spy some fish and mockingbirds.  The mockingbirds are tied into the title song which is sung to the tune of Mockingbird.  At least one professional critic missed the purpose of the Mockingbird song that's why I'm bringing it up.  Taylor and Day have pretty good chemistry but the story is more about the chase so we don't see much romance.  Instead Tashlin prefers to tie the story together with slapstick scenes such as HiFi installer Dom DeLuise and Day getting their feet stuck in a trash can Day being chased by a robotic floor sweeper and Day in a runaway remote control speed boat.  These are signature pieces for Tashlin and he does a good job with them but Doris Day seems a bit out of place.  Slapstick requires the actor to fill in the time with quick broad expressions and physicality.  We think of a physical actress like Lucille Ball trapped in a glass shower filled with water and drawing laughs from her expressions and cries.  In a similar scene with an automatic floor sweeper Doris Day just seems to be there letting the antics on stage play itself out.  In another scene she's virtually hanging on in an outofcontrol speed boat.  We can imagine Jerry Lewis changing expressions every half second and flipping on his back every two.  Tashlin's skill makes the scenes funny but they are not as hilarious as when cast with a physical clown.  Day does a lot better in the quieter romantic comedy scenes and is given incredible support by a neverending list of character actors who steal each and every one of their scenes.  Among the best are Paul Lynde as a security chief who dons poor disguises and Dick Martin as Rod Taylor's goodtime partner.  Paul Lynde is joined by fellow Bewitched alumni George Tobias and Alice Pearce virtually replaying the neighbors of that TV show Mr. and Mrs. Kravitz this time as Doris Day's neighbors and watch for Robert Vaughn in a quick cameo as The Man From U.N.C.L.E. himself.  Add to this a rare supporting role by Arthur Godrey with his trademark ukulele as Doris Day's dad they sing a duet 60's comedy stuffy character actors Edward Andrews and John McGiver and a preWalton's Ellen Corby as Rod Taylor's maid.  Most films from this era can look really outdated but the sets here still look retrocool.  For breezy 60's fun the film is worth a look and despite a slow start seems to get better and better all the way to the end as the supporting characters come together and start interacting with each other not just with Day.  If only the entire film had the energy of the finale there might have been some much needed belly laughs generated.".

The story built around the attraction between two opposite individuals never reach the sublime heights of Bringing up Baby' needles to say Taylor and Day aren't Grant and Hepburn and it seems that this film greatest problem is not to dare going too far in its craze as other Tashlin's films like Rock Hunter' or Artists and Models' did. Probably the cause is the plot dealing with the cold war a subject pretty much on the focus at the time. Now and them you feel that the director is doing a sort of journalism through a territory that doesn't suit him as good as Hollywood and its superficiality for example. But Tashlin always manages to insert his comments about the decadence of American life a circumstance that not even the fanciest of technology can hide. In his anarchic fashion Tashlin's films counterpart Douglas Sirk's melodramas. Both are about the same but the path chosen to express its vision are opposite.This film has a wonderful use of color an admirable pacing and a freshness rarely seen in the studio comedies of the time the singing scene in the boat looks totally improvised. But if Tashlin's background as a cartoonist often contributes to his creative ability to take situations beyond the edge and to destroy a stiff established order very seldom this very quality can work against him. And this is what happens with all the bad guys in this film. They are a mere caricature and one can never feel them as a serious threat. The theme demanded something more serious and these clumsy amateurs certainly fail.Anyway watch the film and sing the title's tune it'll remain with you for ages.".

But Tashlin always manages to insert his comments about the decadence of American life a circumstance that not even the fanciest of technology can hide. In his anarchic fashion Tashlin's films counterpart Douglas Sirk's melodramas. Both are about the same but the path chosen to express its vision are opposite.This film has a wonderful use of color an admirable pacing and a freshness rarely seen in the studio comedies of the time the singing scene in the boat looks totally improvised. But if Tashlin's background as a cartoonist often contributes to his creative ability to take situations beyond the edge and to destroy a stiff established order very seldom this very quality can work against him. And this is what happens with all the bad guys in this film. They are a mere caricature and one can never feel them as a serious threat. The theme demanded something more serious and these clumsy amateurs certainly fail.Anyway watch the film and sing the title's tune it'll remain with you for ages.";

	schema:reviewBody "What fun in the sun at the space research plant at the party and under the stars! Each setting has its own cluster of comedic slips falls gaglines or situations and this large cast of laughgetters churns out the funny by the barrel. For a comedy the plot is anything but predictable and a major subplot about spying is the source of most of the hilarious antics tripups and sight gags involving various members of the cast. The scenic shots around Catalina Island are a plus and the gadgets and gizmos invented by Rod Taylor's character add to the laughs. Doris Day is at her funny best in Glass Bottom Boat. Her foibles and antics bring hearty laughs at times grins and chuckles at others. Rod Taylor is the epitome of a male lead  looks intelligence wit charm kindness and easygoing calm. And what a great supporting cast with several top comedians including Paul Lynde Dom DeLuise Dick Martin and Edward Andrews. For those of us who grew up with or watched the early years of TV this movie holds something special in the appearances of Arthur Godfrey and Dick Martin. I remember catching the Arthur Godfrey show I think it was on Saturday mornings then when my folks watched it from 1949 to 1959  we got our first TV in 1949. I think some of his later shows were broadcast from Hawaii. Godfrey had a friendly personality and was one of the first TV hosts who had a general talk and variety show. His ukulele was always at hand. Dick Martin and partner Dan Rowan had an early comedy variety show on TV. Rowan and Martin's LaughIn ran from 1968 to 1973. The show discovered or helped launch some of the best comedians of the last half of the 20th century  well before Saturday Night Live came on the scene. Henry Gibson Ruth Buzzi Flip Wilson Goldie Hawn Arte Johnson Jo Anne Worley and Lily Tomlin were among the early stars to rise from LaughIn. As a full comedy and light romance Glass Bottom Boat holds up well at the top of the genre. But the extensive comedic cast including the two early TV icons of entertainment makes this a special film worth note for its historical value as well. I don't think Godfrey or Martin appeared in any other movie of consequence. The DVD with this film also has some notable extras. One is a featurette with spectacular scenery of Catalina Island. Another is an interesting historical capsule about NASA. The U.S. space program still was in its infancy and returning spacecraft dropped into the sea where they were recovered by ships. And anyone who enjoys cartoons will like the excellent educational cartoon The Dot and the Line. The Glass Bottom Boat is top drawer entertainment fit for the whole family. It's sure to make even the most dour face laugh grin and smile at various moments.".

Doris Day is in my opinion one of the most natural actresses ever to grace Hollywood.  She is real and unpretentious.  I consider Glass Bottom Boat one of her best movies because her style innocence wit and charm are infectious.  She carries Rod Taylor right along with her.  This is really the first movie in which I noticed Rod Taylor as having a real comedic flair and I think he comes across as quite charming not to mention sexy.This movie has some memorable characters and actors we grow to love on television.  Firstly this is the only movie I've ever seen with Arthur Godfrey who plays Doris Day's father.  Next is Dick Martin later to be a star on Rowan and Martin's LaughIn.  One of my favorite character actors is Paul LyndeI've never seen him perform without laughing right out loud at his characters.  In this movie he is hilarious as he dons a taffeta dress and wig to try to catch Doris as a Russian spy.  Dom Deluise John McGiver Ellen Corby  Edward Andrews are also on hand to add to the laughs.  And lastly Alice Pearce plays her Gladys Kravitztype character from the TV show Bewitched to perfection.If you like this one you should also see Do Not Disturb also with Doris Day and Rod Taylor.  Happy watching!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fantastic movie! I had heard of the title and had it on my list of mustgets even though I had never actually watched it before. I finally picked it up for 1.00 in a charity shop. This is exactly the kind of picture that I enjoy a great cast in a romantic comedy with lots of laughoutloud antics thrown in. I was surprised at how good Rod Taylor is in this. He's not my favourite actor but he and Doris have great chemistry in this movie and they are ably assisted by the likes of Paul Lynde Dom DeLuise Edward Andrews John McGiver and Dick Martin thrown in for good measure. With those names on the bill you already know that you're in for a heck of a treat but this picture goes above and beyond! There's slapstick galore throughout and it's almost as though Frank Tashlin said Now Doris and Rod you say your lines and these other guys are just going to do their thing and you just go with it and I'm going to keep rolling o.k.? I mean I know that there was a script but it just feels as though sometimes they threw it away!! The movie is fastpaced witty sometimes predictable but always wonderfully entertaining. Paul Lynde is such a crackup that you can imagine the whole cast and crew falling about in hysterics many times over while filming this. There are also several appearances by the familiar face of Alice Pearce who plays her usual nosey neighbour character as she does in many of Doris's movies. I love this picture and it is now one of my favourites!! I think you will like it too. It's a great movie for the whole family from a time when Hollywood made great pictures! Pity they don't make good stuff like this now! 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just think that if Doris Day had not for some reason named her dog Vladimir there might have been no plot at all for this Frank Tashlin comedy.That might have been bad because this was the best of Doris Day's films in the late sixties as she was beginning a downward drop in her box office appeal. The Glass Bottom Boat was the second film she did with Rod Taylor as costar and the first of two she did with Frank Tashlin as director. And this one was the best product in both associations.Doris works in public relations at a space lab in California where scientist Rod Taylor is developing new stuff for the Defense Department and NASA. She also doubles and helps her dad Arthur Godfrey on his glass bottom boat tourist vehicle. One of the things I like best about The Glass Bottom Boat is Doris sings again on screen once in a nice duet with Arthur Godfrey on his ever present ukulele. She also sings her most famous song Que Sera Sera once again for a new generations of film fans.One thing about Doris's later films she always had excellent supporting casts and this one is loaded with some very funny people like Edward Andrews John McGiver Paul Lynde Dom DeLuise Dick Martin George Tobias and Alice Pearce. They all fill roles that you would expect from them.The Glass Bottom Boat has Rod Taylor concerned with plant security in regard to his top secret work. An overzealous security guard played by Paul Lynde overhears Doris call her dog on the phone. What she does is that in order to give the pooch some exercise during the day she calls her own number counts the rings and then says something to the unanswered phone. It's for the dog to get exercise because he runs around like a maniac when the phone rings.From that we deduce that Doris is a Soviet spy and the real CIA in the person of Eric Fleming is called in. This was Fleming's last big screen appearance before he was drowned on location in Peru. A very sad end to a career that might have been the equal of his Rawhide costar Clint Eastwood.Seeing Paul Lynde in drag questioning an inept spy played by Dom DeLuise is worth seeing this film alone.".

Overall an enjoyable film with guffawgenerating moments.That said I am also interested in knowing a bit about the locations. The NASA exteriors look very much like California State University at Northridge CA where I began my own college career in 1959. What looks to be the library building was not there then. The genuine rocket engine tests and locations shown were almost certainly shot at the Rocketdyne facility in the Santa Susana Mountains. The Saturn 2nd stage J2 rockets were tested there. The firststage F1s were tested at Rye Canyon in the Castaic area. I worked graveyard at Santa Susana for 112 years 196365 and also watched a night J2 test possibly from the same bunker that Day and Taylor watched from. Any information on these locations will be appreciated.".

The Glass Bottom Boat is a fun comedy that mixes science with espionage and mistaken identities that produced a funny movie even when watched today.Doris Day in her heyday couldn't do anything wrong in spite of the silly premises of what was written for her. In this comedy is Jennifer Nelson a widow who works in the aerospace industry. The genius scientist Bruce Templeton likes what he sees and proceeds to pursue Jennifer but things get complicated because it appears Mrs. Nelson is a Soviet spy.The film's pace never lets up. Doris Day is wonderful as the naive but resourceful woman who can charm us with one of her wonderful smiles. Rod Taylor is the hunky Bruce Templeton who sees in Jennifer not only a beautiful lady but the right one for him.The supporting cast in this movie is full of familiar faces. Paul Linde provides one of the best laughs in the movie when as a security guard and suspecting Jennifer of the worst dresses in drag and follows her to the ladies' room. Arthur Godfrey is Jennifer's father. John McGiver Edward Anderson Dick Martin Dom DeLuise Eric Fleming Alice Pearce and George Tobias contribute to make this a fun movie. The cameo by Robert Vaughn is a surprise.The film will not disappoint fans of Doris Day.".

Paul Lynde is at his best as the security guard in drag. Don't try to rate this with The Party 1969 or The Cheap Detective 1980... but it is a light very funny and romantic romp just the same. I give it 8 stars because the songs sung by Doris and Godfrey with his ukulele are absolutely redundant and corny and Doris and Rod Taylor look VERY self conscious trying to look enthusiastic singing with him... and the soundtrack goes way overboard playing the main theme over and over and it becomes rather like It's a Small World After All in that it is difficult to get that doggone song out of your head when it's all over .... but there is much to enjoy with this film. The film would have done better with a more intelligent music score and better songs to take advantage of Doris Day's voice. Godfrey does should not have sung at all... though he was fine as Doris' father. The DVD extras about Catalina and the costumes are very nice as well.".

There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... but not bad for Hollywood.

I suspect it was a combination of great directing super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors. Not just one or two... this movie really jelled!

	schema:reviewBody "Easily 9 out of 10 for a film by director we will continue to grow to admire. But don't watch this movie expecting to be entertained. Ang Lee takes an objective look at a relatively unexplored aspect of the Civil War. What is beautiful about the movie like all of Lee's films is that he doesn't side with his characters. He creates characters embodies them with life problems and ambiguity ... and endows them with a reality that often hits far closer to home than with which many are comfortable. This film has action but it is not for the action lover since the violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous ... i.e. like the characters it is real. And as you would expect about one of mankind's most horrific wars the violence is horrific.But as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that surely dwelt within the Civil War it is a masterpiece. Was the war about slavery and an abolitionism? Lee seems quite willing to blur that line made so popular in depictions like the Blue and the Grey. Neither is about idealism though as seen in Gone with the Wind. It is about freedom about the desire to have something which is yours and to fight for it. As you watch the characters you will ask yourself how can they be fighting to preserve slavery? The fact is I don't think they really are and in that the film shows the problem of why so many were caught up in the maelstrom of the Civil War.The fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting out of senses of loyalty to home though they may never have examined what home represents or whether they truly espouse its values. The letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limits. And when the tension finally snaps and these characters find themselves suddenly free ... we see the birth of new men.All this mixed in with Lee's beautiful incorporation of humankind's environment with breathtaking vistas and frames. Lee has a style which is his somehow European in its art a slow camera unrushed Asian in its epicness and development of story and yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many in North Americans.Relax let go of your preconceptions about what the Civil War is what the western as a genre is what a war movie should be ... and let Ang Lee take you into a world so fragile so hard so real that few of us can comfortably see it.In this Lee continues what he wrought in Ice Storm. Again the movie is slow paced and without apparent direction ... a sure sign of Lee's ability to direct without imposing himself on the story or screen. His direction is amplified by what he brings out of Jewel yes the singer a hitherto unproven actress who puts in an amazing performance.A movie for those who love film and are not lovers of the standard Hollywood epic.".

His direction is amplified by what he brings out of Jewel yes the singer a hitherto unproven actress who puts in an amazing performance.A movie for those who love film and are not lovers of the standard Hollywood epic.";

	schema:reviewBody "Taiwanese director Ang Lee whose previous films include 'Sense and Sensibility' and 'The Ice Storm' turned to the American Civil War for his latest feature. Based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell it follows the exploits of a group of Southern guerrillas known as bushwhackers as they fight their Northern equivalents the jayhawkers in the backwater of Missouri.As one might expect there is plenty of visceral action but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it  many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family. Jake Roedel Tobey Maguire is such a man or rather boy as he is only seventeen when the war reaches Missouri. He is the son of a German immigrant but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a Unionist he joins his lifelong friend Jack Bull Chiles Skeet Ulrich and rides with the bushwhackers. Despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed Union men he remains loyal to the cause. So does his friend Daniel Holt Jeffrey Wright a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the South.Lee handles the subject with aplomb never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war  long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting. The action is unglamorised and admirably candid recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities.The performances are superb with Maguire and Wright both courageous and dignified. Upandcoming Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers is particularly chilling as a coldblooded killer while Skeet Ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant. Lee never flinches from the reality of war but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it  the growth of friendship the demonstration of courage and on a wider scale the emancipation of oppressed peoples. Ride With the Devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that  regularly shocks but always moves the audience.".

The border states in this war were completely divided and often the inhabitants of these states were caught up in desperate struggles for their lives and homes.Certainly Ride with the Devil does not feature the epic battle scenes that Gettysburg brought to the screen but it does give an excellent insight as to how everyday people dealt with the total destruction of their lives.Ride with the Devil certainly gives a fresh and unique perspective of the Civil War.  It is to the movies credit that it fully explores the tedium of life experienced by the common combatant who faced moments of tremendous anxiety while in combat and the long dull periods of no action.Furthermore I am really tired of movie critics harping on the dialects and language used in the movie.  Well folks I hate to tell you but in the 19th Century people generally spoke in the manner that this film depicts.  I believe that the language in the film is one of its finest points.Ang Lee went to great pains in making this one of the finest period pieces that I have encountered.  Mr. Lee used hundreds of Civil War reenactors and took great care in making sure that his principle actors sets and scenery looked the part. The movie was filmed in Missouri and Kansas and captures the scenic beauty of this area.The actors are of a fine calibre and should be recognized for their outstanding performances.  Considerable kudos should go to Tobey Maguire and Geoffrey Wright.  They both were believable in their mannerisms and dialect. Tobey Maguire is outstanding in his use of period language.All in all the movie is great.  Since it wasn't on the big screen long we can only hope that the video will arrive soon.  Sometimes it is refreshing to go and see a movie that is about real people and events that really happened.".

	schema:reviewBody "My greatgrandfather J.W. Daugherty was a very young teenager during the civil war in Missouri. While still twelve he was put to work as a muleskinner by one of the blackflag bands of bushwackers around Cedar County in southern Missouri. He later mastered the use of the sixshooter and rode with Quantrill. He claimed to have ridden with Jesse and Frank James during and after the war but every man of his generation made the same claim. Were all the claims true it would probably be about fifty thousand in all who rode with the James boys.J.W. claimed not to have been present during the burning of Lawrence but so did everybody else. With so many thousand occupied in riding with the brothers James it is passing strange that so few managed to be present during the actual burning of Lawrence the single most important action of the Quantrill band.I am incidentally named after Lawrence that appellation being my first name.J.W. claimed it was the James brothers who invented the idea of gripping the reins in their teeth while firing both revolvers thereby availing oneself of a full twelve rounds in flight. J.W. ended up being the champion fiddler of Missouri losing that title only when jealous rivals shut him out of the fiddling contests because he could read music.Another greatgrandfather of mine was James Quinn a young captain of the Union calvery. This was a Missouri militia unit but militias on the border often saw more action that regular units back east. His job was to guard the railroads from the highway agents who even then were perfecting the feat of robbing the trains of yankee gold sent south for payroll.James and J.W. were supposed to have been on opposite sides during the Battle of Wilson's Creek but it is impossible to know for sure. I have copies of Union orders for Captain James Quinn having to do with the bandits operating in southern Missouri.This film RIDE WITH THE DEVIL is one of the truly great American films and the only one that even begins to get close to the feeling of the border wars the bushwacking the betrayals and the split families. In Missouri the Civil War was hell on earth breaking every family apart at least once.Toby McGuire is overwhelming in his grasp of the teenage border warrior who has known nothing else but killing and who finally decides to make a new life in California. Jewel is astonishing as the young survivor widowed twice but full of life and a desire to live it to the fullest.The historical details are almost always spot on and the faces of the men and women are disturbingly like what they must have been in those terrible days.But finally it is the script that is almost unbelievable in its power. Even when one or two words are wrong the scriptwriter manages to somehow capture the mood and the rhythms of 19thcentury speech in that part of the country in all its humor and deep fatalism and courtesyand yes its cruelty too.This is the first work of art that made me feel something close to what my greatgrandfathers must have gone through. They left many stories and written records behind but such autobiographies conceal as much as they reveal especially about the violence and its traumatizing effects of the young males who experienced it.I am grateful to the makers of this film the scriptwriter the author of the original book WOE TO LIVE ON the actors and others who created RIDE WITH THE DEVIL and somehow managed to make it such a stunning work of art. To them I am thankful for bringing me closer to ancestors who made me what I am and whofor better or worsemade this country what it is.Lawrence Swaim".

It stars Tobey Maguire Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright Jonathan RhysMeyers Simon Baker James Caviezel and Jewel. Music is by Mychael Danna and cinematography by Frederick Elmes.On the Western Frontier of Missouri the American Civil War was fought not by armies but by neighbours. Informal gangs of local Southern Bushwhackers fought a bloody and desperate Guerrilla war against the occupying Union Army and proUnion Jayhawkers. Allegiance to either side was dangerous. But it was more dangerous still to find oneself caught in the middleMade for 38 million and intended to be a sweeping epic for the summer blockbuster crowd Ride with the Devil was a considerable financial flop. With a limited release both in America and abroad the financial figures are hardly surprising. More so considering it was given next to no promotion by the distributors. Factor in a little controversy about the events featured in the story some cuts made by the studio Lee didn't have final cut and a delay in home release formats because the distributor incredibly wanted Jeffrey Wright's presence removed from the cover art! Well you would be forgiven for thinking that the film has to be something of a stinker. Not so say I.Part rites of passage drama part reflective war movie Ang Lee's film is a grand film viewing experience. Dealing as it does with the often forgotten part of the war down on the MissouriKansas border where Lee also shoots on location film manages to be both savage and lyrical in equal measure. The savagery comes with the fights bloody frenetic and high on potency while the lyricism comes with the human relationships internal conflicts and the political awareness of the men boys fighting for their cause. All given deft treatment by Schamus whose screenplay contains crisp period dialogue and a narrative correctly showing that this part of the war was not just driven by racist Dixie's hell bent on revenge violent lust and political allegiance but often for family land and rights. Picture is at pains to let us know the youth of the main characters ramming home the point of boys forced to become men killing machines very quickly. Case in point the culmination of the violence in the film that comes by way of the Lawrence Massacre a tragic and upsetting slaughter that saw 180 people murdered under the leadership of a vengeful William Quantrill John Ales. Lee and Schamus aren't interested in showing heroism in this particular war they show it as futile nasty and it leaves the taste of bile in the throat.From here the film slows considerably as the lead characters withdraw from the action of war to awakenings and friendships forming. It's here where Lee is at his best. No great director of action as evidenced by the previously mentioned Lawrence Massacre which lacks the cutting edge to really grab us by the throat and never let go but for human interest aspects and bucolic scenes with characters framed within Lee owes film fans absolutely nothing. The latter of which he is aided considerably by Elmes' widescreen photography. Ulrich and pop star Jewel nicely handle their parts he puts a confident swagger into Jack Bull Chiles she is tender and unassuming in the pivotal female role of Sue Lee Shelley. Caviezel gives Black John Ambrose a brooding menace while Jonathan RhysMeyers is on overdrive as sadistic loony Pitt Mackeson. But it's with Maguire and Wright that the acting plaudits go. Maguire has arguably never been better he gives Jake Roedel an effective sensitivity as a virginal boy receives a violent initiation into manhood. Wright is sublime said to be one of his favourite performances Wright as freed slave Daniel Holt is the heart beat of the film. Conveying most of the good traits available to man Holt fights not just out of loyalty to his friend George Clyde Baker but to gain ultimate catharsis in is life. It's a beautiful measured turn from Wright and it deserves more appreciative attention. The last third of it may be too talky for some and a couple of dangling narrative threads left unanswered stop it from being a masterpiece. But it's close to being just that a savage beautiful and lyrical movie. The stupid studio execs had no idea Putz's. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I've watched this movie twice now on DVD and both times it didn't fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude. It seems more like a depiction of reality than most other Hollywood fare especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed. Even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint it doesn't fail to question it and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost not matter what and cruelty is a common denominator.What really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to overdramatize. Nowadays truly good movies in a nutshell are few and far apart with mainstream fare being enjoyable if you don't have high expectations but terribly commercially spirited. I think this movie comes off as a truly good movie without being a masterpiece because it sticks to itself and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence. This movie is cool observant and generally lighthanded in its judgement which is GOOD.The story has its flaws especially Jewel's Character comes off doubtfully but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life even by liberally taking each next guy. Still she doesn't come off as weak in fact I think she's one of the stronger characters she's always in control of the relationships with the men just tagging. And I take it very gratefully that she's not a weeping widow. I believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now. You could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries so the prospect of of someone dying while surely causing grief didn't traumatise people like it does now. People didn't seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now and I like that attitude.My recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare. Don't watch if if you want nonstop action or heartrenting emotion.".

I think this movie comes off as a truly good movie without being a masterpiece because it sticks to itself and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence. This movie is cool observant and generally lighthanded in its judgement which is GOOD.The story has its flaws especially Jewel's Character comes off doubtfully but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life even by liberally taking each next guy. Still she doesn't come off as weak in fact I think she's one of the stronger characters she's always in control of the relationships with the men just tagging. And I take it very gratefully that she's not a weeping widow. I believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now. You could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries so the prospect of of someone dying while surely causing grief didn't traumatise people like it does now. People didn't seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now and I like that attitude.My recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare. Don't watch if if you want nonstop action or heartrenting emotion.";

	schema:reviewBody "In anticipation of Ang Lee's new movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon I saw this at blockbuster and figured I'd give it a try.  A civil war movie is not the typical movie I watch.  Luckily though I had a good feeling about this director. This movie was wonderfully written.  The dialogue is in the old southern style yet doesn't sound cornily out of place and outdated.  The spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie.  Toby Maguire was awesome.  I thought he was good but nothing special in Pleasantville but here he shines.  I have always thought of Skeet Ulrich as a good actor but nothing special but here he is excellent as well.  The big shocker for me was Jewel.  She was amazingly good.  Jeffrey Wright who I had never heard of before is also excellent in this movie. It seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand.  A movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa. This movie had the perfect combination.  The actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular.  This movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others.  It lets you really get to know the characters which are all very dynamic and interesting. The plot is complex and keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing and ready for anything at any time.  Literally dozens of times I was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were too quiet brilliant directing.  This was also a beautifully shot movie.  The scenery was not breath taking It's in Missouri and Kansas for goodness sakez but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings. Has that rough and rugged feel but keeps an elegance which is very pleasant on the eyes. The movie was deep.  It told a story and in doing so made you think. It had layers underneath that exterior civil war story.  Specifically it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for. There were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie too many to pick out.  It was like a beautifully written short story filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done. If you like great acting writing lots of action and some of the best directing ever see this movie!  Take a chance on it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ride With the Devil has something rich and special if you can stand the slow development.  While tackling a dark gritty subject the brutal guerrilla war in the American West during its Civil War which in turned spawned the outlaws of the old west of the 1870s the movie maintains a strangely satisfying unmanipulated atmosphere.  What I'm refering to is the tendency of films' music and lighting to make you feel the mood you'd expect to feel.  But RWTD instead has a relatively upbeat soundtrack and lets the words and action do the talking set the mood rather than manipulation of the viewer's senses.As an enthusast of this particular area of CW history I'm greatly impressed with the accuracy of the film.  The diologue is expertly written even with subtle humor occasionally with references to bushwhackers and previous boarder battles Independence for example...A far cry from the Oregon Trail!.  The minor events that occur to Jake's band are similar to actual events that took place...Especially the attack when they're holed up in the house and the destruction of the storebooth.  The battle scenes though rare are pretty well executed.  It even has the first CW cavalry battle put on film recently.The directing shows the talent everyone expects of Ang Lee in subtle ways. Example  The character of Black John is shown taunting a Lawrence resident during the massacre Where's your army? Who are we to fight!? Who are we to fight?! The shot then switches to a trio of Confederate Regulars standing doing nothing to stop the carnage while the voice continues You are cowards all! Who are the cowards really?  Little touches like that really enhance the movie's quality.There are no major glaring areas in the history something that can not be said of the masterpiece of film Glory which was basically fiction within the context of the major events it follows.  Some minor problems include the fact that the years as shown by the events represented don't add up.  But you will never notice that. A larger curiosity is the fact that the only AfricanAmerican manatarms character in the film is the quasislave fighting for Jake and his Confederate bushwhackers. It is true that some blacks did fight for the Confederacy out there including one who scouted Lawrence for Quantrill before the attack Who would suspect him?.  Though this black rebel is a fasinating character whatever PC AfricanAmericans might think of him not a single black Union infantryman is seen in the film which would have been more represenative of the black experience in the Western CW.  One of the first black regiments of the CW was raised in Kansas by the murderer Senator Jim Lane and before the 54th Mass. Reg. of fame was organized and black troops in such battles as Baxter Springs KS played a critical role.No glaring historical errors.  Good realistic action which is infrequent and not gratitous.  Good Directing.  This film may not be the blockbusters other recent Civil War were but it's the cleanest job of any.".

This is my favorite TM movie and my favorite TM performance.Ang Lee is also one of my favorite directors thanx to this film. I loved THE ICE STORM and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON but this film is the best of the three. Many people say this is historically inacurate but I've done some research and I don't see more than one or two minor little flawed details. Anyway I don't know what historical period piece HASN'T been criticized and called inaccurate.Ulrich and Maguire lead a great cast that includes Jewel Kilcher James Caviezel Jonathan RhysMeyers Tom Wilkinson and the outstanding Jeffrey Wright as the semi slave who befriends Maguire's character.The story centers on the moral tug of war going on inside a young Missouri man named Jake Roedell Maguire who being of German decent is looked on with scorn and suspicion by Confederate people he lives with even though he is Confederate thinking. His father is Unionist and after Roedell joins an army of bushwackers going on vengeful killing sprees far from home his father stops talking to him. His friend Jack Bull Childs Ulrich protects him whenever their peers start harrassing Jake about being German. The one who does the worst harrassing is Pitt Mackeson a very campy but fierce performance by RhysMeyers.There is a lot of violence and some shocking moments including but not limited to the loss of a finger being shot thru the face oh!!! the death of a father and the long painful death of one of the main cast members. But amid all the violence there remains a poetic graceful humanity. Someone describes the scenes of the Missouri and Kansas woods as pastoral. I agree completely. It's weird to see bloody battles occuring in lovely green meadows rather than in concrete settings.Whatever critics don't like this film it remains to me one of the best new westerns ever made in the ranks of Tombstone and Dances With Wolves. I recommend it highly.".

	schema:headline " A Ride with Ang Lee";
	schema:reviewBody "The War Between the States was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of America a war that pitted brother against brother and family against family and left scars that even today have not yet healed and in all probability never will.  And as in any story about any war beyond any historical significance it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involving.  It is the human element that renders the context necessary to give it perspective which is what director Ang Lee provides in Ride With the Devil' a Civil War drama in which he focuses on the personal travails within the broader depiction of the War itself and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the War the infamous raid on Lawrence Kansas by Quantrill and his raiders which he succeeds in presenting quite objectively from the Confederate pointofview.In 1863 the Union influence predominates in the State of Kansas and even across the border in neighboring Missouri those with Confederate loyalties are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the encroaching Northerners especially without the aid of what could be considered any regular' Confederate troops.  And when things begin to really heat up around their own town Jack Bull Chiles Skeet Ulrich and Jake Roedel Tobey Maguire form a band of their own and join in the fray doing damage to the Union cause wherever it is practicable.  Jack Bull and Jake do not like the War and do not like killing but they are standing up for what they believe to be right.  There are others however even among their own men like the young Pitt Mackeson Jonathan RhysMeyers who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims.  And so for Jack Bull and Jake as well as many just like them it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood. And they will have to ride with the very Devil himself against seemingly insurmountable odds.As with all of his films director Ang Lee approaches his story through an incisive yet subtle examination of the traditions cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting.  And in so doing Lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers perhaps a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged.  Whether it's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters Eat Drink Man Woman' the effects of class distinction Sense and Sensibility' the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above The Ice Storm' Lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level.  This film is no exception and as he does with all his films Lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography in this film by Frederick Elmes who also did The Ice Storm' brilliantly which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry.  It's that special Lee touch and it adds a wistful reflective sense to whatever story he is telling which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable.As Jake Tobey Maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops and his character along with it.  Most importantly Maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation  His stoic acceptance of death and the news of those murdered' in the various skirmishes and battles the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere even in such troubled times the betrayal which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly.  It is all of this that Maguire achieves through his performance and it is no small accomplishment.  It is however the kind of studied understated performance that is often taken for granted which is unfortunate work like this is worthy of acclaim and should be recognized.Skeet Ulrich is effective as well as Jack Bull and Jewel in her motion picture debut turns in an engaging performance as Sue Lee Shelley.  It is Jeffrey Wright however who stands out in a notable supporting role as Daniel Holt as well as Jonathan RhysMeyers who brings a chilling Christopher Walkenlike menace to his role of Pitt.  Also in what amounts to a cameo role one scene Mark Ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time.The supporting cast includes James Caviezel Black John Simon Baker George Clyde Tom Guiry Riley Tom Wilkinson Orton Brown John Ales Quantrill John Judd Otto Roedel and Kathleen Warfel Mrs. Chiles.  The Civil War will forever be an open wound upon the nation but hopefully as time goes on it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like Ang Lee and films like Ride With the Devil' that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing.  In light of more recent events it is something that is sorely needed worldwide.  Film is a powerful medium it can be educational as well as entertaining and perhaps in the future more filmmakers like Ang Lee will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are.  810.".

Jack Bull and Jake do not like the War and do not like killing but they are standing up for what they believe to be right.  There are others however even among their own men like the young Pitt Mackeson Jonathan RhysMeyers who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims.  And so for Jack Bull and Jake as well as many just like them it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood. And they will have to ride with the very Devil himself against seemingly insurmountable odds.As with all of his films director Ang Lee approaches his story through an incisive yet subtle examination of the traditions cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting.  And in so doing Lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers perhaps a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged.  Whether it's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters Eat Drink Man Woman' the effects of class distinction Sense and Sensibility' the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above The Ice Storm' Lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level.  This film is no exception and as he does with all his films Lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography in this film by Frederick Elmes who also did The Ice Storm' brilliantly which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry.  It's that special Lee touch and it adds a wistful reflective sense to whatever story he is telling which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable.As Jake Tobey Maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops and his character along with it.  Most importantly Maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation  His stoic acceptance of death and the news of those murdered' in the various skirmishes and battles the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere even in such troubled times the betrayal which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly.  It is all of this that Maguire achieves through his performance and it is no small accomplishment.  It is however the kind of studied understated performance that is often taken for granted which is unfortunate work like this is worthy of acclaim and should be recognized.Skeet Ulrich is effective as well as Jack Bull and Jewel in her motion picture debut turns in an engaging performance as Sue Lee Shelley.  It is Jeffrey Wright however who stands out in a notable supporting role as Daniel Holt as well as Jonathan RhysMeyers who brings a chilling Christopher Walkenlike menace to his role of Pitt.  Also in what amounts to a cameo role one scene Mark Ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time.The supporting cast includes James Caviezel Black John Simon Baker George Clyde Tom Guiry Riley Tom Wilkinson Orton Brown John Ales Quantrill John Judd Otto Roedel and Kathleen Warfel Mrs. Chiles.  The Civil War will forever be an open wound upon the nation but hopefully as time goes on it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like Ang Lee and films like Ride With the Devil' that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing.  In light of more recent events it is something that is sorely needed worldwide.  Film is a powerful medium it can be educational as well as entertaining and perhaps in the future more filmmakers like Ang Lee will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are.  810.";

	schema:reviewBody "Interesting movie based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell and professionally directed by Ang Lee . It deals with Jake Roedel Tobey Maguire and Jack Bull Skeet Ulrich  two friends living in Missouri when the Civil War bursts out . Jack Bull's dad is murdered by Jayhawkers  so the young men join the Bushwhackers to fight Union soldiers . Bushwhackers are irregulars loyal to the South led by Black John Jim Caviezel and the violent Pitt Mackeson Jonathan Rhys Meyers  besides George Clyde Simon Baker. One of them is an AfricanAmerican  Daniel Holt Jeffrey Wright beholden to the man who bought his freedom . They are a littleknown band of Civil War fighters known as Bushwhackers . They skirmish then spend long hours hiding. Sue Lee Jewel a young widow  brings them supplies . She and Jack Bull become lovers and when he's grievously wounded  Jake escorts her south to a safe farm . Later on  there takes place the looting and burning of Lawrence  Kansas  actually occurred on 21 August 1863 also known as Quantrill's Raid . As his friends die one after another Jake must decide where honor lies .Exciting film based on historical events set during American Civil War 18611865 in which the Bushwhackers use guerrilla warfare to destroy Yankee targets and led by men set on revenge make a raid into Kansas. The picture efficiently describes the atmosphere of violence in which Women and Blacks have few rights confrontation among bands and bloody battles . Emotive and evocative musical score by Mychael Danna . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Frederick Elmes. Very good production design  including breathtaking attacks and battles  the scenes of the Quantrill's Raid on Lawrence Kansas were filmed in Pattonsburg Missouri  Pattonsburg was flooded out during the great flood of 1993 and the town was relocated leaving many empty buildings and homes available . The motion picture was well directed by Ang Lee Brokeback mountain  Sense and Sensibility  Hulk  Crouching tiger  hidden dragon. The flick based on real deeds  these are the followings  The Lawrence Massacre was a rebel guerrilla attack during the U.S. Civil War by Quantrill's Raiders led by William Clarke Quantrill on the proUnion town of Lawrence Kansas. The attack on August 21 1863 targeted Lawrence due to the town's long support of abolition and its reputation as a center for Jayhawkers and Redlegs which were freestate militia and vigilante groups known for attacking and destroying farms and plantations in Missouri's proslavery western counties .By 1863 Kansas had long been the center of strife and warfare over the admission of slave versus free states. In the summer of 1856 the first sacking of Lawrence sparked a guerrilla war in Kansas that lasted for months. John Brown might be the best known participant but numerous groups fought for each side in Bleeding Kansas.By the beginning of the American Civil War Lawrence Kansas was already a target for proslavery ire having been seen as the antislavery stronghold in the state and more importantly a staging area for Union and Jayhawker incursions into Missouri. Initially the town and surrounding area were extremely vigilant and reacted strongly to any rumors that enemy forces might be advancing on the town. However by the summer of 1863 as none of the threats had materialized citizen fears had declined and defense preparations were relaxed.Quantrill himself said his motivation for the attack was To plunder and destroy the town in retaliation for Osceola. That was a reference to the Union's attack on Osceola Missouri in September 1861 led by Senator James H. Lane.The attack was the product of careful planning. Quantrill had been able to gain the confidence of many of the leaders of independent Bushwhacker groups and chose the day and time of the attack well in advance. The different groups of Missouri riders approached Lawrence from the east in several independent columns and converged with welltimed precision in the final miles before Lawrence during the predawn hours of the chosen day. Many of the men had been riding for over 24 hours to make the rendezvous and had lashed themselves to their saddles to keep riding if they fell asleep. Almost all were armed with multiple sixshot revolvers.Lawrence in ruins as illustrated in Harper's WeeklyBetween three and four hundred riders arrived at the summit of Mount Oread then descended on Lawrence in a fury. Over four hours the raiders pillaged and set fire to the town and killed most of its male population. Quantrill's men burned to the ground a quarter of the buildings in Lawrence including all but two businesses. They looted most of the banks and stores and killed between 185 and 200 men and boys .".

The moody cinematography was splendid and rich...like dark chocolate.  And I especially loved the dialogue which was exceptional in that it was so relaxed and yet crackled with intelligence. It was authentic in that it was accurate in phrasing and slang usage from the American English of the time and place.  I have read and heard many soldiers' Civil War diaries.  Also you can't help but notice that the miniballs from the battle scenes' guns actually whizzed and zipped cutting into tree branches and thudding into dirt.  This was a truly beautiful film in spite of its admittedly sad theme.  The performances were all outstanding with Jewel surprising me.  All told if you are a Civil War buff and a film lover see this movie...see it on DVD if possible as the surround sound is awesome for the action scenes.".

The moody cinematography was splendid and rich...like dark chocolate.  And I especially loved the dialogue which was exceptional in that it was so relaxed and yet crackled with intelligence. It was authentic in that it was accurate in phrasing and slang usage from the American English of the time and place.  I have read and heard many soldiers' Civil War diaries.  Also you can't help but notice that the miniballs from the battle scenes' guns actually whizzed and zipped cutting into tree branches and thudding into dirt.

A notable subtle aspect such as the touching of one's hat brim in front of the brow with the right hand as a display of respect and compliment. This was a commonly performed function.The language is prominently gracious elegant and superior. It demonstrated a period of times with exceeding consideration. Such language its dialects and delivery still exist today in a few areas even here in Kansas but more so in Southern areas still reverent to the real issues of the Civil War.

Topographically it is less than 15 miles from the slave Capitol of Kansas which existed in Lecompton. Proximity to the issues was an everyday point suffered by both sides as it was dangerous to be known as showing allegiance to either side.This dangerous discord in Kansas spilled over into the issue of its coming into the Union on one side or the other. Skirmishes such as portrayed in the film are totally accurate in what was called Bloody Kansas. Its motto even speaks of these times and its joining the Union Ad Astra per Astra or To the Stars Through Difficulty.Jewel's speaking voice has a belllike quality which leaves a resounding impression even after the end of her speaking. She is an example of exceptional acting which must certainly derive aside from acting training to her many years performing on stage. Every scene she appears in leaves this writer spellbound. I regard her best work in the extended scenes at the end of the film after she and Jake Roedel are married. The exchanges with Pitt Mackeson between Jake and her switch rapidly from confrontation and memory of past events and pronouncements to a more civil conversation almost forgiving in which Jewel's acting skill carries much of the heightened anticipation of the next series of exchanges what they may be and what their content will promote.Others have spoken remarkably accurate about the portrayals by other actors.I don't know of another film which addresses this period and location.

	schema:headline " A cheerful film with an underlying vein of tragedy";
	schema:reviewBody "HappyGoLucky has been reviewed in the British press as a relatively lightweight Mike Leigh movie but I'm not so sure. The story revolves around Sally Hawkins' remarkable performance as primary school teacher Poppy Cross a highly unusual character in that Hawkins and Leigh between them manage to make her consistently cheerful and optimistic without being either naive or irritating. Poppy is presented as both relentlessly cheery and on another level remarkably intuitive throughout the film she has a series of encounters with troubled male figures a boy in her class who has started bullying a very strange homeless Irishman and above all her phenomenally uptight driving instructor Scott and in all of them Poppy's liveliness and friendly curiosity about other people is seen to be a powerful counter to male selfpity anger and despair.Hawkins' character is not someone who is inclined to let life get her down so it's just as well that she is surrounded by people with a somewhat more sardonic or downbeat take on reality. Her flatmate Zoe Alexis Zegerman very good is a wonderfully dry and sarky counter to Poppy's enthusiasm although the affection between them is palpable. Poppy's younger sisters Suzy and Helen are also quite different Suzy is a law student who is more interested in clubbing drinking and playing with her brotherinlaw's Playstation than in criminal justice while Helen is heavily pregnant obsessed with acquiring the trappings of a respectable suburban life and unable to understand how her older sister can be so happy living in a rented flat and not stepping onto the property ladder.The big surprise for me is that I had been led to believe that this is a more or less straightforward feelgood film. It isn't. Scott Poppy's driving teacher Eddie Marsan is the most affecting character in it and one of the greatest and most unforgettable characters in Leigh's oeuvre. Most of the reviews I've read of the film depict Scott as a hateful sinister or otherwise despicable character but although it's true that he is an uptight judgmental angry bigot it is also perfectly clear from his first appearance that he doesn't know what he's talking about and that he is driven by emotional problems that he hasn't even begun to get a handle on. Marsan's extraordinary performance is one of the best things I've seen on film for a long time. Scott has been afflicted with very bad teeth and a mild speech defect he can't really say the letter 'r' and although his inner anger and bigotry is played for laughs for a lot of the film in the end it is allowed to blossom forth in a riveting scene where his fury jealousy and terror of his own darkness spill forth in a heartbreaking and riveting torrent. If part of the point of art is to help us to understand people we would otherwise have little sympathy with then this film is a work of art. I've never seen Marsan before but he deserves awards for this movie no question.HappyGoLucky is a highly enjoyable and often very funny film but it also carries terrible sadness. I have never been a massive fan of Mike Leigh but lately I have to admit that I was wrong. He just seems to get better and better.".

On the other hand she doesn't shut her eyes on the sad sides of life such as a traumatized homeless man or a boy beaten by his mother's new partner and one understands that she is deeply sad about not being able to help Scott even if she would have had every reason to simply hate him for his bad temper his racism and his stalking.The director has done a superb job with this production it is packed with intelligent witty dialogs and convincingly drawn characters.Our world needs a lot more people like Poppy or at least  if they don't possess her strength and optimism  people who are sympathetic with her values instead of feeling threatened by humaneness.

Like several other reviewers of this movie I signed up with IMDb just so that I could review this horrid movie. I'd like to warn away any potential viewers who have more than one brain cell intact.This movie has nothing to say about real life or about the real drama that each of us faces in going through life while balancing a desire for happiness with an awareness of and empathy for the challenges faced by each of us personally and all of us globally. Aside from the insanely irritating main character and the more complex profoundly flawed and yet sadly sympathetic driving instructor the rest of the characters are drawn with about as much depth as a cartoon sketch in the Sunday funnies.The love story between Poppy and the social worker? Come on. The coocoo your eyes are so gorgeous business on their first date made me want to puke. I guess I shouldn't have expected any more of a coherent conversation topic from Poppy who had already been exposed as an airheaded idiot  but I thought at least her date a social worker would have been given something more scintillating to say as an opening gambit. Then again I would have thought that a social worker who comes to a school to visit a troubled little boy would have brought his own sheet of paper for the boy to draw on... I loathed this movie  absolutely loathed it. The only reason I watched this ghastly thing through to the end was that I hoped  in vain  that the eternally annoying infantile and selfish Poppy would eventually be confronted with someone or some situation that would cause her to reevaluate her approach to life and then to go back and apologize to each person that she had irritated with her outrageously inane behavior.Save yourself the two hours  this lame excuse of a movie isn't worth it.".

It is hinted that she and her roommate have a lesbian relationship but it is never brought into specific relief.6. She has an encounter with a deranged homeless man but nothing further is shown.Poppy seems to be perpetually chuckling to some private inner joke that she does not share with the world or the viewer.

	schema:reviewBody "Whenever I meet people who seem to be happy all the time I wonder if they are crazy or if they just know something I don't. While I don't get them I'm still fascinated by people like this which is why I went to see this film.I found this film to be disappointing. I read great reviews and from the trailer it looked like it would be lots of fun. While I thought Hawkins did a good job in the role and in fact all the acting was good in my opinion I failed to see the point of the story. Yes Poppy is always happy giggly and positive and feels it's her duty to brighten the days of others and allow them to see life from her point of view. This doesn't really seem to work very well from the clerk in the book store to the homeless man to her sister to Scott the belligerent driving instructor. All she seemed to do was irritate these people for being so insanely chipper and wanting to force her cheeriness onto others and fault them for not seeing life the same way. I found HER annoying in this respect.I honestly felt if she DID have a real effect on those people and DID somehow brighten their lives by just being around then the story would have made more sense. I felt Poppy was genuinely kind sweet and childlike however she WAS selfish as Scott pointed out and did have a real need to be adored. She was immature and disrespectful during all her lessons which angered Scott while feeling that she was just being happy and sweet. There are times for jokes and there are times to be a bit serious. If you're mocking another person and what they do don't expect them to be happy with you.In the movie Closer Jude Law's character tells Clive Owens character that everyone wants to be happy to which Clive Owen's character responds depressed people don't want to be happy. They WANT to be depressed. I kept thinking of that scene after leaving happy go lucky. Poppy's view of life works for HER but doesn't work for everyone and is not everyones or most people's true nature. While someone who IS so happy might want to impart their wisdom onto others maybe these people don't want to be educted as to how to see things differently.".

Yes it might be funny if this attitude was not so utterly common and so deeply connected with almost every major issue facing the planet today.But still maybe a good movie could be made on such a premise but alas More than half the movie consists of the very annoying main character either chatting inanely with her friends or turning every single comment by anyone else into a joke which only she could possibly find funny.Yet there seem to be many reviewers here who somehow think that she is inspiring and her attitude something to aspire to but I would argue that maybe they are confusing the strained positivity of ignorance with the peace of mind that comes with wisdom yet they are at opposite ends of the spectrum.Anyway save your time unless it is indeed your goal to be an always positive airhead.".

If Poppy can be said to stroll across the surface of life's duckpond without even getting the soles of her cowboy boots wet then Scott is a man slowly drowning. The film's strongest plot line this is Mike Leigh! charts the evolving relationship between these apparent oppositesand the interplay really lights up the screen.To say more would dent your enjoyment should you decide to go and see for yourself!

Second the main character's approach to a problem with a bully in the class she teaches ends up appearing to have more to do with the physical attraction she has for the male social worker that comes to help than it does with the tragedy of the bully being physically abused at home. Third the main character's runin with a mentally ill homeless man on her way home one night seems to be more about satisfying her own superficial curiosity than it does her interest in learning anything about the human condition. And fourth the main character's final encounter with her driving instructor seems more evident of her total lack of previous insight than it does her ability to be able to reach out to a tortured soul.I guess what I disliked most about the movie is that these four key plot points appear to be put in the movie to try to make us believe the main character Poppy was not just a flighty party girl but had some depth of spirit that we could emulate. I hope nobody emulates Poppy. Even though I think it is important to be happy in this world it is more important to be happy for the right reasons. True happiness goes to the core of the soul.

The other star was for Eddie Marsan's acting although he was wasted in this drivel. As for the character of Poppy trying to make the world a 'happier' place maybe she should try listening to people instead of her constant snickering and mocking attitude. Words cannot express how much I loathed this film but then I've always hated people who say cheer up it may never happen. Next time someone says that to me I'll reply with it already has I watched HappyGoLucky.".

She gets a boyfriend her friends are married most are not she gets on moderately well with her family some members more than others. It could be anybody. And if that's all that it is then this movie deserves a 3 it wouldn't show you something you didn't know or make you think more about something you thought didn't need any more thinking about. It would just rollby its celluloid flicker stealing 90 minutes and 7 you could have spent on learning or doing or making. Some critics have praised this movie simply because it's less relentlessly sad than others Leigh has shot. But failing to be sad doesn't in fact warrant a good review.Some reviewers suggest that through the gauzy veil that is Sally Hawkin's Poppy Mike Leigh reveals basic truths. That is indeed what the movie has to stand and fall on Does it allow us to see the world or at least 'a world' in the grain of sand which is Poppy's week?Unfortunately these other reviewer's don't identify the truths that are supposedly revealed. That I suggest is because none are.Leigh shows us a driving instructor who is angry and blames schools for being leftbrained and society for being irresponsible and liberal...In other words he blames single careless Poppy for the state of his world. Is he perhaps right? This is after all the world in which Poppy is currently happy. Poppy bends her lip empathetically when her bike is stolen didn't get a chance to say good bye. Theft doesn't matter then. Her sister suggests that a woman who at thirty has not had children or gotten married or even a pension might be in for a lessthanhappy old age. This is a massive social change perhaps one of two big changes of the century. The thought's worth considering but Leigh doesn't reveal a truth about whether or how this might matter for Poppy or for culture. Poppy's sister is pretty anal and angry too. There's a pattern here It seems that people being conventional in Poppy's carefree childless unattached world are going to be angry.Poppy is of course attached in many ways  enter her inner London school where half the kids are born of foreign parents and the average skin colour would resemble cup of hot chocolate. But we don't see violence crime and educational failure which are crippling these schools and their kids  just a nice white boy who rather gently whacks his black classmate because we learn through Poppy's new boyfriend to be cum social worker his mum's got a new boyfriend. Poppy's happy And in Poppy's world to disagree with Poppy or her friends is to risk having the police called  you're dangerous.".

She is an unexpectedly cute cross between Michaela Strachan and Frank Spencer. Thankfully there's no beret but there are plenty of knockabout gags which when coupled with Poppy's infectious giggling and quick asides had the audience laughing along quite genuinely. Characters come and go throughout the movie with an especially good performance from Stanley Townsend but it's Eddie Marsan who gives the stand out performance in the movie with his darkly obsessive narratives and non sequiturs which expose his sinister persona. The rest of the cast are also splendid they all fit in just right to make this a very watchable and enjoyable movie. Even the two dimensional characters have good aspects for which they are easily forgiven. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending people to this movie my only complaint being that it was over too soon. I could have watched how the characters developed for another day or two and I guess that's down to the fascination with the ordinary which Mike Leigh builds into his films.".

	schema:headline " A shining occasion for modern cinema HappyGoLucky welcomely explores a range of emotions and themes.";
	schema:reviewBody "On first impression Mike Leigh's new film feels like a lighthearted simpleminded and a briefly delightful flick. But when it comes to Leigh you should enter with the assumption that you will leave drained from all other thoughts. HappyGoLucky is no different. However it has certainly got a balanced amount of comedic and dramatic elements each outweighing each other once present on screen. The naturalistic and fast paced dialogue intertwined with slang and theory with wit and sarcasm is contained for an intense joyful and powerful viewing. Harsh and realistic danger is presented for emotional enhancement rather than the exaggerated situations in the conventional Hollywood film. We are set with a protagonist and remain with her to the end plus the pleasant charm of the British culture entwined.Sally Hawkins shines as the lead Poppy in one of the best performances of the year a seemingly naive extrovert with a very expressive and optimistic attitude towards life and all her hardships. She laughs at unfortunate events that she suffers such as getting her bicycle  her form of personal transport of which she enjoys to wave at people whilst riding  stolen as if it were a cruel irony and she gets the joke. This upbeat spirit is rarely broken even if the polar opposite of attitudes comes into contact with her unless taken to the absolute limit. She is an inviting figure one that which desires to inspire her mood and thoughts on life. In doing so she becomes a primary teacher when the mind is at it's spongiest. There is a scene where she experiments creativity with her long term roommate Zoe Alexis Zegerman in the form of cardboard boxes and more materials to make a birdlike costume. Poppy is the definitive authority figure in the film. To match her personality is the excessive clothes with often delicate unnecessary items just to provide bright colours in the darkest of hues in the scenes. This brightness transcends her performance and makes her my absolute favourite leading performance of the year.The most expressive supporting performance comes from Eddie Marsan as Scott Poppy's driving instructor. However his character is the opposite to Poppy's always agitated and enraged when flaws occur. His character does not mix with her at all. The driving scenes are the utmost emotionally engaging scenes in the entire film and form the structure of routine giving a basis and understanding of the time frame therefore the development the characters go about in their relationships with each other  especially since they meet during his last shift so he wants to escape the working mode and enter the more relaxing mode of no responsibility. Scott constantly misinterprets Poppy's actions as if she's sexually teasing him for her pleasure or patronizing his behaviour. During their rather short journeys of stopping starting arguing repeating explanations  the tension really builds up. Every time Scott's rage is starting to show Poppy strikes him down with a joke to calm him or maybe herself. HappyGoLucky had the power to make a grin evolve across my face then wipe it straight off again within the same shot. Her comfort is very limited and only appears again with the most prominent support of Zoe a wonderfully sarcastic performance which is an absolute joy to see every time  even more so than her family that do appear not necessarily in an agreeable situation. There is also a rather striking and bleak scene in which Poppy encounters a tramp played by Stanley Townsend where he confronts her in a strange gibberish without a seeming understanding of his correct surroundings. This hobo is a symbolism of freedom of complete and utter creativity with his language and imagination. When Poppy is presented with this person she is in a state of confusion as what to do.This is the whole point of the film. Authority Poppy with it's intimidating and overbearing behaviour overtakes that of the weaker society the children so fills their views when they'll most likely take it in without hassle and live by these thoughts. Despite allowing the children to express themselves through the medium of products she is still controlling them and not allowing complete freedom yes on the outside they may all be different but technically they are all birdcostumes  therefore she is not able to properly inspire the creativity she wishes to do so. However once presented with a form of society that has matured and developed their own opinions and morals it is more difficult to get through to them  hence the firmer attitude Poppy has to resort to in order to get Scott this figure of society to conform. The flaws become more prominent once authority is unable to abide by their own rules to make society work which is shown during the dance classes as she is clearly out of time with everyone and making up her own moves. Or a simpler interpretation and a completely valid one is that Poppy is a child at heart therefore her desire to work with children and therefore her dependence on the older flatmate and the fact she prefers to use a nickname as apposed to her real name Pauline. Or possibly willfully ignorant.Other than Sally Hawkins incredible performance HappyGoLucky's strength comes from the balanced script cinematography and editing with the ability to achieve a range of tones therefore reactions from the viewer. Natural and sharp dialogue makes for always compelling and entertaining viewing. The colour is pure eye candy with bright bold shapes and no hues between the colours giving the film personality within itself  without the help of Sally Hawkins. The score adds to the delight with a bubbly mix of string and jazz reflecting the main characters. Although I completely understand how someone can find these irritable I however find them an absolute joy never wanting the intense rewarding enriching and enlightening experience to end.910".

	schema:headline " Infectious cheerfulness? Or masked sadness and misery.";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this in the theater on a weekday matine when there was one other patron a middleaged lady sitting across the aisle from me who kept dropping things loudly. Somehow this added to the experience of the film which is about a positively positive young woman Poppy Sally Hawkins just brilliant who just won't let anything stand in her way of enjoying her life and loving everyone in it as much as she can  until she meets her antihuman match in Scott Eric Marsan a frighteningly angry racist and sexist driving instructor who probably ought to be locked up or at least not having such contact with the general public. Poppy's a working class girl in Mike Leigh's modernday London and that means full of quirks and foibles and not in the least bit glamorous or obvious much of the charm in the film as in most of the Leigh films I've seen is in not knowing what's going to come next except that it will be unusual  but never untrue.Poppy has a couple of sisters a best friend and the beginnings of a relationship to contend with along with her crazy driver training class necessitated by the theft of her bike through typical carelessness in the first scene and she navigates all of them with her chin up  though never with her brain turned off. I'm sure there are some who will be very irritated with this blast of sun through the rainbow but speaking as a depressive who typically hates Pollyanna characters  I just loved her  and the film.At the end when Poppy and Scott have hit a point of no return my emotions really went through the ringer  and I think I started to see what Poppy was missing and that perhaps she knew that she was missing it. Her failure to understand misery is in some ways just as limiting to her understanding of other people and the world as Scott's inability to ever forget it though it's much less destructive. As she goes for a boat ride I'm reminded of Jacques Rivette's Celine and Julie Go Boating a fantasy different in almost every respect from this dose of hard reality and broad humor  but I think that Poppy like the characters in that film knows that she's in some ways living in a fantasy world of her own making. And maybe given some of the alternatives that's not such an awful thing.".

Poppy's a working class girl in Mike Leigh's modernday London and that means full of quirks and foibles and not in the least bit glamorous or obvious much of the charm in the film as in most of the Leigh films I've seen is in not knowing what's going to come next except that it will be unusual  but never untrue.Poppy has a couple of sisters a best friend and the beginnings of a relationship to contend with along with her crazy driver training class necessitated by the theft of her bike through typical carelessness in the first scene and she navigates all of them with her chin up  though never with her brain turned off. I'm sure there are some who will be very irritated with this blast of sun through the rainbow but speaking as a depressive who typically hates Pollyanna characters  I just loved her  and the film.At the end when Poppy and Scott have hit a point of no return my emotions really went through the ringer  and I think I started to see what Poppy was missing and that perhaps she knew that she was missing it. Her failure to understand misery is in some ways just as limiting to her understanding of other people and the world as Scott's inability to ever forget it though it's much less destructive. As she goes for a boat ride I'm reminded of Jacques Rivette's Celine and Julie Go Boating a fantasy different in almost every respect from this dose of hard reality and broad humor  but I think that Poppy like the characters in that film knows that she's in some ways living in a fantasy world of her own making. And maybe given some of the alternatives that's not such an awful thing.";

	schema:headline " A sprightly and optimistic little film";
	schema:reviewBody "If ever a film was wonderfully summarised in a title it is HappyGoLucky. Those five syllables perfect describe the light and breezy tone of this film and quite possibly how you will feel as you leave the cinema. This is a movie that admirably celebrates optimism which I for one found a nice relief in an age where even Hollywood blockbusters strive to be dark and cynical.At first I didn't really think I was going to enjoy HappyGoLucky. The opening few minutes have a couple of attempts at humour that fall rather flat not really a positive sign in a comedydrama. And then there is a sequence illustrating a stereotypical painful night out the drunken ramblings of a coven of irritating witches prove to be an instant turnoff that creates little sympathy towards Poppy our chirpy protagonist.But luckily HappyGoLucky is a slow burner it just takes a little while to adjust to Poppy's world. It is Poppy or Pauline herself that will likely begin to conjure up some goodwill. Her cheery often illogical optimism is a difficult trait to pull off but Sally Hawkins gives a truly exceptional performance. Poppy is an oddity in London a woman who has decided to be endlessly upbeat in a city of dreariness and unfriendliness. Her primary coloured clothes are in sharp contrast to the grey apathetic streets and people around her while her constant attempts at light humour and banter are often dismissed by those she tries to cheer up. Admittedly she does often come across as annoying and excessive but this simply strengthens her character she is a solid mix of likable quirks and annoying habits. Her goodwill even in the most difficult of situations one sequence where she attempts to talk to a homeless drunkard sticks out becomes endearing and you may well find yourself cheering her on sooner than expected. She is a multilayered character her motivations admirable her outlook likable. Most importantly she is a very strong independent person who is entirely happy with her life and the character is more than capable of holding the film together. Hawkins' portrayal works brilliantly and her performance is one of the most charming and memorable in quite some time.Poppy holds the story together and it is a great relief that her character is so compelling as the narrative relies on her completely. Indeed the 'story' is almost nonexistent and is simply a few chapters in the day to day life of our protagonist. The film simply comprises of a number of vignettes in Poppy's life. It documents her daytoday encounters dealing with a troubled boy in the class she teaches her bizarre dancing lessons her sojourns with an intense driving instructor. More than anything these minitales try and portray the way in which Poppy tries to retain her optimism in the face of an often bleak reality. Perhaps the central story is the one focusing on her driving lessons with a racist emotionally fragile instructor. These Saturday excursions are the best examples of the film's thematic concerns the difficulty of remaining optimistic in a pessimistic world. While Poppy's refusal to drop her friendly mannerisms often put her at risk ultimately her cheery attitude keeps her safe and wins over the many other characters she encounters. Director Mike Leigh seemingly urges the audience to try and be friendly in an increasingly unfriendly world through his sympathetic portrayal of Polly which seems to me to be an entirely refreshing moral! There are dark hints throughout the film there are subtle references to child abuse alcoholism obsession and other bleak issues. But these are an integral part of the film that reinforce the general happy mood. The cinematography reinforces this  often quite subtle it makes terrific use of colour to give Poppy a central presence. Her multicoloured clothing and her flatmate's yellow car make her stand out instantly. It is also quite a funny little movie when it wants to be the humour is quirky and offbeat but Leigh will likely succeed in making you laugh through his bizarre characters and situations. Driving instructor Scott's repeated refrain of Enraha is a great running joke while the sometimes ridiculous mannerisms of Poppy are often good for a chuckle.There are one or two issues that should be raised. Some of the sequences seem a little redundant in particular a finalact romance that seems somewhat surplus to requirements although it is thankfully brief. The ancillary characters sometimes seem to lack depth Poppy's younger sister in particular. And the previously mentioned weak start is an obstacle that has to be overcome to reveal the real depth and subtlety the film has to offer.HappyGoLucky is a sprightly little film that is a truly uplifting experience. True a fantastically realised lead character it has a lot to say about the increasing depersonalisation of contemporary society. The messages are subtle and careful despite the excessiveness of Poppy. The film is far deeper than appearances may suggest and while it is a very enjoyable two hours it also lends itself to more detail examination. Catch this in the right mood and HappyGoLucky's big heart symbolised by Poppy's necklace may just win you over.".

In fact you'll probably fall in love with her which is what director Mike Leigh says he thinks anyone of any sense would do.Personally I found Poppy moronic grating and generally pretty insufferable  but then I'd probably feel the same about anyone who never shuts up who never stops giggling and who even smiles goofily when at the start of the film she discovers her bicycle's been stolen. Maybe her penchant for throwing back her head and whinnying with laughter no matter what the situation is philosophically commendable and maybe she's a living saint the movie would like us to think so but she brings out the sourpuss in me the impatient adult that wants to say Grow up and Keep quiet and Get serious. Mike Leigh famously makes improvisational films which is one reason actors enjoy working with him. And some of his films  TopsyTurvy Career Girls maybe Secrets and Lies  are among my favorites. Yet he's also made some of the most tiresome and preachy films and stage plays I've ever had to sit through. This one  and I'm relying in part on interviews with Leigh and the cast  clearly endorses Poppy's worldview she's seen as a Free Spirit and praised for her unjudgmental friendliness openness emotional generosity compassion love enlightenment blah blah blah. To me she typifies a sort of squishy letmegiveyouahug attitude that pervades the modern British nanny state.It's interesting that Eddie Marsan's character who doesn't fit in and who expresses disapproval of things like modernday moral slackness multiculturalism and lack of discipline is soon revealed as a complete malcontent paranoid and conspiracy nut. Leigh's rightofcenter characters all tend to be caricatures.As if to accentuate the relentlessly saccharine tone of the film it is punctuated by a horribly winsome indieish flute soundtrack that seems to stand back and declare as we watch Poppy flutter about London Awww ain't she just the cutest thing? By the way Sally Hawkins herself the actress IS awfully cute I remember being quite intrigued by her in one of the director's dreariest movies All or Nothing and I strongly suspect judging from things he's said that the middleaged Leigh has more or less fallen for her  which is God knows understandable  and has created this movie to celebrate and expand upon a certain happygolucky aspect of Hawkins's own personality. I can't help wishing that instead of inflicting this movie on us he'd contented himself with simply having an affair with her.".

	schema:headline " Poppy needs to be popped";
	schema:reviewBody "Insufferable is what my roommate said as we left Mike Leigh's new film HappyGoLucky. Funny the word that kept popping up in my head throughout was Unbearable. I guess we were both right.I had just finished reading Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's and patently was in the mood for something that possessed such easy levity. HappyGoLucky seemed just right. What I would later learnabout five minutes into Happyis that the film is far closer in tone concept and subject matter to the opening pages of The Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers in which an extroverted Sister Bear can't quite grasp the concept that the rest of the world isn't nearly as nice as she and that whether she knows or not or cares or not there are indeed bad people in the world who are not immediately her friends.And this seems to be the sameand onlyproblem with which the main character of Happy must contend. Played with hyperbolic espiegle that makes you want to slap her in the face on more than one occasion relative novice Sally Hawkins is Poppy a 30yearold primary school teacher who can't stop smiling giggling idiotically and talking to everyone around her no matter if theyor wereally want to hear her or not. The film opens with Poppy popping poppedly into a staid bookstore. Even though she tells the lone worker in the store that she's glad to be inside from the crazy chaos of the city the worker wants yet more serene silence than she choosing to elide her comments until she finally after about ten minutes of nonstop yammering gets the point that someone like she probably belongs out in the noisy world that doesn't seem to stop or shut up.It's all pretty much downhill from there as we see Poppy dance lithely around the world in her obnoxious gogo boots that even her pugilistic racist Christian fundamentalist driving instructor chastises her about time and time again as being inappropriate both for driving and for mature adulthood in general. He may have a point but it's the jabbing and insistent force of said point that earns the driver an absolutely irritating Eddie Marsen one of the high marks that led us to leaving about 20 minutes early from this stinker. This becomes the main crux of the film that literally up until we leftat a good hour or more into the picturehad no kind of discernible conflict whatsoever aside from the obnoxiously swelling score that makes one dizzy and overwhelmed with nausea. Each scene gives us another long and droning glimpse into the life of this gelastic clown who has decided that there's no need to either grow up or to leave alone people who already have. She's either fascistically and maniacally doing all she can to get a smile out of everyone around her no matter if they want to or she's externalizing some superficial selfrighteous sense of evermoreplayful sympathy for people who deserve if nothing else far less.The most offensive moment of such gratuitous compassion is when Poppy as though she were some kind of bubbleheaded progressive college kid or again Sister Bear decides to follow the sounds of a raving derelict deep into the industrial wasteland under a bridge where she finds said derelict sitting filthily amidst some trash.

	onyx:emotionText "Insufferable is what my roommate said as we left Mike Leigh's new film HappyGoLucky. Funny the word that kept popping up in my head throughout was Unbearable. I guess we were both right.I had just finished reading Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's and patently was in the mood for something that possessed such easy levity. HappyGoLucky seemed just right. What I would later learnabout five minutes into Happyis that the film is far closer in tone concept and subject matter to the opening pages of The Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers in which an extroverted Sister Bear can't quite grasp the concept that the rest of the world isn't nearly as nice as she and that whether she knows or not or cares or not there are indeed bad people in the world who are not immediately her friends.And this seems to be the sameand onlyproblem with which the main character of Happy must contend. Played with hyperbolic espiegle that makes you want to slap her in the face on more than one occasion relative novice Sally Hawkins is Poppy a 30yearold primary school teacher who can't stop smiling giggling idiotically and talking to everyone around her no matter if theyor wereally want to hear her or not. The film opens with Poppy popping poppedly into a staid bookstore. Even though she tells the lone worker in the store that she's glad to be inside from the crazy chaos of the city the worker wants yet more serene silence than she choosing to elide her comments until she finally after about ten minutes of nonstop yammering gets the point that someone like she probably belongs out in the noisy world that doesn't seem to stop or shut up.It's all pretty much downhill from there as we see Poppy dance lithely around the world in her obnoxious gogo boots that even her pugilistic racist Christian fundamentalist driving instructor chastises her about time and time again as being inappropriate both for driving and for mature adulthood in general.

	schema:headline " Giant success";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on a novel by Edna Ferber Giant is an appropriately Texassized westerngenerational saga that parallels familial evolution with the changing socioeconomic nature of the United States over an approximately 30year period from the 1920s through the film's present and by extension a turn of the 20th century mentality segueing into a more contemporary outlook. It is filled with excellent writing fabulous direction and technical elements outstanding performances gorgeous photography and plenty of depth via subtly implied philosophical ideas.At its heart Giant is the story of Jordan Bick Benedict Rock Hudson heir along with his sister Luz Mercedes McCambridge to a family cattle ranch that exceeds half a million acres. As the film opens Bick has traveled to Maryland ostensibly to purchase a horse from Dr. Horace Lynnton who has a sizeable ranch of his own but also perhaps to search for a wife. Whether the latter was his initial intention or not he ends up finding a spouse in Dr. Lynnton's opinionated and somewhat irascible but beautiful daughter Leslie Elizabeth Taylor. Bick moves Leslie from the rolling green pastures that she calls home to the huge dusty plains of Reata his Texas ranch.In the process she ends up turning his world upside down. Luz sees Leslie as a threat to their routine an interpretation that Leslie doesn't exactly try to deny. Leslie integrates herself into the daily workings of Reata and initiates changes in the way Bick and Luz behave towards their mostly Mexican staff among other things. Bick and Leslie have children but they're not exactly keen on following the family tradition. Other challenges and perhaps the strongest cultural change in the film comes via Jett Rink James Dean who goes through a gradual transformation from his early status in the film as a dirtpoor uneducated ranch hand.At a three and a halfhour running time and covering decades in the lives of many different characters Giant is nothing if not sprawling. But this is the kind of sprawl that works. Unlike most sprawling films the cast of characters in Giant actually turns out to be relatively small we always have a clear idea of who each character is and every event leads to the next in a very tightlywritten logical manner.In fact one of the more unusual but laudable aspects of Fred Guiol and Ivan Moffat's script is the way that characters will mention something in an almost offthecuff manner before we immediately cut to the full realization of the previous comment. For example Leslie and Bick are barely courting before we see them married. Other examplesLeslie goes from telling Bick that she's pregnant to having the baby in the next instant Bick says that he's going to fly in a plane low over a particular hoteljust for dramatic effect with respect to a certain characterand in the next shot this is just what he's doing. The first couple times this happens it's almost a bit unnerving because of its uniqueness. We figure that the characters are in the middle of a dream sequence. But it quickly becomes apparent that the device is designed to enable large time span passages in an instant and for the overall structure of the film it works perfectly.Given that structure it was also unusual in this era to pick younger actors who would then have to be aged 30 years or so the more standard procedure was to pick middle aged actors who could be made both younger and older through makeup and lighting. But Hudson Taylor and Dean are perfect. Dean is especially impressive as he undergoes the most significant transformation. All three of his major films are almost heartbreaking to watch he was an incredible talent but didn't have a chance to do much with it before he tragically passed away. But all three principal cast members are at the top of their game here each is able to do a bit of scene stealing if they want. It creates a lot of energy throughout the film and enhances the occasional tensions in the script.The smaller roles are perfectly filled as well. I was particularly amused with Dennis Hopper among the supporting cast. Hopper portrays Bick and Leslie's son Jordan III. This was his first major role and he meshes well but at the same time you can easily see the more infamous Hopper ala Easy Rider's 1969 Billy Blue Velvet's 1986 Frank Booth or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2's 1986 Lieutenant Lefty Enright.The cinematography and production design are consistently beautiful. The stark Texas landscapes filmed primarily in the town of Marfa couldn't have more impact. The Benedict home is oddly Gothic and a bit eerie in its exterior especially postPsycho 1960 and lushly gorgeous and Victorian inside. Later scenes give the interior a redecoration to match changing fashions.Giant is extremely engaging in its soapoperatic family drama but just as captivating for its subtle handling of important social themes. Leslie's respect for the Mexican ranch hands and servants parallels the slowly and occasionally painfully evolving public opinion about different ethnicities that is still developing. She also tries her best to usher in a bit of woman's liberation openmindedness in child rearing and many other progressive attitudes. She's a symbol in some ways of Northeastern U.S. thinking filtering across the country in the early part of the 20th Century.Giant is heavy on symbolism in many ways. Jett Rink's newfound fortune isn't just a personal transformation but it symbolizes changing technology and the necessary adaptations to remain viable economically it's a move away from a more agrarian existence. There is also pithy commentary on World War IIjust look at who returns in one piece and who doesn't and the different attitudes towards this.It would probably take a book to just give an adequate analysis of this film. It goes without saying that you need to see Giant if you haven't already.".

	schema:reviewBody "Giant is a sometimes forgotten masterpiece which is remembered for its massive budget becoming the most expensive movie ever made at that time and of course James Dean's death during the final stages of production. All the substories during the making of this film overshadow the fact that this is easily one of the top ten movies ever made. Definitely in the class with epics like Gone With the Wind and Lawrence of Arabia Giant is a 200minute symphony of a movie about the life of a Texas cattle rancher Oscarnominee Rock Hudson and his wife from the East Coast Elizabeth Taylor. Immediately following their marriage Hudson's older sister Mercedes McCambridge Oscarnominated dies after falling off the same horse that Hudson had bought from Taylor's father. Disgusted with the fact that Hudson had married Taylor McCambridge had decided to leave a small part of her land to quiet cowhand James Dean in his finest performance garnering him his second consecutive posthumous Oscar nomination. Hudson is advised to buy the land from Dean but Dean refuses to sell. Now Dean is trying to strike oil and is ultimately successful. He becomes a huge oil baron and one of the richest and most powerful men in Texas. Hudson continues to make money as well but eventually has to swallow his pride and become a wildcatter himself. The hate and friction between Hudson and Dean is sure to lead to fireworks for all associated with the two volatile men. Secretly Dean has always loved Taylor and even goes so far as to try and get with Taylor's youngest daughter a brilliant turn by Carroll Baker. Dean is trying to substitute Baker for the lover he has always had for Taylor. By this time Dean is well in his 50s due to heavy makeup but he is trying to capture the failed dreams of his youth. Ultimately Dean has everything except the one thing he really wanted. He lacks love in his life and he suffers miserably through as the film progresses. The older twin children of Hudson and Taylor's both grow up to go in very different directions. The daughter Fran Bennett marries and wants to run the ranch to Hudson's approval and Taylor's dismay. However the son a very young Dennis Hopper marries a Hispanic woman very taboo back in those days and wants to go north to become a doctor. Of course Hudson is outraged at this development and nearly disowns Hopper all together. Hudson then decides that Bennett's new husband Earl Holliman may be the best for the job. Holliman though is immediately drafted into World War II along with Hispanic laborer Sal Mineo. Hudson worries about change after he passes away but he eventually learns that most of the things he obsesses about are not as important as other matters. Equality for females and Hispanic Americans are major messages throughout here. Much like novelist Edna Ferber's equally excellent Cimarron which dealt with sexism and racism toward Native and AfricanAmericans in Oklahoma Giant paints a wonderfully complex picture of humanistic relationships from varying cinematic angles. Overall Giant is a huge motion picture that is so smart multilayered and deepthinking that it requires over three hours to tell the entire story. Everything here is so magnificent. The Oscarwinning direction by George Stevens the screenplay the art direction the editing the costume design the makeup the sound and the original musical score are all superb. Almost every actor does the best work of their respective careers as well. James Dean and Rock Hudson are the best. Mercedes McCambridge albeit in a very small role is super. Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker Baker even received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in 1956 for Baby Doll both show amazing range at their very young ages. Chill Wills who plays Hudson's old wise uncle and Elizabeth Taylor give stellar performances as always. Overlooked in 1956 the unmemorable Around the World in 80 Days won the Best Picture Oscar Giant is easily the best film from that weak year and is ranked as the best movie of that decade in my book. One of the most excellent productions of all time. 5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:headline " A beautiful sweeping epic";
	schema:reviewBody "George Stevens' 1956 epic Giant is the story of the Jordan Benedict Rock Hudson the male heir to one of the largest cattle ranching families in Texas. At the start of the film we see Jordan traveling to Maryland to look at a horse he is interested in purchasing There he meets Leslie Elizabeth Taylor the daughter of the man he is purchasing the horse from and the unofficial owner of the horse and immediately falls in love with her. The feeling is mutual so after an incredibly brief two day courtship they marry and he brings her back to his ranch in Texas Reatta. At first life on the ranch is tough particularly while dealing with Jordan's overprotective nononsense sister Luz. Mercedes McCambridge Leslie soon adjusts however and the two of them start a family. Meanwhile Jordan is at constant odds with one of his ranch hands Jet Rink James Dean whom he always wants to fire but is eternally protected by Luz. When Luz unexpectedly dies Jet is ready to walk off the ranch for good but discovers that Luz has bequeathed a parcel of the land to him. Partly to tick Jordan off partly for his respect for Luz and partly so that he can have something for himself Jett eschews Jordan's cash buyout and instead sets up a homestead on the land. Five years later Jet strikes oil and soon he is again at odds with the Benedicts as Jet having become one of the richest men in Texas wants to buy out Reatta while Jordan wants to keep the ranch for cattle raising and most importantly  to keep it in the family. The next 1520 years are spent raising their children and trying to cope with a changing family dynamic one where the children may not want to adhere to the roles that have been preattributed to them a struggle that is particularly hard for their son Jordan III Dennis Hopper because as the sole male heir his dream of becoming a doctor is seemingly out of the question. Giant is about life and the everchanging role of the American family.Giant is a very long film about three and a half hours but this time frame is necessary because the story is so rich. Despite its running time there are no pacing issues and no real superfluous scenes. The cinematography is lush and rich I never really thought Texas to be all that intriguing but William C. Mellor's photography was exquisite. The performances by the principals were very good particularly since they had to age 25 years in the film. This wasn't a mere makeup job you could feel the aging in the way they carried themselves and their facial expressions. James Dean in particular perhaps because he had such a fascinating character was stunning. Jet Rink is a complex character and Dean really worked the role fantastically. I was also impressed considering the overly idealistic Hollywood of the 1950's that Giant while ending on a happy note did not compromise its characters in any way to achieve its ending. Jordan for example is typical oldguard Texas and therefore looks down on Mexicans. When his son marries one he has marginal acceptance and is always polite but even after engaging in a fight to defend the honor of his grandson he still expresses his woe that his grandson is who he is. Also Leslie is an unabashed freethinker who often challenges the Texas traditions much to Jordan's chagrin. Throughout their years together however she does not compromise her views and need to express them. I really liked this about the film because it is rare for the time particularly when the genre is melodrama.I really liked this film though when recommending it have to caution because of the sheer length of the film. Watching Giant is an investment of time but it is certainly a worthwhile investment. 710 Shelly".

	schema:headline " The Eyes of Texas";
	schema:reviewBody "I am of the opinion that it is impossible to make a bad film out of an Edna Ferber book. Her backgrounds are epic and she creates characters who fill the backgrounds that their stories take place.Such is the case of Giant and the story of Bick Benedict Leslie Lynnton and Jett Rink and all the Texans here native and transplanted. Giant's story begins with Bick Benedict coming to Maryland to buy a prize stallion and in a whirlwind courtship marrying and bringing back the stallion and it's owner as well who becomes Leslie Lynnton.Benedict as played by Rock Hudson is coowner with his sister Mercedes McCambridge of one large piece of Texas real estate named Reata which makes the Ponderosa look like a homestead. 595000 acres Hudson modestly states to the Lynnton guests at dinner. He's also incurred the jealousy of one of his ranch hands James Dean as Jett Rink who envies Hudson in all things including his new bride.Hudson and Dean were both up for Best Actor in 1956 losing to Yul Brynner in The King and I but I've always felt that this was Elizabeth Taylor's film. Liz showed what she could do in George Stevens's A Place in the Sun and unfortunately she went back to MGM and got a bunch of films that were really beneath her talents. It was George Stevens again who even though he wanted Grace Kelly in the part first got a great performance out of Elizabeth Taylor. Although she's overawed at first by the Texans and their ways she warms gradually up to the role of mistress of Reata and brings a touch of compassion and humanity to Reata and its people.The leading man was also borrowed by Warner Brothers. Rock Hudson got his one and only Oscar nomination for this role. His character of Bick Benedict ages and grows in every way. Maybe because its Rock Hudson playing the part but I think it's Hudson innate and underrated skill as a player that makes you know there's a latent decency that's eventually going to overcome the bad things he was brought up with.Of course Giant marks the early tragic farewell of James Dean as player. In one terrible accident that claimed his life James Dean went from rebel actor to eternal legend. Jett Rink was the final piece of his performing career and only a hint of what we could have expected from him. He's a dirt poor ranch hand as poor as the Mexicans who mostly work at Reata but he doesn't identify with them at all. When he strikes it oil rich he's just put in a position where he can now inflict terrible things on those people he feels superior to.When film fans talk about Giant they talk about the differences between Hudson and Dean. Hudson starts out rich and prejudiced Dean is poor and prejudiced. Dean strikes it rich and becomes an oil billionaire but it's brought him no happiness just richer surroundings to be miserable in. The difference is that Hudson had Taylor and the children they both had. Their lives together Taylor's love and devotion and his children's respectful rebellion made him see things differently and grow as a person. If Dean had an Elizabeth Taylor things might have worked out better for him in a personal sense.George Stevens won the only Oscar that Giant got that year for Best Director. The allstar extravaganza Around the World in 80 Days won for Best Picture though I think Giant has stood the test of time a lot better. Then again Stevens had an Edna Ferber epic story to work from and as I said before you can't ever go wrong with one of her stories.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am of the opinion that it is impossible to make a bad film out of an Edna Ferber book. Her backgrounds are epic and she creates characters who fill the backgrounds that their stories take place.Such is the case of Giant and the story of Bick Benedict Leslie Lynnton and Jett Rink and all the Texans here native and transplanted. Giant's story begins with Bick Benedict coming to Maryland to buy a prize stallion and in a whirlwind courtship marrying and bringing back the stallion and it's owner as well who becomes Leslie Lynnton.Benedict as played by Rock Hudson is coowner with his sister Mercedes McCambridge of one large piece of Texas real estate named Reata which makes the Ponderosa look like a homestead. 595000 acres Hudson modestly states to the Lynnton guests at dinner. He's also incurred the jealousy of one of his ranch hands James Dean as Jett Rink who envies Hudson in all things including his new bride.Hudson and Dean were both up for Best Actor in 1956 losing to Yul Brynner in The King and I but I've always felt that this was Elizabeth Taylor's film. Liz showed what she could do in George Stevens's A Place in the Sun and unfortunately she went back to MGM and got a bunch of films that were really beneath her talents. It was George Stevens again who even though he wanted Grace Kelly in the part first got a great performance out of Elizabeth Taylor.

	schema:reviewBody "The opening of the movie sets the viewer up for a bit of a shock later on all those lush rolling green fields of Maryland give way to a desolate and bizarrely placed Gothic mansion in the middle of a Texas desert. One wonders what Leslie Benedict REALLY thought because she never let on that this might have been a mistake. But they say love is blind even if marriage is an eye opener. For my part I was left wondering what the cattle ate out there to stay nourished they certainly looked healthy. But of course that wasn't the point. Giant was one of the earliest epic bordering films to examine racial intolerance and present a strong independent woman and the scenes that play to those sentiments are the best in the story.I had only the faintest of knowledge about the film generally cited as a final showcase for one of it's stars James Dean. What surprised me the most was the presence of such a fine supporting cast behind Dean Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor. Mercedes McCambridge excels with limited screen time as Bick's Hudson manly sister while Carroll Baker and Dennis Hopper appear as the adult Benedict heirs each off in their own direction to the consternation of their father. It's always interesting to see Dennis Hopper especially in very young early roles to see how he developed his chameleon like ability to morph into virtually any type of characterization.It's fair to say that the movie's three plus hours virtually flies by and one wonders how long it could have gone if the film hadn't lopped off years between scenes. On the flip side that might also be the picture's greatest downside. Even though continuity is never lost it's somewhat disorienting to see a family age by almost a decade at a clip as there was plenty of room for additional character development in between. That's probably why more than once I thought that the picture might have benefited from a serialization of sorts along the lines of say Dallas other similarities notwithstanding. Is there any way to overlook the connection between Jett Rink's Dean prominent initials and those of the eldest son of the Ewing clan? The movie ties up a lot of connections by the time it's over like Jordy's Hopper 'Country Doctor' medical kit and his adult life's ambition. The best though came near the finale when Hudson's character Bick Benedict transcends his chauvinistic and bigoted past to take on the proprietor of 'Sarge's Place'. It was the redeeming moment worth waiting for set to martial music and inviting the viewer to cheer on the man who was getting his butt whipped. It's a scene that best captures the spirit of Giant as if defining each of it's principal players as a giant in their own right.".

It was a long yes but had some expansive impressive cinematography and had some bigname stars to watch in Rock Hudson Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean. I found it interesting at that time.When I revisited this film a few years after it was released on VHS my reaction was Wow have times changed. This is dragging now. That holds true even more so today in late 2007. This would be very very tough to sit through at the present and I mention it for those under 60 who have never seen it. They would probably have the same reaction. It was a different era and stories moved a lot slower than today..As I look back at all the soap operas that were on screen in the '50s this one looks so typical for its day. I expected affected fluff from Hudson and Taylor but I was disappointed in Dean's smaller role in this film. It was not memorable way for him to go out although nobody certainly knew a car accident would make this his last movie. If you want to remember Dean in a more positive light get the DVD of East Of Eden.Overall I still love George Stevens' direction and the photography  but you have to really love the melodramas the '50s to watch this thing in its entirety today. I never wound up really caring about these characters in here either. Maybe you have to be from Texas to relate. Methinks this film gets overrated because of the notoriety of its three stars  Hudson Taylor and Dean sounds like a law firm!.".

John Kobal's survey amongst 81 film critics in 1988 saw Robert Benayoun and Krzysztof Zanussi vote this one in as the 57th greatest film of all time.Rebel Without A Cause sees a cocky lesscontrolled performance from Dean and while being perhaps the weaker of the two is yet somehow more entertaining.That leaves Giant. A sprawling three hour plus tale of fueding Texan landowners it casts Dean in his final role as a villain who earns a fortune after land he is left in a will turns into an oil field. The fact that Dean's character is more likeable than the aggressive boastful Jordan Benedict portrayed by Hudson deflects the focus of the film as does the fact that it deals more with the HudsonTaylor domesticity rather than any clear narrative pull. A catchall coda dealing with racism is unneatly tagged on the end cementing the idea that this is a film about anything everything and nothing in particular a great deal of which could have profited by seeing the cuttingroom floor.Dean's salary had notably increased from the 12000 and 12500 of his first two major films to a pay of 22500 a generous fee at that time. This was however still notably short of the 175000 and 100000 paid to his costars Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson respectively. A harsh shoot for the actor disliked by almost all crew members except for Taylor his resentment towards the stern director caused him to display his displeasure by urinating in public places including the set. So driven was the Kubricklike George Stevens that he shot over 600000 feet of film with less than 5 making it to the finished product. In fact the record states that the petulant Dean gave Stevens a ride in his new car to celebrate the end of filming dropping him off with the words now that it's all over we don't have to bug each other anymore. Giant is certainly pacy despite it's threehour plus running time. Hudson and Taylor meet fall in love and get married all within the first twenty minutes. And it is kind of fun seeing the posthumouslyouted Hudson feigning interest in Liz. Production save for a few driving scenes using film backdrops is fine as is the direction and the mammoth sets. Of particular note is ambitious sense of scale when Dean's Jett Rink first discovers the oil massive plumes of the stuff spurting into the sky with great cinematic effect. Incidental music is of the period overblown and more suited to an MGM cartoon than a serious dramatic movie.Most importantly it lacks focus. There's hints that Dean's underwritten but decently played Jett Rink has affections for Liz's Leslie Benedict  and that the feeling is mutual. However this is never resolved and so we lose out on what could have given Jordan realistic motivation to hate Rink. It's interesting how the treacherous oil baron has his initials  J.R.  presented everywhere. Wouldn't have influenced a certain Dallas by any chance would it? Also of note is the fact that we never learn exactly why the film's called Giant in the first place unless it refers to Hudson's formidable 6'6 frame. If that's the only reason then I look forward to seeing the films he made after this  Tall Bloke and Big Bugger.Dean's final scene playing a defeated drunk is overdubbed by Nick Adams as the sound was inaudible and Dean had already died before completion. If Giant had not gained a certain notierity by being the final role of James Dean then it would be almost wholly without note. There is nothing inherently flawed with the picture but then neither is anything particularly right. Obvious parallels for its attempted epic scale are Gone With The Wind and in truth Giant lacks the substance to meet it's convictions. For the actors involved this would probably be looked back upon as a treadmill work a runofthemill average tale to be added to a CV but to be glossed over in favour of higherprofile endeavours. A filler an extra paycheck towards the mortgage. Rather a shame then that the death of one it's stars has given it a muchundeserved and morbid fascination.".

The main message of the movie is see how bad the rich white trash folks treats the poor wet backs. James Dean again was too young to act his way through the age makeup. It takes a good actor to pull off a convincing drunk and Dean was not up to that task either. Carroll Baker played her usual sex kitten roll. Dennis Hopper delivers a convincing and understated performance as the son. All in all this movie is too long too preachy and every segment of society is portrayed stereotypically. The movie could have ended when Jett Rink strikes oil. The last part with Rock and Liz trying to act like they were old is painful to watch.".

Powerful beautiful stuff the scene in which Bick's toughass sister tries to break Liz Taylor's horse is a triumph of filmmaking alternating between quick edits of the spurs digging in and a long shot of the horse bucking on the dusty ranch. The acting is too melodramatic the film is too long and occasionally the antiracist theme is a too obvious but the tremendous filmmaking here makes up for it.

	schema:reviewBody "This story of life in Texas over the course of 30 years is intriguing but it's very selfindulgent and I found the last hour to drag. I thought that covering a smaller period of time might have made the film more interesting but as a study of characters and change over such a long period of time I found it dull and selfindulgent.Some very good acting. I'd never seen Rock Hudson in a movie and he is a compelling actor. One can't take one's eyes off him even when his rancher Bick Benedict is a petulant or immature. Hudson conveys decency even though he is grounded in the racism of his region and try as he might finds this tough to overcome. Hudson conveys the internal conflict Benedict experiences superbly and I was very very impressed by him.Liz Taylor as young Eastern debutante Leslie Benedict charmed by Bick when he comes to buy her horse is smoldering in her liveliness. She is charmed by Bick but does not give an inch in standing up for her beliefs and what she thinks is right. It is the fundamental aspect of her character that attracts Bick and Jet Bink James Dean to her. Her unconditional love for Bick colored by her stubbornness enable her to survive and flourish far from home.James Dean as the humorously named Jett Rink is a ranchhand who is trusted by Luz Mercedes McCambridge. He is mercurial but knows the ins and outs of the ranch. Dean's performance here once again reminds us of what was taken from us with his death. In spite of his sudden electrifying fame he is able to portray a shy reserved ranch hand very well during the first twothirds of the film. When he rejects Bick's offer to buy him out choosing instead to remain possibly on a hunch about the contents of the land the course of the remainder of the film is set. Ultimately Jett strikes it rich but at great cost. Dean's performance as Jett during Jett's later years is excellent.Also excellent in the film is Mercedes McCambridge as Bick's tough masculine sister Luz who resents losing her status as the lady of the manor at Reata Dennis Hopper as the plucky principled eldest son of Bick and Leslie and Chill Wills as laconic uncle Bawley whose cool demeanor and counsel helps Bick and Leslie survive some tough times.As I said I found this movie overly long. If it had focused on a shorter time period and perhaps downplayed Jett's transformation or even have been made into two films I might be able to give it a higher mark but given its interminable nature and in spite of great acting from allcomers I can only give it six out of ten.".

	schema:headline " A True Hollywood Oddity";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers ahead. So what happens in Giant? Or rather what doesn't? PLOT POINT Handsome successful suit wearing Rock brings Liz back to his ranch to live forever. Immediately upon her arrival she meets James Dean a troubled boyishly handsome ranch hand closer to her age. QUESTION Will Liz find herself in a torrid love triangle forced to choose between these two very different but fascinating men? ANSWER Nope. She has little if any interest in Dean and only shares a few minutes of screen time with him. He does appear to be interested in her. But whatever is going on psychologically inside the Dean character isn't well dramatized on screen. He's mostly a mystery a withdrawn silent character. He does little if anything to actually try to win Liz's heart. At the end of the film he seems to suggest that his unrequited love for Liz drove all his actions and ruined his life. But given how little interest Liz took in him Dean ultimately comes off more like an emotionally immature lovesick teenager than some tragic figure. And the film doesn't even bother to give us a LizDean scene at the end to provide closure to this part of the story. PLOT POINT Upon her arrival Liz also meets Rock's strong willed sister. She's been the queen of the ranch up until now. QUESTION Will Liz and the sister fight over who is in charge of the ranch and Rock? ANSWER Nope. The sister dies shortly after Liz's arrival in a completely arbitrary random horse accident. PLOT POINT Dean inherits a small patch of land adjacent to Rock's ranch. QUESTION Will the two rivals now living side by side wage war with each other in an epic battle for control? ANSWER Nope. They mostly get along with only minor problems. When Dean's wealth reaches new heights Rock simply sells out. PLOT POINT Sal Mineo is introduced as a young man who is interested in ranch life unlike Rock's own kids. QUESTION Will Mineo in time become Rock's surrogate son and new ranch head? ANSWER Nope. Mineo is killed off screen during the war. The audience is subjected to a dull unnecessary five minute funeral scene for his character. While he was alive all of Mineo's scenes combined represented about two minutes of screen time. The film inexplicably spends more time on his funeral than it did on him! PLOT POINT Once grown Rock's and Liz's kids want to do things with their lives that are different from what their parents want for them. QUESTION Will these disagreements create conflict in the family? ANSWER Nope. Rock lets the kids follow their hearts. PLOT POINT Rock's Latino daughter in law is refused service in the salon in Dean's huge hotel. Rock takes this as a very personal insult to his family by Dean. The two men fight. QUESTION Does this represent a satisfying climax to the film?ANSWER Nope. Technically Rock is right. As the owner of the hotelsalon Dean is ultimately responsible for what goes on there. But Dean doesn't seem like a racist. He's never said or done anything racist during the film. Also Dean seems like an indifferent businessman more lucky than smart. It's unlikely that he was even aware that these racist policies were even in place. Dean's culpability here is weak at best and it seems like a tenuous foundation to build the climax of a three hour film on. PLOT POINT At the end of the film Rock and his family visit a diner. While there they notice that the owner refuses service to a Latino family one that Rock has never met and has no connection to whatsoever. QUESTION Rock fights the manager to express his outrage at the manager's racism and to convince him to change this policy. The music score swells. Does Rock win? Does the final scene offer any kind of satisfactory conclusion to this wouldbe epic story? ANSWER Nope. Rock loses and the diner will continue its racist policy. The film attempts to end on a happy note showing that Rock now cares about people of color. But Rock never expressed any racist views in any prior scene so this doesn't represent substantive character growth. His affection for Sal Mineo seemed to suggest a man with no race or class prejudices. Even if Rock had won it's just a conflict between two men at a diner. For a three hour film called Giant it feels like an oddly inconsequential ending.".

But whatever is going on psychologically inside the Dean character isn't well dramatized on screen. He's mostly a mystery a withdrawn silent character. He does little if anything to actually try to win Liz's heart. At the end of the film he seems to suggest that his unrequited love for Liz drove all his actions and ruined his life. But given how little interest Liz took in him Dean ultimately comes off more like an emotionally immature lovesick teenager than some tragic figure. And the film doesn't even bother to give us a LizDean scene at the end to provide closure to this part of the story. PLOT POINT Upon her arrival Liz also meets Rock's strong willed sister. She's been the queen of the ranch up until now. QUESTION Will Liz and the sister fight over who is in charge of the ranch and Rock? ANSWER Nope. The sister dies shortly after Liz's arrival in a completely arbitrary random horse accident. PLOT POINT Dean inherits a small patch of land adjacent to Rock's ranch. QUESTION Will the two rivals now living side by side wage war with each other in an epic battle for control? ANSWER Nope. They mostly get along with only minor problems. When Dean's wealth reaches new heights Rock simply sells out. PLOT POINT Sal Mineo is introduced as a young man who is interested in ranch life unlike Rock's own kids. QUESTION Will Mineo in time become Rock's surrogate son and new ranch head? ANSWER Nope. Mineo is killed off screen during the war. The audience is subjected to a dull unnecessary five minute funeral scene for his character. While he was alive all of Mineo's scenes combined represented about two minutes of screen time. The film inexplicably spends more time on his funeral than it did on him! PLOT POINT Once grown Rock's and Liz's kids want to do things with their lives that are different from what their parents want for them. QUESTION Will these disagreements create conflict in the family? ANSWER Nope. Rock lets the kids follow their hearts. PLOT POINT Rock's Latino daughter in law is refused service in the salon in Dean's huge hotel. Rock takes this as a very personal insult to his family by Dean. The two men fight. QUESTION Does this represent a satisfying climax to the film?ANSWER Nope. Technically Rock is right. As the owner of the hotelsalon Dean is ultimately responsible for what goes on there. But Dean doesn't seem like a racist. He's never said or done anything racist during the film. Also Dean seems like an indifferent businessman more lucky than smart. It's unlikely that he was even aware that these racist policies were even in place. Dean's culpability here is weak at best and it seems like a tenuous foundation to build the climax of a three hour film on. PLOT POINT At the end of the film Rock and his family visit a diner. While there they notice that the owner refuses service to a Latino family one that Rock has never met and has no connection to whatsoever. QUESTION Rock fights the manager to express his outrage at the manager's racism and to convince him to change this policy. The music score swells. Does Rock win? Does the final scene offer any kind of satisfactory conclusion to this wouldbe epic story? ANSWER Nope. Rock loses and the diner will continue its racist policy. The film attempts to end on a happy note showing that Rock now cares about people of color. But Rock never expressed any racist views in any prior scene so this doesn't represent substantive character growth. His affection for Sal Mineo seemed to suggest a man with no race or class prejudices. Even if Rock had won it's just a conflict between two men at a diner. For a three hour film called Giant it feels like an oddly inconsequential ending.";

There he meets a woman Elizabeth Taylor the daughter of his soontobe business partner who he ends up marrying after a quick romance. The movie follows their lives down in Texas as the seasons change and the old ways begin to give ground to the new century.Giant is an epic. It covers years and years of time and deals with all the prominent themes and problems of those decades. Things like oil business racial issues societal status responsibility of the rich to the poor and so many others make an appearance and are addressed in turn. Taylor's character is the voice of the new age while Hudson's is the voice of the old and their interactions are the driving voice of the film.And it works. It is a very interesting film to follow if you know anything about that particular span of history. The film is over three hours long and can thus cover a lot of ground and give each subject its due time. Though that can be a problem as well. It is a very slow film with deliberate calm pacing. Nothing much really happens most of the time or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that things happen very slowly. Personally I found the film to be perhaps a bit too slow and deliberate but if old epics are your thing you'll definitely get what you're looking for.Giant is to be applauded for its vision. It set out to tell a family saga in its full glory and in that regard it definitely delivers. From modern point of view it can a bit tedious but I cannot in good faith condemn it for that.".

We can debate to what extent this was real or con art but there was something true in his charismatic presence and his power of hypnosis.

What now is history trivia was not that obvious in the 20s and beginning of the 30s and the power of prediction of Hanussen was beyond the general level reaching the level of detail of the fire that destroyed the Reichstag.Istavan Szabo film goes however far away from the real Hanussen. A visit on the site of the family httpwww.steinschneider.combiographyhanussenbio.htm reveals a character even more mysterious and fascinating than in the movie.

It is not clear whether he was driven by opportunistic reasons or by fear or by a combination of both but the real Janussen seems to have been far from the unwilling person or even opponent as described in the movie but may have been rather a real sympathizer.

Hard to say why all these details were not presented in the movie they could have made the character even more complex and interesting.Klaus Maria Brandauer's performance is magnificent he masters the screen as Hanussen must have mastered the stage it is maybe the best thing that remained from this film together with the powerful and colorful rendition of the decadent atmosphere of Berlin during the Weimar Rebublic.

	schema:headline " Great performance by Brandauer";
	schema:reviewBody "The acting by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Hanussen is top notch. He carries this movie. And all in all I really enjoyed it. Only the title is a little misleading. Because I never got the feeling it portrays the historic Hanussen. But then again movies seldom stay true to history. But at least they got all the major events right and even Hanussen's stage performance and probably his charisma... But his character... well I just feel that he wasn't the kind of person that is being portrayed in this movie  AT ALL! This movie portrays him as an opponent of the Nazis when in reality he was more of a supporter who fell out of favor due to factional infighting and some miscalculated movies on Hanussen's part.A lot of people have noticed this and many have asked why he is being portrayed in a purely positive light and as an opponent of the Nazis when in reality he was more like one of Hitler's most important supporters at the time. Personally I think they intentionally altered this aspect. Consider it German censorship. As you can clearly see by watching this movie German censorship works very different than U.S. censorship. Germans have no problems with displaying tons of unnecessary nudity sex alcohol drug use and swearing  sometimes even in children's movies. But having the protagonist of a movie be a leading Nazi? And on top of that a Jewish Nazi? No way! People in Germany of 1988 weren't ready for that kinda stuff. In 2007 the Germans made a movie called My Fhrer which also seems to be VERY loosely based on Hanussen. Only this time they finally included scenes of him actually teaching Hitler  something they obviously weren't yet ready for in 1988.So I actually kinda liked Klaus Maria Brandauer's fictional Hanussen more than the historic one  he is definitely more sympathetic. So as long as you separate the Hanussen portrayed in Hanussen from the historic Hanussen then it is a very enjoyable and touching story.Oh and I feel I have to note that the English subtitles I had aren't exactly the most accurate. A lot of times the subtitles seem to say something completely different than what is being said in German. And while the acting of Klaus Maria Brandauer is awesome the acting of some of the supporting characters is awful. Now this sounds like a lot of criticism but actually the movie is still pretty awesome and truly deserves 9 out of 10. If you liked movies like The Prestige or The Illusionist then this is a must watch!".

	schema:headline " Transfer of Will Transfer of Thought Transfer of Propaganda";
	schema:reviewBody "Having seen the two first films of SzaboBrandauer's trilogy I felt exceptionally curious to see HANUSSEN perhaps the least popular of these but very attractive as for the content. And when I at last got an opportunity to see this film I immediately noticed the mature Szabo directing style that seems to be addressed rather to adult viewers. What is so special about this very style that is ever present in MEPHISTO OBERST REDL and here? It's almost deprived of effective visuals being supplied with the typical themes concerning the fear of future contradictions of a self nonsense of politics problem of selfishness power of propaganda finally a personal tragedy in a diversely brutal world. Yet there is something that appears to be unique for HANUSSEN...the main character.Though Klaus Schneider or Eric Jan Hanussen Klaus Maria Brandauer also goes through an individual drama he is different than Mephisto or Redl were. He is not an actor whom people like for talent and wit he is not a soldier whom the military and governing powers reward he is a magician a hypnotist a prophet who can predict everything who is able to look at people's faces and read their minds. Yet like with the two previous characters at the moment he becomes a popular figure the politics steps in and controls the life of the character no matter if he wants this or not...Since the film has much to do with magic and unreal events combined with hypnosis the events might seem unconvincing for many of us. Transfer of will oriental elements hidden power symbols of magic...these all do not appeal to me whatsoever. At the same time this film is not for youngsters or children but only for adult viewers due to its sophistication and immorality including nudity. However what we get at the beginning and at the end of the movie is the Lord's Prayer. It seems that only in the most important crucial moments of life people turn to the only God they have in their hearts. However someone may cope with one significant dilemma can we combine Christianity with magic? The director does not seem to bother answering for that question. He rather focuses like in his previous films on a person in the world on a life among many lives so unique so irreplaceable so much filled with contradictions so weak and unstable. And that is something I'd like to analyze in more details.Istvan Szabo to the very core provides us with an insight into the sadness hypocrisy of the reality we live in. Why are the people so much into magic? Because they have unstable lives. Magic attracts them because it may tell them something they do not find in a regular routine of everyday life. They love Hanussen because it is him who predicts the unexpected stock exchange prices of cotton it is him who tells the fate of the American ship it is him who predicts the reign of Hitler and his pack of bandits. Finally it is him this time so uncomfortable who predicts the burning of Reichstag. Therefore illusively people love him in spite of the fact that there is also a propaganda around his personality they love him because he can partly ease their fear of tomorrow he can give them an answer while the rest of the world remains mute.The performances are fine but one performance is a marvel...it's Klaus Maria Brandauer's. I am not going to compare his portrayal to his previous ones in Szabo's films. They were all very good. However one fact has to be mentioned. It is in HANUSSEN where one realizes that Brandauer was really born for these roles. His Hanussen is a quintessential of what Szabo wanted to convey in his films. He reaches the climax here. Unforgettable moments! Consider for instance one of his most powerful moments when he Klaus Schneider stops a patient in hospital from suicide. This is also a critical moment in the whole movie because then the main character finds himself as a hypnotist and people find this talent in him. Other cast include Erland Josephson as Dr Bettelheim and Adrianna Biedrzynska as Wally. Meaningful that Szabo twice cast a Polish actress as the main character's woman Krystyna Janda in MEPHISTO and Adrianna Biedrzynska here. She is not Janda but does a fine job too.All in all HANUSSEN though a very difficult movie appears to be a significant work thought provoking individual one. Yet it should be seen after MEPHISTO and OBERST REDL. Then the movie makes the desirable sense. It is simply a harmony of Szabo's with Klaus Maria Brandauer in the lead and their pretty pessimistic message about life and reality.".

	schema:headline " Altman's Dream Film May Give You Nightmares";
	schema:reviewBody "Altman made a lot of films that are obscure and deserve to remain so Quintet but he also made a lot of films that are obscure but deserve to be seen and 3 Women is one of those. It's one of the most fascinating films Altman created and that's really saying something from a director who was able to make even his bad films fascinating.Altman claimed that 3 Women was inspired by a dream he had while his wife was lying ill in a hospital and the film does indeed work on its audience the way a dream does. It resists literal interpretation and will probably frustrate any viewer who insists upon tidiness in their movies. It communicates its messages instead through pervasive imagery and tone  it's not about something as much as it's about making you FEEL something and it does that expertly. This movie will stick in your mind and haunt you long after you've seen it.If I were forced to explain the film's plot it would go something like this Shelley Duvall plays Millie a rather foolish woman who works in a geriatric physical therapy center and whose roommate has just moved out to live with her boyfriend. Sissy Spacek plays Pinkie newly hired at the center and put under Millie's direction. Millie is a pathetic character  she yammers on endlessly about ridiculously trivial things like how to make tuna melts and doesn't realize that everyone around her either ignores her or makes fun of her. But Pinkie nevertheless becomes enamored of her and moves in with her. The third woman of the title is Willie a reclusive artist who owns both the apartment complex in which Millie and Pinkie live and a saloon that resembles something from a ghost town. She paints murals of strangelooking mythological creatures engaged in violent and sexual acts. These images recur throughout the film as do images of water. Everything up to this point in the movie is dealt with in a fairly straightforward manner. But then Pinkie has an accident and when she wakes up she's become a different person causing Millie's hold on reality already tenuous to unravel. At this point the film becomes reminiscent of films like Persona and Mulholland Drive in which seemingly separate female characters merge into different facets of one female personality.The ending is creepy and chilling in ways that are hard to define. The whole film has violent undertones  the lone male character in the film is a lout and vaguely predatory all of the women at various moments seem to be holding back a barely suppressed rage. Altman uses his camera in his characteristically expert manner to shape our perceptions about what we are seeing and he uses other parts of his miseenscene like color Millie's favorite colors are yellow and purple and look for them in the art direction to bring a slightly surreal quality to even the most mundane of locations.I've always thought that Shelley Duvall was an underrated actress and she gives one of her best performances as Millie and almost looks pretty for a change. Sissy Spacek is tremendous as well and shows a remarkable range as Pinkie. Both of these actresses do wonderful things with tough roles and even if we sometimes feel like we're on uneven footing because of the movie's enigmatic nature the actresses are so assured in their parts that we can rely on them to guide us through it.Altman directed a quartet of dream films that all revolve around the psychological and emotional crises of women That Cold Day in the Park 1969 Images 1972 Come Back to the 5  Dime Jimmy Dean Jimmy Dean 1982 and 3 Women. I've not seen That Cold Day.. but of the other three though all of them have qualities to recommend them 3 Women is easily the best.Grade A".

It makes you think long time after it's over. As a matter of fact I am still thinking about it. I think that it is an incredible work of an extraordinary master. As always in his best films Robert Altman is terrific  innovative iconoclastic freespirited unconventional and truly original. He is a great humanist who sees through his characters but never makes fun of them and he understands them. Under his directing Shelly Duvall and Sissy Spacec gave two astonishing performances. They were both great but Duvall was a revelation. She adapted the loquacious Millie's personality and become the character. Altman had discovered Duvall at one of the malls in Texas where she was selling cosmetics and given her roles in his six films. I want also to mention the eerie music the dreamy and uneasy atmosphere of something sinister ready to happen the scary and mesmerizing murals on the bottom of the pool that the third woman silent and mysterious tired and wise Willie Janice Rule was painting. Altman did not try to trick or confuse me and the story seems to be simple one but I am not sure that I understood everything especially the enigmatic ending. Altman was aware of the effect of his movie to the viewers and in his commentary he says that he sees the film as a painting and that the audience should feel it but not understand it. In this regard it also reminds of Un chien andalou 1929 which was supposed to be experienced directly and not analyzed by the viewers.3 Women is another great film by one of the best American film directors.

	schema:headline " Avantguard film about female friendships.";
	schema:reviewBody "Three Women was another Robert Altman masterpiece. His films have always deeply explored the frailties of the human personality. And Three Women is typical of Altman's deftness regarding intense characterizations.This film takes place in the late 70s in a remote California town. It revolves around three very different female characters and the effects that each of them has on each other's lives.Shelley Duvall is cast as Millie. Millie is an intensely garrulous woman. She's obsessed with talking about recipes that she garners from women's magazines. She annoys those around her with her constant chatter about her 'latest recipe'. Millie also desperately wants to impress her male acquaintances. Men seem to mostly shun Millie though which doesn't stop her from trying to gain their attention.Millie has a deadend job working as a nurse's aid in a nursing home. Her supervisors are brusque and unsympathetic. She tries to be friendly and helpful but this often causes her more problems with her bosses.Pinky played by the very talented Sissy Spacek moves to Millie's town. She needs a job and is hired as a nurse's aid at the same nursing home that Millie works at. Millie is assigned to train Pinky in her new job duties. Pinky soon becomes quite attached to Millie. Finally Millie has someone around Pinky who actually admires her. When Millie posts a notice on the bulletin board at work  indicating that she seeks a roommate Pinky is only to happy to get the chance to room with Millie. Pinky then moves into Millie's apartment. Though Millie's apartment has a tacky garish quality Pinky expresses how sublime she thinks it is.One afternoon after work Millie asks Pinky to go with her to a rundown bar. Pinky meets Millie's friend Edgar who has setup a shooting rink out back. He constantly practices shooting there and invites Millie and Pinky to participate. Edgar is a sophomoric machotype who drinks heavily. He also likes to showoff his marksmanship skills.Millie also introduces Pinky to Willie who happens to be Edgar's artist girlfriend. Willie is always painting monstrous sexually explicit creatures around the bar. Pinky is inexplicably mesmerized by Willie's offbeat paintings. Willie has a haunting remote presence. She mostly watches everyone else from afar while being intensely involved with her artwork. Willie also happens to live in the same apartment building as Millie and Pinky. Her disturbing paintings adorn the bottom of the swimming pool located there.Basically the film doesn't have much of a plot. At least not in the traditional linear manner that audiences are accustomed to. Instead Altman chose to focus on the psychological aspects of the relationship between the three woman and how this changes over time. The friendship between Pinky and Millie becomes tumultuous for no obvious reason. Willie is the ethereal mysterious woman of the three. She doesn't interact much with Millie and Pinky throughout the film. Willie's artwork is so hypnotic to Pinky though that it has a horrible effect on Pinky's psyche resulting in tragic consequences. The viewer is left to try and fathom why.All three women in the film are social misfits. And they each struggle pathetically to function in the alienating urban environment that they inhabit. Altman did a marvelous job highlighting the emotional turmoil that the women inflict on each other during the course of the film. This is a film that will leave a deep impression regarding the dynamics of women's friendships in modern life. But don't expect a neat and tidy conclusion to the conflicts between the three women. More than any film I've ever seen this one is vastly open to viewer interpretation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three Women is an utterly fascinating film and by my calculations is Altman's second best after Nashville which few films can beat. However whereas I am so familiar with Nashville that I am actually arrogant enough to believe I can understand it Three Women does not inspire that sort of confidence in me. I have no clue what exactly it is about.Basically it is one of those movies where a woman Pinky admires her roommate Millie so much that she wishes to emulate her in every way apparently even trying to steal her identity. In doing so she freaks her roommate out as can certainly be expected. She also freaks the audience out. It isn't all just a bunch of shivering though. This movie contains a lot of humor which can only be called 'Altmanesque.' The great irony is that Pinky's object of admire is nothing but a bag of hot air. Millie is such a loser. At the film's opening she is training Pinky for her new job at the nursing home. To any normal person two weeks into the job you'd be amazed at how much a moron the person is who showed you the ropes. She brags about men whom she rejects but all the hot dates she claims to be going on never come to fruition. Millie also overreacts to Pinky's actions yelling at her for very petty transgressions. When Millie does something that is grossly irresponsible and morally wrong she attacks Pinky for judging those actions. Meanwhile Pinky is creepily reciting passages from Millie's diary with the passion of a high school drama student.Taking Ingmar Bergman's Persona as its major inspiration around halfway through the film after Pinky has an accident and goes into a coma the two women begin to switch roles. Millie becomes the passive and protective roommate while Pinky becomes the aggressive vixen. Actually Pinky becomes the mythic version of Millie. But I have purposely left out the third woman of the title. I really am not sure about her or the climax and the ending in which she plays a major part. Her name is Willie a pregnant woman married to a man named Edgar who will through the course of the film also sleep with both Millie and Pinky. They run a bar where Millie likes to hang out and they also live in the same apartment complex as Millie and Pinky. Edgar is an outgoing joker and has no problem sleeping around on his wife. Willie is mostly silent which is why she is easy to forget in the proceedings. She paints in a Native American style all over the bar and the apartment complex. She does so seemingly because she is compelled to. She despises complements about them. Throughout the film her paintings comment on the situation between Millie and Pinky they're used in a masterful fashion but the panandscan version that I saw on TV it was also edited for time and content dag nabbit screws this up a bit. I don't know if she serves much more of a purpose than that for most of the film.It is the ending which is especially peculiar and it also most effectively channels Persona. Pinky has convinced Millie that she ought to have their apartment's master bedroom to herself and Millie ought to sleep in the living room. Pinky has a surreal dream which is punctuated by the camera's filming through a fish tank whose blue waters are undulating like a snake in which she goes through the events of the past few months. She becomes frightened and much as Elisabeth Volger does in Persona she wanders into Millie's bedroom. Here though she wakes Millie up asking if she would mind sharing a bed tonight. As they try to sleep Edgar wanders into their apartment drunk off his rocker and spouting that Willie is giving birth all alone. Millie and Pinky race to her side. Millie tells Pinky to drive away and fetch a doctor while she herself helps Willie deliver the child. Pinky fascinated or frightened she had earlier expressed fear about being pregnant herself just stands there and stares. When the child is born it is still. Willie cries in her bed and Millie smacks Pinky for not getting a doctor.The next scene takes place at a restaurant where Pinky is apparently a waitress. She bizarrely refers to Millie as her mother. We find out that Edgar accidentally killed himself with his gun but the audience suspects differently all three women had individual scenes where they shot at targets at the bar they also all have reason to despise him. Millie and Pinky then leave the restaurant and walk back to their house where Willie sits on a porch swing. Pinky talks to her as if they were sisters. They appear to be living together as a family. Who else could end a film like that besides Altman? I've only lately come to notice this but his endings are always enormously original. I just lately saw his latest film Dr. T and the Women which many people hated because of the ending. I cringe imagining what they would do with this one. If anyone has any ideas please contact me. I will have to watch it again. Perhaps soon they will release it on DVD where I can watch it in its true form. 1010.".

He lets the story whatever it is evolve naturally and doesn't force it.In this film things work a little differently. There is a fairly tight classical story sort of even though a couple of big pieces are missing. Moreover there is a very strong sense of symbolism in almost every shot from Shelley Duval's first appearance where she is pictured as a new woman displacing an older generation to the scene where Sissy Spacek playfully puts a noose around her neck foreshadowing her suicide attempt.But here's the miracle even though there's a lot of symbolism the style still feels very loose and spontaneous and open just like other Altman films. How this is possible I don't know but it's quite an accomplishmentalmost unique in cinema I think in the way that each frame is simultaneously closed  symbolic but also open  realistic. Really you have to see it to believe it.Best of all the story which concerns three very different women is perfectly suited to the style. This is a fable about the way women's identities are changing or not and it asks the right questions without giving clear answers.Actingwise the real treat here is Shelley Duval as the new woman the Cosmo girl plastic and fake and shallow and miserable and somehow at the same time horribly and hilariously alive. You will not forget her or the doublesided realsymbolic world she moves in.".

Really you have to see it to believe it.Best of all the story which concerns three very different women is perfectly suited to the style. This is a fable about the way women's identities are changing or not and it asks the right questions without giving clear answers.Actingwise the real treat here is Shelley Duval as the new woman the Cosmo girl plastic and fake and shallow and miserable and somehow at the same time horribly and hilariously alive. You will not forget her or the doublesided realsymbolic world she moves in.";

When you watch this film it will literally shed it's skin and reveal something that is spookily real and very threatening without all the supernatural riffraff and farfetched plot.

Pinky sort of becomes Millie Shelley Duvall and Millie sort of becomes Pinky and they both sort of become the dream of Willie Janice Rule or maybe they don't. Listening to director Robert Altman's commentary on the DVD is revealing. He says that he sees the film as a painting and that the audience should feel it but not understand it. The references to Persona are obvious but while watching 3 Women I was reminded of another haunting and puzzling film Picnic at Hanging Rock.

	schema:headline " Probably the best movie you won't be able to understand contains mild spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen all of Robert Altman's films but I can easily say that he is one of the greatest innovators when it comes to characterdriven films as seen in his large ensemble pieces from Nashville to Short Cuts. Perhaps the reason why so many actors like to work with Altman is because he gives them freerein in the composition of their characters.  Altman's ability to capture the actor's talent of creating a character from the inside out is no less present in his 1977 drama 3 Women a buried treasure of a film starring Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek.  3 Women is definitely a characterdriven film as there is virtually no plot to speak of.  To enjoy this film is to be enamoured of Duvall and Spacek's performances as well as Altman's daring and uncompromised vision.Duvall plays Millie Lammoreaux a young woman living in a barren California desert town whose delusions of grandeur place her in a fantasy world full of social gatherings dinner parties and gentleman callers.  Whether she is at the nursing homes where she works or the residential motel where she lives she carries on as if she were the cat's meow oblivious to the fact that her incessant ramblings about everything from her favorite food recipes to hula dancing lessons are falling on deaf in not unkind ears.  Because of her endearing qualities however Millie is a loveable misfit.  The way she always slams her car door on the hem of her skirt says so much about her character.Spacek plays Pinky Rose a new employee at the nursing home who takes an immediate liking to Millie and soon becomes her roommate.  A childlike waif Pinky emulates Millie in the same way a 6yearold girl looks up to her big sister.  While she completely feeds Millie's selfabsorption she also turns Millie's life upside down when she takes on her identity borrowing her clothes and copying down her social security number.The third woman in 3 Women is Willie Hart played by Janice Rule a sullen pregnant woman who spends her time painting disturbing murals inside empty swimming pools.  She is also married to Edgar played by Robert Fortier a drunken lout whose claim to fame as a former stunt double in famous Wyatt Earp westerns makes him a figure of admiration at the motel. The weirdness sets in when Millie invites Edgar over for an adulterous fling causing a dejected Pinky to jump into the motel's swimming pool from a second story landing putting her in a coma.  This event is the first major plot point in 3 Women. as it spins the storyline in a completely new direction.  Pinky wakes up from the coma rejects her parents who have traveled all the way from Texas to see her and turns into a surly beerswilling gumchewing tramp.  Overcome with guilt Millie also changes into a different person.  Her inflated ego disappears she becomes more passive and she caters to Pinky even while Pinky bullies her and treats her with complete disrespect.3 Women has undoubtedly inspired wonder in whoever has seen it.  The tone of the film is extremely strange and dreamlike and is filled with many symbols that defy the viewer who tries to make heads or tails of them. There are also many archetypal mythical figures in 3 Women that seem to come right out of a Jungian dream analysis book.  For instance Pinky's fixation with Polly and Peggy two twins who work at the nursing home with her and Millie figures prominently in the film right down to its climactic dream sequence.  At one point in the movie Pinky muses Do you think they know which one they are?...Maybe they switch back and forth.  One day Peggy's Polly and another day Polly's Peggy.  Janice Rule's Willie also seems to be an archetype the mother figure.Altman doesn't attempt to explain any of the weird connections in 3 Women. Every time I watch this film I find myself confounded by the same questions why are the twins so aloof? why is Millie and Pinky's supervisor so unrelentingly bitchy? why is Pinky twice shown taking off her underwear from underneath her skirt? The list goes on.  Altman does provide a few rhyming scenes in the film as well.  One such scene is one in which nice Pinky is sitting in a deserted bar and is spat upon by a hideous wall ornament in the figure of a wizened old woman named Dirty Gertie whose mechanical laugh accompanies Willie's entrance into the scene.  This scene prefigures a later scene in which bad Pinky mischievously spits beer at Edgar and then proceeds to cackle in an exaggerated fashion.It is a shame that 3 Women is not available on home video or DVD.  I happened to catch it on the cable network known as WE Women's Entertainment and was so intrigued by it that I looked up the next time it was playing so that I could record it.  It is a wonderfully unusual film and Duvall and Spacek are up to task.  The role of Millie Lammoreaux is a career best for Duvall.  She has never played such a rich character before or after 3 Women.  This is also my personal favorite Spacek performance.  The spookiness of her performance here rivals her performance in Carrie.  She deftly portrays both Pinkys with equally terrific conviction.  And Altman is to be commended even 24 years after the fact for bringing such a refreshingly unconventional story to the screen.  3 Women is arguably the best and most mystifying film that I don't think I will ever understand.".

If you have not already seen it and if you like any films by Ingmar Bergman or Robert Altman or David Lynch then stop reading this or any other review and see the film for yourself.The fun of a movie like this that is so realistic that it has no correct interpretation and even the movie's director and writer is not entirely sure what it means is to come up with your own theories and share with others who saw the film. My theory is that the three women are all separate individuals who are alike in the sense that we are all one but who are not alike in the way female charactersactresses are the same person in Persona That Obscure Object of Desire or Mulholland Drive. The sweet old couple really are Pinky's parents and the suicide attempt leaves Pinky with amnesia which is why she forgets her parents and confuses herself with Millie as she tries to reconstruct her life. Poor old Edgar gets shot by one of the women or maybe all three who make it look like an accident. It makes no sense for his body to be hidden in the tires as that would not be an effective way of hiding him the stench would attract attention and the staged accident is consistent with a traditional body disposal. But maybe it is his body just because stuff that happens in real life often makes no sense.The real fun of this movie for me was the shock of the familiar in picking out the tacky details of real life circa 1977. I was 20 when the film came out and yes I do remember making shrimp cocktails and cooking pigsinablanket like it was a new gourmet treat and sorting out Sociables crackers eating the broken ones and saving the whole ones for company with canned cheese squirted on. I even had one of those silly laughtoys not a hag face just a little box in a felt bag that made the laughing sound and cracked everyone up. I didn't smoke Trues or drive a Ford Pinto but I was around others who did.And the Shelly Duvall character with the heart of gold who lies constantly to try to make herself more interesting and who tries so hard to make everything perfect she annoys all the people she is trying to befriend?

With the fact that almost everyone seems to be ignoring Millie Duvall in some scenes to a point where they are being downright rude and disrespectful to and about her makes me believe her isolation and constant need for perfection her apartment her hair her coordinated clothing her endless chatter of the latest appliances and recipes and constant strive for wanting to be the best Hostess on the Planet I believe she created Pinky Spacek who also had the name Mildred in her private fantasy life who is a total contrast of her. The idea came so fast to me maybe too fast to understand it all but I felt the need to jot it down. I want to believe Millie is aware of coworkers and neighbors ignoring her and openly being disinterested in what she is saying but I wonder if it is because the perfect side of these characters is really not there.Well this is only my interpretation of a person who is isolated and has created her own fantasy life of a single career woman who has a lavishly styled pad goes to the local bar to relax and sits poolside for some sun yet is completely and utterly lonely.My only missing piece to this puzzle would be the third woman played by Janice Rule as the mysterious Artist and Bartender and if in fact Millie and Pinky are pieces of her Creations and the constant maternal nurturing that overlaps with these three women throughout the film.It is hands down the best character study piece I have ever encountered and is brilliantly acted by all central players involved.".

Apparently Altman's risky attempt has been acclaimed because of the emotional spectrum being projected throughout this movie. If you are looking for an intellectual content in this movie you will be disappointed. I presume that the director may be following a postmodern approach in order to prevent us from logical thinking. Like an anomaly this movie has a linear screenplay. So that the viewers would not be spending much time thinking of it's chronological order. So basically the director's intention is to hypnotize the viewers with a relaxed mood and that's what makes it special from the other character driven movies.It's an irrefutable fact that Robert Altman was inspired by the movie Persona Ingmar Bergman to make this movie. Also the movies like Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive belong to the same category. Three of them acted really well out of which Sissy Spacek's performance is outstanding. And the cinematography is mediocre with the normal camera movements. Three of them have very different personae. Pinky was a timid and immature girl. Her personality was rather submissive. She finds it awkward to interact with her colleagues. Eventually Millie was instructed to take care of Pinky. And they become roommates. Pinky thinks Millie is perfect and gradually she observes Millie. Pinky even tries to read Millie's diary secretly. Along with their friendship they trade their personae gradually. Millie introduces owners of her apartment Willie and Edgar. Their personality was mutually exclusive. Edgar was a complete extrovert but Willie was always silent. She never talks to someone. The rest of the events seems like a dream sequence and it's difficult to find an explanation for it.We can find that the three women Millie Pinky and Willie shared something common.1 Three of them were betrayed by Edgar Edgar was the husband of Willie and boyfriend of both Millie and Pinky.2 They were metaphorically represented as daemons in Willie's pictures near the swimming pool in their apartment.3 Although they were the slaves of Edgar they betrayed in a triangular way as well Willie  Millie bar Millie  Pinky apartment Pinky  Willie Willie's homeEventually we can find that their minds complete each other according to the Freudian concept of psychoanalysisId Ego and Superego. There is no intellectual conclusion in the world of emotions. It is meant to experience the emotional spectra produced by the director. It makes different impacts on each viewers and that cannot be expressed but only felt. Certainly I'm looking forward to watch the other movies of this genius.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw 3 Women in 1977. I went back to the cinema and saw it two more times before I wrote a review. Though I have seen it many other times since then today I do not recall every detail. Nevertheless I remember its story dealt with three women whose solidarity allows them to survive in a world dominated by insensitive men. Two of these women move the story the third one does not have a direct influence on the events but she is a key figure. There is no puzzle here no enigma to decipher. It may be based on Robert Altman's dream it may have a dream sequence but it is quite linear and direct with little relation to dreams' structure or lack of it. I say this today but after finding my review in my files I think it's ironic and makes me laugh at myself. By 1977 I had not read Susan Sontag's Against Interpretation yet and I was trying to decipher what the butter meant in Last Tango in Paris. But I must admit that I find interesting some of the research I did and a few interpretations I made. I found then various leitmotivs in the movie first the grotesquely erotic murals painted and shot at by Willie Janice Rule that illustrate the oppressive situation of woman in phallocratic societies water which according to French philosopher Dane Rudhyar stands for collective consciousness and astral world a symbol that for me tacitly connected the three women and that has played an important role in other Altman films McCabe  Mrs. Miller Streamers Come Back to the 5 and Dime Jimmy Dean Jimmy Dean The Gingerbread Man Dr. T  the Women frozen in Quintet and even in HealtH Popeye and O.C. and Stiggs the image of twins Peggy and Polly duplicated in Alcira and Doris mirroring the MilliePinky duplicity and the clinic as a metaphor of social and moral decay while its members attempt at efficiency. It may sound crazy but I even made a connection between the pool of the boarding house owned by Willie and a woman's womb Willie's where the temporary symbiosis of Pinky Rose Sissy Spacek into Millie Lammoreaux Shelley Duvall takes place. Today I consider all these more hints than cryptic data and sometimes they are even too obvious as the line when Millie says something like Sometimes Peggy can be Polly and Polly can be Peggy guncrazy Edgar as a symbol of sexual inadequacy and male authoritarianism and the delivery of the dead child as a metaphor of the sterility of this kind of relationship between men and women. As I remember it today it is a sad story of female bonding as a means of survival in a consumerist society narrated in a beautiful cinematic style with remarkable performances by all. Funny although Duvall had won the Best Actress Palm d'Or in Cannes in my review the one who impressed me the most was Rule because she was able to transmit so much with less than a dozen of lines. By far it's my favorite Robert Altman movie and one of his masterpieces.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first half of the movie is like a quirky character study. This part was intriguing if strange and cringeinducing. Millie is a woman who thinks she's in the center of life but in reality is far from it. In scene after scene she is ignored or made fun of behind her back. A naive Pinky whose real name is also Mildred while Millie is short for Mildred comes into her life first as workmates then roommates. Probably due to her limited experience she thinks Millie is just wonderful while Millie sees her as first a convenience then a nuisance.Then the movie turns into the Twilight Zone. Here's where it all falls apart. After a vulgar browbeating by Millie Pinky attempts suicide and possibly due to brain damage from the attempt changes personality and has problems remembering her past. The new personality is what Millie thinks she is but this time it's real. A brash confident and actually nasty selfobsessed personand very popular. In a dream remnants of Pinky's memory come back to her and she starts to revert to her former self or some amalgam of the two personalities. The final scene makes it seem as if the entire episode might have been the dream of the third woman Willie get it the names are so similar ha ha. Here Millie is the mother to Pinky and Willie may be the grandma or Millie's sister. Did it happen? Did they kill Edgar the ne'er do well who was involved with all three and just create some alternative family? Who knows. And more importantly who cares? I normally don't give any mention to music unless it's really bad or really good. Here it's the former. Terrible spitty flute playing tries to make this seem arty but is just annoying and out of character for the scenes.This is an utterly forgettable experience with no concern whatsoever for any deeper meaning. The acting is the only saving grace here. Shelley Duvall is both pathetic and creepy while strangely engaging. Sissy Spacek really makes the character shine with tiny expressions that convey very well. She's believable both as a simpleton and a sophisticate. It is original however I'll give it that. Overall unsatisfying and irrelevant.".

So cutting edge. So cryptic. Guys....it's awful! I usually can live without violence in movies but when Spacek did a header into the pool I cheered out loud. However what followed seemed like an hour of hospital room coma scenes and I thought my GOD it has to get better. And that's what kept me watching as I think is the case with many folks out there. We need to just find the ability to chuckle at ourselves a bit and say ok Altman got me on this one. Don't watch it again and again searching for the meaning in it all. In the literature included with the DVD there is a statement something like It was Altman's goal to shoot the entire movie with no screenplay. That explains why we see literally 45 seconds of footage of a person walking from a car into a bar. Just walking. Nothing's going to fall on his head. Nothing's going to happen. He's just walking. Still walking. Anyway if you want to watch a good movie about dysfunctional relationships and women rent The Hours.".

It is almost as if Altman was saying to himself Well I'm not going to be around much longer so I am going to speak my peace about how I feel about filmmaking and let it all hang out. For the true aficionado this is as good as it gets. You'll want to savor it in chunks it is so thoughtprovoking. Not only does Altman reveal all the hidden meanings of the film he explains at length with copious examples the philosophy of his art. It shed light on my previous encounters with Altman's difficult style highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ive had the Criterion DVD of this for quite some time before I finally managed to sit down and watch it. The film came at the tailend of director Altmans most creative period and its not one that can be easily categorized  much like his earlier and equally demanding IMAGES 1972 incidentally both are original screenplays by Altman himself and are essentially dreamlike and rambling thus leaving room for respectively various interpretations and much improvisation.Anyway the narrative concerns the odd relationship between the titular figures Sissy Spacek is the inexperienced and reticent type at her new workplace an old folks home she meets Shelley Duvall who on the other hand is worldly and garrulous  but no less lonely Janice Rule then is a bohemian artist whom they occasionally cross paths with her strange designs adorn the floor of the pool at the apartment house where the other two live. For the first 90 minutes or so theres hardly any plot we see Spacek and Duvall at their work routine where theyre pretty much ignored by their coworkers then bonding when the former moves in with the latter again their neighbors arent very friendly and occasionally visiting the bar out in the desert complete with motortrack and shootingrange owned by Rule and her husband. Eventually however the two grow apart as Duvall begins to find Spaceks maladroit ways a nuisance  the last straw is reached when Duvall comes home with Rules husband on her arms and unceremoniously shifts Spacek into the guest room the latter takes this dismissal badly and attempts suicide in the pool! Its here that the film really starts to get weird when Spacek finally comes to shes a totally different person  assertive and sensual she basically takes up the characteristics that had previously been Duvalls by which the latter is confused and becomes the one to feel awkward! Nevertheless she tries to help by sending for Spaceks parents in Texas so that they can be near her however her roommate doesnt appreciate the gesture as apparently being struck by temporary amnesia she claims not to know them! Later Rules husband turns up once again at their apartment  having deserted his pregnant wife Duvall however grabs Spacek and goes to Rules aid  Duvall asks Spacek to fetch a doctor but the latter seems dumbfounded by all of thisso that the baby emerges stillborn! Following this is a quite extraordinary surreal dream sequence which leads us into the finale  where Spacek is tending bar at Rules place when a patron appears she calls on to her mother Duvall! it transpires that the latter is taking care of Spacek and Rule who for some reason seem to have regressed to a childlike state! The script provides an interesting analogy between the protagonists character names Spacek called Pinky throughout is really named Mildred Duvall is Millie which is short for Mildred while Rules character is referred to as Willie probably a diminutive of Wilhelmina and which of course rhymes with Millie! Incidentally the presence of the twins coworkers of Spacek and Duvall anticipates the films later personality switch a' la PERSONA 1966 and PERFORMANCE 1970. Comedy though of the neurotic kind one usually associates with Woody Allen is present during the course of the film  such as the neighbor Duvall fancies but whom she rejects due to his persistent flu and exfilm director John Cromwells appearance as Spaceks senile father. While the general apathy shown towards Spacek and Duvall also raises a nervous chuckle it seems exaggerated to me  for instance after Spaceks spell in hospital Duvall asks her superiors if she can come back to workbut they maintain to not even recall her though admittedly this ties up with Spaceks own earlier rejection of her parents! Despite the emphasis Altman places on the murals painted by one Bodhi Wind no explanation is given regarding their harrowing nature other than the fact that theyre the handiwork of the eccentric Rule so that their point remains obscure to the last.I wouldve liked to listen to Atmans accompanying Audio Commentary  however as Ive explained elsewhere Ive been forced to bypass such lengthy supplements for the time beingand in any case from past experience Id say that his observations seemed to be just as aloof as the films themselves!".

I have also recently viewed Bergman's Persona which was first and far far superior to this languid dull attempt at the psychological puzzle. There were no character developments that anyone could possibly be interested in and the whole film is underscored by one of the most annoying overused score in any film I've ever seen.I loved the performances of these actresses but there is no script or anything of interest to put them into context. There are a series of events that at this point are mundane and uninteresting if you've seen any of Altman's films. Sure this is an attempt at the extreme but for my time there was zero to no payoff. At least Bergman's cinematography alone makes his film memorable. No such luck here. The imagery is heavyhanded and obvious. Sorry guys NOT a masterpiece.".

This movie's unique look and feel is its primary vehicle. If you are looking for a sophisticated plot this movie was not made for you. The plot and acting were adequate enough to avoid ruining the visual picture. The makers applied a comic book feel to the movie that allowed for softer edges and sepia tones both with the animated sets and the human characters. If a set does not look completely realistic the viewer is not troubled because the set is consistent with everything you see in the movie.Anyone who has ever edited video or worked with animation would have to appreciate the visual art and quality of this movie. Otherwise it contains a decent story that would be worth watching at least once.".

This movie's unique look and feel is its primary vehicle. If you are looking for a sophisticated plot this movie was not made for you. The plot and acting were adequate enough to avoid ruining the visual picture. The makers applied a comic book feel to the movie that allowed for softer edges and sepia tones both with the animated sets and the human characters. If a set does not look completely realistic the viewer is not troubled because the set is consistent with everything you see in the movie.Anyone who has ever edited video or worked with animation would have to appreciate the visual art and quality of this movie. Otherwise it contains a decent story that would be worth watching at least once.";

However it's obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinnedplotted film. SPOILER For crying out loud they forgot to have a villain in this thing! OK they have one but he's been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place. Conran misses the point of HAVING a villain. As far as action goes well let's see Sky Captain Law shoots down ONE robot two or three of the flapping wing airplanes before Dex Ribisi tells him to stop shooting them down!!! and a couple robots but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie the reviewer who comments on hers and Law's lack of chemistry is so right and I for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera showing she ONLY HAS TWO SHOTS LEFT both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie one uncomically one quite funny although I saw it coming from 70 years away. No one except Law and Paltrow have any significant time on screen and that's the movie's real flaw. An audience doesn't identify with robots they need a hero to root for and a visible despicable villain to hate. Without that plus a good engaging story all the CG in the world won't help.".

	schema:reviewBody "Computer generated special effects have been around for quite some time now and often questionably so but they come into their own with Kerry Conran's SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROWan innovative film that failed in theatrical release but which now makes a big splash in the home market. And whether you love it or hate it SKY CAPTAIN is likely to cast a very long shadow indeed.As a concept the film seems to be based on the popular serials of the 1930s and 1940s. This is not limited to the use of an improbable plot fueled by special effects and cliffhanger action sequences but it extends to the dialogue and characters as well all of which are typical of such celebrated serials as BUCK ROGERS CAPTAIN MARVEL SPY SMASHER and THE CRIMSON GHOST. The film also draws specific plot elements from such diverse sources as KING KONG LOST HORIZON THE WIZARD OF OZ and WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE to name but a few.The story is typical of serials. Girl Reporter Polly Perkins Gwyneth Paltrow is doing a story on missing scientistsand when giant metal robots attack New York she unexpectedly holds a clue to their origin. She and Sky Captain Jude Law form an uneasy alliance to get to the bottom of things. With an assist from Sky Captain's faithful sidekick Dex Giovanni Ribisi and the disconcertingly military Frankie Angelina Jolie the two search the worldand finally track the wicked Dr. Totenkopf Laurence Olivier resurrected via CGI to his secret lair.The look of the film follows suit. The live cast worked on a blue screen set and with the exception of a single set the costumes and items the live actors had to handle everything you see on the screen was created in the computer and added after the fact. A great many people have described the look of the film as deco an arts movement associated with the 1920s this is misleading. It would be more accurate to describe it as a mixture of preWWII arts movements filtered through a 1950s sensibility and the result is like nothing so much as a pulp science fiction magazine cover unexpectedly come to life.Now how much you like this will depend to a great extent on how clearly you recognize the film styles and specific films that have clearly influenced it. If you know nothing about serials for example you are likely to be appalled by the flatness of the script and Paltrow's onenote performance on the other hand if you are a serial fan you'll immediately recognize that the script is reflective of such serials as SPY SMASHER and that Paltrow echoes Linda Sterling famous for such serials as THE CRIMSON GHOST. It wouldn't be too much to say that in many respects SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW is akin to an inside joke.But most particularly your liking for this film will depend on how you react to the visuals. I am not a great fan of CGI when it is used to bolster live action films such as GLADIATOR or TITANIC I can usually spot the CGI and I find it distracting. But I have to come down in favor of SKY CAPTAIN this isn't an effort to make it look real this is an effort to make a totally artificial world and whether it be giant robots ShangriLa or Radio City Music Hall the designs are stunning and remarkably well executed. Whatever other shortcomings it may have SKY CAPTAIN has incredible visual WOW! The film is currently available in a DVD release that is visually handsome with superior sound and the package contains a fair number of bonuses. Unfortunately the two commentary tracks are less interesting than you might expect but two short documentaries Brave New World and The Art of the World of Tomorrow are quite goodand the original six minute short that inspired the film is fascinating. Not every one will get it so I recommend you rent before you buy but on the whole this is a show truly worth the money. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

I wasn't disappointed except for the story which was just soso.Almost the whole film is computerized and almost has a paintinglike look to it. In fact many scenes look as if Edward Hopper had painted them. Yet it is a liveaction movie with real actors whose faces aren't altered except for Gywneth Paltrow's hair which is made more blondish and shimmering.Storywise it's nothing special just a corny oldtime serial story about someone using hightech robots and spaceships to take over the planet. The time period however is preWorld War II so to see this futuristic type of robot is a bit of a stretch. Nonetheless it's a strictly oldfashioned scifi story with little profanity and except for the robots a great retro look.Going back to that look this film is still very worthy of viewing because it's absolutely stunning to see. There truly is nothing quite like it. I'm sorry it didn't do well at the box office because that won't encourage others to make more of these visuallyinventive kind of films. This must look beyond incredible on an expensive plasma TV set!Also notable is the sound. The better the sound system you have the more you will be blown away with the audio here. It's as good as the visuals. If only the story was as good!".

I really did like the glossy look of the visuals.The story is not overly deep and I would have loved to see some more backstory development for some of the main players but for what it isthe plot is easy enough to follow along too. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow have great chemistry together here and I'm glad things between them stayed constant through the film. I could write more here but I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it.Despite the fact I enjoyed Sky Captain I am still thankful these films are the exception rather than the rule. I still prefer films with real or at least partially real sets and shooting locations. I've read comments here about the quality of the acting in this film and that's a pitfall for socalled Blue screen films. Even a great actor has a challenge when standing against a blue screen and pretending to respond meaningfully to something that's not really there. The acting here isn't down right corny but I believe if the key players had more real surroundings to play off of the performances would have improved. I also think Angelina Jolie's Frankie character deserved more screen time.'Sky Captain' is an interesting experiment and certainly a movie that will hold your attention for 90 or so minutes the movie is pretty short in comparison to other blockbusters.So if you're curious check it out you likely will get something enjoyable out of it.".

I didn't like the direction that cinema was taking with this film featuring a backdrop that was mostly digital because being a film purist I used to relish the feel of actual celluloid in my hands so this 'fake' creation was disturbing. I am still wary of this possible trend but after seeing 'Sky Captain' I found that art can be realized in this medium.'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' not only boasts one of the longest film titles in recent months but a great cast Jude Law as Joe 'Sky Captain' Sullivan our hero Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins our intrepid reporter and Sullivan's former flame and Angelina Jolie as Capt. Franky Cook a friend and ally of Joe's. There is an evil element threatening the Earth and it is up to Joe and Polly to find out who is behind the threat before Earth is destroyed. One line is all it really takes to sum up the story which is generally all it took to summarize the films 'Sky Captain' pays homage to. The story is good and it certainly boasts one of the most entertaining endings that I can remember in recent years but it is the presentation that is the biggest draw with 'Sky Captain'. The overall style is 1930's Art Deco mixed with bits of NeoFuturism. The robots in the first half hour of the film look like something out of comic book the clothes and character styles are most certainly inspired by the 1930's and the backdrops and locations are very Deco. It's obvious that one of the advantages in producing a film in this manner is that the filmmaker can be as elaborate in design as possible because the 'set design' was very rich and exciting. As a lover of classic film I found the numerous nods to the films of the 30's very refreshing. Several scenes or lines could have been construed as corny but I found them to be presented with a giant wink at the audience. Because all of these aforementioned elements were done so well this film was a huge success in my opinion. And despite my concerns which are still prevalent in my mind I can sincerely rave about and recommend 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' to just about anyone who appreciates both art and good entertainment.Shel".

This movie is in every way better than the new Star Wars movies.... it has the great futuristic dogfights that were so great in the first 3 SW movies but are missing in the new films and its effects are better thought out and better done than Attack of the Clones. Everybody who likes science fiction or just who likes good oldfashioned movies should see this film. It is suitable for kids and for adults. Very good photography and direction I think this one will be appreciated by film fans looking to the new fronteirs of filming also. This film gave me some hope at long last that Hollywood will not become a wasteland of effects without good story so I am indeed surprised that many posters here consider it to be just that.

With further attacks around the globe Sky Captain and his group team up with Polly to track down the source of the robot menace uncover the plot involved and stop it before it is too late.All the interviews around this film have talked up the visuals and the possibilities of making movies entirely on blue screen etc and to be honest the marketing behind the film reflects it really well because it is all about the visual style and effects with very little else. The film starts immediately with a really great visual feel that harks back to the old scifi serials of the 193040's where the future is based on the present with knobs on. The lighting and delivery is all fitting this period and it works pretty well on this level. The scale and nature of the effects are impressive they are all retro and look great and only occasionally is it obvious that the actors are staring at things that aren't there. Of course after this we have problems because looks enough aren't quite enough to make it all work. The period feel will make it a cult film with time but at the moment it is not enough to just sell me a computer generated yarn with no substance to it.I suppose in a way the writing and delivery is all in keeping with the genre that it is homaging but this is a thin excuse for material that is slightly dull and lacks the twinkle and wit it really needed. Wooden acting and clunky dialogue can be fun if served up with the tongue in the cheek but that never really happens here to the degree it should. Thinks looked good at the start with Godzilla making an appearance on a Japanese newspaper but aside from this and a handful of other comic touches the film is played pretty straight  meaning we feel we should treat it so something I found too hard to do. The dialogue is fun at times but is mostly as stiff as much of the delivery. The cast are not to blame because they are remote from the action secondary to the visuals and trying to match the acting of the genre which is traditionally wooden. I'm not totally sure that bringing back Olivier was a good idea but it was such a small part of the film that it didn't really matter and left me wondering why they bothered in the first place.Law is boyishly handsome and works pretty well with the material looking very British in his beautiful Spitfire. He has fun with his character and he at least seems to be in on the joke. Paltrow has some comic moments but mainly she plays it pretty straight and is a little dull. Ribisi is all at sea he plays it straight and looks bad as a result. Jolie is a nice addition but has little time to make an impression  she never has a character and is really nothing more than a set of lips! Support from Gambon and Ling Bai is wasted and neither makes an impression  especially disappointing from Ling who is really the main baddie for the majority of the film. None of them are good enough to make the plot engaging or bring out characters in their genre clichs but they try their best and at least fit into the period quite well.Overall this is eye candy but it is candy that will develop a cult following based on how well it captures those old serials and the scale of the visual designs and effects. Many viewers will lament that Conran didn't move away from his computer for longer and put more heart and wit into the script because this has little or no substance to it and when backdrops are not stunning and robots are not stomping it can get dull and does. Worth seeing for the effects and the visuals this is a very expensive scifi serial that is fun but sadly lacks any substances characters or real humour.".

And that's what such films should be. In my opinion this is far and away the best of it's type far surpassing the Marvel and Transformer spectacles. While adopting many of the plot points and action sequences of serials it still manages to look fresh and surprising.While I haven't the time or energy to review all of the previous posts it surprised me that many criticized the use of color. One even said it was adopting the colorized look of the 1970s. You'll notice that the only part of the film that had true color was The Wizard of Oz showing on the Radio City Music Hall screen. In point of fact the film was a deliberate attempt to copy the look of twostrip Technicolor which was used up to 1935. As a fan of this look I go out of my way to find such films. Sky Captain succeeded admirably in copying it.Much criticism is lodged about the lack of sparks between the principals. This also is in keeping with serials where the only clinch was the closing scene. Instead the rivalry between investigator and reporter with lots of wisecracking copies the feel beautifully. While all of this has become hackneyed from decades of use it is handled well and intelligently.The CGI is used with care and as an adjunct to the plot. Small details keep popping up that will require multiple viewings to assimilate.This is a film for film fans. I consider it a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite guilty film pleasures. It's a 1940's comic strip broughttolife by a producer with very little success other than this film. Shot entirely inside of a greenscreen computer environment no real sets to speak of. Just platforms and such. Yet it travels all over the world and quite convincingly I might add. Staring Jude Law Sky Capt. Gweneth Paltrow PollyThe Reporter and Angelina Jolie Frankie. She is truly amazing although she appears late in the movie. She plays a oneeyed British Commander. A superwoman who oversees a flying armadainthe sky. Oh yes she flies like a Flash Gordon rocketeer. She commands combat planes battleships aircraft carriers submarines and special forces. As the Muppets once quipped they travel by map and end up in Tibet and ShanghaiLa. It plays homage to every great scifi film you have ever seen as well as the 1940's Superman Max Fleischer cartoons. There are giant robots mechanical monsters The Hindenburg images of Fritz Langs' masterpiece Metropolis. It might even remind you of King Kong. Laurence Olivier appears like a projected image from The Wizard of Oz. He is a nowdeceased genius behind a plot to save all the animals yet destroy the planet Earth. Some critics pointed out the many goofs but I believe some of it was intentionally tongue incheek at times. Roger Ebert gave it four stars and Leonard Maltin hated it. As much a thrillride as any of the Indiana Jones or Star Wars outings. I wish it had been more successful in its time. 2004 My only regret is that I never got to see it on a large screen. Also on BluRay.".

	schema:reviewBody "While my peers were racing to the movies to see such films as Pretty in Pink and Say Anything I couldn't wait to visit my grandparents' farm in southeastern Colorado. In my grandmother's antique cabinet in their 'playroom' were literally hundreds of tapes movies staring the Three Stooges the Marx Brothers Abbott and Costello and dozens of cliffhangers such as Mystery Squadron and The Adventures of Red Ryder . My love of serials is one of the few things I remember sharing with my father.So when I was sitting in the theater and the first preview for Shy Captain and the World of Tomorrow came on I was transported back to the safety of my grandparents' home and the love I felt while watching old cliffhangers with my dad.I was instantly in love with the movie the beautiful quality of every frame that made the movie appear to be one beautifully illustrated comic book and of course the similarity to the campy scifi movies of the 1930's. I went home and immediately looked the movie up on the internet.I was stunned to find out that this was the first film Kerry Conran had directed or written and that Sky Captain was originally a six minute reel that producer Jon Avnet saw and wanted to turn into a feature length film. The movie itself was first storyboard with crude animation so that the actors would understand what was happening in their scenes since the entire film was shot in front of blue screen. Because there were no actual locations filming only took 26 days instead of an estimated 6 months.When the movie opened on the 17th of September I was there for one the first showings. The theater was all but empty only about twelve other people were there all men all in their thirties and all alone. I was truly shocked at the small turn out what about this film had turned off so many movie goers?The movie began and I felt like a little kid falling in love with movies for the first time all over again. The shuttle references to classic scifi movies of the 1920's 30's and 40's littered the screen. References to King Kong Forbidden Planet and the comic book Nick Fury Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. were everywhere you looked. At one point Polly Perkins the feisty reporter played by Gwyneth Paltrow is talking to her editor on the phone saying 'They're reached Sixth Ave Fifth Ave. they're a hundred yards away' a direct quote from Orson Welle's radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds. Even Star Wars was referenced when Joe 'Sky Captain' Sullivan played by Jude Law is instructed to land on the air carrier's pad 327 the same number the Millennium Falcon lands on in Cloud City. By far the greatest reference to past greatness is the appearance Sir Laurence Olivier who died in 1989 as the villain Dr. Totenkopf using CGI and archival footage Conran brings back to life one of our greatest actors.I was in movie geek heaven for about the first hour and then my attention started to wonder. In a society of attention deficit the constant motion and flying from one scene to another and the quick panicked pace of this movie should have fit in however I felt teased as if I was only watching part of a movie the part that would never have a conclusion. We receive through the dialogue what little character development the movie has to offer which isn't much and in the end no one grows or changes or even becomes deeper than a character in a commercial.Looking back at the old serials I realize that the characters remained the same generic two dimensional characters they were at the beginning but the lack of development goes unnoticed in an action film less than twenty minutes long. Today the only programs we watch that are less than twenty minutes are situational comedies that parade a host of cardboard characters through redundant stories lines. A two hour long episode is too much perhaps Kerry Conran should have stuck more closely to the serial format and released the movie in smaller segments maybe then I would have remained entertained and in love with his homage to old cinema. We are a country that seems to forever be moving forward with little room to go back and even though we sometimes get nostalgic for a simpler film or movie hero it's not always possible to pull off with today's intellectual needs.".

All of the planes get blown up and yet again the ONLY person fighting back is the Sky Captain...THE ENTIRE world is under attack and he's the ONLY person ever fighting back.

	schema:reviewBody "As computer graphics are becoming more and more a part of movies it only makes sense that eventually a film would come along that is completely computer animated with humans just inserted into the footage.That's the feel of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow a strange but fun fantasyaction movie inspired by the likes of classic scifi comics like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordan. The characters are essentially liveaction people walking in front of green screen images but it does all mesh together nicely if not too nicely.The year is 1939 and several famous German scientists have wound up missing. When plucky New York reporter Polly Perkins Gwyneth Paltrow is contacted by a scientist who fears that he's next she discovers a diabolical plot by a mad scientist named Dr. Totenkopf Laurence Olivier thanks to some digital trickery.Totenkopf has unleashed an army of massive robots on the world and the call soon goes out to Joe Sky Captain Sullivan Jude Law a wellknown heroforhire fighter pilot to come to the rescue. Fate soon brings Perkins and Sullivan together again having once been an item but now bitter over a past incident that left Sullivan in a Japanese prison camp.They soon discover that Totenkopf is using his machines to raid the world's power supplies but to what end they don't know. Skeptical at first Sullivan soon changes his tune when the robots raid his base and make off with his chief mechanic and friend Dex Dearborn Giovanni Ribisi. Committed to the task of stopping the scientist and rescuing his friend Sullivan goes after Totenkopf with Perkins in tow smelling a story exclusive that's too big to pass up.Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a nice throwback to the old adventure serials of the 1940s and the look and feel is certainly inspired by the Max Fleischer Superman cartoons of that era particularly the 1941 short Mechanical Monsters whose title robots bear a striking resemblance to the ones in this film.First time director Kevin Conran also the screenwriter clearly has respect for the source material of the era and the movie certainly has a unique atmosphere to it. However the problem is the visuals and production design command so much attention that the characters come off as ancillary at best.As the Sky Captain Law gives a laidback performance not really in keeping with a world famous adventurer. He's certainly charming and handles the action scenes well but he lacks the ambition necessary for the role.As Perkins Paltrow seems to be invoking the spirit of Superman's Lois Lane mixed with Underdog's Sweet Polly Purebred and as such succeeds at being a nosy reporter who often get in trouble. But Paltrow never really brings Perkins to life and she recklessly endangers countless numbers of lives and is never even berated for her actions.Ribisi and Jolie both fair well though their characters just exist to advance the plot. It is Olivier's presence here that is the real eye opener. More than 2 decades after his death the legendary actor is recreated for the movie in two scenes. It's a little disturbing to this critic however sort of the digital equivalent of grave robbery. Along with the current plans to digitally insert the late George Burns into a new film as well I don't think I agree with this usage of the technology.Despite their shortcomings the actors do give a nice try but they're powerless against the scope of the film. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a cornucopia of technical wizardry that's fun to watch and then instantly forget. If the plot had been tooled around with a bit more it might have become something more classic like Raiders of the Lost Ark. However what we have here is a wonderfully conceived artificial world with no humans to inhabit it.7 out of 10 stars. It's a fun little popcorn movie and a throwback to the serials of yesteryear but it just can't come together as anything more than a series of interesting set pieces.".

Instead we have an early stinker of a predecessor to what will no doubt be many many CGI films in the future.One does not expect a film of this sort to be realistic but the 'face' of this film as it were is so contorted into one vast ironic wink that no other tone is at all apparent. There is zero suspension of disbelief at any point in this film NONE! Indeed the much mentioned sepia tone and fuzzy image designed to evoke the 1930's are but the final straw in giving the film not so much the charm of a comic book but rather a bad comic book's pervasive air of insincerity and unreality. While technically striking the film is not quite visually striking being simply too phony to matter. I suspect that this film was aiming for the sort of insincere fun found in the Pirates of the Caribbean series but unlike the Pirates franchise the acting humor and dialog are all played down rather than played up and the plot is amazingly utterly and notably inferior.While many people have criticized the dialog and acting in fact I think that both are somewhat cleverly done but both are also so shriekingly at odds with the supposed action on screen that one is reminded of a janitor sweeping in front of a movie screen while a film is running a veritable exercise in DEintegrating live action and CGI.I think or at least hope that this film marks something of a milestone in Hollywood as the final gasp of pure special effects awe over special effects artistry and film craft. While intended to be sophisticated and ironic the filmmakers are mired in a mentality that upholds pointless but technically difficult spectacle over all. The next generation of filmgoers in particular will be accustomed to high end special effects and are not going to be awed by special effects that are not supportive of story nor truly interesting in themselves. While past films could shock simply because they COULD show a given scene just like a novelist future filmmakers will need to present a scene skillfully and present scenes that support a story. Almost nothing in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is well presented and unfortunately the film is suitable only for small boys.".

Which is a shame because being an excellent film with superb graphics it is also the forerunner of everything that has followed in Compter Generated Images CGI.Sky Captain was filmed entirely in blue screen. None of the sets existed except it the mind of the people doing the graphics. Which meant the actors had no frame of reference when they were performing. Oh of course there were tape marks on the floor but nothing to react to nothing to walk around nothing but a blank room with platforms where necessary to go up and down. Which means the actors had to envision the room as it might be and then respond without the aid of visual cues. Now I don't know about you but I would call that acting above and beyond the normal requirements. And the best part is they all do it extremely well. As to plot considering the setting of the film the plot is exactly as it should be. If this had been made in the 1950's this film would have been a Cliffhanger like Commando Cody or Flash Gordon used to be a tool to get parents to drop their kids off at the local theater for Saturday morning matines while they did their grocery shopping or other chores. I remember doing that while my mom was off grocery shopping and my brother and I would sit for two or three hours watching cartoons and a couple of those films.Still there isn't a lot of action by comparison to what we expect from films these days and the technology in the film is 'old school' so perhaps the current generation of film goers just didn't get it. I recommend the film as a great way to spend ninety six minutes when the kiddies are looking to see what the old world used to be like. Rated PG collectible for us Sci Fi types. Enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sky Captain may be considered an homage to comic books pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres. One contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences. I don't think this is at all true. One's expectations of the filmsfiction and serials that Captain pays tribute to were entirely different. Especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children. This film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those. Of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama. Toward the climax of Captain Law and Paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal. They take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with 30 seconds left to tragedy. Of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency.One doesn't expect films like this to necessarily make sense. One does expect them to be fun thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic. Captain has almost none. Remember when Law and Paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge? Well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side? They can FLY!!! The chasm itself means nothing to them. The bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape? If the land across the chasm is 'forbidden' to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if.I know that Paltrow and Law both of whom have given fine performances in the past were playing types but both were pretty flat. Only Giovanni Ribisi who showed himself capable of great nuance here and Angelina Jolie seemed to give any oomph to their roles although Omid Djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he'd only been given the chance. He did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted.The film had a great 'look' but there are so many ways in which CGI distracts. CGI works best when it is used for the fantastical when it is used to create creatures who don't exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular. When it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints. There is no real sense of wonder. A CGI mountain doesn't have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does. I know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it wasn't necessarily supposed to LOOK real but shouldn't it FEEL that way? It just didn't. As for the weak and clichd script...homage is no excuse. Even so had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable. The Last Samurai was as predictable as the days of the week and I am no fan of Tom Cruise but it had everything that Captain didn't most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that Sky Captain most definitely did not.I'd like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30's and 40's. The original Jay Garrick Flash or Green Lantern Alan Scott come to mind as being ripe for such treatment. Maybe the better more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film. It would be hard to be worse.".

It's a downright boring movie the acting is terrible the writing dull and obviously a firsttime director because it's stiff. And I wanted to love it. I love scifi the old cliffhangers and I can appreciate the attempt at nods to Flash Gordon and Metropolis but my God what a waste of money. I used to work for Paramount Pictures and I had written Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests. She told me they'd never have an interest or need to do it. 10 years later Paramount releases this piece of crap. Sherry was right in 1993 but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog. Blue screen an effect shot but not an entire movie. Let's not forget neither Jude nor Jolie are terrific actors but easy on the eyes. Paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort. Too bad  it could've worked but only under a skilled director. the funny thing is Sky Captain's director will keep getting work even after this dreck. It's commerce not art!".

Teen comedy about a group of kids looking for weed and girls? Instant hit. Martial artist seeking revenge? Guaranteed cable sale. But here we have an artist so enchanted with the serials of the 1920s 1930s and 1940s that he in effect did an homage to them with an excellent script and AList actors Paltrow Law Jolie  WOW!. But the real deal was the CGI. It was breathtaking. And still is if you watch this on DVD or stream it from the ionosphere. I remember the mandatory interviews that Paltrow as a lead actress had to give at the time. She kept insisting over and over that the actors had to do their parts blind because the CGI was added later. The interviews sounded more like a union grievance than an accolade. But that is beauty of the filmic art. The final product will be available for viewers of the future regardless of how the actors and public treated the film on first release maybe it should have been called SKY CAPTAIN AND THE VIEWERS OF TOMORROW?. A one of a kind gem and highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sky Captain and the world of Tomorrow is the kind of film I've been waiting for! Pure sci fi in my opinion where mechanical robots weighing many tons can fly and The Hindenburg can dock at the Empire State Building this was actually discussed during the planning and building of the historic landmark. Many people think this film was set in some dark future while others think it was pure fantasy. In reality for anyone who has ever read a comic book this was set in 1939. Despite it's many errors not the right camera not the right plane etc you have to suspend all belief and let your mind go to the fantasy world of science fiction the way it used to be. They're showing The Wizard of Oz at a theater. So is it 1939 or some distant future retrospective as some have claimed? It's winter as snow is falling on New York City yet there is something odd about the skyline. To me this film contained all the elements of a good sci fi movie some from Wizard of Oz some from Things To Come even some from King Kong. I especially liked the sound effects from the robots. Does anyone remember the Martian war machines in War of the Worlds? The cars were especially nice vintage 1930s yet not a single one could be identified. And Bazooka chewing gum? Don't see much of that these days. The special effects were awesome and the notquitecolor look of the movie gave it extra oomph if you will. It looked old. This film could've been made in 1939 had they the technology. All in all it was a fun ride an adventure around the globe impossible situations machines and even a rocket ship. Most people forget these days that there was a time that scientists believed if a rocket would leave Earth and punch a hole in the atmosphere it would start a chain reaction and incinerate the Earth! With time running out literally at the last second Sky Captain stops that from happening. For those of us who enjoy Ray Bradbury stories and H.G.Wells then this is the film for you where the impossible is not only possible it seems logical. One of the finest sci fi movies ever made. Also when they're showing pictures of giant machines from all around the world if you look carefully you'll see Godzilla in Tokyo. Great shot!".

Manufacturing industries were still a significant part of the US economy and factory workers were a good example of the average American. The word downsizing hadn't entered the general vocabulary yet but everyone knew the phenomenon. Bruce could be heard on the radio singing Foreman says these jobs are going boy and they ain't coming back to your hometown. Chrysler had just been bailed out by Uncle Sam. Bumper stickers could be seen saying Buy American  the job you save may be your own.Gung Ho does a better job of capturing the mood of the American industrial workforce than just about any other popular movie made during that period. Certainly the movie has its flaws  some loose plot threads and mediocre acting jobs by everyone except Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe. But the story really is about the meeting of East and West Keaton's Hunt Stevenson personifies America brash and confident on the outside yet insecure underneath. Watanabe's Kazuhiro personifies Japan on top of the heap with a successful system but wondering if there is more to be learned from their Western rivals. The movie's plot flawed as it is simply provides a framework for the conflict and eventually synthesis of their two personalities.Keaton's acting overshadows everyone else's and practically makes the movie by itself. I've always admired Keaton for his ability to deliver  lines that feel improvised no matter what script he's following. His character Hunt Stevenson is a likable affable everyman a natural leader with a wiseass streak. But he has a fatal flaw common to many of us he doesn't want to disappoint anyone. He'll distract the crowd with inspirational anecdotes and even lie rather than point out the ugly truth.Kazuhiro is the mirror image of Stevenson shy and introspective but also because of his Japanese upbringing reluctant to be the bearer of bad news. The scene in which Stevenson first comes to Kazuhiro with the employees' grievances captures perfectly the Japanese approach to workplace conflict. Kazuhiro replies to Stevenson's complaints with I understand what you are saying but won't refuse his requests out loud. Stevenson misinterprets this as agreement and goes away saying Okay we've got that settled. This is still a problem in JapaneseAmerican business relations in the 21st century!Ultimately Kazuhiro and Stevenson have the same problem get the factory working smoothly meet production goals and fulfill their responsibility to the workers under them. In working towards this goal they each have to take a page from the others' book. Kazuhiro's family becoming more Americanized is an obvious example. Also note that Stevenson thinks it's odd when Kazuhiro explains how he had to make a public apology to his workers for failing them  and yet later in the movie Stevenson does exactly that himself.The plot and its resolution are a little cornball but hey this is a comedy. If you can overlook the movie's flaws there is a great story about selfrealization and openmindedness here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Way way back in the 1980s long before NAFTA was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities the United States and Japan were at each other's throat in the world manufacturing race. Remember sayings like 'Union Yes!' 'the Japanese are taking this country over' and 'Americans are lazy?'As the Reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace director Ron Howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash 'Gung Ho' which drew over 36 million in U.S. box office receipts. While in many ways dated Howard's tongueincheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today.'Gung Ho' focuses on Hunt Stevenson Michael Keaton the automakers union rep from Hadleyville a small depressed town in the foothills of Pennsylvania. Stevenson has been asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo similar to reallife Toyota which is considering a U.S. operation at the town's empty plant. With hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse Assan decides to move in and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line.The 112 minutes of 'Gung Ho' is a humorous look at these two sides with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered on one hand an American workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism on the other hand Japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of selfworth. In Stevenson we find an American working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings. With the survival of his workers' jobs and most of Hadleyville on the line Stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble. Besides answering to the heads of Assan we witness a delicate balancing act between Stevenson and his fellow union members many of whom he grew up with. This includes Buster George Wendt Willie John Turturro and Paul Clint Howard Ron's brother.The Japanese cast is headed by Gedde Watanabe also known for 'Sixteen Candles' and 'Volunteers.' Watanabe plays Kazihiro the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for American life. He is constantly shadowed by Saito Sab Shimono the nephew of Assan's CEO who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order. While given a light touch these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the Japanese working culture.With Hunt Stevenson dominating the script Michael Keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work. 'Gung Ho' is indeed a slamdunk success for Keaton who also teamed with Ron Howard in 1994's 'The Paper.' He made this film during a string of lighter roles that included 'Mr. Mom' 'Beetle Juice' and 'The Dream Team' before venturing into 'Batman' 'One Good Cop' and 'My Life.' It's also hard not to like Gedde Watanabe's performance as the odd man out who first wears Japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with Stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit.The supporting cast is topnotch including Wendt Turturro Shimono and Soh Yamamura as Assan CEO Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers supplies a romantic interest as Audrey Hunt's girlfriend. Edwin Blum Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel teamed up for Gung Ho's solid writing. The incidental music which received a BMI Film Music Award was composed by Thomas Newman. Gung Ho's soundtrack songs are walltowall 80s including 'Don't Get Me Wrong' 'Tuff Enuff' and 'Working Class Man.'The success of 'Gung Ho' actually led to a shortlived TV series on ABC. While more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago Ron Howard's film still has its comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and is a tad shortchanged. Audio options are provided in English 5.1 surround English Dolby surround and French 'dubbing' but subtitles are in English only. There are no extras not even the theatrical trailer. On the plus side Paramount's digital transfer is quite good with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound. While a few extras would have been helpful  especially that 'Gung Ho' was a box office success  there's little to complain about the film presentation itself. out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "With no laughs but with important messages Gung Ho manages to be a reflexive entertainment about the cultural and economical clashes of two nations when they join forces to rise from the ashes an automobile factory that can be the only hope of saving a town. Michael Keaton plays an American executive who gets the job of rescuing such factory with a new leadership coming from Japan with a desperate executive Gedde Watanabe trying to save his career from potential failure. The latter's task is to command the American plant and their workers accustomed to work in a particular way trying impose the Oriental methods of working for long hours for the benefit of the company and such clashes with the interests of Keaton who's trying to look good before his friends who aren't used to such working journey. But let's face it the movie isn't funny. Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz are terrific writers Splash Parenthood but they didn't create much moments we could say they were funny most of the time is just using of caricatures to make some amusing moments they barely work maybe two or three scenes. Their concentration to the more engaging aspects was what made Gung Ho something really worth seeing. It pokes fun on the culture comparisons between U.S. specially when it comes to both nations traditions but it also establishes a greater sense of supporting each other one might be better than the other but only together they come up with something bigger better and stronger. Having a movie like this made on a decade where American superiority was presented in every single movie and also in politics is something of a miracle. It basically says We're no longer the strongest nation in the world neither the most efficient but we can aspire to be if we follow some other examples around the world. Sure it doesn't paint a fair picture for both sides Japanese as workaholics who can't contest their bosses and Americans as lazy and incompetent often recurring to stereotypes but presents something good out of those. Although a little sloppy clichd and never serious enough Gung Ho can be used as a source of inspiration at least for those who have a company and doesn't know how to bring out the best with their employs it's always there to bring out of the best of a team push them to the limits and show them the advantages of following new directives. I know this movie is something of a classic between Administration students in here and most of them enjoy it. Out of this department it might be a disappointment for Keaton and Ron Howard fans they're not at their best. The supporting cast formed with the likes of Mimi Rogers George Wendt John Turturro Rance and Clint Howard save this for a bit but the most interesting in scene is Watanabe the funniest in the show. In the end it reaches its purpose of presenting a parallel between cultures but never takes our fully enjoyment neither much of our laughs. Easy to watch and quite motivational though. 710".

Hunt Stevenson Michael Keaton was so obnoxious arrogant and disrespectful that I found it hard to watch him. He embodied every negative stereotype of Americans. If that wasn't bad enough once the small American town's finest workers were shown the image only got worse. On the opposite spectrum the Japanese were presented as emotionless robotic workaholics. The movie wasn't even all that funny I only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it. And I'm glad I continued the watch.Just like boxing judges are swayed by how you finish the round. This movie went from about a three up to the seven I rated it because of the ending. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious ending and this was just that. It was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory but what was most special was the marriage between the Japanese customs and values and the American customs and values. It was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note.".

There was a strange awkwardness throughout the whole film as if there wasn't a clear vision of what was supposed to happen. Many scenes were almost funny or even almost dramatic but very rarely hit the mark. Also by the late 80s pop music hit an absolute low and here we get to sample some of the most awful tunes including one near the end in the factory that actually spoiled a scene that could have accomplished something. I must also point out the strange acting or was it bad casting or directing? Watanabe was great in Sixteen Candles but was he a little young to play a top executive or was that just me? George Wendt was very odd doing things that didn't quite make sense or feel right. I really wanted to like it and I guess it was pleasant enough but I realize now why it's only rated a 5.7.

Gung Ho is a bit dated as far as the Japanese stealing American jobs idea is concerned. Still it's a fun light hearted family comedy of the type that Ron Howard excels in making. The supporting cast bring up the rear quite well with the likes of George Wendt Gedde Wanatabe and John Turturro. Ron Howard manages to fit his brother Clint into the movie like he always does and thank God that Ron became a director or Clint would be wandering the streets somewhere. The story itself contains a continuous series of laughs and also has the moral of we can learn from each other at the end. Bottom Line A serviceable 80's comedy from Michael Keaton's glory days.".

Grew up as a kid in the nineties around adults like him and can't say I'm a fan. I mean this is the all the guy was good for back in the eighties playing a company man for corporate propaganda movies. It's why his career went south for a few decades.Since this movie has made both the Japanese and Americans have lost respect and trust in the corporate world.

	schema:reviewBody "This may not be the funniest comedy as the movie raises a few guffaws here and there but it's the very real scenario in the clash of two cultures that makes the comedy work. Again this film originated from a song deals with car union boss Keaton again working his winning on screen presence merging with a Japanese boss Watanabe at an American car plant. Now in new hands the American workers are butting heads especially Wendt's character with their new Asian bosses as they have different work strategies and ethics. The film masks and breathes real life into the complications that arise between both parties Watanabe's boss is a real sour puss where to the Asians American workers are slack. There lies a real challenge if you turn out 15000 cars a month as everything the Japanese do are quick. Just look at the new unoccupied cities they build. It also shows how conformity sucks something in real life I think sucks. Keaton's way of dealing and manipulating this I liked but does bow to the bosses demands put on himself on some occasions the cold skinny dipping scenes with him and his counterparts overtly so. Watanabe's character I liked because he's the only real one who gets how America thinks and is sympathetic like when a workker injures himself. He can't show this of course cause he'll cop crap from the bigger guns and that will ruin his career which as you see reflects on his own personal life. The dinner meeting at his home the scene seemed very hostile and standoffish and I really liked Mimi Rodgers defiance to stay at the table where the other woman were told to leave. That was brassy. The Pretenders 86 hit Don't Get Me Wrong over the opening credits of the aptly titled Working Class Man a.k.a Gung Ho seemed weird or questionable where the title song rocks at the end over end credits with a sea of plant workers doing exercises whatever one thing our fine American workers find stupid. An insightful and well crafted filmcomedy and a definite recommendation from me. Just don't rely solely on it for laughs.".

I always liked Keaton for his wisecrack manner and facial language for me one of the best. Watching today the picture has lost some of it's vibe from three decades ago. Times change and tastes change so I guess that accounts for most of my sentiment. The culture clash between American and Japanese workers is at the heart of the story here and how midlevel managers Hunt Stevenson Keaton and Oishi Kazihiro Gedde Watanabe direct their approach to work. Americans are industrious and competent but by the Eighties the demands of family life often took priority. Whereas for the Japanese work is the defining characteristic of one's life and other considerations are not allowed to intrude. The picture seems to take a fairly well balanced approach in bringing each side over to the other's point of view. I had forgotten most of the supporting players here. Mimi Rogers George Wendt and John Turturro had modest roles supporting Keaton and after a while I came to realize that a different name was used for Watanabe's character every so often like Kazoito and Takahira. In his own inimitable style Keaton called him Kazmania and my own personal favorite Kazmonaut. Well like the man said it's not brain surgery. The ending of the picture seems to come together out of left field to reward the citizens of Hadleyville for pulling out a win in the fourth quarter like Hunt promised. It's a little convoluted and feels forced but if you're a Michael Keaton fan it ought to work well enough for you.".

This is mostly a comedy just for the sake of comedy but there is a cultural message here. The Japanese find out how hard it is to have a bunch of bluecollar Pennsylvanians make cars the Japanese way efficiency zero defects  and all that.

	schema:reviewBody "Bernadette Soubirous 18441879 was a modest shy retiring religious girl of strong convictions in her faith who would have passed through this world unnoticed by many but for an incident in her hometown of Lourdes in France. If you believe it was all a hallucination than this film will mean nothing to you.But there are a great many people who believe that the pious young lady was chosen for a visit from the Virgin Mary one day when she was an adolescent teen. The Virgin Mary appeared to her several times in that location which in fact was the town garbage dump. In that spot an underground spring was discovered that had healing properties.The film is based on a historical novel by Franz Werfel and Darryl F. Zanuck decided on an unknown to play young Bernadette. The girl chosen was Phyllis Isley of Oklahoma whose name was changed to Jennifer Jones and in her third film and first under her new identity Jennifer Jones walked off with Best Actress Award of 1943. She beat out such seasoned veterans as Ingrid Bergman Joan Fontaine Jean Arthur and Greer Garson. I'm sure it helped Jones that Fontaine and Garson were the previous two year's winners that the film was such a hit and that David O. Selznick had totally flipped for her and used every bit of influence to get that Oscar.With all of that and a great performance as well. Jones captures both the simple beauty and piety of the young girl who may have been given insights into matters spiritual. Playing the Virgin Mary in an unbilled part was Linda Darnell a fact I believe that did not come out until after Ms. Darnell's death in 1963.Director Henry King gave his young unknown a lot of support by assembling a thoroughly professional cast without a bad performance in the lot. Such people as Lee J. Cobb Vincent Price Charles Dingle Gladys Cooper Roman Bohnen and Anne Revere were just perfect in their parts.As was Charles Bickford in the role of the priest and director of the Catholic school in Lourdes. He's very skeptical at first but becomes her firm champion. Jones and Bickford became extremely close in this film she looked up to Bickford for the rest of his life as a father figure in Hollywood. Bickford was nominated for Best Supportin Actor but lost to Charles Coburn and Cooper and Revere both received nominations for Best Supporting Actress but lost to Katina Paxinou.Even with a more recent film telling the Bernadette Soubirous story that came out in 1989 with Sydney Penny this film is still owned and shown in many Catholic churches and schools to this day. But even the most hardened of unbelievers will be blown away by Jones's performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 'Song of Bernadette' gives us as viewers a little insight into the life of one of the best known saints in the Catholic religion.'St Bernadette'. It was from Bernadette's efforts and deep faith the spring of healing waters at Lourdes were given to us. From Our Lady and through Bernadette the spring started to flow.to this very day it continues to help the faithful who are sick and disabled.A beautifully scripted film it tells the story of Bernadette Soubirous a young French girl who was chosen above all others to bestow her eyes on the Mother of Christ. One day in a grotto in the province of Lourdes France she has a vision of Our Lady  The Immaculate Conception. The Story follows her journey from poor peasant girl till she enters the convent.One of the many reasons why I love this film is because of the sincerity and unrelenting faith one person can have faced with so much doubt and ridicule shown by others. The performance of Jennifer Jones is flawless proved in the fact she received an Oscar for her efforts. The other cast members were brilliant too each individual character portrayed their role with conviction. So many wonderful actors Anne Revere Vincent Price Charles Bickford Lee J. Cobb and Gladys Cooper in support. The production especially the set designs give a realism to the actual time period of France in the 1800's. Altogether this film accumulated 4 Academy Awards and 3 of them unsurprisingly going to production Cinematography Art Direction and Best Musical Score. I give it a well deserved 910.".

From Our Lady and through Bernadette the spring started to flow.to this very day it continues to help the faithful who are sick and disabled.A beautifully scripted film it tells the story of Bernadette Soubirous a young French girl who was chosen above all others to bestow her eyes on the Mother of Christ. One day in a grotto in the province of Lourdes France she has a vision of Our Lady  The Immaculate Conception. The Story follows her journey from poor peasant girl till she enters the convent.One of the many reasons why I love this film is because of the sincerity and unrelenting faith one person can have faced with so much doubt and ridicule shown by others. The performance of Jennifer Jones is flawless proved in the fact she received an Oscar for her efforts. The other cast members were brilliant too each individual character portrayed their role with conviction. So many wonderful actors Anne Revere Vincent Price Charles Bickford Lee J. Cobb and Gladys Cooper in support. The production especially the set designs give a realism to the actual time period of France in the 1800's. Altogether this film accumulated 4 Academy Awards and 3 of them unsurprisingly going to production Cinematography Art Direction and Best Musical Score. I give it a well deserved 910.";

It takes place at a convent after Bernadette has been accepted as a nun. Sister Marie Vauzous who has doubted Bernadette the entire film stands over her in a pose of authority and accuses her of trying to get attention. Sister Marie is lit from an angle at sharp focus which accentuates the lines and imperfections of her face as she asks for proof and laments about her own suffering. Meanwhile Bernadette is lit straight on with a soft focus as usual and the smoothness of her peaceful humble face is perfect and divine. She agrees with Sister Marie that she is a hundred times more worthy than herself all the while hiding the true nature of her own suffering. It is at this point that the Christian theme of salvation through suffering which has meandered its way through the film really makes its point and it is a genuinely moving moment.".

The performances of the other cast members were also on a par with the lead role. I will here only mention a few. Charles Bickford as the priest who first scoffs and eventually becomes a firm believer was his very best. Vincent Price who is always able to play a villainous role to perfection was excellent as the doubting prosecutor who cannot be convinced. And Lee J. Cobb turns in an excellent performance also. But the second kudos of the film go to Gladys Cooper who should have won a best supporting award as the old nun who cannot accept Bernadette for who and what she is. Finally a note for the person who said the was no song in the movie and questioned the title. The whole film was a song or more correctly a psalm of faith and the psalms were never sung but spoken. The music of ALfred Newman again underscores the action of this film perfectly. It is high on my top twentyfive films of all time.".

One day while helping her sister and schoolmate gather firewood Bernadette sees the Blessed Virgin Mary standing in a nasty old grotto. Due to her poor schooling Bernadette doesn't even know who the woman is but  upon Mary's request  Bernadette continues to come and see her for 15 days.On one of these days Mary commands a confused Bernadette to dig for a spring and to wash herself in it. Realizing there is no water nearby Bernadette digs into the ground and begins smearing mud on her face and arms. The crowd makes fun of her and Bernadette's family takes her away. Later on however water begins flowing from the spring Bernadette dug up and miracles occur. To this day miracles still occur with this water. Contrary to what some reviewers may say this film does not make Mary out to be greater than Jesus. Rather it makes her out to be a symbol of hope and a gift from God. This film is a mustsee for Catholics and Christians. Tears and goosebumps are guaranteed... possibly even increase in faith. I cry every time I see the scene where the mother dips her dying crippled baby into the water uttering the little prayer Take him O Lord and give him back to me. Whereupon shortly after this the baby is restored to perfect health and grows to walk. The acting in this film is astounding. 90 of the time it's hard to believe they're even acting at all. And the music is top notch. Give this one a watch... and pray to Our Lady for grace to become closer to Christ. 1010".

Surely this is one of her best roles as the movie is one of the very best. Charles Bickford is great as the dean of Lourdes and Gladys Cooper gives a memorable performance as Sr. Marie Thrse not to mention the great Vincent Price as the hateful yet intelligent Imperial Prosecutor.The town of Lourdes is taken back to the 1850s in this faithful retelling of the famous story of the apparitions of the Immaculate Conception way back in the last century.  The plot spans a number of years yet it never lingers.  It is just breathtaking.  The strong will of the feeble and simple Bernadette is the highlight throughout all of the movie.I was very much impressed by the character of Sr. Marie Therese.  From the beginning to nearly the very end she is a devil in robes of a nun always finding something new by which to ill treat the poor Bernadette.  Her character reflects a lot that of the dean however she was more blinded by jealousy than him. But like him she finally finds the proof she has been always seeking  the secret of suffering in silence  and from then on that is to say the last 7 minutes of the film she becomes Bernadette's best friend and helper.This movie is definitely a winner in all respects and its Oscar awards for  were all vell deserved.  A must to all the lovers of good great stories.".

Thus 20th Century Fox made clear it's stance on the incident involving a poor ignorant peasant girl from the western Pyrenees who one early spring witnessed a vision of a beautiful lady. Fox decidedly erred in favor of Bernadette's 'marion apparition'.  But it wasn't because the mammoth studio had gone all pious suddenly. It's that the demographs showed that a vast number of potential audiences across the country had for the longest time gone untapped. The Catholics. What's more the time seemed right to bring out the religious angle in a time of war. We looked to God for peacetime but raking in hefty profits at the boxoffice for such a sacred cause wasn't a bad idea either. Fox found their inspirational story from a most unlikely source who's own truelife story would have made a compelling screenplay. Franz Werfel  an orthodox Jew had taken flight from the Nazis. He needed desperately to be reunited with his wife in America by seeking out those who would help along the way. Stopping to rest in his escape in Lourdes which bordered occupied France and neutral Spain he found the people very sympathetic hiding him from the Germans until he was given safe passage to the US. It is in Lourdes that he learned of Bernadette Souibirous and made a promise to God that if ever he should leave Europe alive he would tell Bernadette's extraordinary story. It must've been a case of 'from Werfel's lips to God's ears' because that's just exactly what happened. In preparing the galleys for his book on Bernadette's account the suits at Fox got wind of it and bought the rights to the film even before the publisher had the book on the stands which would become an enormous best seller in 1943. This was Jennifer Jones first leading role in a major film and few of us I believe could deny that her sensitive portrayal was nothing short of a miracle. A convincing harrowing portrayal of a pious ingenue without ever once being mawkish. Now that's walking a tight rope between instinct and skill. The rest of the cast is uniformly fine especially Anne Revere as Louise Soubirous whose brilliant career would run afoul of the House Commitee for UnAmerican Activities labeled a communist sympathizer. As for the reallife Bernadette she was canonized in 1933 the same year it was decided to remove her remains to Never. Something even more startling however is that when her remains were disinterred some seventyfive years after her burial she was found virtually in tact an incorruptible. Needless to say the Church had all the justification it needed in declaring her a saint. And to this very day many who 'believe in God' make pilgrimages to the little grotto where the vision took place and the spring which brought about so many miraculous cures. There is in all this an interesting bit of irony though. The uncredited role of the 'beautiful lady' went to Fox contract player Linda Darnell who would have a brief but successful career playing 'bad girls'.".

I recently took a look at the novel and must say I found it laboriously detailed with regard to all the political events going on at that time in that region of France. The simple story was buried under so much clutter that it's wonderful to see how the film overcame all of this with a script that is concise and to the pointand yet does contain some of the historical background that was so detailed in the book. All of the performances are superb the most outstanding being Charles Bickford as the Dean of Lourdes and Gladys Cooper as a stern and unbelieving nun. Alfred Newman's score is magnificent and now available in its entirety on CD dual CD in fact since it's an extensive score. Whether you are Catholic or not your enjoyment of this movie is guaranteed if you enjoy a wellacted well scripted film version of the legendary story. I have to report that this is one case where the film is much better than the novel in every way.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE CIRCUS United Artists 1928 written produced directed and starring Charlie Chaplin is a welldocumented gem about circus life mixing comedy and sentiment in the best Chaplin tradition ranking this one of his finer yet neglected achievements of the 1920s.In it Chaplin plays a tramp who drifts at the midway of the circus after being wrongly accused of a theft and chased by a policeman. His escapades are mistaken as part of the act which stirs roars of laughter from its audience. Because his circus has not been earning any profits the ringmasterowner Allan Garcia decides in hiring Charlie as his top attraction. However it is learned that Charlie is only funny whenever he blunders to his viewing public. Charlie soon learns from the abused Merna Merna Kennedy how valuable he really is thus making demands of quitting to his employer unless he ceases mistreating his stepdaughter and offers him a higher salary which he does. All goes well until Rex Henry Crocker King of the High Wire joins the circus and becomes attracted to Merna causing Charlie to vie for her affections any which way he can.With the circus being one of the more famous backdrops of many movie comedians andor comedy teams ranging from W.C. Fields to Laurel  Hardy The Marx Brothers to Martin and Lewis THE CIRCUS stands out more for its ingenious use of difficult gags comic timing and the effort that went into it to make every gag funny as well as realistically done. Rarely seen since its original theatrical release THE CIRCUS came into full view again shortly after Chaplin's death in 1977. Newly scored and restored by Chaplin himself in 1968 as mentioned in the new opening titles with his singing of Swing Little Girl recorded on the soundtrack during the opening credits my first experience with THE CIRCUS was in 1980 at New York City's Regency Theater 68th Street and Broadway where the revival theater which no longer exists having been demolished in 1998 paid a tribute to Chaplin with a series of shorts and features including THE KID 1921 MODERN TIMES 1936 and THE GREAT DICTATOR 1940. Being surrounded by an appreciative audience laughing at a silent film made long ago indicated d THE CIRCUS has stood the test of time and what a comic genius Chaplin was especially when demonstrating how difficult performing comedy can be as his character finds he has to be funny and isn't and at the same time showing how poor he is as a comic to the circus staff and how funny he is as a bad comedian to the movie audience. While sitting in the dark movie theater of all ages at the Regency the biggest laughs occurred during the opening as Chaplin hides from the law inside a fun house surrounded by mirrors and later making a fool out of the rival pickpocket Steve Murphy as they each attempt to fool the policeman by pretending to be movable statues Charlie's encounter with a lion while locked inside the cage and the biggest topper of all being Charlie doing a tight rope wire act and trying to balance himself while loose monkeys crawl all over him thus disrupting his act. These same gags obviously brought forth many laughs in 1980 as it did in 1928 and continue to do so today. In between these gags comes pathos which Chaplin also succeeds without hurting the continuity.Chaplin staff players regulars such as Harry Bergman as the Clown and Stanley Sanford as the Head Property lead fine support. Others in the cast include Betty Morrissey as The Vanishing Lady George Davis as The Magician John Rand Albert Austin and Heinie Conklin in smaller roles.In spite of its true greatness it's hard to believe how underrated THE CIRCUS has become not having the appreciation as Chaplin's own masterpieces THE GOLD RUSH 1925 and CITY LIGHTS 1931 even by Chaplin himself. It's been said that during the making of THE CIRCUS Chaplin was going through personal problems of his own including divorce and the passing of his mother. It's even more ironic the elimination of THE CIRCUS from Chaplin's own autobiography published in 1964 while his other works were profiled to great extent regardless of his nomination as Best Actor and Best Comedy Director by the Academy for 192728 awards. At least this has been amended through its reissue throughout the years to a new generation of movie lovers.Distributed onto video cassette as part of the Chaplin centennial collection in 1989 THE CIRCUS currently on DVD made its presence known on television in the height of cable television notably on the weekly series Dead Comics Society on the Comedy Channel hosted by Kevin Kline around 198990 followed by American Movie Classics 19972000 and Turner Classic Movies where it made its debut in 2003.THE CIRCUS a 70 minute comedy is a fine study to film students and anyone appreciating and supporting the art of silent comedy.

Chaplin once again dons the role of the tramp this time having all sorts of adventures and misadventures under the big top.In order to evade the police who suspect him of being a thief the tramp ducks into a circus tent and acts as if he is part of the show.  The cops follow him into the tent and try to apprehend him with comical results. The crowd goes wild believing all this was planned ahead of time.  The audience's reaction is so strong that the tyrannical circus owner hires him on the spot.  When it is discovered that Chaplin cannot be funny intentionally the owner gives him a job as a prop man clumsily lugging equipment around the tent as part of the show.  Again the crowd roars its approval at his inadvertent antics and soon the tramp is the circus' main attraction.  In the meantime he falls in love with the owner's daughter a bareback rider who herself loves the tightrope walker and romantic complications ensue.The Circus' is an allaround Chaplin effort.  In addition to playing the lead role he wrote directed produced and edited it and composed the music as well.  It is a meticulous production on all counts with each sequence choreographed to elicit the maximum capacity of laughter from the audience.  The scenes in which the tramp is pursued through a hall of mirrors trapped inside the lion's cage and forced to double for the missing tightrope walker stand alongside his finest achievements.  The ending sequence is especially heartrending as many are in his films.  Here is a movie to be cherished by all fans of Chaplin but appreciated even by casual viewers.  This is because it achieves a rare blend of comedy and poignancy through appealing sympathetic characters and with genuine honesty adding a note of realism to counterbalance the clowning.".

And it took two years to plan and film starting in 1926.And in some ways this is the best of them all for the simple reason that it avoids that occasional cloying sentimentality that you either love or tolerate in his other classics. It's a pure light clever cinematically sophisticated comedy. And the physical tricks the timing of certain gags is breathtaking. It also has a deeply satisfying ending shot in 1927...which you might see echo of in the last moments of Being There with Peter Sellars from 1999.The Circus is just over an hour and it never flags never repeats is never strained. Chaplin had the rare ability to do the most outrageous things and make them seem perfectly plausibleeven though we know better. It's partly because he would do dozens of takes perserverance to the point of madness as he said until it felt right. A note on the sound. This was a true silent film on its release. In the 1960s and 70s Chaplin created musical soundtracks composed by himself and made edits as well for his earlier features. The song sung over the opening credits on the Warner Bros. DVD is Chaplin himself as an old man singing a song he composed. It's not really legit in terms of period 1928 but it feels good. The music is fairly innocuous but a bit too emphatic at times. Still it's better than the addon tracks most silent films get these days and Chaplin was smart to have paid it attention.Most of all this is funny uncompromised Chaplin genius.

	schema:headline " Chaplin's comedy about comedy is sweet funny and beautiful";
	schema:reviewBody "The Little Tramp is chased into a circus tent during a performance his antics prove funnier than those of the clowns and the ringmaster hires him for the show.When a comedian plays a character who is inadvertently hilarious it can seem narcissistic just check out Jerry Lewis's The Errand Boy where Lewis has his supporting cast praise the comic genius of the character played by Jerry Lewis. Despite this danger and despite Chaplin's offscreen egotism the premise plays beautifully especially since The Little Tramp though not Chaplin is such a terrible comedian when he's trying to be one. My favorite moment is when the ringmaster demands the auditioning Tramp to be funny right that instant the Tramp grins and shyly dances around a bit gingerly falls down puts his cane between his legs and meekly lifts himself back up. Terrible! roars his wouldbe employer.This film has more selfawareness over comedy conventions that any other Chaplin I know of. The Tramp ineptly but hilariously performs a couple of standard comedy routines with the other circus clowns. Later there's a funny twist to the old banana peel gag and near the end he crashes into an old general store looking as if he's thrust himself back into his old Keystone days. This is Chaplin's last true silent film and the Keystone moment feels like a nostalgic farewell to the past.The Circus is funny throughout but the opening scenes are probably the best. There's a marvelous funhouse sequence and a priceless routine where The Tramp pretends to be a motorized dummy. Has anyone seen the Swiss clock routine from Your Show of Shows? He also falls in love with the ringmaster's cruelly treated daughter which leads to a poignant ending.I enjoyed the music which Chaplin composed for this film in 1969. His scores are always repetitive but they're also sweet and funny and they enhance the action. I could have done without the titlesequence song which he sings himselfsomething about looking up at rainbows. Otherwise this comedy is nearperfect and holds its own against Chaplin's even greater features The Gold Rush City Lights and Modern Times.".

This is because of the movie's rather romantic leaning but here audience is spared the endless romantic dribble of a character in love. Instead the movie was able to move constantly forward spurred purely by Chaplin's exaggerated facial and body expressions. The movie also works without sound because Chaplin's Tramp character would probably come across as a bit of an imbecile with sound rather than naive with all of his accidental highjinks and follies. It is this naive innocence that makes the Tramp so likable and when he losses Merna at the end Chaplin's face and defeated body language do more justice to the sad moment than any dialogue with him lamenting her loss could have.

Unusual for any other leading man but Chaplin was such a legendary icon even now when he was only making one film every few years his mere outline was enough to announce his presence. But with such a status came a certain weariness and The Circus is one of a number of pictures in which Chaplin lampoons the whole process that made his name.A lot of the business in The Circus is about Chaplin's ability to be naturally comical and the shortcomings of being an employed comedian. It's interesting how more than any Chaplin picture that came before or after The Circus seems to be putting us the audience into the little tramp's experience. There are a number of point of view shots and often characters addressing Charlie are virtually staring into the lens as opposed to the profile shots he usually stuck to. Even the shots in the ring do not give us the perspective of the big top crowd and instead the camera looks in on the action from the performers' entrance. The camera is always in the sawdust and never the stalls. This is from its very first scene clearly a backstage movie. It may seem a subtle shift but Chaplin is certainly drawing us more to focusing on the lives of circus folk and away from thinking of the circus as entertainment. It's notable too that Chaplin's best comedy vignettes occur outside the big top.It seems Chaplin was increasingly giving larger and more substantial roles to his leading ladies. Oddly however while Merna Kennedy plays the most fleshedout female lead of any Chaplin picture to date she seems less of a focus for the camera which barely lingers on her. From what we can see she is not bad but she lacks the calm dignity of Edna Purviance and Georgia Hale or at least does not get to display such a thing. More reassuringly there is a decentsized part for Chaplin regular Henry Bergman as an old clown. Bergman had been a comedy performer for decades and had even worked in a real circus in his youth so he certainly knew what this role was about. With some heartfelt facial acting amongst all his usual huffing and puffing about it is probably his finest performance.If The Circus is known for anything it tends to be the very fact that it is not as well known as many of Chaplin's other features. Chaplin himself does not even mention it in his autobiography the imaginatively titled My autobiography  but then again being the legend that he is he doesn't need a punchy title to promote his own name. But far from neglecting the work Chaplin gave it surely his neatest and most delicate updatejob when he came to overhaul all his silent features for rerelease in the 60s and 70s. Unlike The Kid and A Woman of Paris from which he cut several scenes and The Gold Rush which he all but butchered in 1943 The Circus is left intact. He also treats it to its own theme song under which the opening credits are intercut with shots of Kennedy on the trapeze creating the most tender and lyrical opening of all his pictures.".

Chaplin himself does not even mention it in his autobiography the imaginatively titled My autobiography  but then again being the legend that he is he doesn't need a punchy title to promote his own name. But far from neglecting the work Chaplin gave it surely his neatest and most delicate updatejob when he came to overhaul all his silent features for rerelease in the 60s and 70s. Unlike The Kid and A Woman of Paris from which he cut several scenes and The Gold Rush which he all but butchered in 1943 The Circus is left intact. He also treats it to its own theme song under which the opening credits are intercut with shots of Kennedy on the trapeze creating the most tender and lyrical opening of all his pictures.";

The way the characters fit their roles really helped with not being able to hear them. The exaggerated actions and facial expressions were key to telling the story and keeping my attention. Another very important part was the use of music to set the mood and pace of a scene which worked well. This film has made me want watch more Chaplin films and try other silent films.

I also loved the recurring despondent theme of love which provided The Circus's more touching moments but there are also some truly brilliant slapstick setpieces especially when Chaplin walks a tightrope with falling trousers and a clinging monkey while the chase through the hall of mirrors and the scene in the lion's cage are also inspired.

For this reason I find it very important to continue to support their work and look for further and deeper truths. What can be gleaned from this is astonishing. There is so much sadness joy anger and fear lurking at the surface it takes multiple views to catch it all. What Chaplin does with this simple story his incredible array of stunts and comedic situations and that memorable little Tramp make for one of the greatest of all silent films one worthy enough to be mentioned with City Lights The Gold Rush and the other Chaplin classics.

This doesn't mean it'll make you cry like City Lights or be somewhat enlightened like Modern Times but it has a fresh and joyous and innocent delight in its making and Chaplin as the Little Tramp where here he's more than ever like a simple cartoon character thrust into this roughandtumble circus world with a mean ringmaster and kind and kind of loving girl.And it's not just the infamous climactic tightrope act although if for no other reason that's one big reason to see the film as the little Tramp goes haywire with his plans to safely go across the tightrope. It's just the entire assemblage of skits and moments little things that might seem silly to talk about like Chaplin locked in a lion's cage or trying to 'learn' a barber trick and how it unfolds with a precision and finesse yes finesse that is just short of genius if not that. In fact a big point in the film is try and act funny which is not something that can really be barked on command to anyone especially the Little Tramp who in essence garners his comedy from unintentional goofiness embarrassment or humiliation on the parts of others or just plain old physical pratfalls. What we get in the Circus is the tale of the classic clown in the midst of a whole programmed slew of them and what it takes to make it in it or what humanity is there.As said it doesn't necessarily have the best love story even if that's touching and it doesn't make some big statement on the workingman or society in general.

Will he be able to keep the audience's belly's giggling with laughter and will he strike gold with the lady? From what I had heard of this film I expected bigger laughter.

The Tramp has a nice personality he gives up the girl he likes for her happiness. Two good parts are when he's auditioning for roles in the circus and failing miserably and when he takes the tight rope walker's position and nearly kills himself. Charlie Chaplin does a good job of expressing what is going on regardless of the silence and the song he sings at the beginning and end of the film is a nice touch. All in all I give it a rating of 510 because although I got bored half way through there is an appreciation for early movies you must have.".

It's course of course is the town and the race is on to stop them before the town is destroyed.For a 'B' film it's wellacted with Grant Williams star of The Incredible Shrinking Man in the lead and Lola Albright of Peter Gunn TV fame as his girlfriend. It's always good to see the gorgeous Albright in her younger days a classic beauty. The supporting actors in here were fine too. Nobody sounded wooden. The monoliths  the specialeffects  were welldone too for its day. They were interesting not scary and the soundeffects that went with them were effective.In all not something you'd watch over and over but certainly worth one look and it is a worthy additon to the recentlyreleased SciFi Ultimate Collection pack.

The menace here are crystals that expand to enormous proportions when they come in contact with water. The crystals are also deadly if touched by someone when they are expanding.The film has good but obvious special effects. The crystals rising and expanding are done simply by pushing them up through holes in the table top miniature sets. Grant Williams fresh from THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN gives a good performance despite the fact his role is the standard scientist type found in most films of this nature from this period.Film historian Bill Warren correctly described THE MONOLITH MONSTERS as Universals last adult science fiction of the 1950's. After THE MONOLITH MONSTERS every horrorscience fiction film PRODUCED by that studio were lackluster quickies THE LEECH WOMEN THE THING THAT WOULDN'T DIE etc. thrown out to support much better imported Hammer films like HORROR OF DRACULA or independent acquisitions THE 4D MAN.

However the threat here is not the usual giant insect or alien invader but rather a meteorite which has splintered into a number of small shiny black rocks. What happens with these rocks is absorbing but audiences then and now seemed to want villains with emotions and personalities. Rocks with curious properties or inanimate machines such as in Kronos don't provide the necessary thrill. Calling this movie The Monoliths would have been more apt since it can't deliver the shocks you'd expect from a movie with Monsters in the title. Besides while the town of San Angelo is threatened the movie never really convinces you that the world itself is also in danger. Still this is a brisk and efficient piece of entertainment that has been put together with a degree of care which belies its modest budget.The story on which Monolith is based was cowritten by Jack Arnold who also directed its lead actor Grant Williams in that scifi classic The Incredible Shrinking Man.".

	schema:headline " Interesting yet could have been more";
	schema:reviewBody "Monolith Monsters was unique in that it took a different approach to 1950's scifi. There were no alien monsters. Atomic radiation didn't spawn them. You couldn't just blast them with guns. There weren't any miracle chemicals or devices needed just good oldfashioned common sense.   In a nutshell a meteor crashes into the desert outside a small Arizona town leaving a huge crater as well as thousands of small but smooth shiny black rocks. When these rocks come in contact with water they absorb the silica content and begin to grow until the silica source is gone. When they grow tall enough gravity makes them unstable and they fall only to have the shattered pieces grow yet again. In this way they spread forward in a seemingly unstoppable wave of destruction. By the way they absorb any kind of silica including the small quantities the human body uses to make skin flexible so fingers and joints can bend and so organs like the heart and lungs expand and contract. Thus when humans handle a wet rock they literally are turned to stone.   Despite the unique plot you come away from the movie feeling somewhat disappointed. Director John Sherwood had only two directing credits to his resume. Most of his career was spent as an assistant director up until his death in 1959 two years after Monolith Monsters came out.   The cast is credible though not used to anything close to their abilities. Grant Williams so brilliant in The Incredible Shrinking Man plays hero Dave Miller somewhat distractedly. His love interest Cathy Barrett is played by Lola Albright Peyton Place. She's so syrupy and sweet it's absolutely nauseating. Her portrayal was typical of female characters in '50s scifi and horror but she was way over the top in this role.   Les Tremayne a wellknown veteran of radio theater and screen in such films as War of the Worlds is totally wasted. If he had simply left the set one day into filming and had never returned his role could have simply been written out with no production delays or problems whatsoever. He mostly stands around in the Arizona heat in a white suit listening to the other characters emote. Other veterans like Richard Cutting Attack of the Crab Monsters Phil Harvey The Deadly Mantis and Steve Darrell Tarantula are likewise wasted.    Much of the actors' dialog is stilted and unnecessary like the actors were getting paid by the word. Also their interaction is way too pat. Everyone comes off like they live in Pleasantville instead of Our Town.   The holes in the plot are glaring. For instance when Williams and a professor played by Trevor Bardette go out to find the meteor crater they locate it and see the hillside and plains surrounding it covered in the small monolith fragments. Later during a driving rain storm they pair drive out to the crater and watch giant monoliths growing out of the mouth of the crater. Somehow the director Sherwood forgot about the fragments and the area around the crater should have been thick with thousands of growing monoliths.   Also you get the feeling the movie ended too soon although that's typical of scifi films of the 50s and 60s. Most never made it to 90 minutes in length. So here you get to see the monoliths destroy a farm and you see a few townsfolk affected by the monoliths but that's it. To me it seemed to lessen the potential thrill factor. Also a lack of common sense does in the film. I won't give away the ending but a mean of stopping the rocks is found but the actors intimate that if it fails in one instance that the rocks will never be stopped and will destroy the earth. Common sense says that since the monoliths are in the middle of the desert and the solution is so common that there is plenty of time to stop the monolith monsters.   Still the movie is interesting enough for a late Saturday night. The movie was adapted from a story called Monolith that was cowritten by Robert Fresco and Jack Arnold. Interestingly enough Arnold directed Williams in The Incredible Shrinking Man. Arnold had a lengthy director's resume including directing and producing some 30 TV series ! including Wonder Woman and The Bionic Woman. One wonders if Arnold should have directed Monolith Monsters.   You can tell the film was from Universal Studios even if you miss the opening credits. The town of San Angelo doubled as Desert Rock in Tarantula and was also used in It Came From Outer Space another Jack Arnold classic. The music done by an uncredited Henry Mancini can be heard in many other Universal monster movies. Steve Darrell Phil Harvey and Richard Cutting were stock actors for Universal.   On a side note look real close at the scene where extras are working feverishly at the dam. The man waiting for word from Williams so he can trigger the main weapon against the monoliths is an uncredited Troy Donahue. Universal did the same thing in 1955 with an uncredited Clint Eastwood in Tarantula. It took years for people to pick up on the cameos.".

The fragments of a meteor that struck nearby the community of San Angelo possess the strange capability of growing to skyscraper proportions when activated by water. The alien monoliths crumble under their own weight shattering into even more pieces capable of growing and destroying everything in their path. But the danger goes beyond the destruction caused by the falling rock formations. Any living being that comes into contact with the monoliths is turned into stone. It's up to geologist Dave Miller Grant Williams and a band of plucky locals to find a way to stop the threat to San Angelo and ultimately the world.I just love these 1950s era Universal scifihorror movies. They're so much fun to watch. From the steady enjoyable cast headlined by Grant Williams and Lola Albright to the crisp clean black and white cinematography to the familiar but effective stock monster music The Monolith Monsters is the kind of movie that never fails to provide a great deal of entertainment value given its relative modest budget. I get a kick out of the number of Universal films from this era that take place in some small remote South Western desert town like San Angelo you can thank Jack Arnold for the desert setting. It's a perfect location or this kind of movie. The Monolith Monsters also features some nice special effects. I'm sure it was difficult task to make rocks look menacing. The scene where one towering rock formation after another rises from the desert floor and crushes a small farm is very effective. Another plus for The Monolith Monsters is the intelligent script again you can thank Jack Arnold for this. Sure the movie is filled with a lot scientific mumbojumbo but in this case it actually has an air of believability to it. Finally The Monolith Monsters benefits greatly from the steady hand of director John Sherwood. He may have only directed three movies but he capably pulls all of the elements I've mentioned together with nice pacing and interesting camera shots to create a rock solid pun intended movie experience. Overall it's a job well done.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Monolith Monsters follows the usual scenario of Universal's 1950s monster movies. An illunderstood menace threatens the town or the country or mankind. Men wearing uniforms try to deal with it but it's the scientists who come to the rescue. Sounds like the Cold War. In this case  in this inexpensive and late case  the imagination of the writers had just about reached rock bottom.The monsters are rock pylons generated by a meteorite. They grow at a phenomenal rate when they are in contact with water sucking all the silicon out of whatever material they touch including human flesh.

	onyx:emotionText "The Monolith Monsters follows the usual scenario of Universal's 1950s monster movies. An illunderstood menace threatens the town or the country or mankind. Men wearing uniforms try to deal with it but it's the scientists who come to the rescue. Sounds like the Cold War. In this case  in this inexpensive and late case  the imagination of the writers had just about reached rock bottom.The monsters are rock pylons generated by a meteorite. They grow at a phenomenal rate when they are in contact with water sucking all the silicon out of whatever material they touch including human flesh. The victims are turned to stone.The meteorite has landed on a mountain top in the desert but unfortunately a rain storm activates it. These huge black towers grow visibly then crash and splinter into hundreds of smaller pieces which grow in turn.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps it is all because of Grant Williams. Williams was a B film actor who was best known for his starring and titular role in The Incredible Shrinking Man generally acknowledged as one of the most literate and high quality B sci fi films from the 1950s. In watching the DVD of his next noted film The Monolith Monsters I was struck by how well written a film that film is also even as it is another B sci fi film. No Williams' role in the 77 minute black and white film from 1957as was The Incredible Shrinking Man is not as important as his role in the prior film but his mere presence it seems raises the bar for the other actors. In a sense he was a B film version of Marlon Brando who always seemed to elicit the best out of his A film costars.Another positive for the film is that of all the 1950s horrormonsters from space films The Monolith Monsters is likely among the most plausible scenarios to be explored almost like an early version of The Andromeda Strain save that the monsters are not microscopic and biological but huge and chemically reacting black crystal columns that have no agenda. They are not aliens nor atomically irradiated mutants just meteor debris that grows when it comes into contact with regular water and is destroyed by salt water. The former property is shown early in the film when a rock gets some water accidentally poured on it when a car radiator overheats and its driver pours in water. Even worse is that the rocks can turn people to stone once the water has activated their mysterious otherworldly properties.The credit for the bulk of this film's success however belongs less with its director John Sherwood who was directing only his third low budget film and more with the film's cowriter the science fiction writer and film director Jack Arnold who also helmed two classics of 1950s sci fi and horror The Creature From The Black Lagoon and This Island Earth. There are the standard sci fi inexplicabilities such as all the right folk are right where they are needed at exactly the right time no one calls the Feds nor the National Guard petrifying limbs would fall off with gangrene etc. and other sorts of silly science but the wit and dialogue especially in a brief scene with veteran B film actor William Schallert as a discombobulated meteorologist trying to tell Dave Miller when the thunderstorm is expected to end are first rate. Arnold's cowriters on this film were Robert Fresco and Norman Jolly but the film has all the hallmarks of a classic Arnold film. Why he did not direct it is probably only because he was juggling many other film projects at the same time.The film also pulls off a rare feat its ominous opening voiceover monologue by Paul Frees who forebodingly intoned the opening of many sci fi films marveling over the wonders of 'Science!' and such and was also a voice for The Rocky And Bullwinkle cartoon a few years later. His booming voice was ripe for parody and that he undercuts some of his own pomp shows how good an orator he was for he opens this film with a monologue that both satirizes and pays homage to even worse monologues from far worse films. It starts out 'From time immemorial the Earth has been bombarded by objects from outer space bits and pieces of the universe piercing our atmosphere in an invasion that never ends' and gets even better or worse from there. Then we see the meteor crash which is another version of the same scene from the earlier Arnolddirected Universal film It Came From Outer Space. But the film also succeeds with some fairly innovative low budget special effects from cinematographer Ellis W. Carter. The effect of the growing monoliths which grow in size and depth was never revealed but likely done by the optical illusion of forced perspective by pushing the monoliths through the set for the upward height and moving the camera toward them as the camera zooms outward. A similar technique was used to great effect in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo.The DVD is part of a five film three DVD package called The Classic SciFi Ultimate Collection. Well not really but The Monolith Monsters shares its DVD with Grant Williams' other film of note The Incredible Shrinking Man directed by Arnold. The other three films in the set are Tarantula another Arnold flick The Mole People and Monster On The Campus which featured Troy Donahue. Despite the Ultimate in the pack's title the only extra feature The Monolith Monsters comes with is its original theatrical trailer. As Arnold and Williams are key 1950s sci fi figures an expert in that era's genre films would have made for a potentially great audio commentary. On the plus side Universal did a superb job in restoring the film the transfer is stunning and almost wholly blemish free and in its original 1.331 aspect ratio. Also of note is a quite effective film score by a young and uncredited Henry Mancini.The Monolith Monsters is not a great film by any means but it's a damned good B sci fi film leagues above the usual crap from that era or any era and because of its hints of plausibility and being played straight it traverses that thin line between cheesiness and real drama and tropes toward the better side. Let all things sway in such a way.".

If you know even a bit about science its frustrating as all getout. So the geologist takes a break from his pontificating to call a meteorologist to find out when the rains will stop. The weatherman goes on for a few minutes with an equal verbal mess disgusting the geologist who demands that he just answer directly.For the era the effects are pretty effective. Its a good idea and pulled off fairly well.Oddly there is drama in the end that is not well exploited. The final defense concerns blowing up a dam having the water flow through some salt piles reach the desired amount of salinity and then cover precisely the right area to stop the progress of the monoliths. The drama in the movie is our hero's decision to blow up the dam without the governor's permission.The actual risk is that if the required salinity level wasn't reached the water would work against humanity and I wouldn't be here to type this.

Monsters that you can't hate because they aren't living adds a unique twist. The special effects are very nicely done and the acting is good. The film has a special interest to me because of the filming locations. In my twenties I spent a lot of time in the high desert near Victorville and many scenes appear familiar. I only discovered Monolith Monsters within the last year and was very pleasantly surprised to find a quality sleeper from the 50's. A lot of 50's SciFi films contained cheesy elements that are fun to poke fun at. This film holds the distinction of not displaying any of those elements. I don't find anything to ridicule in fun. I sincerely hope that there are many sleepers of this quality out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "This interesting Universal scifi outing starts out with a geologist Phil Harvey finding an unusual rock in the desert...then he's found the next morning by partner Grant Williams...and Harvey is solid as a piece of granite! It turns out that the rock in question was a mysterious meteorite which grows uncontrollably when exposed to water.Naturally there's an extended storm and pretty soon there are towering slabs of rock marching through the desert threatening to break out and wipe out earth as we know it. Williams and his old professor friend Trevor Bardette race to solve the mystery in order to stop the rocks from breaking out of the valley in which they're confined. Their solution is unique and the story has a positive and happy ending.I was a little disappointed when I saw this film as a kid there were no monsters per se like hairy guys with eight eyes. I now view the movie as classic 1950s scifi. Even though John Sherwood got directing credit the hand of writer Jack Arnold is evident throughout from the desolate desert locations to Williams' heroic character.Williams is pretty understated as usual but Les Tremayne as the local newspaper editor and especially Bardette are outstanding in this intelligent story. Lola Albright is also great but her school teacher character unfortunately takes a back seat to Williams'.The special effects may seem quaint to those used to modern stuff but they're excellent for the era and quite convincing especially when the monsters fall over and multiply. Also be sure to examine the scene in which Williams is studying a thin rock section without the benefit of an objective lens in his microscope. He must be one heck of a geologist!Good story direction and special effects add up to classic and unique science fiction. Okay some facets are dated look at that massive iron lung! but this is a fine movie. Very enjoyable and it respects its audience.".

Maybe that's why to this day I have a nifty little collection of rocks and minerals. An IMDb real treat was reading a comment that archly questioned 'why the green face on the cover'. DUH! Anyone knows there were no discolored humans simply wonderful tall phallic and lumbering black monoliths. I suspect stock cover art was pulled of the shelf for quickie publishing. Shame!".

Or at least enjoyable in a surreal lunatic sort of way. This movie seriously doesn't have a brain in its head.In every sense a Bmovie it most resembles those gleefully exploitive lowbudget movies that Roger Corman and Russ Meyer made decades ago where biker gangs did battle with their switchbladetoting girlfriends at their side. And it's every bit as silly as it sounds which could be either good news or bad news for you depending on what kind of filmgoer you are.Personally I knew it was crap the whole time but still had a blast watching it. The story is ridiculous and the dialogue is ludicrous these characters exist in a world where when a girl says Nice bike the guy says Nice a and she LIKES it. But I cannot fully resist a movie in which two improbably beautiful biker chicks stare each other down on their bikes in a photogenic deserted alleyway both of them in front of huge product logos for extra giggles one of them yells Bring it on b! the other whips out a switchblade and then they charge! As a classic Bmovie enthusiast I offer no apologies for having fun watching a scene like that.It's really not all bad either. Martin Henderson and Monet Mazur have some genuinely nice and tender scenes together and the great colorconscious cinematography makes everything look so shiny you could eat off the screen. Jamie Pressly is an absolute hoot as the evil biker chick and Adam Scott scores some laughs as a conceited F.B.I. agent.Also several of the action scenes are pretty amazing once you get over the idea that this movie is obviously not taking place on planet Earth but rather some video game universe or a 12 yearold's dream.I wish Ice Cube was off doing the kinds of good movies he used to make like Three Kings the original Friday Boyz N The Hood Higher Learning Ghosts Of Mars... but he contributes some laughs as one of the heavies here. I do wish he had changed his expression at least once though. You know the one where he grits his teeth and curls his upper lip so that he look like he hates your guts and steam is about to come out of his ears? That's the one that he has throughout the entire movie.Basically I'm not gonna fight for this movie or anything I realize it's of essentially no value. I'll just say that it made it easy for me to shut off my brain and I enjoyed it and maybe you will too. I give Torque 3 stars the same way I would give Switchblade Sisters 3 stars.

Martin and Monet are beautiful to look at and almost pull off their tougherthanthou attitudes.  Ice Cube was dope meant in the good way not the dumb one and the bad boys and grrrrl were just too much fun.  Joseph Kahn shows promise as a director if someone will please put him on Valium his quiet moments were just as nice as his nonstop action ones.What's bad?  I can't say the script was because it's obvious there really wasn't one except in the loosest sense.  The editing was so in your face I got lost a few times and still cannot figure out how one character died except he went BOOM on his bike in downtown LA.  I was a bit offended at how all the black guys were portrayed in a stereotypical badassedmuthafkah way as opposed to the cool as cucumber confidence of the lead three and she and the we're refugees from MAD MAX baddies.Let's put it this way  cotton candy is probably the worst thing you can put in your body in the way of anything edible but if you got a craving for it nothing else will do.

Ice Cube was dope meant in the good way not the dumb one and the bad boys and grrrrl were just too much fun.  Joseph Kahn shows promise as a director if someone will please put him on Valium his quiet moments were just as nice as his nonstop action ones.What's bad?  I can't say the script was because it's obvious there really wasn't one except in the loosest sense.  The editing was so in your face I got lost a few times and still cannot figure out how one character died except he went BOOM on his bike in downtown LA.  I was a bit offended at how all the black guys were portrayed in a stereotypical badassedmuthafkah way as opposed to the cool as cucumber confidence of the lead three and she and the we're refugees from MAD MAX baddies.Let's put it this way  cotton candy is probably the worst thing you can put in your body in the way of anything edible but if you got a craving for it nothing else will do.  And that's TORQUE to the max.";

I just had a laughing fit writing that.Ice Cube shows up as the angriest biker in the world. He has a permanent scowl on his face. Just looking at him had me laughing. All the macho elements of a biker flick are on proud display. The hard rock was cranked up as the bikers did battle. There was Kid Rock and StaticX. It was a hard rock party. I had a good time.Speaking of StaticX the last scene with super hot Jaime Pressly has Push it blasting away as she does battle with the main blonde biker. Ah Jaime. What a special effect you are.

You know that when you are going to watch a movie like Torque you are going to see a bad story with some second rate actors but with some nice action.And this movie surely has some nice action. The motorcycle sequences are surprising good and tense. Most of the stunts were nicely choreographed and the movie has some nice camera tricks and nice editing. It's obvious when watching this movie that Joseph Kahn is a music video director but that certain style works perfect for a fast paced movie like this. Joseph Kahn seems like a talented and well motivated director of which I'm sure we will hear more of in the future. Yeah sure the ending is pretty bad and fake looking but it didn't ruined the movie for me in any way. I was entertained throughout the entire movie by some nice action.The movie has a bit of an awkward kind of humor which they should had left out in my opinion. The script is not very well written but still the actors pull it of to make their characters likable and give them a personality. Would I mind seeing Torque 2? Most certainly not! I would rather see a Torque 2 than a The Fast and the Furious 3.Really just give this movie a chance you might very well end up liking it.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 2004 Torque cost 40 million and only made a little over half back at the USA box office. It's therefore not a very wellknown film but its gained a hardcore cult following in the years since. After viewing it I can see why.I thought it was going to be terrible but it was actually great! The action goods are all there but five minutes into it I got the joke and was laughing with it and not at it. I don't think Torque will appeal to everyone but it will get two types for sure action gearheads who just want a solid uncomplicated action picture and smart viewers who can appreciate clever filmmaking and the injokes threaded throughout. I fall under the second bracket since I generally loathe mindless action flicks. What takes Torque beyond mindless physicsdefying action is pointed out above the film is cleverly made and filled with hilarious injokes. Director Joseph Kahn has a history in flashy music videos and this comes across on the screen. It's pure eyecandy from beginning to end with all manner of entertaining tidbits like the brief closeup of the turtle between the racing cars at the very beginning.The look  vibe is pure comic book come to life. Every shot facial expression action scene confrontation word set pose etc. reflects this. The bikes are mostly crotch rockets but there are all kinds. The guys are coolness personified and the girls are hotness incarnated. The cast is highlighted by Martin Henderson as the worthy protagonist and Monet Mazur as his babe. Ice Cube is great as the leader of a black gang while Matt Schulze and Jaime Pressly play the villains. There are also a couple of FBI agents in the mix.The cinematography is gorgeous shot in the desolate regions of S. California.The film takes no prisoners at a brief 84 minutes. This is good since films of this ilk shouldn't overstay their welcome.Believe it or not there's actually some depth to the characters and storyline we see glimpses of courage love friendship repentance respect sacrifice and loyalty. If they would have upped the depth and offered some moving epic parts I would have easily given the film a top rating of 910 Stars.But it works fine as is. It is what it is  perhaps the ultimate cult action film ever made pulsating with energy creativity and excitement.GRADE B or A".

I don't think this movie will appeal to everyone but it will get two types for sure action gearheads who just want a solid uncomplicated action picture and smart viewers who can appreciate clever filmmaking and the injokes threaded throughout. After seeing the cameo of Dennis Weaver still being chased by the truck from Duel after thirty years I was won over by the Torque's own charms. First of all it the director cinematographer and editor did a great job. This film looks incredible. For those of you who actually care about filmmaking this film is densely loaded with interesting angles and techniques that somehow manage to work as a cohesive style. I love the way Joseph Kahn stages scenes. It's very creative and he has a sharp sense of timing  action and comedywise. An overlooked first effort and I would like to see more from him. Second I thought Martin Henderson as Cory Ford did a solid job as your typical running from the law good guy. I liked his charisma and hope he does more action flicks. There are some standout sequences but my favorites are the opening car chase the train sequence the freeway and the surreal overthetop Playstation style ending. What's great is that each has its own feel so that there is no sense of repetition. You feel like each chase brings something new to the table unlike other ilk of this genre. Need I say anything about the women in this film? Wow. I would let Jaime Pressly ride my bike anytime she wants. A word about the bad reviews here ignore them. The film is too good as an action movie to be dismissed  what are the looking for Cold Mountain? Disregard anyone who complains about the pepsi product placement for that is most definitely someone who did not get the joke two motorcycle dominatrix chicks staged opposite from each other under big prominent soft drink signs  classic!. I think the movie suffers from a minor contradiction  it's script is too dumb but it's filmmaking is too smart. Yes the story is crap but you don't watch a motorcycle chase movie for STORY. If you sit back and enjoy this modern riff on Roger Corman you might find a smile on your face. If you have the ability to appreciate the sly wit of smart visual filmmaking you could find yourself cheering like I did. Worst movie ever? Ridiculous. Three 12 out of five stars maybe more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made by people who realise how ridiculous and excessive the average Hollywood action movie has become Torque revels in the glorious absurdities of the genre while simultaneously poking fun at the outlandishness of it all for other examples that adopt the same approach see Con Air the Charlie's Angels movies and the more subtle  misunderstood Escape From LA. Make no mistake this film is  intentionally  a shiny multicoloured liveaction cartoon that has as little to do with reality as the average press conference by the Bush Administration.In this movie every action setpiece breaks several different laws of physics. Bikes don't just crash in Torque  they explode into fireballs with such ferocity that anyone nearby is thrown twenty feet into the air. Chases through city streets are conducted at such intense speed that bystanders are blown over and car windows shatter. Product placement isn't sneaked into the background but blatantly placed at centrestage. Every male in the film is either handsome  slim or bulky  menacing while all the women are centrefold material. It's the kind of movie where a badass like Trey Ice Cube somehow manages to lead a gang of outlaw bikers who control most of the crime in downtown LA while refusing to deal drugs or have drugs sold on his turf. It's the sort of film in which the hero proves he's innocent of murder when in fact his alleged 'evidence' would never stand up in court and is promptly allowed to walk away without even giving a statement to the police despite the fact that during the course of the movie he's stolen several vehicles been responsible for the deaths of numerous bad guys and caused an immense amount of property damage. It's not meant to be taken seriously for a second and if you keep that in mind it's a lot of fun.Since all the characters are barely two dimensional stereotypes the cast is hardly taxed but do what they can with what they're given. Martin Henderson as the hero is bland but not as wooden as he could have been while Monet Mazir as his girl and the world's most glamorous mechanic is fairly spunky. Will Yun Lee from Witchblade and Die Another Day and Jay Hernandez draw the short straws as Henderson's sidekicks they have so little to do that there seems no point having them in the movie and you wonder why their characters weren't written out while the script was in development. Matt Schulze as chief villain Henry James is surprisingly low key considering his cocky swaggering turn in The Transporter but still makes an effective nemesis. One of those actors clearly born to play bad guys Schulze could become the Christopher Walken of the 21st century if he plays his cards right. In fact none of the cast truly disgrace themselves and the only false note is skinny Brit actor Max Beesley bizarrely miscast as James's righthand enforcer.However the movie's one star turn is provided by Jaime Pressly as China James's girl. Even though she's only on screen for about 15 minutes throughout and has about five lines of dialogue when Pressly turns up you can't look at anything else. And I'm not talking about the fact that she's undeniably easy on the eye or clad in barelythere leathers  this girl has star quality. With her face set in a permanent sneer amongst an explosion of piercings and tattoos China is the Biker Vixen from Hell and Pressly doesn't just steal this movie  she rules it.".

A B movie is low budget. This was obviously not low budget. I would have to lighten up to the degree of being an overexposed photograph of the kid from Powder to even watch another minute of this film again.There is something about cult or campy flicks that is difficult to explain. On paper or at face value a campy movie can be bad but there's a sense of fun in it. You can watch Faster Pussycat Kill Kill and think that they actually had fun filming it AND screening it. You watch Torque and you think that on day 33 of the shoot it must have been painful beyond belief for the crew to answer their alarm clocks.Torque doesn't work in ANY labeling of film. It isn't low budget. It doesn't feel campy. It isn't even funny bad. Unless the real life actors are complete idiots in real life they must have been downright embarrassed by this. It paid their bills though.There is ZIP for any sort of conversation that even mildly could be construed as entertaining. The editing is a total MTV hyperkenetic ADD disaster. The stunts are neither even remotely plausible or interesting. The love interest scenario was as clich as possible. Ice Cube couldn't act his way out of a styrofoam cup in any movie previously and it still shows.I feel that this movie was literally a physical challenge to watch. Around the midway point I felt like I had just free climbed Devil's Tower. Perhaps I lost a few years of my life from the physical exhaustion this movie delivered to my body.On the upside though  I feel like after having watched this movie I could watch any 9 hour insurance seminar without batting an eye.

But while the setting is not unlike those movies criminal gangs racing each other in custom vehicles there was still a big difference in how the movies played out. First of all i like the style of Torque a lot better. Granted the overthetop racing sequences with quite a lot of CGI tucked in to create the illusion of speed are too much many times. But still there is a certain style and feeling here that actually makes it work pretty well.The beginning of the movie almost made me give up though. The hero arrives at a biker meet where women with more silicone than natural tissue greet him and it almost becomes too much to bear. But when the obligatory naked skin passes by the action picks up and so does the entertainment. Don't be mistaken this movie is a hopelessly juvenile testosteronefest. But in the genre it's not too bad.So if you like fast bikes and fast paced racing this might just be your choice for the Friday night entertainment. Easily digested easily forgotten but a fun ride while it lasts. I rate this 510.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was made because of the success of the Fast and the Furious. But in this they decided to use fast motorcycles instead of cars. A can't miss right! What were the producers thinking when they decided to spend 40 million on this? The extremely thin plot revolves around our hero Ford who is set up for a murder by the bad guy. The guy killed is the brother of our antihero Trey who of course isn't so bad after all. Then there is a twist involving the FBI cop but if you couldn't see it coming a mile away then this is your first movie.There were many outrageous stunts in this. OK I could get past two guys jumping a ramp onto a moving train and then driving through the train cars. And racing through a bunch of trees without getting killed. And I can even get past the ridiculous fight on motorcycles between the two girls. But the last 15 minutes where it looked like a video game was too much. It was so silly them saying this bike could go over 200 mph and then he does it through crowded city streets. Someone would be dead in seconds from running into something.But I must give props to Martin Henderson. He was very hot and I never heard of him before. Hopefully he'll get more mainstream movie roles because I sure don't mind looking at him for a couple of hours.FINAL VERDICT If you like movies with ridiculous stunts then this one is for you. Also if you want a good look at a hot new actor check out Henderson.".

	schema:headline " Worthwhile Western";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a fan of all 3 of this film's principals  Jean Arthur William Holden and Warren William. This film is not the premier vehicle for any of their talents however it is a very entertaining western. First if you have read some of the other comments I want to provide a few corrections. William Holden is NOT a drifter  he is in the United States Cavalry. He does not appear and disappear. Early in the film he returns rather expediently just like the Cavalry! to save Jean Arthur when Porter Hall has turned the tables on her so to speak and has her at gunpoint. Holden then pops in and out of Arthur's office a time or two while stationed in Tucson. Presumably he is on duty from time to time! Jean Arthur does not become feminine whenever Holden is around. To the contrary she is in her usual untidy male garb whenever he is around  even when he proposes to her! The first time she dons a dress is on the eve of Holden's trip back to Nebraska to acquire feedstock for the ranch they are building  which is the reason he disappears! The dress she makes clear is new for the occasion  intended to remind him of what's waiting for his return! It may well be her only dress  special for the occasion and in anticipation of her married life! She rides out to meet him with their new herd in her same old breeches and hat! Oh yeah  she wears a dress on their wedding day!Many negative comments have been made about the difference in age between Arthur and Holden. Actually I completely disagree with the criticism  on several levels. First from a technical standpoint I find it fascinating that in this film the customary casting technique is reversed! Male leads are usually old enough to be the fathers of their costars! But when I look at Arthur in this movie I fail to see a woman who is obviously older than Holden. I think Jean Arthur's age is always difficult to determine in film  if you are inclined to speculate on such matters. She seems rather ageless to me  and she certainly doesn't show her age in this movie. Even more to the point however I suspect that people who criticize the film on that basis are more influenced by other depictions by Hollywood of the Old West than by the reality itself. Women lived extremely hard lives in the Old West. Plus I have no doubt that the climate of Territorial Arizona would have rapidly aged a hardworking woman. Without modern moisturizers and astringents I suspect a woman's skin began to look twice its age after a very short time in that harsh environment. Thus if you do think that Arthur looks older than an admittedly very younglooking Bill Holden I suspect that's just about what you should expect of a female in that environment when compared with a recent arrival from less harsh environs further east. For a perfect illustration of this just check out Barbara Stanwyck in So Big. The use of hands as a symbol in that movie is wonderful!The story is a little uneven. Just how the arrival of the herd on the very day Arthur is to pay off the debt will help her circumstances is not made clear. No prospective buyer is ever identified. Nor has Warren shown any willingness to accept cattle in payment. AND After all the herd was intended to be the basis of their ranch stock. But never mind! The cast is stellar. Warren William stands out as the villain. Holden is good in his first starring role. Arthur always looks and sounds good even if she seems a little out of place in dusty Tucson  as opposed to an office on Capitol HIll! This is not a great western but it is a good example of a TYPICAL western. THAT is its strength.".

Male leads are usually old enough to be the fathers of their costars! But when I look at Arthur in this movie I fail to see a woman who is obviously older than Holden. I think Jean Arthur's age is always difficult to determine in film  if you are inclined to speculate on such matters. She seems rather ageless to me  and she certainly doesn't show her age in this movie. Even more to the point however I suspect that people who criticize the film on that basis are more influenced by other depictions by Hollywood of the Old West than by the reality itself. Women lived extremely hard lives in the Old West. Plus I have no doubt that the climate of Territorial Arizona would have rapidly aged a hardworking woman. Without modern moisturizers and astringents I suspect a woman's skin began to look twice its age after a very short time in that harsh environment. Thus if you do think that Arthur looks older than an admittedly very younglooking Bill Holden I suspect that's just about what you should expect of a female in that environment when compared with a recent arrival from less harsh environs further east. For a perfect illustration of this just check out Barbara Stanwyck in So Big. The use of hands as a symbol in that movie is wonderful!The story is a little uneven. Just how the arrival of the herd on the very day Arthur is to pay off the debt will help her circumstances is not made clear. No prospective buyer is ever identified. Nor has Warren shown any willingness to accept cattle in payment. AND After all the herd was intended to be the basis of their ranch stock. But never mind! The cast is stellar. Warren William stands out as the villain. Holden is good in his first starring role. Arthur always looks and sounds good even if she seems a little out of place in dusty Tucson  as opposed to an office on Capitol HIll! This is not a great western but it is a good example of a TYPICAL western. THAT is its strength.";

It was filmed just a few miles west of Tucson at Old Tucson where several famous westerns have been made and at what is now Saguaro National Park west unit. So this movie has the right look and feel to it.Knowing what the film was about in advance I had a difficult time seeing Jean Arthur in the lead role. But darn she was very good here...although it's a very long way from films like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington and other comedies of hers in that era. Of course she eventually did go on to star in Shane. But this film is definitely against type for her.Her costar  William Holden  is so young here only 22 that you may have difficulty recognizing him! But he does just fine also.Warren William is excellent as the bad guy you want to hate. The other character actors here do very well.This is an excellent film although there is one bit of illogical action. Apparently horses belonging to White cattle drovers run faster than horses belonging to Indians since the cattle drovers outrode the cattle but the cattle stampeded the Indians. Ah well it moved the plot along.Recommended.".

	schema:headline " A different Western oozes with charm and reality";
	schema:reviewBody "Arizona is a very enjoyable movie about pioneer settlement of the West. Without giving away the plot let's just say that it has enough twists and angles to make it stand apart from the normal grind of Westerns. It gives us a little bit of all the various stock parts of Westerns  Indians cowboys cavalry good guys bad guys guns and shootings robbery and romance sagebrush and scenery horses and a stampede a wagon train and cattle drive. But it's the way those bits are put together and woven into a nice story that sets Arizona apart and gives it the feel of an epic film. Jean Arthur is excellent as Phoebe Titus. She's a selfassured decent hardworking and tough Western gal with big dreams. We never learn why or how she got to Tucson on her own. But viewers are taken with her sincerity and toughness which has just a touch of humor. The men in the movie are also won over by her pies. I can't think of another Western that has a pie shop or stand in it. William Holden is a delight as Peter Muncie. This is only the fifth movie in which he was listed in the credits. It's one of his early starring roles and his very first Western. Holden's character has a very likable easygoing and pleasantness about him. A pity we didn't see more of that persona throughout his career. For most of his roles later on Holden had a more straight or serious demeanor  even dour at times.Another reviewer commented on Warren William's excellent role as Jefferson Carteret. He played the villain very well. William was a very accomplished actor who might have done some great films in the 1950s and 1960s. But he died in 1948 from cancer. He was just 53. He had played suave sophisticated and intelligent leading men and fiends and conniving crooks and scoundrels equally well. I especially enjoy him as Perry Mason in the original movies about that fictional detective lawyer. A number of other character actors gave banner performances in this film. Edgar Buchanan Porter Hall Paul Harvey and Regis Toomey stand out. The direction and cinematography were excellent and the musical score for this film was a delight. It received two Academy Award nominations one for musical score. Others have commented about the setting and feel of reality about the movie. Arizona was made in 1940 when it was possible to find space to shoot a film around Tucson that wasn't invaded by utility poles and lines paved highways and other signs of modern times. The ramshackle settlement of the early town sure gives it a feel of reality. I'm not so sure though how accurate a picture that is of Tucson at the time of the story. It's taking place around the Civil War years. The town of Tucson wasn't incorporated until 1877 but the town got its start a hundred years earlier. Hugh Oconor is the founding father of Tucson. He was the military governor of northern Mexico and authorized a fort to be built there in 1775. Even before that the very first development was the Mission San Xavier del Bac in 1700. The mission is still operating today and is a historic site south of Tucson. Columbia Pictures built the set for the film with a sound stage a few miles west of presentday downtown Tucson. It sat idle for a number of years after the movie was made. Then in 1960 it was fixed up and opened as an active movie set and tourist park. In time more streets were added and some amusement events were staged  gunfights and bank robberies. Nearly 70 movies have been filmed in part or in whole in Old Tucson as it is called. Most were Westerns but a number of mysteries and dramas were made there  even a comedy or two. John Wayne filmed four of his Westerns in Old Tucson  Rio Bravo McLintock El Dorado and Rio Lobo. A 1995 fire destroyed much of the set and sound stage but the community rebuilt the movie set town and it is still open today.".

It serves the role well enough but doesn't seem completely natural.Her particular talents were better served by good comedy roles in my opinion. What's more she seems too mature to be a plausible leading lady for a 22 yearoldand very youthful lookingHolden. I recall reading that she didn't want Holden to be her leading man and I can understand why. Gary Cooper wasn't available according to Robert Osborne and Arthur finally consented to Holden's selection.Arthur plays a pioneer woman with a lot of backbone ordering men around making plans that include a hubby and a good piece of ranch land and a futurealways spunky and up to the challenge whether it's a petty thief or a downright criminal trying to take over her business.She never quite convinced me that she was completely at home on the range while WILLIAM HOLDEN is very engaging in one of his less cynical roles and is refreshingly natural in a western role. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD WARREN WILLIAM too is expert as a con man posing as a helpful friend to Arthur while in reality leading a gang of swindlers and not above shooting his partners in the back.It's a well mounted western with plenty of shooting and riding lots of Indian extras and cattle herdsbut some draggy spots before a climactic showdown between hero and villain after which our hero and heroine head for the proverbial sunset as a married couple.Fans of Jean Arthur and William Holden should enjoy this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "NOTES The character played by Paul Harvey Solomon Waters was originally called Solomon Warner in the script. The name was changed for obvious reasons. Jean often calls him Sol or Wat in the actual movie. Also changed was a bit of dialogue in which Jean refers to him when overcharging her 25 cents for a needle as an old Jew. This became an old Scotsman. Mind you in my opinion the film would be improved a whole lot if most of the HarveyArthur material which is dull both in the writing and in the acting were cut out completely.Norman Deming who is billed here as assistant director codirected with this movie's 2nd unit director Sam Nelson two Columbia 1939 serials Mandrake the Magician and Overland With Kit Carson. I'm glad to say that the action material in Arizona is a vast improvement over Mandrake. I particularly like Nelson's pleasing habit of riding horses and wagons over the camera.COMMENT An attractively rolling title introduces this long lavishlybudgeted epic western in which the players do wonders to overcome their somewhat cliched dialogue and formularized roles though in 1940 they were probably less familiar as stock types of western characters. It's good to see George Chandler in a fairsized part as Hall's henchman. William plays the villain with his usual smooth assurance and Porter gives us his delightful characterization as a smalltime crook. Holden is effective too and even gets to sing I Dream of Jeanie which is then used as a romantic theme throughout right through and a few bars of Kiss Me Quick and Go in a pleasing light tenor all his own. Miss Arthur repeats herself from The Plainsman. There's plenty of action superbly directed by Sam Nelson with lots of running inserts as Indians bite the dust. Ruggles makes a commendable attempt to spice up the overtalky Jean Arthur scenes with tracking shots and often lots of extras milling around in the background. In fact the opening series of tracking shots as Holden and his wagon train come into Tucson is a classic sequence which belongs on anyone's list of memorable scenes. No expense has been spared to recapture the epic sweep of Cimarron though nonArizonians might well be bored by the constant plugs for the ideals and aspirations of the Arizona Territorians. It all comes to an effectively directed shootout climax though many western fans may feel cheated that it is shown through Miss Arthur's eyes and not through that of the protagonists. I thought it effective anyway. Paul Harvey has a major role which he plays somewhat indifferently. Addison Richards does not seem to be in the 127minute release print. However it is most attractively photographed with realistic sets that convey the primitive squalor of the early west.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arizona is directed by Wesley Ruggles and adapted to screenplay by Claude Binyon from a story by Clarence Budington Kelland. It stars Jean Arthur William Holden Warren William Porter Hall and Edgar Buchanan. Music is by Victor Young and cinematography by Joseph Walker Harry Hallenberger and Fayte Brown.It's 1860 and feisty Tuscon frontierswoman Phobe Titus Arthur has grand plans to ignite a freight business. But when romance with drifter Peter Muncie Holden leaves her off guard she could loose all to nefarious town competitors.It was a much troubled shoot blighted by weather cast decisions and suit executive expectations add in budget issues and some bloke called Hitler being a looming menace and the end product is not as envisaged by all. Yet in spite of it all and with a weak plot not strong enough to carry a two hour film it's not a half bad Oater saga.Pic isn't bogged down by the central romantic thread this is because it's nicely played and is merely one slice of Phobe's whole pie she is a pie maker in the beginning of story. In the mix is the constant of Apache threat who are duly on hand for action duties. There's the ongoing fall out from the Civil War ticking away the NorthSouth rivalries given thought the villainy  though not hard to spot  is sturdily played while there's a host of colourful characters filling out the play. Finally as a historical piece it earns its corn the formation of Arizona's formative year most interesting.It's old fashioned but in a good way and if not expecting an ebullient actioner then this has worth to the Oater loving crowd. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great value western. It is worth to review Arizona especially Jean Arthur beautiful and William Holden early in his career in a nostalgic and authentic Western. The film shows the colonization of the American West with the intense conflicts between cattle ranchers cowboys gangsters and all sorts of adventurers who have moved to that wilderness of the USA many paying dearly for their daring with their own lives. What we see in Arizona is certainly no different from what has happened in the vast majority of American states. The images are perfect people dress with what was possible in a backward and resourceless region. The physical types all indications are perfectly displayed dirty with ragged clothing. Violence prevailed in a region without law and without a minimum of justice. Everything here was very uncertain one never knew if it would be possible to return to the place where one was and even if there would be a day after. Relations were too superficial and life too short. But it also shows the spirit realized of the people of the Wild West and the character of Jean Arthur fully incorporates this spirit of struggle of achievement. It is a magnificent film worthy of being among the best westerns of all time. I believe that if it had been produced in color surely today it would be appearing among the great westerns.".
