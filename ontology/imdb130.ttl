	schema:reviewBody "One of the most interesting consequences of the brief period of porno chic in the early 70s was the resulting effect on the Italian exploitation industry.  Never quick to miss an American cinematic craze a lot of filmmakers found themselves curiously crossing genres and stuffing hardcore porn into other genres as well as vice versa.  The absolute master of this was the ubiquitous Joe D'Amato and here he fuses porno with the zombie movie which at the time was in the midst of enormous popularity in Italy.THE EROTIC NIGHTS OF THE LIVING DEAD was shot backtoback with the similar but more sexoriented PORNO HOLOCAUST.  In its full uncut form the scenes of XXX are strangely innocent.  There are a few explicit shots here and there but no actual penetration other than when one of the female characters hilariously opens a bottle of champagne with her genitalia! plus many of the scenes seem to cut away at strange times.  Whether this is due to an incomplete review print a Midnight Video release clearly made from two different prints spliced together isn't clear.  What is obvious is that as a sex movie this fails horribly.  Many of the erotic scenes also fall victim to Luigi Montefiori and Laura Gemser's obvious unwillingness to perform in hardcore sequences.  Many of the sex scenes are made up of Montefiori watching a female character masturbate before pretending to have sex with her often without removing his trousers first!The real benefit for Massacessi is that the sex allows him to pad out a horror movies that in actuality has only about 30 minutes of material. Almost all of the first hour revolves around sex and the horror portion of the story really only kicks in after that.  Massacessi was the first to admit that horror was not his forte although after seeing this it has to be said that porn clearly wasn't either! and by structuring his film in this way he can basically cover up his shortcomings whilst still producing a marketable zombie movie.Still as ever this is strangely enjoyable.  The final 30 minutes is actually quite atmospheric and there is some nice gore in there.  I hear that this movie is very difficult to get hold of in an uncut form review print was in unsubtitled Italian but as far as I can tell from my copy it is certainly worth seeking out as the cut print looks absolutely anaemic in comparison...".

	schema:headline " Hardcore softcore gore and melancholy voyeurism";
	schema:reviewBody "After pushing the envelope and erasing the borders between horror softcore and hardcore porn flicks in his Black Emanuelle movies Joe D'Amato went the whole hog here and made a film which could be at times classified as all of these things. It ends up being quite a mishmash but by the end as the images of coitus and demise have passed before our eyes in a two hour parade the film seems most like a kind of motion picture memento mori reminding us of the inexorable link between the little and big deaths.The film begins in a madhouse with D'Amato regular George Eastman who intriguingly wrote this film staring back out of the screen at us through a wired fence. We then follow a pretty young inmate as she searches out Eastman in the bowels of the institution finding him and engaging in passionate unbridled softcore sex. A shambolic drooling maniac has also followed them and he keeps at a distance touching himself and lolling his tongue as he peaks at their pleasures. We could almost take this as a metacinematic representation of D'Amato's cinema  we the audience are the drooling lunatic voyeurs watching our own fellow madmen portrayed in flagrante on D'Amato's cinematic canvas.The plot itself now begins as Eastman is revealed as the islandhopping skipper on a small schooner somewhere in the Caribbean operating a seabound taxi service for wealthy visitors. He humours the rich men whilst lusting after their bootyprize women. Meanwhile we follow Mark Shannon's property developer Wilson as he sources information on a local island hoping to build a luxury resort there and in the meantime ogle and frolic with the local whores. His frolicking set the hardcore action of the film in motion as the whores explicitly fellate him in the shower and he enacts cunnilingus with them on his hotel bed. After cutting between Eastman and Shannon for a while the two come together when the skipper agrees to take the developer and a golddigger he has picked up to the island ripe for developing. But we've heard sinister things about this place the socalled Cat Island it is home to a hoard of zombies headed by a cat ! the locals are terrified of it and some of them keep jujus to ward the evil off. We've also glimpsed some zombies bringing instant death to those they encounter with a swift chomp to the throat Before leaving skipper goes to a local bar where a girl he is involved with strips and does an act which involves masturbating with a champagne bottle and then popping it with her vagina. This is a long slow melancholy scene  scored with wistful music  in which the skipper alone in the bar watches the act with interest amusement impressed but still with a nagging feeling of loneliness. In D'Amato's universe the viewer is alone shown exotic and erotic sights but removed alienated atomised and ultimately sad.The skipper and his two passengers sail to Cat Island and there encounter an old black man with an eggshaped disfigurement on his forehead and his luscious granddaughter played with an exquisite lack of affect by Laura Gemser. They warn the visitors against messing with things but Wilson insults them offers them money and generally causes offence. Gradually the dead rise and interrupt the various erotic scenes which ensure killing Wilson and aggressively establishing their ownership of the island. Gemser is a kind of succubus making love to the visitors whilst the dead rise in the background. The old man gives the skipper a juju which has some effectiveness in warding off the dead but which is lost in the final melee leaving the skipper vulnerable. He does escape with the golddigger but they have both been driven mad by the experience ending up making manic love which puts them right where we first saw them in the lunatic asylum. Their lovemaking and the drooling idiot's view of this is interrupted by the guards. Skipper and girl are dragged back to their cells they are convicted of Wilson's death and cannibalisation and the loon is told that he should stop playing with himself and grow up. The audience are thus instructed to put their own private parts away and the film ends.Erotic or Sexy as the credits have it Nights of the Living Dead doesn't altogether work  it is overlong languorous and underdeveloped in terms of plot. Yet its mix of hardcore porn extreme gore and softcore frolicking make it a compelling example of D'Amato's refusal to stay put in any one genre. In throwing  almost willynilly  meat shots coy fondling bloody death and monsters at us whilst constantly reminding us of his male characters' ultimately sad position as voyeurs sometimes conscious and lonely sometimes drooling and outofcontrol and by suggesting that sex in the face of colonial exploitation and strident displays of wealth he does go someway to offering a compelling vision of late 20th century Western man on the rocks of alienated enjoyment whose erotic nights are indeed those of the living dead.".

This merely is a routine Italian zombie film like Zombi 2 or Zombie Holocaust with a handful of hardcore sex sequences thrown in during the first half hour. And as crazy as it may sound it actually is a pretty decent zombie movie if you just ignore these totally redundant porno moments and focus on the beautiful island location and rather stylish gory makeup effects. There's the typically obnoxious businessman who buys a tropical island with a vicious reputation and intends to build a tourist resort there. Along with a macho sailer and a whore he picked up in some hotel he goes to scout the place but stumbles upon an uncanny old man and his ghostly granddaughter that rule over the island.

George Eastman clearly is in great shape again as the stud but he still doesn't manage to script down one reasonably good dialogue. There are a couple of atmospheric zombieattacks and explicit gore. You can't possibly expect more from a Joe D'Amato film apart from sleazy oddities in the script maybe like the girl who ingeniously uncorks a bottle of champagne by using her vagina only !.".

	schema:reviewBody "Erotic Nights of the Living Dead 1980  out of 4 XXX versionInfamous Joe D'Amato film that mixes Italian gore with Italian sex. Three people head for a deserted island to have a lot of sex and to see if a hotel could be built on the island. They should have listened to all the rumors because zombies are there waiting. This is an extremely weird and bizarre film because the producer's wanted two films made. One a porno and another a horror film so the director just combined the two elements. Running at nearly two hours this thing goes on for way too long which is why I wish the hardcore sex scenes would have been removed. There's a soft version out there that I keep meaning to see because I'm sure I'd like the film better minus the sex scenes. The zombie footage on the other hand is wonderfully done with a lot of great atmosphere and gore. D'Amato was a master behind the camera and the cinematography here is terrific as is the music score. Laura Gemser George Eastman and Mark Wart Nuts Shannon star. This here is a lot better than the director's first horrorsex film Porno Holocaust which was filmed at the same time with the same cast of this one.Sexy Nights of the Living Dead 1980  out of 4The version under this title is the pure horror version which is missing all of the XXX scenes. For years I had been wanting to check this version out because I felt that the hardcore scenes in the uncut version were all rather ugly and did nothing erotic and instead they just dragged the film down. It was interesting watching the film without the porn scenes because you realize that the Joe D'Amato film has more problems than just the porn stuff. For starters even without the hardcore sex there's way too many softcore scenes that are also not erotic. I was really surprised to see how silly the majority of the scenes are because it's clear that the main intent was just to show sex. Another major problem with the picture is that it just takes them way too long to finally get to the island where the zombie stuff happens. The zombies as great as they are are pretty much wasted because outside a couple scenes early on the majority of their screen time happens at the very end of the movie. It's really a shame that they weren't given more screen time because I felt the horror elements were quite strong and they keep the movie interesting. Even though he was unable to make anything erotic D'Amato did do a good job building up a rather bizarre atmosphere. This version clocks in at 100minutes which means it is missing twelve minutes worth of hardcore scenes. So is this version better? I would say that it is simply because it's shorter and as I said the hardcore scenes were rather ugly and added nothing to the picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who has seen Porno Holocaust will know exactly what to expect from Erotic Nights of the Living Dead as the two films feature basically the same cast and plot lines. Joe D'Amato is often held in high regard by cult horror fans and he has made some excellent classics in the genre but to be honest I really don't know where he's coming from with the whole pornzombies thing. Last time I checked the living dead aren't sexy and mixing an average zombie film with a load of porn isn't exactly a guaranteed recipe for success. As mentioned the plot is basically the same as the one in Porno Holocaust and focuses on an isolated island. A group of sex starved or not people travel to the island for some reason or another but naturally the island is infested with zombies. This doesn't stop the travellers having sex with each other every five minutes the zombies do prove to be a bit of a nuisance. That's about the long and short of the plot really...This film is slightly better than Porno Holocaust but only slightly. The two films suffer from the same main problems Erotic Nights of the Living Dead is also far too long and it takes too long for anything to happen too. The sex is mostly quite boring too which obviously does the film no favours. The film features two of exploitation cinema's biggest stars in George Eastman also the writer and Laura Gemser. Gemser however doesn't turn up until we get over the halfway point. There's a fair bit of gore in the film some of it quite hardcore but it's clear that the sex is the main focus. The zombies themselves are the typical Italian style crusty looking things not very convincing! As mentioned the film is far too long and the plot really drags on numerous occasions which is a shame. There really isn't much to this film it's very much what you'd expect so if you're looking for something substantial then look elsewhere! I can't really say that I found Erotic Nights of the Living Dead all that enjoyable so I won't be recommending it but I guess some sleaze fans may get a kick out of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Erotic Nights of the Living Dead is a somewhat entertaining zombieporn mixture.SPOILERSHeading out on a trip Larry O'Hara George Eastman has his boat hired out by John Wilson Mark Shannon an American businessman for a trip to a nearby island. Taking along companion Fiona Dirce Funari they seem initially weary of the journey due to local legends about a race of zombies controlled by an evil cat creature they land on the island and find that it would make an excellent highend resort. Even though warned away from the place by local Luna Laura Gemser they decide to stay there and use the island for their original intent. Despite more warnings a horde of the living dead arise from the grounds and stalk them through the island forcing them to realize the reason for the zombie rampage and set out to stop it before they all become prey to the shuffling creatures.The Good News This one had some rather good qualities to it when it tried to. The biggest plus to it is the fact that there's some rather good stuff to come from the film's inclusion of hardcore porn into the zombie film genre. Along with the usual Eurosleaze standard of showing off full nudity from the females involved this one goes the extra mile and uses it to insert male nudity into the mix with a variety of different options. The main one is a fullon extended and extremely graphic threesome that starts off with an explicit shower scene then moves on into the hardcore sex scene that includes oral penetration and more. That it goes so far in presenting everything makes it standout and the other sex scenes presented throughout aren't as bad either. These are also packed into the beginning of the film giving this part of the film a sleazy taste that along with copious amounts of nudity from nonsexual encounters presented leave a really sleazy feel to these scenes. Most of them fail though when compared to a bottle trick accompanied by a stripper's stage show that is easily one of the most dirty and disgusting scenes imaginable for these films. Even a lesbian romp kept to a softcore focus due to the extremity of the previous entries is a delight and somewhat fun. The zombie footage mixed in what little there is is also really nice and manages to get a creepy feeling or two from the scenes as it comes with the grosslydesigned longdead and rotting look that really sums up the term zombie in great order looking quite unique and really great. The scenes of them emerging out of the sand is a sight to behold with the heaving earth giving way to the creatures in a long extended sequence that gives the chills and the resulting action scenes provide plenty of life to the film. The last plus is the moody cinematography on display giving the island scenes a really beautiful look and the cemetery scenes an eerie air that sets up what's to come nicely. These here are what help the film along.The Bad News This one here did have a few problems with it. One of the biggest here is the simple fact of the inclusion of so much hardcore footage into the film. This is the kind of stuff that can appear to turn off or morally offend the more prudish out there that merely want to see zombies ripping corpses apart and have no desire to see such kind of scenes. The fact that it goes into the hardcore realm with it's sex and nudity even so much as doing it often as well is going to be a struggle for those with these values plus it also manages to bring up the film's other big problem in that the inclusion of all that footage results in the film just dragging out for no reason. This is easily a good halfhour too long most of which is the hardcore footage boosting the length as the film stops in it's tracks and indulges in them for no purpose other than it can forcing everything else to come after it and making it feel way too long. That also affects the zombie scenes in here as they're rarely given any screen time other than the very end which is a sad fact that they're reduced to a cameo role in their own movie. The last flaw in here is the rather unusual manner of the ghost inserted into the film which has very little sense to it and is overall sloppily done. These here are the film's problems.The Final Verdict A weird conundrum as it mixes together the extremes of everything yet not really doing much with them. This one could be worthwhile if you've got a strong stomach and don't mind overbearing amounts of Eurosleaze or fans of zombie films but those with prudish values are advised to seek out a censored version or ignore altogether.Rated URX Continuous Full Male and Female Nudity hardcore Sex Scenes Graphic Violence and Language".

	schema:reviewBody "aka EROTIC NIGHTS OF THE LIVING DEADJust saw the uncut newlyremastered ShriekMedia Blasters DVD of this and I must say I was bored by the whole thing. However 'everybody else' must have liked it because the cast stuck around for D'Amato's next Caribbean offering PORNO HOLOCAUST 1981OK I admit I was turned on by the hardcore threesome between Manlio Cersosimo and the two Dominican whores he had up in his room but the rest of the film was totally uninteresting horrorwise or sexwise. Gemser should have continued played Emmanuelle and I'm surprised she didn't here. Especially for a Joe D'Amato movie. There's surprisingly little gore for a film of this scope and the zombie plot looks like it was thrown in there as a pretext for the softcore lesbian scenes between Gemser and Funari. There's also soft core sex scenes between Eastman and Gemser and between Cersosimo and Funari as well as the previously mentioned hardcore sex scene.Plot concerns George Eastman taking Manlio Cersosimo and his girlfriend Dirce Funari to an island so he can scout locations for a new hotel resort. A female spirit Laura Gemser and an old man conjure up the dead buried on the island to go after these three and stop any development from taking place. Some of the zombies get impaled on sticks by Eastman and some brown  green stuff blood? comes flowing out and there's a couple of zombies who get torched but that's pretty much all the action. Eastman and Funari wind up in a 'mental institution' after all this. ShriekMedia Blasters did their usual impeccable widescreen treatment of this DVD far more than the actual film deserves. Not much in the line of extras though. There's also a halfway decent electronic score by Marcello Giombini. Mostly deserves a yawn...3 out of 10".

	schema:headline " More Sleaze From SmutKing  Joe D'Amato";
	schema:reviewBody "EROTIC NIGHTS OF THE LIVING DEAD is a sleazy smutfilled endeavor from trash director Joe D'Amato  but of course I live for this garbage so although this one was pretty silly  I still got a kick out of it. Unfortunately though don't expect any cool undeadcopulation as the title would suggest you won't get it here. But you will get plenty of living people's tits and ass so I guess that counts for something...This one concerns a businessman who buys an island to put up a big resort hotel. Of course the island has some local lore around it involving zombies that live there. Before embarking on his journey to check the island out Mr. Business bangs two hookers in his hotel room. Pretty decent hardcore sex action if you dig big 70's pussfro's and protracted semierect blowjobs featuring a guy that looks like Magnum P.I. Then he bones the lady that's staying next door seems that Magnum is quite a pimp.... The next day Magnum and TheGirlNextDoor head to the docks to commission a boat and sailor to take them to the island. The boat ride is just another excuse to show some more extended tits and ass scenes but unfortunately other than the hookersandwich in the beginning there's no more hardcore sex to be had in this film unless you consider one VERY amusing scene where a stripper graphically uncorks a bottle of champagne without use of her hands hardcore.... The adventurous threesome begin exploring the island and find that it's not completely uninhabited. There's a real old guy with a big lump on his head and his granddaughter played by an anorexically thin but still smokin' hot Laura Gemser... and a grave yard where a bunch of epidemic victims died the epidemic is never explained naturally..... Ol' BumpHead tells the trespassers that they should probably rollout but Magnum ain't hearin' it. BumpHead gives the sailor some kind of little statue that's supposed to protect him against the zombies and somewhere along the line we find out that Gemser is some sort of ghost or something that obviously doesn't like to give head which is proved in one particularly hilarious penischomping scene... because you don't see her in photographs and she keeps disappearing. Sound hard to follow? Trust me it's not  it's just poorly written. Anyway...of course our adventurers pay no head to BumpHead and GhostGirl so the epidemic victims decide to be a little more persuasive...Basically ENOTLD is a film whose main purpose is to cram as much gratuitous nudity and sex as possible into it while still straining to maintain some sort of plot as a horror film. The sleaze is hotandheavy although I wish that there would have been some more XXX scenes as seeing them in the very beginning and then not at all through the rest of the film was kind of anticlimactic. As a horror film ENOTLD doesn't really hold up well. Actually as a porn film it doesn't really either  but the combination of the two make this one somehow work out to be pretty entertaining. Not nearly as memorable as D'Amato's supersleazy EMANUELLE IN America or his horror classic BUIO OMEGA  but still worth a look to the trash fans out there...or those that dig hot 70's chicks with big 70's bushes...710".

The acting is very amateurish so any scary atmosphere of the film is covered up by cheesiness. There is little if any plot and the gore scenes are few and far between. The gore scenes could be really graphic and disturbing but no papier mache would have been more convincing. As for the ending I think it was obvious from the very beginning. I'm happy I've seen the film as it is a rarity but now I know why the film is almost a forgotten one. Joe D'Amato should have chosen to make an adult OR a zombie film as with this odd crossgenre he has failed miserably. Recommended only if you are an extreme D'Amato fan like myself. 3 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi or Erotic Nights of the Living Dead  Sexy Nights of the Living Dead as it's more widely known among English speaking audiences introduces us to John Wilson Mark Shannon who works for a company that are going to buy a tropical paradise called Cat Island  build a holiday resort on it. John hires local sailor Larry O'Hara George Eastman to take him  his wife Fiona Dirce Funari to Cat Island so he can give it the once over despite Cat Islands bad reputation with the superstitious locals Larry agrees to take them. Once there they encounter a mysterious young woman Laura Gemser  her Grandfather who act strangely  warn them to leave. John isn't having any of it  since the boats motor has broken down their stuck there anyway. Things take a turn for the worse when it becomes apparent that Cat Island is also infested with rotting flesheating zombies whom appear very hungry...This Italian production was directed by Joe D'Amato who also saw to the cinematography under his real name Aristide Massaccesi  there really aren't many films like Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi around this has been released in basically two different versions an explicit one with hardcore sex  a softer one without although I think both versions contain all the gore. The script by star George Eastman mixes hardcore pornography  Italian exploitation horror. I'm not sure that the mixing of these two genres work particularly well as both the horror  sex elements are kept well apart in terms of the story  one has no notable significance in regards to the other which at times can make you feel that Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi is two different films pasted together. The hardcore footage consists of one scene where two prostitutes have sex with John masturbation at this point while giving John a handjob one of the women says they could arrest you for carrying a concealed weapon! oral sex  full penetration are present but that's where the hardcore ends really there is a scene when Fiona masturbates  an infamous bit when a women opens a bottle by inserting it into her vagina. The horror doesn't really kick in until the last 20 or so minutes when the zombies rise. The pacing is a real killer as far as the overall film goes it becomes quite boring towards the end  at almost 2 hours long in it's uncut state I found my interest waining well before the end. There are very few characters in Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi  those present aren't that well fleshed out a lot of scenes  ideas seem unrelated  go unexplained like the Doctor who gets one scene the black cat that keeps turning up the zombie in the port that Larry kills the man at the beginning killed by a zombie  why the hell are there zombies on Cat Island anyway? Some sort of explanation would have been nice while the opening  closing segments are completely unnecessary  feel out of place. On a positive note director D'Amato amazingly manages to create some good sequences the blue lit zombie scenes at the end look fantastic  add a visual elegance. I wouldn't give D'Amato too much credit though as these scenes were shot during the day  a blue sepia tone was probably added in post production with the alternate sunny daytime shots as they were filmed presented on the DVD as an extra. The real life Santa Domingo locations in the Dominican Republic look beautiful the beaches the clear blue sea  the palm trees make me wish I was there zombies or not! The gore is not that graphic a couple of zombies have their heads chopped off a few are shot in the head there is one brief gutmunching scene a Doctor is attacked by a maggot ridden zombie  that's about it. There is lots of nudity in fact everyone take all their clothes off for the slightest reason except Eastman who never strips below the waist in any part. The acting  dubbing are up to the usual low standards set by Euro exploitation films. Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi is an odd film I liked it's exploitation elements but found it very choppy poorly paced  despite the odd explicit sex scene  brief horror I didn't find it particularly enjoyable or entertaining as a whole just in parts which is where my score comes from. Still it's definitely worth a watch for Euro exploitation fans like myself who should be able to find a few redeeming features in it. However if you get hold of the uncut version make sure you don't watch it in front of your family...".

	onyx:emotionText "Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi or Erotic Nights of the Living Dead  Sexy Nights of the Living Dead as it's more widely known among English speaking audiences introduces us to John Wilson Mark Shannon who works for a company that are going to buy a tropical paradise called Cat Island  build a holiday resort on it. John hires local sailor Larry O'Hara George Eastman to take him  his wife Fiona Dirce Funari to Cat Island so he can give it the once over despite Cat Islands bad reputation with the superstitious locals Larry agrees to take them. Once there they encounter a mysterious young woman Laura Gemser  her Grandfather who act strangely  warn them to leave. John isn't having any of it  since the boats motor has broken down their stuck there anyway. Things take a turn for the worse when it becomes apparent that Cat Island is also infested with rotting flesheating zombies whom appear very hungry...This Italian production was directed by Joe D'Amato who also saw to the cinematography under his real name Aristide Massaccesi  there really aren't many films like Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi around this has been released in basically two different versions an explicit one with hardcore sex  a softer one without although I think both versions contain all the gore. The script by star George Eastman mixes hardcore pornography  Italian exploitation horror. I'm not sure that the mixing of these two genres work particularly well as both the horror  sex elements are kept well apart in terms of the story  one has no notable significance in regards to the other which at times can make you feel that Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi is two different films pasted together. The hardcore footage consists of one scene where two prostitutes have sex with John masturbation at this point while giving John a handjob one of the women says they could arrest you for carrying a concealed weapon! oral sex  full penetration are present but that's where the hardcore ends really there is a scene when Fiona masturbates  an infamous bit when a women opens a bottle by inserting it into her vagina. The horror doesn't really kick in until the last 20 or so minutes when the zombies rise. The pacing is a real killer as far as the overall film goes it becomes quite boring towards the end  at almost 2 hours long in it's uncut state I found my interest waining well before the end.

	schema:headline " Nice Spaghetti freely based on Shakespeare play and being well directed by Enzo G Castell";
	schema:reviewBody "Decent Spaghetti adaptation of Hamlet with thrills  violence  shoot'em up and well set . This Ravioli Western packs violence  shootouts  high bodycount and it's fast moving and some moments genuinely entertaining . On his way back from the American Civil War 18611865  Johnny Andrea Giordana is visited in his sleep by the ghost of his father who lets him know that he has been killed and who asks him to revenge him . Back in the family mansion  Johnny aware that not only has his deceased father has been murdered but that Gerty Gertrude Franoise Prevost  his mummy  has married her late husband's brother Claude Hamilton Horst Frank . The latter is now the proprietary of the ranch and of all the ownerships of his daddy . SantanaPolonius a nasty Mexican outlaw  is supposed to have murdered Johnny's father. Then Johnny seeks vendetta against Santana  Claude and his underlings Ennio Girolami  Pedro Snchez .Interesting Spaghetti packs drama  thrills  action  and lots of shots and gunplay .It's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonists and hoodlums . There is a huge shootout in the ranch and a breathtaking face off between Andrea Giordana and Horst Frank . Good cast as Andrea Giordana who starred Massacre at Grand canyon  The Dirty Outlaws and this Johnny Hamlet at his best . Nice acting by Gilbert Roland as Horace  he starred some Spaghetti such as Sonora Goldseekers  Any Gun Can Play and Between God  the devil and a Winchester . Horst Frank as a cruelly baddie role is terrific he steals the spectacle as a crazed psychopath  former and subsequently he would play similar characters in various oaters . Furthermore there appears usual Macarroni secondary actors such as John Bartha Ennio Girolami  director's brother  and Ignazio Spalla or Pedro Sanchez who used to play similar roles to great Fernando Sancho . This widely deemed picture  unlike most conventional Spaghetti Western  contains exceptional setting  colorful images with an atmospheric cinematography by Angelo Filippini . Agreeable musical score by Francesco De Massi  Spaghetti's usual  including catching and evocative songs by Alessandro Alessandroni  usual collaborator to Ennio Morricone . The motion picture was professionally filmed by Enzo G Castell . Director Enzo G achieved in Johnny Hamlet  possibly one of his best works of an important career  with some memorable scenes  appropriate camera movement and descriptive closeups . Enzo usually makes experimental editing techniques such as unbroken transitions from one scene to another and a cameo appearance in his films . Castellari often works with Guido and Maurizio De Angelis and uses to do slow motion shootouts and choreographic death scenes . Enzo is a good a craftsman working in all kind of genres  as he made Western especially . His first one was Some dollars for Django codirected by Leon Klimovsky  but actually for the most part of its filming by the disagreements arising with Klimovsky was realized by Enzo G. Castellari which this film was his directorial debut in a subgenre that became one of its greatest representatives  in fact if you compare the beginning of 7 Winchester for a massacre which would direct the next year and the end this one seem to be similar direction . After that  he went on directing  Johnny Hamlet  Kill them everybody and came back alone Tedeum  Cipolla colt and the masterpiece  Keoma and finally its inferior sequel Jonathan of the Bears also with Franco Nero . Some of them are serious  others are goofy and plenty of slapstick and slapdash . This Johnny Hamlet 1968 is a bewildering story  enjoyable in lots of parts and it will appeal to Spaghetti Western fans . It's an acceptable film  and better than a lot of the ulterior spaghetti western to come . Other Spaghetti Westerns freely based on famous novels and plays are the followings  Apocalypse Joe by Leopoldo Savona with Anthony Steffen that takes elements from Hamlet and Macbeth of Shakespeare . Other Spaghetti freely based on notorious play by Shakespeare is The Fury of Johnny Kid by Gianni Puccini with Peter Lee Lawrence and Cristina Galbo from Romeo and Giuletta along with Bullets and the Flesh by Marino Girolami . Other Spaghetti based on known and classic plays and novels are  The return of Ringo by Duccio Tessari inspired on the Odyssey and John Il Bastardo1967 based on books from Zorrilla and Moliere  Long days of vengeance by Florentano Vancini with Giuliano Gemma and Francisco Rabal  being based on classic novel titled The count of Montecristo written by Alexandre Dumas and between God  the devil and a Winchester based on Treasure island  being directed by Marino Girolami  father of Enzo G Castellari  with Richard Harrison  Gilbert Roland and Roberto Camardiel .".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on an idea by Sergio Corbucci Enzo Castellari directed this western adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet drama as Django or Johnny depending on which dubbing you get in your country avenges the death of his father. It is interesting to observe how the classical tragedy elements work in the context of a Mediterranean style western movie. Not yet 30 years old Castellari was already very creative at little touches like the camera circling around Django's face in the scene at his father's grave and should take this way further in Keoma a decade later.Quella sporca storia nel west suffers a bit from the unconvincing cast German actor Horst Frank with his blond hair does not look like he is a member of the same family as Gilbert Roland the veteran actor Roland is too old to play Andrea Giordana's brother whose mother is much too young to be the mother of any of them. But even if the audience won't buy this ensemble for a family the cruelty of the old tragedy is working great for a tough western and the visual qualities of the movie also gifted with a thrilling musical score by Francesco de Masi save the day and make it a must for the collection of every spaghetti western fan. Regrettably Andrea Giordana did not make any westerns after this anymore because the young man had talent.".

	schema:headline " That Dirty Shakespeare Story Set in the West";
	schema:reviewBody "The first 30 minutes of 'Johnny Hamlet' might be the most inspired in all of Spaghetti Western. The movie opens with a misty nightmare scene that immediately let's you feel the mindset of the warstruck antihero. He awakens by an actor reciting Shakespeare with the chosen text being very appropriate for Johnny's situation. After that we get a scene of Johnny finding his father's grave which is on a cemetery in a cave. The scene has a surreal feel to it and impresses with its moving camera. Then he comes home to his mother after having been away fighting in war for two years to find her having a jolly hot time with his uncle Johnny's father's brother. Johnny is understandably flabbergasted learning that his father got killed and finding his mom living together with his uncle all on the same day. After that Johnny meets his old flame who got married while he was away. When asking her what she knows about the killing of his father she refuses to talk out of fear apparently. That's when two guy shows up advising Johnny not to ask so many questions and a fistfight ensues. Johnny is saved by an old friend and a good friend of his father's who's a tough guy and enjoys this kind of thing.And that's how this thing starts. Yes it's an adaption of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. Not only is this revenge story like made for a Spaghetti Western but the film doesn't even struggle with the complex source material. The directing is inspired and clever in those first 30 minutes I was especially impressed by the prevailing theme of melancholy but beyond anything else it is wellwritten. Instead of feeling constructed the plot development feels remarkably natural with the individual characters simply following their own interests. Nevertheless this is a Spaghetti Western through and through with everything we've come to expect from films of this subgenre including shootouts and a fine score. A bit of Spaghetti Western routine sets in after the magnificent beginning and while the action is merely competent the film thanks to its writing nevertheless manages to stay interesting until the showdown.It's an extremely wellworking mix of lowbrow and highbrow cinema if you will with elements that fans of only lowbrow cinema would call artsy. 'Johnny Hamlet' is not only a new Spaghetti Western favorite but even an unexpected Shakespeare adaption favorite. If you are a fan of both of those genres I reckon this is a mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two worlds collide as Italian action master Enzo G Castellari takes on English wordsmith William Q Shakespeare in a mashup of Hamlet and Spaghetti Westerns. It's faithful up to a point I guess. Not sure if Hamlet gets crucified in the play mind you.Johnny Hamilton has a dream in which his father's ghost visits him and tells him he's been murdered and to head home and avenge his death. The usual stuff. Johnny's been hitching along with an acting troop who just happen to be performing Hamlet so you get the 'to be or not to be' speech right there at the start of the film on a beach while another does backflips! Johnny heads home and meets his friend Horace who seems reluctant to tell him what his mother's up to and lo and behold she's married Johnny's Uncle the scheming Claude Horst Frank great as usual. Johnny now has to avenge his father's death find out who really killed his father get in many punch ups like the play right? and kill loads of Danish Mexicans or something.You see Enzo is no fool. He's got the great source material but he's still got to deliver an actionpacked Western as well and he manages to bring them together. Johnny is Hamlet Horace is obviously Horatio Ross and Gill I guess are checks spelling Rosencrantz and Guildenstern only with guns. Ophelia's there too but played down a bit.You've also got a high instance of the 'Enzo Factor' which includes all his usual crazy camera angles people appearing in mirrors camera shots very often through objects a chair someone's legs a bullet hole in a sheriff's badge hyperactive camera shots and the action amped up to ridiculous levels. I laughed twice  once when Mexican bandit Santana rode his horse through a glass door and then again when Ennio Girolami shot a Chinese bartender by mistake.This is a great because all the effort Enzo put into it is up there on the screen. It appeared on YouTube about a week ago in a great print. I don't imagine it will be there long mind you.Now someone upload The Return of Ringo! Also my wife and I tried to go see Hamlet performed live in a park once but for some reason the actors decided to perform it on the top of a hill while we were all seated at the bottom of the hill. It quickly became agony to sit on the tiny stools we rented so we left at the first interval but also took the stools with us as compensation. The kids still use them to this day.Take that Shakespeare!".

Why bother i feel like i've lost ninety minutes of my life. Remakes are one thing but to blatantly rip off another film so soon after it was released and to put so little effort into it is a waste of time.

In fact him calling himself a director is like me calling myself the dictator of a small South American country. I am nothing of the sort but neither is he.I did pick up some interesting info while watching this crapfest though such as When a US Navy ships Captain rescues one of his female officers from under a piece of armor plating they then roll around on the deck and make out a lot. When in battle a US Navy ships crew does virtually nothing except stand around on deck waving their arms and shouting YAY!. There is always a five foot long piece of twoinch iron pipe lying around on the deck of a US Navy battleship in case you have to stop a rolling 16 inch artillery shell from crushing you. Carl Weathers would be better off spending his time at the horse track eating sardine sandwiches and betting 50 cent trifectas.There is nothing redeeming about this uh movie. The acting is wooden the CGI is so amateurish it's laughable and the plot is ridiculous. Next time I'll paint a wall and just sit watching it dry my time would be better spent.".

There were some very nice shots of the historical battle wagon. The only reason this movie was made was to advertise the fact that the Big Stick is on her way to being turned into a museum. Though i am not sure that making a terrible film was the best way to get that point out to the general public. But what can you do?";

The problem are the different quality of the scenes. Some of them you can see how bad the 3DCGI rendering is done. It looks less real than a simple PC game. Other scenes where airports and islands are hit by missiles and the camera moves you can see the overlaying explosions sliding over the buildings revealing that they are only posteffects.One of the female actors looks like she was sprayed with selftanning just before shooting the movie. Also rather disturbing making it all even more fake.There are also some bloopers regarding the ship itself because this ship is supposed to be a museum etc. but the doorways aren't even painted and look rusty. All in all I would say 85 of the movie is poorly attempt to copycat on another movie. I wonder if this movie was produced with one intent that of being rentedsold because of the name alone so keeping the budget low was part of the deal.Disappointed I was... very!".

They get the directory of upcoming summer big budget films and throw together a spoof of the concept on a shoe string budget and release it at the same time.I wasn't around for this one but last year they put the Battle of Los Angeles on TV during the release week so I assume this went the same way when BattleShip came out.First things first this is a Brate move.

The acting sucks the visuals look like they where made by a class of graphics design students and the audio is balanced for TV.This isn't to say its a badbad movie in fact its rolls the odometer back around to good its so cheesy.

	schema:headline " The Asylum's 'American Warships' sails the sea of cheese";
	schema:reviewBody "Piggybacking off the domestic box office disaster Battleship as much as they can The Asylum released their lowbudget knockoff entitled American Warships. Leave it to these mockbuster makers to swoop in on the dead carcass and pick off all the flesh left on the bone after the brutal slaying it suffered. The original title of the film was American Battleship until Universal Pictures intervened demanding a namechange among other things. The Asylum did what they had to do to get the finished product released and told the studio they appreciate the publicity.American Warships begins when a mysterious attack is launched by undetectable ships off the coast of civilization. The U.S.S. Ohio and its crew are brought out of retirement to find out who's responsible for the attacks before the different countries of the world begin World War III. They soon discover that the unknown force is alien. The officers and crew of the ship must find a way to stop them before they can call in intergalactic reinforcements to complete their mission to take over the Earth.This movie once again takes a rather serious direction and doesn't come off as too campy. It took a while to get going with most of the action in the first 45 minutes or so depending on ships shooting at each other. Things really get interesting when the Navy SEALS board one of the alien ships to see what they're up against. We finally get some of the typical action regular viewers of Asylum movies are used to. The good guys chase the bad guys through some sort of tunnels or hallways while shooting lasers and rifles at each other.The visual effects and CGI are par for the course based on the last few Asylum films. They're just above adequate but lightyears ahead of where they used to be. The aliens still suffer a bit visually from bluescreen pasting and CG work but they look unique. These aliens aren't the garden variety War of the Worlds or Alien looking ones we get so many times in these types of lowbudget films.One thing that really helps the film is it was shot on an actual Navy battleship. Filmmakers used the decommissioned U.S.S. North Carolina as a standin for the Ohio. However the room supposedly in the Pentagon looked like it was shot in a small rented out hotel conference room with sheets put over the entrances. That kept you grounded in the world of the Asylum enough to where you didn't forget what you were watching.Just like every great Asylum film we were treated to appearances by actors who have been off the Hollywood radar for a while. Mario Van Peebles stars as Captain James Winston and Carl Weathers stars as General Hugh McKraken. They put their all into the roles they were given and act circles around most of the other cast members in the movie.American Warships isn't the best Asylum film ever put out. It'll still give fans of these types of movies something to laugh at on a boring Saturday night. I hoped for a bit more cheese which strangely enough people usually don't want when they watch a movie. However an Asylum film without the cheese is like a cheeseburger without the cheese. Did I use the word cheese enough in this paragraph?".

Aside from the traditional brown military uniforms for ranked officers the uniforms for the crew are so terrible that I would liken them to props used in a middle school play. They were wearing plain old blue baseball hats and plain red and blue sweaters and shirts that look like they just came off a WalMart shelf. They still have the wrinkles in them that clothes have when they have been sitting on a shelf for sale before they are washed. They didn't even take the time to attempt to make their clothing look used in the very least. The props are also horrible. Not a single prop looks like military grade at all. The visual effects and audio are some of the worst I have ever seen. The continuity is horrible. The men playing the Navy seamen look about as far away as being a Navy seamen as possible.. and especially the SEALS. They were either little skinny guys or overweight. The hair of some of the male actors was too long and would not even be within military guidelines. This movie looks like it was produced and directed by people that lacked even the basic knowledge of the military.

	schema:headline " Much Better Than Its Big Budget Counterpart Battleship";
	schema:reviewBody "It's general low rating notwithstanding I actually enjoyed watching American Warships. Recently I watched the movie Battleship. It's a big budget blockbuster that has roughly the same storyline  an old American warship forced into battle with aliens. American Warships however is much more exciting and even more believable  to the extent that any movie of this kind can be believable.Here the primary warship is the World War II vintage USS Iowa commanded by Captain Winston played by Mario Van Peebles. The Iowa is about to be retired and turned into a museum and it's on its way to the US from a good will visit to South Korea when first a South Korean island and then the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier group also in the area is mysteriously destroyed. Was it the North Koreans? The Chinese? No one knows and the Iowa sets off to investigate while the United States prepares to fight World War III. The attacks continue on various military targets the tension ramps a nuclear attack by the US on China and a return attack by China on the US is imminent with only the Iowa who have now figured out what's happening standing in the way. The attackers are aliens trying to goad the world into a nuclear war so that they can take over. The aliens also seemed far more threatening here than in Battleship.Basically I liked this. It's pretty exciting and tense all the way through. Van Peebles was not too bad as the Captain of the Iowa and while having a WWII era ship beating powerful aliens in Battleship made little sense in this there was a plausible sort of anyway explanation as to why that type of warship could succeed in such a battle  the aliens basically knocking out integrated electrical systems to facilitate their attacks systems that weren't around in World War II so that the Iowa had the ability to survive the aliens' most powerful advantage.Now there are some problems I admit. First by the time this was over I was getting very tired of the Star Trek type references. We heard about cloaking devices and ships that had to decloak before they could fire. There were references to phasers and Klingons not to mention the fact that the aircraft carrier destroyed was the Enterprise and the main American ship was the Iowa  where Captain Kirk was supposedly born. All that was a little too much in your face. I liked Van Peebles but I thought the rest of the performances were perhaps a bit uneven and I wasn't impressed with David Polinsky as Admiral Hollis. I also didn't think that there was any reason for having a romance between Winston and Lt. Bradley Johanna Watts. I also found it passing strange that the aliens who supposedly wanted to provoke a nuclear war would destroy two of the American bomber groups that had been sent off to be prepared to attack China? Isn't that defeating their own purposes? At least I couldn't figure that out. The closing captions of the movie suggest that this is based on a congressional act passed in 2006 retiring the Iowa but making sure that it would remain battle ready even as it serves as a museum. So the question is why keep an old warship battle ready? This is the supposed answer.Overall though I thought this was a pretty exciting and enjoyable movie much better than its reviews would suggest. 610".

Although Asylum of course timed there release of this film to come out when Battleship does it still in itself is a decent movie. What it loses in poor special effects it makes up for with a nice storyline and great acting. That alone is strange as most Asylum movies offer nothing in the line of special effects and usually terrible acting...In closing as I said before the movie was pretty enjoyable to me and seemed to leave you thinking about it in a positive way.. The biggest point of the movie is do not always look to the most high tech methods of defending yourselves Thanks for reading my review".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the type of movie that reminds us of what made the lowbudget science fiction movies of the 50's and 60's so memorable. Poor acting clich'd dialogue not so special effects. American Warships isn't great cinema in any sense of the word and yes it was put together to cash in on the blockbuster Battleship but honestly the movie is enjoyable in its own right. It has in it the elements that have made those other movies so memorable.The plot is something sort of like Battlestar Gallactica in that an older warship that isn't as technically integrated and is being turned into a museum is called into action when a sudden and unprovoked attack by forces from another world decide they want to take over.While the plot has been used what good bad science fiction movie doesn't borrow a clich'd plot the pacing is actually good and there aren't many areas where the action tails off into boredom. Overall the acting is not great. Some of it might not even qualify as good or competent. But again this was made to cash in on the big hit of the summer. And it isn't so terrible that it isn't watchable much like 1950's science fiction.The weakest point of the movie is by far the special effects. The obvious use of the same shots over and over and over again became a bit repetitive and stock footage was certainly overused yet this is what made those so bad they're good movies that way. I don't believe that those who have negatively reviewed this film really understood what was being done here. It's not great but it is so bad it's good and this classic science fiction fan enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "American Warships aka American Battleship thanks HasbroUniversal isn't very good and frankly sucks and I'm often surprised how people prefer this Asylum Ripoff over the big budget product. I know Battleship isn't that smart either or hell original. But at least it had a budget and wasn't apparently made to con suckers into picking this up at the store or renting it at red box. That and at least Battleship had some life in it compared to this I mean this has some of the stiffest acting ever. . And these's movies are shoddy as all hell with literally PC graphic special effects. Some people say they are aware of this and it adds to the charm. Well I don't it's just shoddy as all crap. Once again Battleship didn't have perfect special effects or anything but at least it looked like it could afford to show a battleship being attacked. Another thing The Asylum does is apparently hire washed up actors to show up in there movie for instance in this one both a bored looking Mario Van Peebles is in it as well as Carl Apollo Creed Weathers. Both looking like they would rather be in anything else. I would just say to watch this when it premieres on Syfy like we all know it will then decide if you like its zgrade movie quality. And believe me when I say the quality is definitely Z and you will think how in the wide world a movie like this could be made in this year. It's shorter than Battleship but really it feels much longer than Battleship. The aliens look even more laughable than the Battleship ones that looked like some Halo inspired aliens from the planet Who Ville apparently. The special effects are downright groan worthy like I said at least Battleship had effects. This is Birdemic level even the muzzle flash from the guns firing is CGI apparently the cast was too sheepish to fire actual prop guns. Peebles and Weathers are the only two cast members with a level of actual acting skills that they use to the best they can. And marvel at the subsquent triple endings to the movie. Just when you think the movie will end it continues on and on. Plus do we need even lamer clichs than the one we have in Battleship? Bad stock footage of things like the pentagon the Iowa at several points and the port where it's stationed. And please can the characters stop babbling about it being possible North Korean or Chinese weapons when anybody with a brain would know that they wouldn't have that type of technology the aliens use. Lame shootouts with the aliens and a bad climax that is to be in a word just so freaking anticlimatic.".

Unfortunately that's where the positives end as everything else about American Warships is just plain crap the script is so full of holes  plain absurd inaccuracies that it is simply impossible to take American Warships seriously. Apparently all electrical systems on the Iwoa are down yet electrical lights  navigation equipment are shown working as are speakers  medical monitors the idea that a battleship is steered mechanically from the bridge is just plain hilarious wrong uniforms are worn the attitudes  behaviour of the military personnel is highly questionable Navy Seals walking around with gun with their fingers on the triggers the Captain of the Iwoa openly flirting with another officer someone taking clear photograph's with an old camera in the dark without a flash the idea that they can make hundreds of planes that have been stuck in museums for decades battle ready in mere minutes as well as plenty of other goofs  ridiculous plotting besides.The whole film is inept from a production point of view it doesn't get much better.

As well as a dumb military film American Warships also has scifi aspects with the aliens trying to start World War III so we will wipe each other out but they look ridiculous when finally seen they are a sort of weird cross between a human  Turkey with two shell things on their back  a few spikes sticking out of them they are hard to describe but are very goofy  silly in appearance. The so called action scenes are poor there's not much interaction  noone seems overly concerned or in much of a hurry the terrible CGI computer effects don't help either.Probably shot on a budget of about zero American Warships was actually filmed on the museum ship the U.S.S.

It is also true that a nuclear air blast will usually do the trick. One reason the USS Iowa was able to still function was it was a WWII ship and did not have a nuclear engine and didn't have to rely on electronic circuitry to fire it's guns although it initially did have it but didn't need it operate its guns. Some folks got turned off by the science fiction part of it. But it was presented naturally and puzzled the crew the National Military Control Center and the President. If there was any fault that center was only manned by a Lt Gen the Secretary of Defense but no one else. You would usually have 4 star generals of the Army Air Force Marces and a Fleet Admiral as well the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Adviser. Regardless the acting was very good except for the Admiral that was aboard. I felt that actor was a little over the top worrying too much that the Iowa was a museum and a warship. The movie was great and well worth time to watch.".

The movie was great and well worth time to watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "A deceptively dark film that seems lighthearted and somewhat fun on first glance but just keeps on twisting as it progresses. A badly burned teacher Kevin Spacey wants his grade school class to come up with a project to make a difference in the world. Thus young Haley Joel Osment comes up with an idea to help three people in trouble and then have each of them do the same for three others in order to keep paying it forward. Osment wants a father and soon hopes that Spacey will fall in love with his mother Helen Hunt. He also helps a homeless man James Caviezel who just cannot seem to say no to narcotics. For a while it appears that everything might actually work out but Spacey's sad life and the return of abusive father Jon Bon Jovi in a nice little supporting turn just make Osment that much more tortured emotionally. The love that grows between Hunt and Spacey appears it will save the day but sometimes nothing is the way it seems to be in life. I did enjoy Pay It Forward very much. I liked the elements of the production really more than I liked the entire movie as a whole. There are some really wonderful ideas here and in all honestly there are really two or three movies within Pay It Forward. All the performers are right on. Osment is the greatest child actor to ever live hands down. Spacey is always a guaranteed performance and Hunt has grown as an actress in just the last several years. I was disappointed that Caviezel's who struck gold in The Thin Red Line did not have a little more time here. His character is quietly deep and complicated beneath the surface. The tone hurts Pay It Forward. I really expected a somewhat lighthearted film at the start after some situations that seem to be going for comedy. Some things just do match up with other parts of the movie. With all that said I still think that Pay It Forward is a fine effort that stands a little taller than others might believe. 4 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Life is full of inconsistencies and it is not without a sense of irony. There are people that have tried to make a difference in life and some of them have paid for it with their lives.  Some that come to mind are Martin Luther King Jr JFK Gandhi and Terry Fox.  It's not easy to change the world.  It takes a lot of hard work and determination.  And it doesn't happen overnight.  But then you see a film like this and you begin to question that rationale.  What if a concept like this really was implemented?  What if every single person that had a favour bestowed upon them was asked to pay it forward?  Is it possible that a Utopian world could be achieved?  I doubt it but it certainly would go a long way to making this condemned world a better place to live.I don't think this is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  I don't think it is even the best film that I will see this year although it will make my top ten  but the idea behind it is what has me intrigued. Believe me when I tell you this.  I don't think I have ever been as emotionally galvanized as I was in this film.  There is a raw power a truth that rings clear in Pay It Forward and if there was one film that I would want people to see this year it would be this film.  It is entertaining it is superbly acted and it the one true film the one true idea that really could help make a positive and tangible difference in our society and our world.In some circles this film has been criticized for laying on the fluff.  It is too much like a soap opera.  And that is so far from the truth.  Let's recount the issues at hand and examine them.  Kevin Spacey plays a burn victim because of child abuse.  Helen Hunt plays a single mom that is having a hard time recovering from alcoholism and has a bad case of can't get her exhusband out of her life and her bed.  Haley Joel Osment plays a wise beyond his years son that had to grow up precociously because of his mother that suffers from the above.  Every character in this film including the bit players suffers from real problems.  If people have a hard time understanding this then just go to an average suburban classroom in North America and arbitrarily pick out ten kids.  Chances are you will find cases of alcoholism child abuse divorce and a plethora of issues that are not conducive to a healthy environment for a child.  So this film is just mirroring life.  That's all.The performances by the three leads is nothing short of brilliant.  Not as much can be said for the rest of the cast but Spacey Osment and Hunt all could be nominated this year when March comes.  All three bring compassion and depth to the three scarred people that they portray.  But especially intriguing is Osment.  He doesn't need to say anything in order for you to understand him.  It's a look a twitch a smile a shiver.  Anything he does helps us understand who he is and why he is that way.  Osment is one true gifted actor and I really don't think he is going to fade away in the years to come like so many other child prodigies.  This is the real deal.  By following up Sixth Sense with a performance this real solidifies him as a true thespian.If you have not seen this film for whatever reason and its box office suggests most haven't then do yourself a favour and take a chance on it. Not only will it do you good it really might help change you in some ways. And as Osment says in the film maybe we may all see in some way that  the world isn't really st.9 out of 10  and bring lots of tissues ".

	onyx:emotionText "Life is full of inconsistencies and it is not without a sense of irony. There are people that have tried to make a difference in life and some of them have paid for it with their lives.  Some that come to mind are Martin Luther King Jr JFK Gandhi and Terry Fox.  It's not easy to change the world.  It takes a lot of hard work and determination.  And it doesn't happen overnight.  But then you see a film like this and you begin to question that rationale.  What if a concept like this really was implemented?  What if every single person that had a favour bestowed upon them was asked to pay it forward?  Is it possible that a Utopian world could be achieved?  I doubt it but it certainly would go a long way to making this condemned world a better place to live.I don't think this is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  I don't think it is even the best film that I will see this year although it will make my top ten  but the idea behind it is what has me intrigued. Believe me when I tell you this.  I don't think I have ever been as emotionally galvanized as I was in this film.  There is a raw power a truth that rings clear in Pay It Forward and if there was one film that I would want people to see this year it would be this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Pay It Forward is a movie that is aimed at one particular audience. The kind of audience that expects to have their life changed as the minutes tick by.And as a film that provides profound poignant and tearjerking moments Pay It Forward will be perfect for this manner of audience. Unfortunately harder more expecting moviegoers will probably dismiss this movie as an oversentimental and perhaps unrealistic film.The film is centred around Trevor Hayley JoelOsment. An 11 year old boy living alone with his dysfunctional onoff alcoholic mother Arlene Helen Hunt. One day Trevor is set a homework assignment by his new Social Studies teacher the mysterious slightly disfigured Eugene Kevin Spacey. Eugene sets the class a difficult task to think of an idea that will change the world and put it into action. Et voila!! Pay It Forward is born.Trevor is played with an endearing maturity and at times unstable frustration by uber kid actor Osment. As an aspiring actor I worry that an 11 year old boy can grab hold of such difficult roles and make them his while I still strive to gain my Equity card!! What Osment promised in The Sixth Sense he shows again here with a more difficult and emotionally charged role. Trevor is a boy not altogether happy with his life. He is lacking in a father figure his Mother struggles to have any impact on him as she juggles two jobs to make ends meet which leaves Trevor with nothing but his own intuition to drag him through life. For a child that can only be extatic and contented with HIS life Osment does well to project such a fragile character on screen.Eugene is a character made for Kevin Spacey although all his roles seem perfect for him. Intelligent compassionate slightly bitter and at times unpredictable Eugene is a man that we as an audience cannot help but engage with. The dialogue written for Spacey is much better than other characters in the film and he puts it to good use. Spacey is at his best when doing two things calmly and charismatically attracting attention to himself Ordinary Decent Criminal Midnight In The Garden Of... and when he bubbles just below the surface inviting audiences in so that he can devastate you with a single revelation Seven Usual Suspects Swimming With Sharks. And his revelation in this film he relives how he came to get his horrific scars is so vivid so intricately and harrowingly retold that you cannot help but feel a tear well up in your eye.Helen Hunt is fantastic as Arlene. Managing to achieve a look that bizarrely mixes trailer trash run down alcoholic with vulnerable cuteness. She doesn't get the pick of the dialogue however and the role aswell as the whole film would have been a whole lot worse off had Hunt not been on top form. You don't want her to be your Mother but you really want to see her happy and for her to do a good job at being Trevors.The film falls short in little details. Supporting characters do little to affect the story Jay Mohr as an almost nonspeaking narrator?? and the whole thing feels flat if Spacey is off screen too long. Good actors like Jim Caviezel go almost unnoticed and you can't help but feel that a few more juicy characters would help the story become a little more...cohesive.The ending is a reinforcement of the atmosphere of the whole film. It is a sequence that heightens our emotion and should set the tears rolling.In short see this film for three things Haley JoelOsment Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt. All three are fantastic and it's obvious to see why so much Oscar gossip was being spread.If you like heart warming films with a little bit of edge then watch on. If you're expecting an original exciting twisty or philosophical film...watch it anyway at least the three leads are good.".

I came across a review that said the movie was over sentimental and perhaps unrealistic. For those that have lost faith in humanity and ability to do a good deed for someone you really don't know ... perhaps it is unrealistic. But living in a developing context means that we are faced with that opportunity all the time.Irrespective of linguistical social cultural or economic barriers we all have the capacity to recognise when the hand of support or help is extended... its tough to ignore!

Helen Hunt also did very well as Arlene McKinney and really represented the character how she was meant to be based on the book which is a rather difficult thing to do. I think that although the film and book differed to a certain extent as all film adaptations do the film kept the sentimental quality of the book and in the movie Trevor doesn't get to meet the president which I find to be more realistic rather than a story book fairytale idealism.

How could a movie with Kevin Spacey Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment be this bad.  I had to go home and watch Usual Suspects and American Beauty just to be remind that Spacey has made some good films.  I like the idea of this film very much and I wanted to like it I really did.  I wanted to feel good when I left this movie like after watching Field of Dreams or The Shawshank Redemption.  Instead I felt empty manipulated and stupider. Lets start with the screenplay.  What the hell is up with the screenplay?  I mean I like the beginning where they show Spacey ironing his routine then the scene with Jay Mohr where he has to Pay it Forward.  I liked that because it can be viewed as a turning point in the movie.  It is from this scene that Pay it Forward gets national attention.  Scorsese used this technique in Goodfellas and Casino and it would have worked here if they didn't decide to defy the rules of space and time.  The film procedes to cut between 4 months earlier when the movement first begins and Jay Mohr trying to find out how it started.  It was distracting and unnecessary. It took away from the whole movie.  It was like the people in charge were saying look how clever we can be we're telling you the story in a nonlinear way.  They could have shown Jay Mohr and then go back 4 months leading up to the beginning like in Goodfellas or American Beauty even. The ending was stupid and contrived.  this movie is so frustrating.  THe characters are so one dimensional and cliched.  They say one thing and then in the next scene they are doing the opposite.  I told three people not to see this movie i hope they pay it forward and tell three people not to see it and so on and so on until no one sees this awful film.".

He portrays a lonely conflicted child who lives with his mother who by the way is single and suffering what a surprise and guess what she's also an alcoholic. Not much of Helen Hunt. Osment also plays the role of the insignificant little boy who saves the world with his Pay it forward idea. Very ridiculous. And youll see him again crying begging for help being Mr. Wise guy and showing all his dramatizing techniques. No wonder he was not chosen to play Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace he cannot play roles that do not involve crying and exaggerating.Do not waste your 8 bucks. Watch something else.

	schema:headline " A beautiful movie and a big tear jerker.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those profound movies that affects you and leaves you reflecting about the movie and how it makes you feel and makes you wonder if you could effect people the way Haley did. With the tear jerking moments and the thoughtfulness of a little boy make this a great sentimental movie for most and possibly too unrealistic for others. You then think if it is unrealistic does it have to be can we make this a reality in our communities. While a 5th or 6th grader Hayley Joel Osment in a social studies class is given a difficult task to come up with a idea to change the world and to put it into action. That is where the idea of pay it forward is started. Osment does a firstrate job in this very emotionally charged role. Here you have a boy who does not have a father figure does not really have a happy life. He has a emotionally unavailable mother who is a habitual alcoholic and struggles with two jobs. This leaves him with his own imagination to get him through his day. Which is projected well on screen as the fragile boy. The teacher played by Spacey fits him perfectly his compassion with a slight bitterness and at times is unpredictable and we cant help but feel engaged with his character. Although Hayley did a great job Spacey had some great dialogue. The way he attracts attention to his character and invites us in and then he spoils the experience with a single revelation. In this movie when he reveals how he got his scars are so dramatic and so perfectly retold that it brings a tear in your eye. Helen is just as superb as ever. The way she delivers her performance as a trailer trash alcoholic that still has a alluring side to her. While she might not get the best pick of dialogue she showed top form and added to the movie in a memorable way. Seeing her we may not long for her as our mom but we hope through the whole movie that she finds her way to take care of Trevor. You would think with a lot going against him you would then be wrong this only fueled his desire to help people and having a innocent view that maybe he can help his mom and teacher. He does end up succeeding in helping some people there even comes a TV story about him and the ripple effect he had on the people he helped and the people they helped. Watching this and living in the world we do today you see life is full of conflict and without paradoxes. Changing the world is a lot of work and takes conviction that not a lot of us have. You see a movie like this with a pie in the sky idea and you think this could never happen. It would go a long way if people were able to achieve this goal to make this suffering world a better place. If you have not been able to see this movie it is a must rent. You must take this movie under consideration and take the chance. With Trevors statement in the movie maybe we should try so we can see the whole world isn't really as bad as we may see. We all may want to mark our place in the world but what would the world be like if we did a big favor to someone and they did the same to other people. I do wish they showed some more attention to the idea of pay it forward. But seeing in the end when the 2 big lives he helps change for the better. The end of the movie to a lot of people was not desirable I think it was necessary cause it ended up catapulting his idea. In conclusion this is more than a worthwhile film that shows a powerful message that there is good in the world and the differences one person can make. If you enjoy heart warming films then this is a absolute must watch. If you are tired of the same old rehashed movie ideas unoriginal movies then another reason to see this. As the title says don't thank someone for telling you about the movie pay it forward and tell others.".

Here you have a boy who does not have a father figure does not really have a happy life. He has a emotionally unavailable mother who is a habitual alcoholic and struggles with two jobs. This leaves him with his own imagination to get him through his day. Which is projected well on screen as the fragile boy. The teacher played by Spacey fits him perfectly his compassion with a slight bitterness and at times is unpredictable and we cant help but feel engaged with his character. Although Hayley did a great job Spacey had some great dialogue. The way he attracts attention to his character and invites us in and then he spoils the experience with a single revelation. In this movie when he reveals how he got his scars are so dramatic and so perfectly retold that it brings a tear in your eye. Helen is just as superb as ever. The way she delivers her performance as a trailer trash alcoholic that still has a alluring side to her. While she might not get the best pick of dialogue she showed top form and added to the movie in a memorable way. Seeing her we may not long for her as our mom but we hope through the whole movie that she finds her way to take care of Trevor. You would think with a lot going against him you would then be wrong this only fueled his desire to help people and having a innocent view that maybe he can help his mom and teacher. He does end up succeeding in helping some people there even comes a TV story about him and the ripple effect he had on the people he helped and the people they helped. Watching this and living in the world we do today you see life is full of conflict and without paradoxes. Changing the world is a lot of work and takes conviction that not a lot of us have. You see a movie like this with a pie in the sky idea and you think this could never happen. It would go a long way if people were able to achieve this goal to make this suffering world a better place. If you have not been able to see this movie it is a must rent. You must take this movie under consideration and take the chance. With Trevors statement in the movie maybe we should try so we can see the whole world isn't really as bad as we may see. We all may want to mark our place in the world but what would the world be like if we did a big favor to someone and they did the same to other people. I do wish they showed some more attention to the idea of pay it forward. But seeing in the end when the 2 big lives he helps change for the better. The end of the movie to a lot of people was not desirable I think it was necessary cause it ended up catapulting his idea. In conclusion this is more than a worthwhile film that shows a powerful message that there is good in the world and the differences one person can make. If you enjoy heart warming films then this is a absolute must watch. If you are tired of the same old rehashed movie ideas unoriginal movies then another reason to see this. As the title says don't thank someone for telling you about the movie pay it forward and tell others.";

He is encouraged to exploit this reputation by his long time best friend Dr. Stu Klaminsky a sex obsessed sex starved schlub who became a plastic surgeon just so that he could masturbate over the sight of women's breasts. Charlie doesn't want to be solely a stepping stone for women which is how they end up treating him once he gains this reputation as a lucky charm but rather one's true love.

	schema:reviewBody "If you like Dane Cook then chances are you have seen his movies and while Good Luck Chuck is better and in some instances funnier it still is just another Employee of the Month. I personally enjoy Dane Cook's humor and I thought Employee of the Month was....decent. I was hoping Good Luck Chuck would be a hilarious smash hit but throughout the advanced screening I kept thinking to myself Okay well this is funny but it's so typical. Now I don't want to give anything away but let's just say if you've seen at least one romantic comedy in your life then you know the entire story of Good Luck Chuck already. Don't get me wrong I laughed pretty much all the way through the movie although there were occasional points where it died down a little. Sad to say there were only a few really memorable funny parts to the movie though. Most was just slapstick style humor and revolting sex jokes. The humor in Good Luck Chuck was by far raunchier than Employee of the Month but then again that was PG13 and this is R. I mentioned that the movie was typical and when I say typical I mean every romantic movie clich possible was used. It was like they took a blueprint for a love story and then just added Dane Cook and Jessica Alba and then made them do funny things. Granted there are moments where they stray a little or add a funny twist to the formula but it definitely didn't take long to come up with the progression of love in the film.If you want your next dose of laughter after Superbad then go see Good Luck Chuck but don't expect anything new or inventive in terms of storytelling. It is however something to note that there are tons of sex scenes lots of boobs extremely raunchy jokes and Jessica Alba does not reveal any body parts although some side boob can be glanced for a brief moment in the movie. Just an FYI for all those who were dying to know".

And that old tired pretty girl falls down a lot shtick wasn't funny when it became a movie clich about 5 years ago.The only funny moments seem to be when Dane is improvising. When he's doing the written parts of the script it clunks hard. Him dressed in a penguin costume? Yikes. The two leads try SO hard to show us they have chemistry a lot of shoulder wiggling and cutesy facial expressions mostly that it backfires.There were a lot of grossout moments that just weren't funny  the fat sidekick scrubbing his backflap with a scrubbrush for sexual pleasure a penguin eating his crap two seduction scenes with obese women straight out of Norbit  also unfunny.The sidekick is so foul and obnoxious he throws the movie completely offbalance. You feel like the movie needs a sorbet after one of his scenes to get the bad taste out of your mouth.The only likable person was the guy playing Jessica's brother Lonny Ross of 30 Rock. I actually think he might have made a better romantic lead than Dane  who was somehow offputting.Maybe Dane will have more input into his next comedy movie. Maybe that will help.".

Packing in excessive nudity pointless scenes unnecessary crude humor and predictable physical humor in a matter of 90something minutes this film flounders from the beginning flops mostly throughout and begins to reek towards the climax and the ending. Missed opportunities are much more common than laughs in this heap of disaster which also includes a very generic musical score wooden acting and borrowed material. Perhaps the only good that comes from this is Jessica Alba whose sexy and innocent charm keeps this movie afloat albeit barely.Good Luck Chuck is a totally different movie from the one advertised. The ads showed that this movie was going to be a charming romantic movie featuring plenty of Cook and plenty of Alba. Unfortunately we get crude Dane Cook and very little Jessica Alba and then plenty of preventable boobs. The story here revolves around Chuck Dane Cook a man who from a young age receives a hex that allows for him to get with women but whenever they leave him the next man that female meets will be The One. He takes advantage of this curse until he realizes that he will become lovedeprived as long as the hex exists. In the middle of the crisis he meets a beautiful penguin expert Cam Jessica Alba whom instantly brings out the best in him.Explaining why the film fails would require a lot more words than allowed so let's just point out the major issues. Let's begin with the writing. It was a good idea turned sour with filler material terrible jokes and no heart. Our main character isn't exactly likable until he is on the brink of destruction over our lead female. Chuck's best friend is an even more disgustingly awful character in more ways than one. The lack of chemistry between everybody in the movie is a major concern but between the two best friends is far beyond awful. The only consistently likable character once again is Cam. Attempting to reach the college crowd we see plenty of cleavage undressing and Frat packstyle humor. Unfortunately it fails to bring in the heart and good content that the recent Frat Pack movies contain. Unlike the adult comedies we've seen recently this movie tries much too hard to earn the R rating and it only takes away from its appeal. Has too much crudeness to be considered a date movie even with its romantic plot entangled.Dane Cook is overrated on standup and not any better onscreen. Perhaps with good direction we can see a decent romantic comedic lead out of him but that is about it. His improvising fails his line are sometimes delivered flat and he just doesn't have the charm that we see in Owen Wilson Will Ferrell Steve Carell or Seth Rogen. On the other hand Jessica Alba pulls a nice performance as the beautiful yet hardtoget Cam. A noteworthy oddity is that in the previews it shows that she is very clumsy yet in the film it's a trait that becomes quickly forgotten. She handles herself well with the little material she is given as she gives the movie its bit of energy that it desperately needs time and time again. Every other female in the movie was in it only because her jugs were a respectable size or in order to be ridiculed by everyone else.The main issue of Good Luck Chuck is that it is totally unaware of what it is it is unsure of what kind of movie it should bethen it winds up failing on every genre it tried imitating. Trailer shows it's a quirky romantic comedyfailure. Then in the movie we see an attempt to gross us out an attempt to arose us with all the nudity then tries to teach us about love by offering a bit of sentimental valuefailure. Fires on all cylinders but miss every single time. It is extremely hard to take this movie seriously in terms of the loveydovey material when we see an entire montage of Dane Cook sleeping with different women or there is a moment dedicated to seeing a penguin eating his own feces.Firsttime director Mark Helfrich should know better than to riddle this good idea with clichs explored ideas and Dane Cook material. Helfrich has been in the business for a very long time and could have really spun this short story by Steve Glenn into a creative romantic comedy. Instead it tries much too hard to be like Old School Wedding Crashers 40YearOld Virgin and other Rcomedies that have helmed a good amount of money. To be able to predict the next several scenes in the movie is never really a good sign either.Bottom Line A mess from start to finish we once again see Dane Cook trying to transfer his success from the mic into the movie screens but with no success at all. It does not help that he has an untalented cast of writers and cameramen behind this trash but Cook's inability to expand his brand of humor isn't exactly easy to work with either. Besides Alba there are no admirable traits in this movie and that even includes the grotesque amount of nudityand the critic reviewing this is a male. It takes guts to destroy a film that has beautiful women in almost every scene but Good Luck Chuck does exactly that. If it had stuck to what the trailer was presenting there could have been some hope. Good Luck Chuck ends up being like the best friend in the movie crude offensive unworthy pointless and just allaround an annoyance. Skip this pile of fish droppings.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie marks bar none the greatest departure I have ever come across between the response from both professional and IMDb critics and my own personal opinion. This striking dichotomy has prompted me to post my first ever IMDb review. Literally every professional critic I could find gave this movie a terrible review which I can only attribute to closed mindedness and a lack of imagination. Apparently every movie must fit neatly into a certain genre and cannot deviate from standard and infinitely repeated tropes. This movie was supposed to be a romantic comedy a genre which I generally do not care for as they tend to be sappy depressing and just generally boring. Nonetheless virtually all reviewers seem to decry that this movie refused to take out all the smut and revert itself into another in a line of bland and lifeless romantic comedies. An oft repeated line I found in reviews was that this movie is much closer to Caligula than Sleepless in Seattle. I personally cannot think of any higher praise for a movie.Other IMDb reviewers stated that the only people who would like this movie are college frat boys who want to see boobies. Well I can tell you that I and my girlfriend both have postgraduate degrees and both of us loved it. The movie is funny cute sexy fast paced and never takes itself too seriously. All of the characters are goodnatured and fun and display realistic responses and a great deal of humanity in reacting to an unusual and very funny situation. Dane Cook's character is a good person in a realistic nonHollywood sort of way. He tries to help people but certainly doesn't turn down sex with attractive women when it is quite literally thrown at him. When he meets the love of his life he ignores all of her quite significant flaws and pursues her vigorously. Jessica Alba's character is sweet funny and believable in the progression of her relationship with Cook. She is refreshingly understanding and nonjealous about Cook's rather unusual malady. Troy Gentile's character is criticized on these boards for being misogynistic but is certainly no more so than Jason Alexander's character in Shallow Hal. Gentile is often extremely funny generally well intentioned and a good friend to Cook.Many have commented that this movie is crude and disgusting. I honestly do not see this at all. The humor is significantly less lowbrow than say Superbad with all of its crude penis jokes and drawings. Yes there is nudity and sex but I don't see why this should make a movie disgusting. I also found it refreshing that the main two characters in this movie were a dentist and a doctor both educated successful and well spoken. In just about all of the recent comedies I can think of the main characters are reject losers that the audience can enjoy laughing at rather than laughing with. In Good Luck Chuck we don't feel especially sorry for any of the characters but we empathize with and relate to them and can laugh at their antics and escapades in a good natured and fun way.Do yourself a favor and ignore the critics. Go see this movie!".

Now there was a lot more sex then I expected but if you can handle that montage of sex scenes then you will enjoy the rest of the movie. It was better than Superbad I'll tell you that much I liked it and I hope that some people will give it a chance rather than listen to Roper and not see it.

Basically I thought I would have fun watching it as the hot Jessica Alba stars in it.The story is dead simple Dane Cook's character was chosen to sleep with a girl but he did not want to and this goth girl cursed him. The future comes those girls who slept with him will find their true love but not him. Chuck  Dane Cook wants romance and meets Cam  Jessica Alba he soon falls in love with her the rest of the story is the usual type of romance. The amusing parts are when Cam seems to be always a careless girl like when closing the door of a car and then her skirt gets stuck in it and the she pulls....her skirt gets ripped. The funny thing about this movie. It tries hard to get people laughing with its sexual contents and the usual banging into items. You got a choice to watch this. Whatever your taste is Jessica alba is still hot. Jessica alba is starting to be a famous actress her upcoming movies Awake and The Eye. If you think you will laugh at all funny sexual contents and dumb scenes you will laugh at it. Some people may find funny and some do not.Those who can't bear to see foolish people banging into items like a lamppost and those who hate disgusting jokes steer away.".

	schema:reviewBody "I approached this film with an open mind. The reviews had been bad but I films of this genre generally do. Besides any movie with Jessica Alba is worth a try in my opinion!The concept is good enough and should form a strong comedic element but I laughed about once throughout the movie. I don't know if it's just me but I found the opening kind of wrong and uncomfortable. The kids looked about 10 or 11 and the goth girl asks Charlie to show her his penis! She then forces herself onto him and curses him thus setting up the movie. I just found it unlikely that an 11 year old girl would act or talk in that way. Despite this weird opening I was still confident it could be a decent movie. I was wrong. Problem? Dane Cook. I saw Employee of the Month pretty poor but not as bas as this and Dan In Real Life good apart from Cook and found Cook to be intensely irritating. If you think Ben Stiller is annoying with his constant 'I'm a good guy who's unlucky in love' then you should see Dane Cook. He can't act he isn't funny and his gormless expression which is intended to show emotion just grates after awhile. So basically every girl who is with him then goes onto meet Mr Right after they split up with him. Predictability ensues and his thoroughly unlikable friend makes the film drag with few jokes capable of raising a laugh. The shame here is that Alba is sweet and the scenes around the penguins are amusing with her brother and her clumsiness raising this film to acceptable. Also the scenes with Alba and Cook before they date are funny with Alba's incredible bad luck with accidents. This is where the film peaks however it then steadily declines into absolute trash. It is impossible to care for the relationship. All I was thinking was that Alba should get a new agent because this is atrocious. Cook takes the movie to absurd levels with an over the top display of love in which he seems to become more of a stalker than admirer. I doubt that many of you will last long through this movie. Believe me the ending isn't worth waiting for. And a warning to you all is do not stay for the credits. I was greeted by the most disgusting and distasteful image that you'll see. Good Luck Chuck is basically a romcom with a nastiness to it. It's like the makers were trying to make a trashy sex comedy with a heart. They failed. This movie would have been far more successful had it cut out all the lewdness and Dane Cook! I don't mind a sex comedy which has outright lewdness and isn't trying to give it any heart. American Pie presents Beta House for instance is pointless but fun because it is meant to disgust and amuse in equal measure. It doesn't have a story and you don't care about the characters but at least it's not trying. With Good Luck Chuck you feel as though they were trying and this is the biggest tragedy of all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday a friend and I wanted to rent a movie. So I suggested Good Luck Chuck. So we rented it and saw it and it was one of the funnier movies I have seen this year. After seeing it I went on IMDb to see what other people have said. And this movie was given an overwhelmingly large pile of bad reviews. The one main complaint that I saw was that there were too many sex jokes. But what people don't understand is that the sex ties in with the premise of the movie. What I mean is the movie is about a guy that has sex with women and then they get married. So if that doesn't sound interesting to you then why would you pay 10.50 to see it. Another factor is that there is not only one kind of comedy. This is a raunchy comedy and on that point it delivers what it said it would. So maybe you should rent it instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "There has been some good Rated R comedies this isn't one of them. ChuckDane Cook has a curse on him by some goth girl so every time he has sex with a girl the girl finds the man of there dreams the next time they go on a date. Some may think of this as being lucky cause just about every girl wants to have sex with Chuck but soon he comes across Cam WexlerJessica Alba who is the girl of his dreams. Dane Cook plays a sweet guy that has respect for women which I highly doubt he is in real life. Cause just about every girl in this movie is shallow and dumb superstitious slut including Cam Wexler who is Jessica Alba's character. She tries to make her character seem clumsy cute and a bit ditsy but she just comes across as clumsy ditsy dumb and a bit psychotic. Chuck is a dopey dentist and works in the same building as his best friend StuDan Fogler. I never found Dan Fogler to be that funny and he tries to go with the gross humor in this one but just ends up being gross than funny and is a bit of a annoying character which is okay if he is funny but he is not funny. There is a scene in this film where it shows Dane Cook having sex with multiple girls since the screen gets split up into multiple section while he is performing the Kama Sutra which was unique but not that tasteful. And the best scene in the whole movie besides the parts that show off Jessica Alba's assets is the scene where Dane Cook gets bit in the crotch by a penguin. I get the feeling that the creators knew that sex sells so they just tried to go with what they thought was going to be a big hit. Plus the jokes aren't even clever they just throw in bunch of repulsive nonsense and expect the audience to laugh. Despite it having a lot of flaws it did somewhat have it's moments and was somewhat entertaining but nothing is special about this film. With it's slapstick style humor and revolting sex jokes which is cool if it was funny or at least amusing. 4.810".

Save your 812 and let this unfortunate waste of celluloid be reconciled to the obscurity where it belongs.And please noteI saw several small and teenage children in the theater.

It was even worse than I was expecting and I was expecting pretty bad seeing as Dane Cook is in it. There is only one more laugh in this movie than I've ever gotten from Dane Cook namely one laugh and it had nothing to do with Dane Cook's performance.Well at least Dane Cook didn't steal any jokes in this movie at least none that I noticed. Dan Fogler also delivered an extremely annoying character in the movie. A character that piggish should have been funny but he somehow didn't get a single laugh from me or the entire viewing audience.One unrelated note here I was confused how we watched the entire movie and there was only one laugh everyone was obviously bored no less than five people walked out and still when it ended a few morons clapped?!?! Anyway back to the trashing this movie deserves... This movie is being bashed by critics and it deserves it 110. The plot is based on a ridiculous premise. I didn't notice the written by credits but it was so stupid and illcontrived I'm assuming Dane Cook must have had a hand in it. On top of that it's misogynistic again talking about the Fogler character in particular to an incredible degree but still can't get a single laugh out of it.Do yourself a favor see any movie other than this! Even if it's not a comedy it will still be more funny. And even if it's a grade two student film made by a mentally challenged kid with A.D.D. it will have a more believable and heartfelt plot.Looks like this movie has already bombed which is great because it hopefully gets us one step closer to a Danefree world. What an awful movie!".

Anyway back to the trashing this movie deserves... This movie is being bashed by critics and it deserves it 110. The plot is based on a ridiculous premise. I didn't notice the written by credits but it was so stupid and illcontrived I'm assuming Dane Cook must have had a hand in it. On top of that it's misogynistic again talking about the Fogler character in particular to an incredible degree but still can't get a single laugh out of it.Do yourself a favor see any movie other than this! Even if it's not a comedy it will still be more funny. And even if it's a grade two student film made by a mentally challenged kid with A.D.D. it will have a more believable and heartfelt plot.Looks like this movie has already bombed which is great because it hopefully gets us one step closer to a Danefree world. What an awful movie!";

After 30 minutes I convinced myself to keep watching to see if it would get better or worse out of morbid curiosity. After 35 minutes I had to turn it off. For a romantic comedy I thought the basic premise sounded pretty funny and I used to like Jessica Alba. But the problem with this movie is that it is a one liner the guy who is a lucky charm for women to meet their match after dating Chuck. A lot of movies are one liners but what makes this one terrible is that has no depth. It simple reiterates the premise over and over again until the viewer is losing their will to live or at least keep their eyes open. This is the most superficial irritating simple minded and poorly actedwritten movies I have ever seen. I wish Jessica Alba wouldn't have gotten involved in this project. I thought she had more potential yet she is taking terrible roles and doesn't have enough talent to pull movies like this one out of trash bin few actresses would. The way the script makes her constantly trip all over everything is another excruciating aspect of this film. Do not waste your time.".

That's pretty much what I felt like doing after watching this movie.My husband and I rented this last night on pay per view thinking it was a lighthearted romantic comedy with Jessica Alba featured as a klutzy but lovable girl. What it turned out to be was soft pornfest suited for teenaged frat boys than a 'couples movie'. There were boobs boobs and MORE boobs Dane Cook portrayed having sex every which way with numerous woman all shown at once in a 'Brady Bunch' intro 'tic tac toe' format because showing him having sex with only two girls to get the point of the movie across just wasn't enough. I mean the movie opened with a topless girl giving him oral sex on the beach! The sidekick though hilarious comedic timing had some of the skeeviest dialogue. When Alba's character spills a burning candle on Dane's character during a wedding scene and the melted wax hardens on his pants the sidekick friend Stu proclaims that it looks like male ejaculate however he used the slang term. ICK did I really need to hear that?? Oh lets see....the sidekick masturbates into a grapefruit while stimulating his anus with a vegetable scrubbie I am NOT kidding! a woman with 3 boobs the sidekick who's a plastic surgeon calling Cook's character into the exam room to check the symmetry of a patient's boob job which absolutely violates doctorpatient privacy laws countless euphanisms for sex and even more for the female genetalia and a VERY disturbing ending showing Dane performing oral sex on a stuffed penguin. I don't know why but that just disturbed the bejesus out of me. After 11 years of marriage I have never been more uncomfortable around my husband after I move as I was after this one. I could go on but I would need a shower after I'm done reliving the skankiness of that movie.Ms. Alba who was adorkable in the movie should crawl under a rock to have associated with this movie. And to the reviewer who commented about Dane's pocked face  WORD! How is this guy a leading man? He's positively FOUL.This movie was absolutely gross. It made American Pie look like a Jane Austen novel. I swear! Unless you're an uberhorny guy looking for something to circle jerk with your friends to rent this. Other than than skip it. Run.

However because the very decade that gave birth to these films was so ruled by its own convictions most all of the films released at this period have dated. CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. Its very title suggests a sunny romantic comedy with occasional lapses into the risqu. This is not to say that it's a bad thing quite the contrary films about risqu subject matter have to begin somewhere and America being a culture rooted in specific traditions themselves laced in deep hypocrisies shocks itself for the sake of it when seeing an indirect reflection of the mores of the time. Meanwhile European films address these same situations walk off looking like a million bucks and have a longer shelflife because what we consider scandalous they shrug off say Next and move on. Toni Simmons Goldie Hawn in her breakout role a young very sixties bright young thing is carrying on with a mucholder dentist named Julian Winston Walter Matthau who has commitment issues. He can'r marry her he's already married. Toni decides instead of wilting away she actually wants to meet his wife and set things straight. Into the picture comes his assistant Stephanie Dickinson a luminous Ingrid Bergman returning to American cinema after a twentyyear absence a woman closer to his age who acts as if she and he had the perfect marriage and household. There is a reason for this she has harbored quiet emotions for Julian emotions he is unaware of even when he asks her to play his wife to ward Toni off from wanting to step their relationship further. And then he steps it up a notch when Toni's blissfully innocent actions veer the action off into the unexpected and he introduces Harvey Greenfield Jack Weston as Stephanie's lover. By the way Harvey is also an older gent who is having an affair with a much younger woman Eve Bruce whom he also lies to in one very funny scene.It's funny how the person whom we're looking for is the one who's always been there. What could have been a thankless role for Rick Lenz who plays Igor Sullivan Toni's next door neighbor turns into the man who not only sees the true beauty in fellow outcast Stephanie but the one who saves Toni at the start from killing herself. Not the stuff of comedy suicide. Then again this is not your average comedy. And needless to say is Ingrid Bergman's subtle poignant portrayal of a woman who's somehow missed her chances at love who's become prickly who due to a lie said to another she becomes the real person she was always meant to be. I can't imagine anyone else in this quiet but deep role.Movies like these can be enjoyed at facevalue and seen as escapist fun  a product of its times  or be viewed for the deep symbolism that like its title it carries deep within. It's a tricky film the same way Hawn's and Bergman's performance are equally tricky because in seeming so simple devoid of flourish and pose neither come out and proclaim what they are about. Their acting becomes not really acting but playing real people warts and all. CACTUS FLOWER is a story that never appears to take itself too seriously but reveals itself to be deep and very human after all.".

Matthau is an odd choice for the leading man he's too old for Goldie Hawn and too unrefined for Bergman not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist but I liked the way he tries hard to please Goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie. Hawn who won a Supporting Oscar is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today. This bedroom farce isn't terribly sophisticated and faintly reminds one of Any Wednesday besides but it's a welcome relief from the noisy teenoriented comedies churned out of presentday Hollywood.

	schema:reviewBody "Cactus Flower is what I call a pizza movie A personal favorite that never fails to satisfy. Perfect for an evening at home with a pizza. Knowing all the lines and what lines! by heart only enhances the enjoyment.Since so many others here have retold the plot I'll simply add the correction that Bergman's character Miss Dickinson was a nursereceptionist meaning she was a skilled nurse and therefore an educated person not just a receptionist.Bergman's performance in this film and the film itself was largely dismissed at the time but today's audiences will marvel at her range not just the impeccable comic timing but the ability to make us believe her character is unaware of her own feelings while revealing them so clearly to Toni and to us. While the general plot stretches credibility Bergman's performance is compelling honest and utterly believable.Also a standout is Jack Weston's performance as the Matthau's old friend and coconspirator Harvey. No one could deliver a zinger like Weston and I.A.L. Diamond's script gives him plenty. For example That's such a big dirty rotten lie it has class. Weston excelled at slightly seedy characters because he exuded a warmth that allowed you to forgive his characters' flaws. The film is a fairly straight adaptation of the Abe Burrows play which was itself adapted from a French play by Barillet and Gredy. On Broadway Matthau's role was played by Barry Nelson. Bergman's by Lauren Bacall and Hawn's by Brenda Vaccaro. It ran for 1234 performances three years and was nominated for two Tony Awards Vaccaro and Burt Brinckerhoff who played Igor.For me the film's score written and adapted by the legendary Quincy Jones is another highlight. The main theme A Time For Love Is Anytime is performed by Sarah Vaughn over the opening and closing credits. It is also insinuated in different arrangements throughout the film most notably as the romantic piano music underscoring Berman's speech to Hawn in the record store. Jones also created covers of popular songs from the period To Sir With Love I'm A Believer for the night club scenes. As with all of the film's elements there is a tremendous amount of talent taste and professionalism evident. In my opinion few modern romantic comedies can hold a candle to this classic. It's great to finally have it available on DVD. Time to call for a pizza...".

When she's on the screen it positively twinkles.This is a film which may appear dated at first but it actually made me wish I was around during the swingin' 'sixties. Hawn's fashions are as tacky as Bergman's are chic. That's one minor flawisn't her character a little too soigne for a gal who still lives with her sister? But then again would we have Ingrid any other way? And who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called The Slipped Disc?The best compliments I can pay to this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that I never saw and that it left me wanting more. Speaking of wanting more I wonder what ever became of sexy supporting actor Rick Lenz? He resembles Griffin Dunne in this film. This was his film debut and I don't see any other major roles in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn she's done so much since then it's easy to not be impressed but I can't imagine any other actor in the role either.Since the movie is based on a play the line delivery may seem a bit stagey but it did not inhibit my enjoyment at all. In fact I am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirtyfive years. Because this film represents a bygone era it has unjustly slipped from the consciousness of film buffs. It is more linked to the era films that came before it than the ones that followed. But don't let that stop you from savoring the delights it has to offer. Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw LAUREN BACALL do CACTUS FLOWER on Broadway I never dreamed that one day I would see an actress like INGRID BERGMAN playing the Bacall role on screen. But here Ingrid really lets her hair down for some good comedy moments as the dental nurse pretending to be WALTER MATTHAU's wife so he can go on with the fib he's told GOLDIE HAWN.It's a story played for laughs from beginning to end goodhumored stuff that never runs out of dry humor and wit throughout its running time.

I loved her interaction with Toni at the music store as well as her Dancing and doing the Dentist. It only further proved what I already knew that she is one of the greatest actresses of all time. Goldie Hawn is also delightful to watch. Her fun gentlehearted and lovable Toni is the driving force of the movie. You don't even question why she would be so concerned about her Finacee's wife you just accept that she's just that type of person who wouldn't be happy unless she knew everyone else was also. And Walter Matthau is great as Julian. His actions never create a feeling animosity for the viewer in fact they almost make him more enduring. There wasn't an unlikable character in the bunch.

A supercute Goldie Hawn is absolutely charming and vivacious. I couldn't have pictured anyone other than Walter Matthau as Julian. The rest of the cast are impressive.'Cactus Flower' is a well made movie. Quincy Jones's music has a foottapping effect. The cinematography and editing are solid. Saks never derails from the main story.This film has plenty of laugh out loud moments but my favourite one is the final dance sequence. That had me pretty much rolling on the floor.

The rest of the cast are impressive.'Cactus Flower' is a well made movie. Quincy Jones's music has a foottapping effect. The cinematography and editing are solid. Saks never derails from the main story.This film has plenty of laugh out loud moments but my favourite one is the final dance sequence. That had me pretty much rolling on the floor. To sum it up 'Cactus Flower' is a wonderful comedy. I'll be revisiting it sometime.";

	schema:reviewBody "Goldie Hawn in 1969 was best known for playing in television comedy shows  in particular ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN where she was the giggly cookie young blond. She did make movies before CACTUS FLOWER the most notable being a Walt Disney feature THE ONE AND ONLY GENUINE ORIGINAL FAMILY BAND. But CACTUS FLOWER picked up on her character from LAUGHIN and due to a good script by I.A.L. Diamond  Billy Wilder's second partner  based on an Abe Burrows play she was able to develop the television character so that a real performance was fleshed out. As a result Ms Hawn won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1969 and her career took off to such future hits as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although other stars of LAUGHIN did well on television Henry Gibson has a recurring role as a judge on BOSTON LEGAL only Goldie was able to have a career as a bonifide movie star.On LAUGHIN Goldie's personality would show a naivet that would be embarrassing. Occasionally she realized it and would laugh loud to cover but sometimes she just did not see her error example Goldie is introduced to the 1950s variety show host Gary Moore and is told Goldie this is Mr. Gary Moore. She shakes his hand and says much to his confusion I've always wanted to meet Mr. John Gary Moore!. But as Toni Simmons it is quite different. She is desperately in love with Dr. Julian Winston Walter Matthau a successful dentist who can never marry her. Julian has told her that his wife with whom he has had two sons and a daughter will never give him a divorce. So at the start of the film Toni tries to commit suicide by the gas of her stove. But she is rescued by her neighbor Igor Sullivan Rick Lenz a struggling dramatist who breaks into her apartment and turns off the gas. Toni is resigned to live but she has sent a suicide note to Julian. Igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note but Julian's receptionistnurseassistant Stephanie Dickinson Ingrid Bergman won't stop Julian's work schedule to pass him the phone when Igor calls. Instead Julian finds the letter and races to Toni's apartment only to find her alive. When Igor supports her story that she tried to kill herself Julian realizes the depth of her love and decides he must marry such a woman. Unfortunately Toni has swallowed Julian's lies and believes in his wife and children. You see Julian has no wife and children. Since Toni is a firm believer that she can't marry a man who would lie to her Julian is stuck on a weakening tree branch.Julian comes to solve it by getting Stephanie to pretend she is Mrs. Winston. Stephanie is opposed to it at first but on her own on her first free Saturday she confronts Toni at the record shop Toni is at. They talk and Toni notices all the fine strengths of character and personality of Stephanie and since Stephanie has her two nephews with her Toni thinks they are Julian's kids. Toni tells Julian they have to see who is the man that Stephanie is supposedly going to marry. So the lie starts spiraling for Julian Stephanie and Toni. Soon a lover is given to Stephanie in the form of Julian's friend and freeloading patient Harvey Greenfield Jack Weston. Greenfield is so sleazy Stephanie loathes him that Toni feels that he is unworthy of Stephanie.And so it goes with one complication most caused by the wellintentioned misinformed Toni following another until the conclusion. The script is full of first rate situations and oneliners example Julian to reward Stephanie for lying about their marriage buys two record albums from Toni's store. He has given a mink stole to Toni but she decides to send it to Stephanie with Julian's card. Stephanie is quite happy at getting the mink but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she got  when she profusely thanks Matthau he says the thought she'd like Horowitz  meaning Vladomir Horowitz. But Stephanie thinks Horowitz is the name of the furrier!. Bergman must have enjoyed the filming as several scenes shows that earthy radiance that was a trademark for her in the later 1940s films. But there was also the resemblance to her 1958 film comedy smash hit INDISCREET. There Cary Grant lied to make sure the pair would concentrate on the romance of their affair without having to think about marriage. When Grant's lie is revealed to Bergman she decides on a lie of her own to convince Grant that she was making him a cuckold. Here instead of being the passive lover believing Matthau is telling the truth Bergman gingerly tries to get Matthau out of his mess by little white lies only to find one leads to another to complicate everyone's lives. Bergman is seen as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem despite trying to be part of the solution.All the leads perform well in particular Bergman all business thoroughness at first but gradually reclaiming her sexuality. Matthau is delightful as a man who finds a useful lie is an impediment that just can't be kicked aside. The supporting cast especially Weston as the mooching and sexually slimy Harvey and Vito Scotti as the U.N. ambassador who actually has the hots for Bergman. It was a clever comedy and a really good way for Goldie Hawn's movie career to push forward.".

	schema:headline " My favorite best werewolf film of all time a true horror icon classic!";
	schema:reviewBody "An American Werewolf in London 1981 is a cult classic horror werewolf slasher flick. It is my third favorite werewolf film of all time! An American Werewolf in London is not only the best werewolf movie ever made it is also one of the best genre films of all time. I grew up watching this film and it is a childhood favorite of mine. I first saw this movie when I was 13 years young of age it is a childhood movie for me and it is the first werewolf film I ever saw. I love this film to death and I think it is a great horror film of all time! It is one of my personal favorite horror werewolf movies of all time.It is very scary especially the ending you can see a human's head falling down the street. I don't know much about the cast I don't know almost anyone except actress Jenny Agutter I know her from Logan's Run 1976 and The Eagle Has Landed 1976. This film is directed by John Landis who directed a lot of comedy films. The movie was entirely shot in London Surrey and Wales which you can see a beautiful country side in the UK. This film The Howling 1981 and Dog Soldiers 2002 are my top 3 favorite werewolf films this will be my number 2 favorite film.Plot Two American college students are on a walking tour of Britain and are attacked by a werewolf. One is killed the other is mauled. The werewolf is killed but reverts to its human form and the local townspeople are unwilling to acknowledge its existence. The surviving student begins to have nightmares of hunting on four feet at first but then finds that his friend and other recent victims appear to him demanding that he commit suicide to release them from their curse being trapped between worlds because of their unnatural deaths.This is a classic horror film about two young American men David Kessler played by Naughton and Jack Goodman played by Dunne attacked by a werewolf on a backpacking holiday in England. With Jack killed David is taken to a London hospital where his disturbing apparitions of his deceased friend informs him that he is a werewolf and will transform at the next full moon. What I love about this film is I love the story the special effects and the humor in here. In the opening scene you have a really beautiful view on an England country side when you see David Kessler and Jack Goodman walking down the road. This movie is really beautiful shot I love that two young men best friends are traveling together and seeing England in a country side. I love the werewolf story and everything in it.I love the characters in this movie the story is a full long horror film with awesome black comedy in it practical effects by Rick Baker that still rival some god awful cartoon ps1 CGI now a days!!! I have seen this film more then any other movie and it still feels fresh. And while filmed in the early eighties it feels timeless. The blend of horror and humor are perfect. The horror comes at you brutal andor fast and the humor is never forced but comes naturally out of the absurdity of the events waking up naked in the zoo having your dead friend tell you that you are a werewolf. Oh man this is such a fun movie. It's a great werewolf story with enough gore for the splatter junkies and enough story to make it better than just some runofthemill horror flick. This was created in a time when horror was HORROR as opposed to these kiddie flicks with predictable jump scares we get today.The special effects done by the great Rick Baker are absolutely astounding even more believable than a lot of what we get today. The first transformation scene is one of the best to ever be featured in a werewolf film especially with the convincing screams of pain from David Naughton. The actual look of the werewolf is also just as great giving one of the most menacing and evil appearance I've ever seen on a wolf. The howl sounds like a mixture between a man's scream and an actual beast giving a call a sound that sends a chill down your spine every time you hear it. These sort of details remind you that even though there's comedy in it Landis did put great focus on the horror aspect of the film.An American Werewolf in London is a 1981 BritishAmerican horror comedy film written and directed by John Landis and starring David Naughton Jenny Agutter and Griffin Dunne.Overall An American Werewolf in London is a timeless excellent cult classic movie my favorite number 2 werewolf film of all time! Score 1010 I love this film the acting is really solid the characters in this film a well written. The special effects in this movie are well made. This movie on it self's stays a true classic in a horror genre and it is way better movie than these days horror movies that are in PG13 ratings awful!".

Great performances from the cast and an excellent script make this a memorable experience.  Unlike monsterhorror movies today this film has no computeraided special effects.  It doesn't need them for this is a landmark film.".

This is one of his best.The appeal to this film is the combination of horror suspense action and humor. The latter actually is the key ingredient because this can become a downright scary movie. The levity here and there is welcome relief. There is just the right amount of contrast between horror and comedy.For parents wanting to know there also is a fair amount of rough language and there two sex scenes one as part of the story and one on screen in a porn movie theater where the two male leads meet late in the story.Jenny Agutter is the love interest in here a very pretty woman whom Americans audiences aren't that familiar with. It isn't just her neither of the two leading American male actors in this popular movie ever became stars either.An entertaining but silly sequel came out almost two decades later An American Werewolf in Paris. I own both movies but much prefer this one.".

The comic bits wouldn't be nearly as delightful if they didn't supervene on the disturbing and the horror wouldn't have near the impact if they didn't arrive in the context where you halfexpect the next moment to be just as lighthearted and amusing. Both the initial animal attack and the apocalyptic ending are perfect examples of this.Aside from that exquisite unusualness An American Werewolf In London has many other superb characteristics. The cast is perfect. Naughton who also starred in the seriously underrated Desire The Vampire aka I Desire 1982 carries the film with ease. The cinematography is excellent. The shots of the countryside actually filmed in Wales are actually both beautiful and very eerie at the same time. The makeup effects are awesome and the transformation effects are unsurpassed. The music which is primarily a number of different moon related pop songs is also perfect partially because of the bizarre contrasts in mood that the music creates which echoes the comedytragedy juxtaposition. Unlike many other films every scene in this one is a something I'd like to spend years exploring. The settings the characters the scenarios are all so fascinating.This film is a 10 out of 10 even with one hand tied behind its back. If you enjoy it and you're open minded about newer horror film styles the sequel An American Werewolf in Paris is also worth a watch.".

David Kessler David Naughton and Jack Goodman Griffin Dunne have not a care in the world until they end up on The Moors... At night... With a full moon... Okay this is getting redundant but I bet you get where I'm going if not refer to title. If you ever do find yourself in merry Ole' England at night etc etc etc. Stay clear of a place called The Slaughtered Lamb in fact just stay on sheep truck until sunlight comes around. Besides the first Howling American Werewolf is the best werewolf flick out there and holds up nicely to today's cheesy horror flops.

	schema:reviewBody "John Landis has one of his most memorable films as it challenges him as a director of comedy and horror and he's rarely done better in the latter. While many of his best films are among the comedies that he directed for SNL alumni Belushi and Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy An American Werewolf in London stands apart from those by casting David Naughton Jenny Aguter and Griffin Dunne in the parts all practically unknowns then and giving them some of the best kinds of genre roles imaginable. The two friends played by Naughton and Dunne are out on vacation sort of and they stumble upon a town loaded with superstition about wolves and other things. When Dunne gets killed and something uh peculiar happens to Naughton it changes both of them principally because Naughton keeps seeing Dunne deteriorating throughout the rest of the film even as he both turns into the werewolf Beware the moon David beware the moon and falls for a kind nurse played by Aguter. All three roles are realized well though it might be prudent to put a lot of good will on the male leads as they both go under Rick Baker's still showstopping makeup jobs.This is the kind of production that could go in a few different directions and for someone like Landis's skills it could've gone in those directions either one considering his background. It could have been a sendup much like his Kentucky Fried Movie. It could have been just dumb pure camp like one of his lesser comedies of the 90s. But here he's really sticking to his guns to make it really believably scary but also with a sly coarse and crude sense of humor about it. It's almost in tune to what would come a few years later with Ghostbusters only without the megawit and overall mainstream appeal. It's a cult item that probably isn't seen by many as Landis's other films yet I still remember things very well from the film years later indelible things like the use of songs obvious sure by 'moon' being all over the place but everything from Van Morrison to CCR to the main Blue Moon theme used during the crossover are really deadperfect for what's needed. Aside from the obvious makeup scenes I remember being both freaked and delighted by the undead exchanges with David especially when it finally reaches its purest absurdity in the movie theater scene.And even the ending unlike other Landis films is with a tinge of tragedy and sadness. This is not the ending a typical comedy director would bring as by now we've really gotten on the side of David the scorned protagonist turned bloody villain by way of a curse. Some of the scenes that end up cutting back to the old rural village as I also remember it were not my favorite scenes as they brought more of the superstitious stuff that is not necessarily needed. It's the bits with Naughton with Dunne and even with the lady of the film that make it worthwhile. It's fun but not too goofy or bad Bmovielike and it's scary without being cheap. It's basically the finest synthesis yet from the filmmaker to combine his gory theatrics with his firm cool sense of humor. It's also one of my favorite films of 1981.".

Aside from the obvious makeup scenes I remember being both freaked and delighted by the undead exchanges with David especially when it finally reaches its purest absurdity in the movie theater scene.And even the ending unlike other Landis films is with a tinge of tragedy and sadness. This is not the ending a typical comedy director would bring as by now we've really gotten on the side of David the scorned protagonist turned bloody villain by way of a curse. Some of the scenes that end up cutting back to the old rural village as I also remember it were not my favorite scenes as they brought more of the superstitious stuff that is not necessarily needed. It's the bits with Naughton with Dunne and even with the lady of the film that make it worthwhile. It's fun but not too goofy or bad Bmovielike and it's scary without being cheap. It's basically the finest synthesis yet from the filmmaker to combine his gory theatrics with his firm cool sense of humor. It's also one of my favorite films of 1981.";

It may not add anything to the plot but the werewolf Nazis and the following sequence where the audience are wrong footed is a very witty piece of writing The film manages to merge gut wrenching black comedy with gruesome horror and not many films have been able to do this . It also manages to mix traditional horror clichs like outsiders walking in to an Inn  We don't get many strangers 'ere sir  with post modernism where characters discuss werewolf movies . These mixed concepts never jar and add a charm to the film .

The special effects people and make up artists make AWIL a tour de force for their profession . You might complain that the werewolf itself when fully shown looks too literally like a massive wolf but nowadays we'd be drowned in CGI effects credibility would quickly collapse . Indeed this was a major problem with the sequel set in Paris . That and the blatant fact that it was unrelated to this picture There are a couple of minor complaints . One is the very abrupt ending where the protagonist is killed when you're expecting the deed to be done by his lover  especially when David did mention werewolves being killed by loved ones in movies earlier . There's also a plot hole of David transforming in to a werewolf  leaving the house killing several people including one in the London underground but never once being spotted by a passer by . What compounds the lack of logic is the following memorable comic sequence where a naked David wonders how he's going to get home but I guess this is cinematic convention in general and horror convention in particular  you have to suspend disbelief in order for a film to work But these are minor complaints .

I guess there's just something about the visceral thrills associated with waiting for some sort of ubergross supernatural being to spring out of the shadows and make a bloody mess of things. When the monsterhorror genre is mixed with comedy the resultas we've seen in recent yearsis often gold. Whether it's Shaun of the Dead Zombieland or any variety of Bmovie schlock a good time is generally had by all.And that's the case with John Landis' 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. It's silly and punctuated by instances of extremely dark humor and it rarely makes any attempt to work true emotion into the narrative. This of course is a good thing.After a somewhat slow opening we witness two friendswho are backpacking across Europestumble upon a shady pub called The Slaughtered Lamb. When they walk through the door the effect is pretty much the clich turntablecomingtoascreechinghalt scenario that you've seen a million times before. A room full of hardnosed Brits eyes them suspiciously and the boys' seemingly innocent inquiries about a pentagram that's painted on a wall doesn't help add levity to the situation. After some awkward moments the pair is once again traversing the English countryside. It's then that a monstrous wolfcreature attacks them out of nowhere killing one and injuring the other.The survivor is taken to a hospital in London where he soon realizes that when the moon is full he'll transform into an unstoppable killing machine complete with fangs claws and brambles of tangled hair.Said protagonist falls for his nurse and they embark on a brief love affair that involves little more than intimate encounters in a shower and playful banter regarding the possibility of humans becoming creatures of the night.As you'd expect the humor is what elevates Werewolf above any offerings of similar quality. Landis strategically places appropriate moments of dry actionslinedelivery throughout the movie and the contrast between the horrible gore inflicted by the monster and the overly proper behavior of some of London's finest citizens makes for a chuckleworthy fishoutofwater scenario.The problem though is that are far too many moments where the story quite simplylags. Throw the funny but much too abrupt finale into the mix and it seems as if Landis and company have somehow avoided taking full advantage of a great premise.If you've never seen An American Werewolf in London it is worth checking out. It has one or two moments that will likely cause you to doubleover in raucous laughter but when compared to more recent comedyhorror fare it seems like little more than a fleeting slice of mildly amusing nostalgia.".

As they walk along the country roads they engage in realistic backandforth banter and we learn that Jack is unhappy with the situation and would much rather be in some continental city whereas his friend David is glad to explore the English countryside. As the sun goes down they take refuge inside a pub called the Slaughtered Lamb to escape the cold. The locals are unfriendly especially when they ask about a pentagram painted on the wall ... the two of them eventually take the hint and leave to continue walking through the moors.Wandering off the road into the dark grassy land they begin to hear strange and frightening howling noises and see something big stalking them in the shadows ... suddenly Jack is attacked and David flees the scene before turning back to help his friend but he too is set upon by some kind of wolfbeast until the locals show up armed with shotguns. He wakes up in a hospital and learns that his friend Jack is dead. While there he falls in love with a beautiful young nurse. As he recovers from his trauma he has peculiar dreams about monsters misty woods and killing. Then he starts having gruesome visions of his dead friend who warns him that he is becoming a werewolf ...There are so many memorable sequences in this movie it's unbelievable. My favourite has always been the initial werewolf attack on the moors  I first saw the movie when I was very young and that was the one that scared me most of all. I also remembered the dream sequences particularly well and that poor man who is stalked by the werewolf in the London underground. It's an incredibly surreal movie especially during the excellent hospital sequences because well becoming a werewolf would be a pretty surreal thing to go through! All of this is helped by the high quality of directing from John Landis and Rick Baker's infamously brilliant makeup inventions.The soundtrack is also excellent  Landis' idea was that he would only use songs with the word 'moon' in the title. Since then the songs Bad Moon Rising and Blue Moon are automatically linked with this movie by anyone who's seen it. The cast is also very notable and both David Naughton and Griffin Dunne give funny competent performances as the two Americans while the allstar British cast is headed by the brilliant Brian Glover Jenny Agutter and John Woodvine.Some of the comedy may be a little cheesy but most of it is still worth a few laughs. You should bear in mind that this was the first real horror comedy ever made and these days they're a dimeadozen. If it hadn't been for American Werewolf the genre would certainly not have been the same. This is an indisputable classic of the horror genre and an incredible important movie. Two decades on it's easily still deserving of it's title as the greatest Werewolf movie of all time.".

This is without a doubt one of my favorite horror films because it has such a brilliant combination of horror and comedy that is priceless.John Landis he was such a great director in the 80's and I learned that this was one of his first scripts. This movie was also a break through Oscar wise this is the first film to win best make up effects. Which it totally deserved because we actually get to witness the transformation from man to werewolf on screen and it's unforgettable. For 1981 these effects were amazing!Taking place in London as two Americans are back packing through Europe we have David Naughten who plays David Kessler and Griffin Dunne who plays Jack Goodman. When they are warned to beware the moon and stick to the road... oops! they loose their way and are viciously attacked by a werewolf. Jack is unfortunately killed but David is bitten and the werewolf gets killed by the town's people. David wakes up in the hospital where he is being cared for by a beautiful nurse Jenny Agutter who plays Alex Price and is David's love interest in the movie.When David has finally gathered himself and accepts what happened as just a freak accident Jack a terribly dismembered and gouged out dead Jack comes to visit David from beyond the grave. It starts off as just this hilarious conversation talking about Jack's funeral while David is debating if he's going crazy or not my favorite line is in this scene Susanname??? cried a lot and snuck the comfort in Mark Levigne's bed David is shocked and says Mark Levigne?! Jack just playfully remarks An ae life mocks me even in death. LOL! Then Jack tells David that they were attacked by a werewolf and he must kill himself otherwise he'll kill others and make them like Jack whereas he cannot go to Heaven or Hell he's on the line until the werewolf's blood is severed. Have you ever tried talking to a corpse!? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself David before you kill others is Jack's last lines before David just begs Nurse Alex to get him out of the hospital.Through a love or lust story between Alex and David David is warned once again by Jack who is now becoming more decayed he ignores the warnings thinking it's only his conscience but is terribly wrong when he kind of goes on a stroll during the full moon killing 6 people in London. He then is confronted by all of the corpses along with Jack and just have this great scene of how to kill himself. Guys this is a terrific movie and is a must see for horror fans comedy fans any type of movie fan. It's just a lot of fun to watch and it's scary and exciting and you just can't miss it. Beware the moors and maybe get yourself a silver bullet if you go to London. D1010".

Unable to remember what he did the night before David becomes worried  after getting various visits from his dead friend Jack warning about what was going to happen he is convinced he killed those people. The only way to put an end to the bloodshed is for David to be killed but with the next full moon fast approaching who will do it...This British American coproduction was written  directed by John Landis  is considered one of the true classics of the genre usually I don't buy into what other people say  make my own mind up just the way it should be but on this occasion I can see why An American Werewolf in London is so highly regarded as it's an excellent horror film with lashings of black humour. The script modernises the traditional Werewolf story just like The Howling 1980 did around the same time although I think An American Werewolf in London is the far superior film. It has a great story that really engages with terrific character's whom you care for  make the downbeat ending rather sad a nice pace plenty of incident  some really cool scenes including the climax set in Piccadilly Circus which must have been a nightmare to organise. To offset the horror there's a nice vein of black humour running through the film with a funny  slightly surreal scene set inside a porno theatre where David gets to talk with his dead victims  the amusing aftermath of David's first transformation where he wakes up naked at a zoo  has to get home by stealing a woman's coat. The only problem I have with An American Werewolf in London are the abrupt nightmare sequences which don't make much sense in context  just seem to happen  I would have liked a little bit more involving the villagers who feel like they should be important but are never really used  are totally forgotten about. All in all though a classic of the genre that holds up really well even today in fact An American Werewolf in London is head  shoulders above most new horror product.This is well made with the Oscar winning special makeup effects by Rick Baker being of particular note the Werewolf transformation is excellent  still has yet to be bettered really. It's certainly a lot more impressive than any CGI computer Werewolf transformation I have seen. There's some good gore here too from ripped up Deer slit throats severed hands rotting corpses lots of blood a bitten off head  some mangled bodies. The effects are good though the attack scenes are short  little is seen probably due to the limitations of the effects at the time. Several London landmarks are seen  feature in the film while the soundtrack is especially good here with all the songs featured having the word Moon in the title  the Werewolf howl very striking  one of the best I've heard.With a supposed budget of about 10000000 this had a pretty big budget  you can see it on screen with good use of locations great effects work  high production values. The acting is very good too there's a great supporting cast including Jenny Agutter Brian Glover Alan Ford Frank Oz  Rik Mayall while porn star Linzi Drew appears as herself in the porn film playing at the theatre. Apparently the studio hoped Dan Aykroyd  John Belushi would be cast in the leading roles but thankfully that didn't happen.An American Werewolf in London is a classic horror film that is well regarded amongst genre fans for very good reason it's one of the best horrors out there basically that can be enjoyed on many levels  probably is more accessible than a lot of horror. A really top film that was followed by a terrible sequel An American Werewolf in Paris 1997.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being around fifteen at the time when I first saw this movie it was on VHS Video. I was at my aunts Cottage in the middle of nowhere. It was late on a summer's evening. The cottage was a Servants Cottage as she was Maid to a very well heeled family. After watching I had to go home the walk home was only a few miles no problem back then to hitch a lift. The walk from the cottage to the main road was one mile. One mile of country lane. With no streetlights and plenty of empty fields and trees along the narrow winding single traffic width lane.Now you are walking down a dark quiet and a little too peaceful lane late at night after watching An American Werewolf in London. I never ran so fast down that lane so much in all my life. 1982 Academy Award Winner Rick Baker has been in the business of scaring the life out of people since his very early days in 1971. Working as Make up and Special Effect's Artist on movies such as Star Wars 1977 Flesh Gordon The Ring Batman Forever Videodrome and the 1976 King Kong movie to name but a few. The category for Best MakeUp had only just been introduced to the Oscars in 1981 because of An American Werewolf in London. Rick Baker was the very first to win an Oscar for this category. To date he has won six Oscars for his work on Best Makeup and Effects. Winning also the 1982 Academy of Science Fiction Fantasy and Horror Films Saturn Award for Best Makeup for Werewolf in London and Star Wars 1977 in 1978 and Interview with the Vampire in 1995 to mention a couple here. The Director of Animal House 1978 and The Blues Brothers from 1980 John Landis has come a long way since becoming a stunt performer in Sergio Leone's 1968 masterpiece Once Upon A Time in the West and as assistant Director on the 1970's Kelly's Hero's movie. Though not his first Horror movie to be Directed and written by Mr Landis this being the 1973 Schlock comedyhorror movie. He took up the role as Writer for Werewolf in London as early as 1969 when he was nineteen years of age some twelve years before the film was filmed and released. The impact of this movie at the time of its release was phenomenal. Nothing had ever been seen like this before. Being the story of two American friends David and Jack back packing across Europe. It is when they reach the English Moors in Yorkshire on a cold and wet afternoon on a night of the full moon that they find that their troubles will begin. After upsetting the locals in the Slaughtered Lamb pub they are shown the door. Beware the Moon they are forewarned this was to become one of the most iconic phrases in modern horror movies of all time. But it is too little too late whilst getting lost on the Moors they are attacked by a lukanthropia. Jack dies and David wakes up in a London Hospital days later. The love interest here is done through the connection between the young and beautiful nurse Alex Price played here by the ever quintessential English Rose Jenny Agutter. The next full moon rises and David has other plans for the night. The Beast has awoken. What has made this movie transform itself from the mainstream werewolf movie to the Movie of Werewolf's is the fantastically frightening and completely original manner that David transmogrifies between Man and Beast. While other Werewolf movies rely on out of shot changes for example here you are with him in the same room to terrified to move. You are here as character witness the fear locking your senses to the sheer terror that is unfolding before your very eyes and seeing every minuet detail from Man to Beast. Every stage a transgression of a dangerous and terrifying ordeal. There is nowhere for you to run. Your next. As typical Landis style humour be it slapstick or dark is never far away. Even for Werewolf in London. David in his Lycanthropic state devours several victims. The most famous being the businessman alone on the London Underground System. Classic horror. The point being that Jack and his poor victims come back from the dead to ask David to kill himself. Jack and his new found undead friends are now cursed to walk the Earth in limbo until he himself is dead. To break the curse. These undead are talking walking and extremely decomposing carcases. The make up at the time was second to none. The attention to detail is truly Oscar inspiring.What is odd about this movie is that every musical soundtrack is a song that contains the word Moon in the title for example Blue Moon by Sam Cooke and Bad Moon Rising by The Creedence Clearwater Revival. This works very well and brings home the ever foreboding fear and trepidation that Werewolf in London is. Here we see the late Brian Glover and a nonspeaking cameo role by the then young and unknown English comic Rik Mayell as the second chess player. Frank Oz the Muppet master plays a tiny role here too. This werewolf movie has surpassed them all due to the combinations of Rick Baker John Landis and a great team of movie people working hard behind the scenes. An American Werewolf in London is an epic special effects masterpiece. If the Academy Awards have to make an entirely new Category because of Werewolf in London's merits then that is telling us something that perhaps Hollywood have become Animal lovers? No they recognise talent and hard work when they see it.".

With no streetlights and plenty of empty fields and trees along the narrow winding single traffic width lane.Now you are walking down a dark quiet and a little too peaceful lane late at night after watching An American Werewolf in London. I never ran so fast down that lane so much in all my life. 1982 Academy Award Winner Rick Baker has been in the business of scaring the life out of people since his very early days in 1971. Working as Make up and Special Effect's Artist on movies such as Star Wars 1977 Flesh Gordon The Ring Batman Forever Videodrome and the 1976 King Kong movie to name but a few. The category for Best MakeUp had only just been introduced to the Oscars in 1981 because of An American Werewolf in London. Rick Baker was the very first to win an Oscar for this category. To date he has won six Oscars for his work on Best Makeup and Effects. Winning also the 1982 Academy of Science Fiction Fantasy and Horror Films Saturn Award for Best Makeup for Werewolf in London and Star Wars 1977 in 1978 and Interview with the Vampire in 1995 to mention a couple here. The Director of Animal House 1978 and The Blues Brothers from 1980 John Landis has come a long way since becoming a stunt performer in Sergio Leone's 1968 masterpiece Once Upon A Time in the West and as assistant Director on the 1970's Kelly's Hero's movie. Though not his first Horror movie to be Directed and written by Mr Landis this being the 1973 Schlock comedyhorror movie. He took up the role as Writer for Werewolf in London as early as 1969 when he was nineteen years of age some twelve years before the film was filmed and released. The impact of this movie at the time of its release was phenomenal. Nothing had ever been seen like this before. Being the story of two American friends David and Jack back packing across Europe. It is when they reach the English Moors in Yorkshire on a cold and wet afternoon on a night of the full moon that they find that their troubles will begin. After upsetting the locals in the Slaughtered Lamb pub they are shown the door. Beware the Moon they are forewarned this was to become one of the most iconic phrases in modern horror movies of all time. But it is too little too late whilst getting lost on the Moors they are attacked by a lukanthropia. Jack dies and David wakes up in a London Hospital days later. The love interest here is done through the connection between the young and beautiful nurse Alex Price played here by the ever quintessential English Rose Jenny Agutter. The next full moon rises and David has other plans for the night. The Beast has awoken. What has made this movie transform itself from the mainstream werewolf movie to the Movie of Werewolf's is the fantastically frightening and completely original manner that David transmogrifies between Man and Beast. While other Werewolf movies rely on out of shot changes for example here you are with him in the same room to terrified to move. You are here as character witness the fear locking your senses to the sheer terror that is unfolding before your very eyes and seeing every minuet detail from Man to Beast. Every stage a transgression of a dangerous and terrifying ordeal. There is nowhere for you to run. Your next. As typical Landis style humour be it slapstick or dark is never far away. Even for Werewolf in London. David in his Lycanthropic state devours several victims. The most famous being the businessman alone on the London Underground System. Classic horror. The point being that Jack and his poor victims come back from the dead to ask David to kill himself. Jack and his new found undead friends are now cursed to walk the Earth in limbo until he himself is dead. To break the curse. These undead are talking walking and extremely decomposing carcases. The make up at the time was second to none. The attention to detail is truly Oscar inspiring.What is odd about this movie is that every musical soundtrack is a song that contains the word Moon in the title for example Blue Moon by Sam Cooke and Bad Moon Rising by The Creedence Clearwater Revival. This works very well and brings home the ever foreboding fear and trepidation that Werewolf in London is. Here we see the late Brian Glover and a nonspeaking cameo role by the then young and unknown English comic Rik Mayell as the second chess player. Frank Oz the Muppet master plays a tiny role here too. This werewolf movie has surpassed them all due to the combinations of Rick Baker John Landis and a great team of movie people working hard behind the scenes. An American Werewolf in London is an epic special effects masterpiece. If the Academy Awards have to make an entirely new Category because of Werewolf in London's merits then that is telling us something that perhaps Hollywood have become Animal lovers? No they recognise talent and hard work when they see it.";

If Werewolves were real this is exactly how they would look instead of a human shape with a wolves head it looks more like a massive very scary looking dogwolf. You catch a glimpse of it on the Underground scene and then again at the very end. They couldn't have made it look more real if they tried. It has an absolute perfect balance of comedy and horror. The horror of the movie is very scary and the comedy is often hilarious without adding the mistake of slapstick An American Werewolf in Paris. There is also a bit of a love story thrown in. I think this is and always will be my favorite horror of all time and was probably the first real horror that I saw as a child Shown to me by my very irresponsible babysitter when I was just 7. I hear it's due for a remake it would have to be a pretty amazing movie to surpass this one.".

The characterisation is fairly predictable though wise older Japanese gangster hotheaded younger gangster coldblooded Italian gangster etc. The film sometimes looks as if it's heading in some interesting directions the Italian mobster's verbally abused sidekick for example but these turn into dead ends.

I became a fan of Viggo Mortensen after watching this movie in the 90's his character is very well developed in one sentence of his liaison Sam when he explains that David Brandt is a needy man without family that gives a great value to honor and does not admit betrayal. The screenplay is sharp and the production is classy supported by magnificent direction and performances and an awesome soundtrack.

After fending off the attackers he saves the life of Shuji Sawamoto Ryo Ishibashi who just happens to be a high ranking Yakuza member.

Sawamoto takes a liking to Nick and takes him under his wing. However when Brandt's boss Littman Forster informs him that the Campanela clan is going to wipe out the Tendo gang and to stay out of it Brandt gets angry firstly because he's fallen in love with Yuko Lawson and secondly because he's come to actually respect the culture and customs of the Japanese which has blurred his judgment to the fact that he's dealing with criminals. So during the final firefight between the two gangs Brandt makes his final stand...what will it be? American Yakuza is classierthanusual fare and recommended viewing. It's shot very well the acting is topnotch there's intelligence behind the writing and it's directed with a mixture of grit and an artistic streak that is very hard to pull off but here wins over the audience.It's definitely more of a gangster drama than an action movie but there are some spectacular action scenes that make you wish there was room in the plot to fit in a few more. But it is somewhat unfair to demand More Action! because this isn't strictly an action movie. It's a wellthoughtout underrated affair that more people should see.It's funny Robert Forster plays pretty much the exact same role here as he does in Scanner Cop II it even looks like it's shot in the same room and Michael Nouri plays almost the same role as he does in Overkill. If they were items on a computer it's easy to imagine the director dragging and dropping them from their respective movies into this one. That's not meant to be an insult Forster does his usual professional job and Nouri seems in his element. It's actually one of the better Nouri performances we can remember. Viggo Mortensen made this movie before he was even really a big name and he achieves the complex task of making you understand his emotions and motivations as he pulls off his double life. He should get more credit for that. As he gets swept up in the Yakuza lifestyle he still tries to make a contrast between his American culture and their Yakuza one by preferring good old American whisky to their Sake.Because American Yakuza combines visual flair with an engaging plot you really can't lose. Interestingly enough this would make a great double feature with American Dragons 1998. They are both high quality movies with some similarities. We give high marks to American Yakuza.For more action insanity please visit www.comeuppancereviews.com".

Interestingly enough this would make a great double feature with American Dragons 1998. They are both high quality movies with some similarities. We give high marks to American Yakuza.For more action insanity please visit www.comeuppancereviews.com";

Yes we're in a Hollywood that had taken note of John Woo's films and was doing everything to emulate them. Unfortunately the action sequences here are just imitation and rather silly as a result.Although the depiction of the Yakuza in this film is rather understated  we learn little of the warrior code that we see in the likes of Takeshi's BROTHER  Ishibashi is outstanding as the gangster with a conscience.I also found the amount of story in the film to be too little. There just isn't enough intrigue to sustain the running time and including Bmovie favourites like Michael Nouri and Robert Forster just isn't enough. Try HARDBOILED instead.".

The way Nick befriends him and starts to respect their customs but also becomes guilty that he's really an undercover agent who is trying to bring there organisation down is definitely interesting especially in a psychological way.

After healing his wounds Shuji thanks Nick and offers him the chance to work for them.

Soon the Yakuza launch a attack on the Mafia wiping out several of Dino's men this attack sparks a war between the Mafia and the Yakuza. Meanwhile Nick is getting more and more involved with the Yakuza and begins to become guilty that he's secretly betraying Shuji. Nick soon finds himself becoming romantically attached to Shuji's goddaughter and gets even further attached to the Yakuza when they make him a honorary member of their family. Eventullay Nick's boss Littman Robert Forster makes a deal with Dino to let them eliminate the Yakuza with any interference by the FBI or police. Nick is told he's off the case but ignores them and decides to put this war into his own hands.American Yakuza is a great blend of action drama and romance all thrown together into one enjoyable combination.

	schema:headline " Awful awful film";
	schema:reviewBody "Plot holes unfunny moments a subtle antigay vibe and downright poor acting are just some of the anchors weighing down this film.Matt LeBlanc is wooden sullen and mechanical as OSS officer Steven O'Rourke  an American who has already tried to steal an Enigma code machine from the Germans in Italy.  LeBlanc plays O'Rourke as an arrogant unsympathetic and violent ugly American who always knows better than his British counterparts who seem toffeenosed elitist rulebound and lacking in common sense.  The film is touted with the tagline see Matt LeBlanc  in a dress!  Yet LeBlanc's character openly ridicules crossdressing in the film and is seen in drag only three short times during the opening insertion into Germany at the Gestapo party and during the factory scene toward the end.  Throughout the film the director and writer go to extreme lengths to prove LeBlanc's heterosexuality  by having him look unfeminine in drag by having him openly seek sex with Resistance contact Romy at one point you almost expect them to do it in her attic apartment her legs are spread he's between them and all that has to happen is for him to drop his pants and by having him do a variety of butch and masculine things that seem stupid for a spy to do like sit on a rooftop and use his radio engage in running gunbattles in downtown Berlin in broad daylight and steal an airplane from a Luftwaffe fighter base.Eddie Izzard is the film's standout lead.  The reallife transvestite and comedian not only knows how to play comedy but he doesn't denigrate drag or homosexuality or bisexuality.  Most of the film focuses on Izzard's character anyway  he turns the ragtag group of nonspies into believable sic women it is his attempt to find German exlovers Franz a man and Paloma his exwife that is the primary reason the plot moves forward and resolves itself.James Cosmo as pencilpushing preretirement British Army sergeant Archie is wellcast.  Although he takes a while to get a handle on his character especially in the opening scenes he is one of the film's real gems. Especially poignant are the scene with his wife the night before he is to infiltrate Germany his part in finding the Enigma factory and his final scenes  where he adopts an orphan German girl and steals the Enigma device and where he sacrifices himself in order let the others escape and the Allies win the war.David Birkin as Johnno the codecracking wunderkind who speaks 27 languages is a little lightweight for this cast but he is able and manages to score several wonderful moments.  The look on his drunken face as he's gambled over in the lounge where Paloma sings is just precious and his grief and confusion when the German officer is stabbed to death before his young eyes is palpable.  One wishes however that his character had been given more depth I came away wondering if perhaps his character wasn't supposed to be sexually confused it would have added to the film if he had been.Nicolette Krebitz as Romy the German Underground librarian is wasted in this film.  She's beautiful she has class and she has real acting skill. Her decisiveness as the group escapes the library provides an unreal scene with believability.  Her acting is reminiscent of the many female spy roles in war movies from the 40s and 50s  a real compliment!  About the only time things fall apart for her is when she's matched with LeBlanc who  as an actor  gives very little for his costars to work with in scenes.Oliver Korittke as Izzard's boyfriend Franz is wonderful as well.  Franz comes off believable and real and matches Izzard emotion for emotion without making the audience think that he's thumbing his nose at homosexuality on the inside.  One only wishes he appeared in more scenes and had more to do.  Watch for Edward Fox in an outstanding role as Col. Aiken  the uberBritish Royal Army officer!  He's great!Otherwise the film is a very mixed bag.  There are numerous obvious plot holes.  For example why does the Army infiltrate spies who can't speak German into Germany?  LeBlanc says he spent four months among German Army troops in Italy trying to steal an Enigma machine  yet he can't speak German?  Why does LeBlanc go into the open to send his radio signals? How does a fatbodied airplane manage to escape Germany and occupied Europe without being shot down or fighters sent after it or being shot down by British AA or fighters?  Why does LeBlanc try to burn down Gen. Lansdorff's office  and him with it?  Won't this raise suspicion about Gina?There are some great visual moments in the film  notably the shot of hundreds of bombers flying at night over a Germany aflame.  There is another scene shortly thereafter when the spies parachute out of the plane and they float down over a darkened countryside  with Berlin on fire and bombs exploding in the city streets in the background.  In another part of the film the guys wander in drag through the streets of Berlin  which are shattered and ruined.  Up til now they have talked about Jerry and kraut  and only now do they realize that war is destroying Germany. And yes we soon see a rich German Army general and his dolledup wife exiting a car proof that it is the German people who are suffering and not the elites.But the editing  while smooth and seamless  doesn't have much style to it.  The opening and closing titles are difficult to watch they are inventive but like Flash coding  they are also very annoying.  The music in the film seems to comprise largely of one semiswing piece of music played at the beginning and end of the film and whenever the audience is supposed to laugh.By the film's end I was terribly disappointed with All the Queen's Men. What is billed as an actiondramacomedy with a positive view of crossdressing instead plays transvestitism for laughs in the way that you'd expect from a film in the 1950s.  Where a more honest leading man would embrace the character of O'Rourke and what he has to do to win the war LeBlanc seems so afraid of being labeled queer that he has forced O'Rourke to embrace him.  The result is a comedy whose laughter comes at the expense of its audience.  It's too bad that the film couldn't have just focused on Izzard Cosmo and Birkin  it would have worked and worked amazingly well.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I finally found this movie I had been looking for it for quite some time. I have been a very big Eddie Izzard fan for a long time and also a FRIENDS fan so it was definitely something I wanted to see. And I think it met my expectations. No it isn't an Oscarworty movie or anything like that but it is throughly enjoyable. It is the best thing aside from Friends that I've ever seen Matt Le Blanc in I know that isn't saying a lot but he does give a decent performance. The stand out as many people have said is obviously Eddie Izzard. The fact that he is a more polished comedian and since he is a transvestite in reality he seems pretty comfortable in the plot. He also has the best timing of them all. The only true complaint I have about this movie is that on the DVD in order to have subtitles for the few German lines you have to have the subtitles on the whole time but that has nothing really to do with the movie as a whole. It isn't a movie that takes a lot of concentration to watch but that isn't always bad. I really hate that so many people have written comments basically praising everyone in it and then calling the movie awful. There are some very touching scenes especially one between Izzard's character and his boyfriend who have been apart for a long time. So I would definitely recommend this movie to a friend. 12 stars out of four.".

Taking it as that style of campy send up of war we found it rather funny of course it was cheesy and full of plot holes but that was part of the appeal. I have to get my mousykins! I mean if this film wasn't laughing at itself it should have been. Yes Eddie turns in a brilliant performance from an emotional stand point as well as does David Birkin but their performances add to the humour not over shadow it. Yes from the stand point of making the world a better place this film did not accomplish a single blow for understanding but not everything has to be a statement for the cause. Some things are allowed to be funny for humour's sake and those of us who get that the stereotypically wooden characters are there to make a point find them all the more funny. Give it a try.".

Despite this the acting cast do a good job with a few recognisable faces making well acted appearances. But the big problem comes with LeBlanc because his appeal is primarily to an American audience and fans of 'Friends' and of course he isn't playing Joey. The lack of subtitles for the German dialogue also didn't help for people like me who don't have an excellent grasp on the language and this film features quite a lot of foreign dialogue. Nethertheless the film does deliver something quite different and funny in times so isn't a total drag. Its worth a watch maybe when you've got a couple of hours to spare just like i did today!".

The fact that two of them couldn't speak German and they all made no attempts to lower their voices when speaking English didn't sit well either. Were we really expected to swallow the notion that the British army were so stupid that they'd send nonGerman speaking soldiers on a mission behind enemy lines or for that matter that they wouldn't use the option of female spies to do the job? But I'm pleased that I overcame these annoyances and didn't let them spoil my growing enjoyment of the film and its rather delightful assortment of characters. Especially as very late on in the action everything becomes clear and falls right into place quite beautifully. But to tell you how that comes about would be to plant a spoiler so I'll not say another word about it.All The Queen's Men actually handles its subject matter extremely well and considering four of them are wearing dresses none of the actors are tempted to camp it up anymore than is strictly necessary and they all perform with a good sense of both the comedy which is for the most part subtle and drama involved. There's a little bit of romance a touch of pathos here and there and very importantly an extremely sensitive yet understated view of how ordinary Germans were dealing with the devastation of the Second World War. Having accepted the somewhat implausible plot I found myself enjoying the well crafted script and couldn't help but grow rather fond of all the central characters.

He gets to show off his legs and his German but it's not enough to lift this film off the bottom.There was one interesting thing if you're a STTNG fan David Birkin who played both the young JeanLuc Picard in Rascals and Rene Picard in Family is in ATLQM as a code breaking multilingual genius.".

I cannot believe that AQM realy got a general cinema release.AQM is set during World War 2 and is the story of how an American officer Le Blanc and a troop of transvestite British soldiers set out to recover an Enigma machine from an all female staffed German factory. That's as much as anyone needs to know about the absurd plot. Everything about this production stinks. Imagine if you can coming across the bloody remains of a particularly bloody road kill the body parts of which are strewn hither and yon. You start to reassemble the beast and what emerges bears no resemblance to anything you've seen before.The story is predicated upon such a preposterous notion that it is difficult to bring to mind any director adept enough to suspend our disbelief long enough for the humour what there is of it to come throughperhaps a Woody Allen of thirty years ago. Le Blanc is hopelessly miscast slapstick is a forte that few contemporary actors possess and were he so gifted he wouldn't have saved this film anyway. Other featured actors are the noted transvestite comedian Eddie Izzard who's acting skills and presence haven't improved since the equally awful 'Avengers' and Edward Fox playing guess what? Thats right a Blimpish army officer.Both actors play their parts absolutely to type. No one was helped by a dire David Schneider screenplay. To British viewers Schneider is more recognisable for his acting stints in Steve Coogans 'Alan Partridge' series and Armando Iannuci's 'Saturday Night Armistice'. Schneider can at least console himself for having not concocting the storyline.AQM never settles upon knowing what sort of animal it wants to be. It has about it shades of Jerry Lewis' 1970 gem 'Which Way to the Front Mein Herr General'. It also has its occasional 'Carry On' moments yet still the bawdy pen of Talbot Rothwell would not have saved this effort. Scenes lurch from the comic set ups to a tearful husband and wife the night before he is to go of into combat. Bathetic in the extreme. Even the grading of the film stock conspires to make this film look cheap. Soif you realy do like to prod road kills with a stick this film is for you. Otherwise leave well alone its a stinker.".

Enjoy it.Despite many details about life in Berlin at the end of WWII the movie has a major drawback the reason for the silly outfit only becomes apparent at the end and if you leave before the end you will not think of it as such a great movie. I find it difficult to change the plot to suit people who would leave their seat midway but after 25 minutes you really should stay. For the WWII film buffs out there are most likely a few oversights but on the whole I enjoyed the movie on its own set of details.I expected a movie like this with LeBlanc to be a comedy with a few minor plot changes and LeBlanc and his supports replaced with female ditto it would have earned a 9. I gave it 8 because it is a comedy which has all the details to pull off a straight drama but fails to deliver 100 on that account.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSThere are many war films released each year. Some perhaps tell the story of the second world war in a deep moving story like 2003's The Pianist whilst some prefer to tell it as a laid back story. In All the Queen's Men we are presented with a historical representation which is not funny not deep and which is arguably considerably offencive to the English.Set during the war this film centres around American Special Services O'Rourke Matt LeBlanc. O'Rourke has ended up in a British Prisoner of War Camp after a screw up with British Intelligence. Recruited to retrieve an Enigma machine from an all womens factory O'Rourke works with Tony Eddie Izzard a British cross dresser who's undeserving of a surname to complete his task.This film is simply awful. Gathering a group of men to star in roles and look absolutely nothing like women was either a masterstroke or a sign of stupidity. By giving Matt LeBlanc the leading role the creators of this film have been both offencive to the English and useless in their casting. LeBlanc performs exactly as we'd expect Joey from Friends to perform and he does it by implying that the English are useless. At the beginning LeBlanc is meant to have retrieved an Enigma Coding machine alone only for a group of English soldiers to destroy it under a bureaucratic rule book. Therefore from the first five minutes we are already introduced to the British stupidity and how it screws up the War.LeBlanc and Eddie Izzard are sent to Germany as women and look positively unfeminine working with two other British soldiers who look even more masculine. As British soldiers turned drag queens James Cosmo most notable for Angus McLeod in 1986's Highlander and David Birkin an unknown except for an appearance as Picard's nephew in Star Trek The Next Generation these two actors appear awkward and uncomfortable wearing dresses and looking stupid.The two key problems with All the Queen's Men are upsettingly not the way it has masculine men dressed as women but the ways it attempts to show the German's as uncultured and simultaneously trying to make Eddie Izzard physically sexy. Firstly Izzard has always been good as a comedian but never sexy as a woman. Secondly the Germans were never uncultured fiends like everyone implied. During the wartime one of the best Philosophers was Heiddeggar who was a strong Nazi sympathiser. Simultaneously Hitler was in favour of art and music admittedly only from particular people but art none the less. Anyway irrelevant of politics this film implies that homophobia and countless other topics are minority topics and unique.Cutting down to minor detail irrelevant of whether this film is offencive or not the plot is awful the scripting is awful and the cinematography is absolutely dreadful. As a director Stefan Ruzowitzky is dire and it's unsurprising that this is only one of five directorial experiences. So with an awful script awful plot awful directing stupid cinematography and pointless music this film has little going for it. It's not funny it's not serious. It appears to not know what it wants to be and it never does anything except make the audience irritable and grouchy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hilary Rodham Clinton probably will skip Barb Wire director David Glenn Hogan's action epic Most Wanted a clever but contrived conspiracy thriller about the assassination of a fictitious First Lady. Wayans plays rogue Marine Gunnery Sergeant James Anthony Dunn whose own superior officer frames him for gunning the first lady down. Actress Jill Hennessey appears as Dr. Victoria Constantini a Zapruder style eye witness who videotapes the real assassins that shot the President's wife. Before long Constantini finds herself on the lam with Dunn. Despite its clearly imitative nature and its wholly disposable plot Most Wanted contains enough okay action scenes to make the grade. Nevertheless this standard issue shoot'em up is definitely not the best work of actorwriter Keenen Ivory Wayans. He was more fun in his 1994 action comedy Low Down Dirty Shame with Jada Pinkett.Not only does Wayans star in Most Wanted but he also penned the screenplay. Wayans cobbles together scenes from every major action flick to create his own film. Shrewdly he forges a plot around a string of surefire movie scenes that he has rewritten carefully. In the opening scene Sgt. Dunn refuses to shoot an innocent shepherd boy during Operation Desert Storm. Sgt. Dunn's Commanding Officer threatens to shoot him on site for disobeying an order. They struggle. During the struggle the officer's gun discharges accidentally and the officer dies from a gunshot wound. Dunn receives the death sentence for murder. During his bus ride to Fort Leavenworth Dunn is rescued by a super secret antiterrorist military unit. An evil redneck Gen. Adam Woodward alias Lt. Col. Grant Casey Jon Voight of Midnight Cowboy gives Dunn the option to either join his group or die. Reluctantly Dunn agrees to join and finds himself the designated hitter in an assassination attempt.The unit has targeted shady biochemical mogul Donald Bickhart Robert Culp of Hickey and Boggs. At the VA Hospital where Bickhart is greeting the First Lady Dunn is set up. Gen. Woodward's henchmen kill the First Lady and frame him. Now the Los Angeles Police Department as well as Woodward's gunmen pursue Dunn. Our wrongly accused hero spends the rest of the movie trying to exonerate himself. The filmmakers pad the action out with a superfluous subplot involving the Central Intelligence Agency. C.I.A. Deputy Director Kenny Rackmill Paul Sorvino of Goodfellas smells a coverup. He is suspicious because Dunn's description as the assassin was confirmed far too quickly. Dunn calls in the agency but the C.I.A. refuses to help him until he can find scoop some poop on Gen. Woodward. Meanwhile Constantini doesn't totally believe Dunn even after he saves her life from a bomb planted in her house.Director David Glenn Hogan and Wayans have crafted a Kennedy style conspiracy thriller. The heroic sergeant that Wayans plays is the classic loner with either no family or no friends. He qualifies as the ideal choice for the assassin as well as the fall guy. The first scene borrows from the Sylvester Stallone shoot'em up The Specialist 1994 with Sharon Stone. The bus escape scene is straight out of Brett Ratner's Money Talks with Chris Tucker. The ebony and ivory combo of an AfricanAmerican hero and a white heroine recalls the chaste Pelican Brief with Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts. Like The Pelican Brief Wayans and Hennessy never get the hots for each other and play hide the salami. Most Wanted has a prefabricated tracethenumbers storyline that leaves little doubt about where the action is leading the characters. There are some really dumb scenes too. After the authorities have identified Dunn he strolls into a public library to use a computer. The Dunn character wanders through half of the action without a disguise. In the most original scene half of L.A. chases Dunn onto a freeway in a Frank Capra like foot chase. Sadly Keenen Ivory Wayans wants to become the black equivalent of Stallone's Rambo character. He makes a suitable straightforward hero but he's far too dull. Mario Van Peebles would have been a better choice for Dunn. Wayans plays a squeaky clean hero. The reverse occurs when the antagonists are involved. Enjoying a villainous career comeback since Mission Impossible Jon Voight conjures up a fullblown portrait of evil. As Gen. Woodward Voight is a ruthless adversary. Paul Sorvino lends his considerable screen presence as the spy chief to the C.I.A. subplot as does Eric Roberts as his aide. Most Wanted squanders both Sorvino and Roberts. Miami Vice supporting actor John Diehl shows up in yet another cameo as a police captain. Luscious actress Jill Hennessy is sexy enough but she never really proves herself either as a heroine or a hot date.Most Wanted emerges as brisk harmless action fodder. Don't dwell on its improbable plot if you want to enjoy it for the mindless fodder that it is. Just sit back and get a kick out of its adrenalin antics. The pizza scene is hilarious and the dialogue on the prison bus is a hoot! Wayans appears to have had the most fun writing in the scene where dozens of blacks with shaven heads crowd the scenes. Another funny moment occurs when a guard mistakes Dunn for another talkshow host and asks for his autograph. Most Wanted plays it safe confining itself to familiar territory doing exactly what you expect for a thriller of its caliber and delivering the usual quota of thrills chills and spills without offense of any kind. Composer Paul Buckmaster endorses the action with a flavorful musical score and Set It Off lenser Marc Reshovky's murky photography captures the element of paranoia that suffuses this saga.".

I remember watching this film a bunch of times when i was younger and I been meaning to watch it again but I forgot the title so i spent years and years searching for this movie until i caught it on cinemax a few months ago. The plot military convict named James Dunn Wayans who is recruited from death row to serve in an elite CIA black squad group. The convict is framed for the murder of the First Lady of the United States a murder he didn't commit. He escapes with his life then seeks to find the real killer and bring them to justice. This film also stars Jon Voight as a corrupt general with a southern accent and it seemed like he was really into his role and Jill Hennessy as the unlikely sidekick she doesn't really do much and her character isn't well developed. the acting was quite good the action sequences were well done and intense. also a few funny scenes. Very interesting watching Keenen Ivory Wayans In a serious role. I recommend this movie it's not perfect but it's worth a watch.".

There are some good moments the ending especially but for the most part this film is very campy to say the least definitely not getting a Oscar any time soon. This movie is trying to push the bad cop good cop message at a higher level but it doesn't seem to stick as movies like Dark Blue and others have before. It's a lot of Keenan Ivory Wayans and his tough as nails brutish military strut while still able to throw in some humor from time to time which trust me is not funny at all you practically laugh at the jokes in sympathy for how cheesy they are! 6 out of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most Wanted is considered an action movie however in a perfect world it would be categorized as a comedy. One fateful rainy day I stumbled upon this movie while channel surfing. I thought it was rather funny seeing Keenen Ivory Wayans funny man and mastermind from In Living Color and other movies as a machine gun toting commando. At first I thought it was a spoof of an action flick. Spoofing has been and still is the specialty of the Wayans brothers. However I was shocked to find that this was a serious attempt at an action film. Needless to say it made me laugh five times harder after learning that this film was unintentionally funny. Since then I have told my best friend to keep an eye out for it in the 5 dollar DVD rack at Wal Mart so we can both share a night of laughs. I really would not know where to begin with this movie. For one thing I do not understand why solid performers like Jill Hennessy and Jon Voight would do such a badly written and unoriginal movie. The dialogue is just hideous the whole time you get the feeling that Wayans is just trying way too hard to sell himself to the audience as a cool and calculating exmarine hitman. Then there is the whole scene where he is being chased by the entire city which takes the film from bad to ridiculous. There is also the scene where Wayans and Hennessy's characters find information about a COVERT OPERATION on a website in a public library. Yeah OK sure...That makes sense. I would have sworn they called it covert for a reason. Like a previous reviewer on this film said I could sit here write on and on about how bad this movie is. But you have to see it for yourself. Don't see it to see if its good or not. Instead see it to laugh at how bad it is. With all due respect to Wayans Hennessy and Voight this movie should have never happened. Fortunately for those involved it didn't seem to put a damper on their careers.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there's one flaw plaguing Peter Berg's The Kingdom it's that it tries to be all things to all people. OK maybe not all things as it definitely doesn't try the romance angle. That's not to say The Kingdom isn't a terrific film because it is. However it should have been decided at the outset to make this movie either a political or action thriller and gone with one or the other.Matthew Michael Carnahan's script starts out hitting all the right action beats as it unfolds with a vicious terrorist attack on a Saudi compound housing employees of an American oil company the movie draws inspiration from the 2003 compound bombing in Riyadh. From there the movie almost threatens to get bogged down as it shifts focus to the political machinations both hindering and enabling a joint SaudiFBI investigation. Fortunately Berg pulls the film out of this quagmire that threatens to put the breaks on the movie almost as surely as the political attempts to nix the joint investigation.With the political jabber out of the way The Kingdom gets down to the meat of the script shifting the Saudi investigation into high gear and refusing to take its foot off the accelerator.The movie deserves full marks for refusing to dumb down its story and make the Saudis appear as little more than window dressing to a big screen American shoot'emup. While Jamie Foxx Jennifer Garner Chris Cooper and Jason Bateman all get top billing the real star of this story is Ashraf Barhom who plays Saudi police Col. AlGhazi a man dedicated to his profession with an acute sense of fair play protocol and justice. AlGhazi who was at the scene of the initial attack on the compound initially plays the role of hamstrung gobetween relegated to babysitting and restricting the movements of the FBI at the urging of higherups. However thanks to a fortuitous facetoface between the American guests and a Saudi Prince AlGhazi is given free reign to lead the US investigators as they try to uncover the mastermind behind the attack.From there the audience is treated to a top notch story that nicely touches on everything from culture clashes forensic revelations kidnapping religious doctrine and the self perpetuation of hate all of which culminates in a final half hour of riveting vicious blood spattering action.I said The Kingdom suffered from one flaw? On second thought make that two. It's also yet another victim of the handheld cameraman suffering from Delirium Tremens complete with blurry and shaky shots that rarely allow the viewer to actually focus on the images being played out. One day Hollywood will learn that this type of cinematography just doesn't cut it. Sadly this is not that day. That said however The Kingdom delivers a smart taught evenly balanced thriller that easily shapes up as a heavyweight in this year's run for the Oscar.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Berg's The Kingdom is a thrilling movie that's out of the question. The problem is that it doesn't really know whether it primarily wants to be an action movie or a political comment.It starts out well enough. The gripping opening montage documents the connection between the U.S.A. and Saudi Arabia and sucks you right into the story. The first act plays out as a very good depiction of terror in the middle east. In the second act the movie loses some of its pace and we get to know the characters a bit more. What's really offputting is that the Americans come across as constantly joking relaxed but at the same time totally competent people. It's the old cowboyimage Hollywood has always tried to convey in its war movies from the 80's that should really have been left behind by now. It's not a fatal flaw but it definitely prevents the movie from becoming more than just an action flick set in the middle east.This becomes more apparent in the final act which starts with a car crash and continues with countless shootouts. The movie goes way over the top from this moment on and turns into something Jerry Bruckheimer might have thought up. Technically the action scenes are developed pretty well I don't share the common criticism of other reviewers that the shaky cam distracted too much. I'm not a fan of it usually but here it was alright. In its best moments the action looks like something out of The Bourne Ultimatum in its worst the movie could be Shooter.What separates The Kingdom from Shooter is its message though. The final lines spoken in the movie redeem Berg of a lot of the mindless action that preceded them. After all the makers apparently did want to make some kind of statement and this last comment really hits home. Other than that you don't find much of a message in The Kingdom. Just because the movie doesn't glorify the U.S.A. at any point doesn't exactly make it critical. It's merely neutral which is more than can be said about most American action movies dealing with terrorism. There is one questionable scene in which a police man from the middle east and the main character an FBI agent played by Jamie Foxx seem to agree that it would be best to simply execute the masterminds behind terroristic acts without asking any further questions. On the other hand this can just be seen as the realistic depiction of what those characters would feel because I don't think that either would be a big defender of a terrorist's rights.In the end The Kingdom is a straightforward action flick with enough critical undertones to not be propaganda. It's a very exciting thriller to watch but except for the final scene there's nothing really thoughtprovoking here.".

However halfway through watching it it occurred to me that it would in fact have been a much more interesting film if none of the stars were in it. Which was little odd because I am very fond indeed of Jennifer Garner's upper lip.The plot is this There is a big terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia. Some FBI agents led by Jamie Foxx fast talk and bamboozle their way into the country to investigate where they team up with two Saudi cops. There then follows a small amount of detective work some interesting political manoeuvring and two really rather welldone shoot outs.Now I like Jamie Foxx Chris Cooper and Jennifer Garner's upper lip who play the FBI agents and although all three do the best they can with the material they are given no effort is made to make their characters interesting. What's worse although they aren't interesting they are nevertheless vastly superior to everyone else. Thus nearly every single advance in the case is made by these three. They are the ones who solve everything.The two Saudi cops on the other hand are interesting characters. Two good cops working in a corrupt brutal system. Trying to solve a horrific crime whilst faced with hostility from their fellow officers and political interference from above. What's more they're human. They have weaknesses and fears. They make mistakes.And that's what occurred to me. I thought to myself that this film would almost certainly be more interesting and entertaining if the whole idea about the FBI agents had been removed and instead we'd just been following the wily but unfailingly polite Colonel Al Ghazi and his loyal sidekick Sergeant Haytham as they tried to solve the crime. Instead once the FBI turn up these two get relegated to standing to one side and looking suitably impressed every time one of the namesabovethetitle stars does something brilliant.Right at the start of the film Jennifer Garner's character ably assisted by her upper lip makes a comment about how if the Saudi's allowed the FBI into the country to investigate the crime it could prove to be enormously destructive.

LOTS OF IT. I know for most action movies plots and storyline are very weak. I'm not trying to say the story was bad far from it. The story line was actually very good with strong dialogue and an amazing quote towards the end that really gets you thinking. No spoilers here just go watch it when it comes out.

I'm glad I didn't decline. This film got me hooked from the get go and kept me hook up until the credits. Not a an epic movie by any means but it sure is very entertaining and packed full of action. LOTS OF IT. I know for most action movies plots and storyline are very weak. I'm not trying to say the story was bad far from it. The story line was actually very good with strong dialogue and an amazing quote towards the end that really gets you thinking. No spoilers here just go watch it when it comes out. You won't be disappointed.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film has a great opening act a terrorist attack on an American housing compound in Saudi Arabia leaves many people mostly US citizens dead. The FBI investigates all incidents where US citizens die but the politics of the Middle East don't make things that simple. The FBI can't just walk into Saudi Arabia but nonetheless strings are pulled and the agents arrive to investigate.The film's second act is also compelling and focuses on more than just the crime at hand. The FBI agents have a Saudi State Police Officer to look after them and they form a certain friendship. They are people who make their life doing the same thing but they have different ways of doing it and thinking about it. That's what makes the film interesting. The portrayal of the Saudi Arabia also isn't ridiculously demonic and evil as I thought this film might turn out. Ashraf Barhom plays a dedicated and strict man but he is also likable and his character development is treated just the Jamie Foxx's character. Their relationship in the story exemplifies the two different ways of dealing with the issue at hand. The film isn't very deep but is definitely better than the typical action movie with a political backdrop and definitely enough to keep the film rolling.The film's third act begins with a massive car crash and pretty much never recovers. Throughout the film you can see the shaky camera that seems to be popular with many thrillers today but the third act really does it. The action is so shaky and edited together so fast from so many shots you actually begin to wonder have they forgot about choreography? Better known as the arranging of onscreen action so we can actually see what is going on for a couple a seconds at a time. And it is not just the action but the plot just races toward a quick kill 'em all revenge conclusion that knocks off all the bad guys has some cheesy moments when a good character dies and leaves you almost in disbelief that the film could wind up here.There is an interesting irony in the very last scene that asks some questions but by that point it feels like they were giving so many quick convenient answers that a question seems out of place.  610Rated R for violence and profanity. Ages 13.".

The movie is about terrorists in the Middle East specifically The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The FBI steps in when US citizens are attacked abroad and Foxx Cooper Garner and Bateman play a team of agents sent to Saudi Arabia to investigate the attack. It seems like there was a lot of research for this movie and it is interesting to see the interactions between the US officials and the Saudi officials. There is constant action in this movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat but also emotion I cried several times. I do have to say though there is a lot of violence so if you can't handle it don't go. I didn't think the violence was overdone but it was present throughout the movie. That said this is one of the best action movies I have seen in a while. Go see it it is awesome on the big screen!".

The final shootout in distinctly unfriendly territory where the American team is helped by Saudi cop Ashraf Barhom is well staged and exciting. Barhom an Israeli actor has the best performance in the film.The film was shot in both Phoenix and the United Arab Emirates and captures the flavor and feel of an Islamic society very well.

I waited to write this comment because I felt that the audience might have influenced my hatred of this movie. That is not the case. Peter Berg has the honor of directing one of the most irresponsible films I have ever seen. It opens on September 28 so there may be some changes made but if left untouched only Toby Keith fans will like it.Peter Berg tries to disguise this straight up revenge flick as something deeper. In order to persuade the audience of this the credits start with a watereddown history of relations between the US and Saudi Arabia. We are then treated to a horrific terrorist attack in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia where hundreds are killed including a special agent. Cut to the U.S. Special Agents get upset that one of their own has been killed and want to go over seas to investigate the attack and bring the terrorists to justice. The U.S. government says no but they go anyway. That is it. They go to Saudi Arabia and kill as many terrorists as possible. In the third act the movie turns into nothing more than a video game of Americans killing terrorists. Dodging bullets avoiding rockets launched at them shooting terrorists in the heads and frantic shots of hallways that were all but directly lifted from a Doom video game.I don't know if Peter Berg has had a chance to sit in an advanced screening in the South but he would be appalled. The audience clapped and cheered with every Saudi killed. It was truly more grotesque than any of the unnecessary images being shown on screen. As a filmmaker he had the opportunity to redeem this message in some way but he took the low road and fueled hatred. The movie ends with this nugget of advice being passed down from both the Americans and Saudis Kill all of them. Nice message.Being a fan of Jamie Foxx Chris Cooper Jennifer Gardner Jeremy Piven although he's awful in the role. It's like he never stops playing Ari Gold. He was like Ari in Arabia Peter Berg and the always reliable Jason Bateman I expected much more.If you want war violence go see Werner Herzog's beautiful Rescue Dawn. If you want to see hatred at its finest then see The Kingdom.".

I totally agree with all the reviewers who were annoyed by this. It took away from any enjoyment I was getting from this movie. Consider yourself very lucky if this film doesn't hurt your eyes and head.However you still have one other major hurdle the story! It starts off fine and even 60 percent through I had no complaints but once the long rescue scene begins the credibility of this story goes right down the dumper. This is bigtime Rambo material in which the good guys hit everything they fire at and the opponents are lucky to put a little nick into our heroes. In addition the good guys have their SUV rolled off on a street going hundred miles an hour flip over many times and all come out running and just fine. Hardly a bruise on any of them and certainly nothing to slow any of them down. Come on!! Trust me it gets worse Jamie Foxx exchanging machine gun fire with foes about 10 feet away and nobody can hit him! You know.....that sort of thing. Thin little Jennifer Garner making like Lara Croft mowing people down left and right. She gets thrown up against a wall at least times and gets kicked in the ribs but comes up none the worse for wear each time. Are you getting the picture? It's too bad because it good have been a pretty decent picture.I liked the premise some Saudi Arabian terrorist committing mass murder with one horrific bombing scene and the FBI sending over an elite team to work with the Saudis to capture this Bin Ladentype villain. But well.....it got Hollywoodized if you get my drift and turned out to be something that would insult the intelligence of most adults. It's strong on action and and specialeffects but weak on brains and credibility.".

The worst being Blair Witch with Paul Greengrass's Bourne  United 93 taking the third and fourth place. The Kingdom had some big spectacular action sequences which should have been good but the camerawork was so appalling it was hard to see what was going on. Even when the cameraman managed get the action actually in the frame the scenes were cut too short. Why have Hollywood producers and directors chosen to torture their audiences. Maybe a hand held camera can heighten the dramatic atmosphere of certain sequences but why wave the camera around while the characters are talking to each other. Making the audience aware of the camera is pretty stupid technique as it destroys any involvement in the story and characters. Of course bad camerawork can also disguise bad direction which can sometimes be fixed in editing however this didn't work for The Kingdom.

	schema:reviewBody "This is not a biting Hollywood satire and I'm sure there were some missed opportunities to poke fun at the biz.  But as long as that's not what you're expecting you should have lots of fun.I'm an avid Billy Crystal fan and though he's not the star of the film I was really looking forward to this moviebeing that he also cowrote the script.  There are some trademark zingers you'd anticipate from the Oscar's favorite MC  Sixty pounds?  That's a Backstreet Boy.The cast is superb.  Hank Azaria like always steals the show.  He is absolutely hilarious as Catherine ZetaJones' new Spanish lover.  There is a great scene near the end where he gets outraged at a rumor of his inadequate size.  Just like his role as the flamboyant butler in The Birdcage he brings out tons of laughs taking on a phony accent.  He really is a man of extraordinary talent.  John Cusack shows us his more...goofy side.  I've always enjoyed him in past movies but he usually plays the straight man. This was something different.  Well I guess you can say he plays the straight man but he stumbles into all sorts of slapstick situations that causes him to overreact in comic fashions.  And he's great at it!  Julia Roberts is...well...Julia Roberts.  I have nothing against Julia but I don't patronize her in the same way others do.  I don't think she's the most beautiful woman and I don't think she's the most brilliant actress.  But I'm sure many were looking forward to this movie because of Julia and if you're one of those people you won't be disappointed.  Catherine ZetaJones is extremely beautiful but she is so great as the whiny bitchy exwife of Cusackspoiled actress that I wanted to stab her every moment she was on screen.  Alan Arkin is funny as the pretentious preposterous spiritual healer.  There is a great deleted scene with him and Cusack over the phone while Arkin rides the streets of Vegas in a pink convertible.  Those renting the DVDdon't skip the deleted scenes!  And last but not least Christopher Walken Da Man! has a brief but memorable appearance as reclusive director Hal Wideman.Don't expect any surprises.  The story's as predictable as can be.  The whole movie is superficial fluff.  But it's enjoyable superficial fluff. If you just want to kick back have some good laughs without having to kill any brain cellscurl up on the couch with your man or woman and watch America's Sweethearts.My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Normally who is married toengaged todating who in the movie world is something that I couldn't possibly care less about and I still don't care but America's Sweethearts manages to make that very subject amusing and entertaining. John Cusack and Catherine ZetaJones play Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison two movie stars who have been tremendously successful working together and who have worked their way into the heart of the American public. The conflict comes from their highly publicized breakup which has resulted in two consecutive box office failures for Gwen and some serious psychological problems for Eddie.Stanley Tucci takes on a small but very effective role as Dave Kingman the short tempered studio executive furious with Christopher Walken's much more entertaining Hal Weidmann the introverted filmmaker who sent Kingman the first print of his film after charging 86 million of the studio's money which consisted of nothing but titles and the hilarious message We could also do these in blue.' Kingman throws a predictable but very funny tantrum. We spend the rest of the film wondering why Weidmann is so cocky toward Kingman and so closemouthed about the film but we are rewarded in the final act. Julia Roberts comes back in an ironic role when compared to her recent and far superior role in Notting Hill in which she was America's Sweetheart who had fallen in love with a regular guy. Here she is the constantly unnoticed sister of Gwen Harrison her big movie star sister. Both women are perfectly cast as the famous movie star and the famous movie star's sister but this is more a testament to their abilities as actors than it is to the ingenuity of the casting director. The acting was just excellent. Hank Azaria plays the part of Hector This is bullchit!' the overthetop Spanish guy with the hilarious lisp that Gwen has been seeing ever since her rough break up with Eddie. Hector is an amusing character but it is obvious from the first scene where we see him in which he insists that he and Gwen will go to the hunket' together.' that he is an expendable character. He's funny but he still badly mangled the Spanish accent as well as the lisp coming off as amusing but impossible to take seriously.The entire romantic subplot of the film was predictable from the very beginning if only because it was given away in its entirety in the theatrical trailer. If you have ever heard of this movie before watching it then you've already seen the emotional scene where Kiki Roberts tells Eddie that that woman that he saw standing by the spa that he had to spend the rest of his life with was her and not her sister Gwen. From that perspective America's Sweethearts is one of those movies where if you've seen the preview you've seen the movie take Pleasantville as another example. Christopher Walken provides an excellent source of comic relief as well as one of the only really interesting characters in the film. He is the nutty filmmaker indeed the best films almost unwaveringly come from the people who are a little off' who edits his films in the Unabomber's cabin which he had moved onto his property and who indeed created a truly memorable film of which we unfortunately are only able to see a small portion. The Blair Bitch Project' as the press later calls it is a kind of film that would be really interesting. The tabloids would have a field day.There are a lot of sight gags and low brow humor in America's Sweethearts and it is reported to bear a striking resemblance to Singin' In The Rain although remains far inferior to that classic musical comedy but it manages to keep the audience entertained if not hanging on every word. True film fanatics are sure to pick it apart for nearly feeding off of classic films and for following such a clearcut formula but there is definitely something to be enjoyed here.".

Julia Roberts' character is Zeta Jones sister in the movie and happens to to get with John Cusack's character because she always had a crush on him and John Cusack has always liked her.Well the movie was good it wasn't great. Yes most people will watch it because of the cast and not like it. Christopher Walken steals the show as always in the beginning and end with short scenes. There are some really funny scenes but thats about it. The plot of the movie is okay nothing excitint.I give it 6 out of 10 stars.

This tangential storyline was written by Billy Crystal also one the stars and Lee Philips. The premise is very promising. America's Movie Sweethearts Eddie Thomas Cusack and Gwen Harrison Catherine ZetaJones are no longer they are getting a divorce.In fact Gwen has a restraining order on Eddie following their dramatic breakup. Gwen is shacked up with a Spaniard dancer Hector an embarrassing loser role played by Hank Azaria. Eddie now resides in a spiritual retreat following his meltdown. However Eddie and Gwen made one last movie with eccentric genius reclusive director Hal Weidmann perfectly played by Christopher Walken. No one has seen the film which looks to be a ripoff of JeanClaude Van Damme's Time Cop. Weidmann professes this unseen movie is his greatest work. Studio Exec. Dave Kingman Stanley Tucci convinces promotions expert Lee Philips Crystal whom he fired to stay on and orchestrate the press junket for the movie. To bring the estranged Eddie and Gwen together Lee enlists the aid of Kiki Harrison Roberts who is not only Gwen's doormat sister but also her personal assistant. We soon learn that big hearted Kiki has always loved Eddie. The movie industry inside jokes and details surrounding press junkets are great in the beginning of the movie. Though this wastes time in what is predictably a romance. Tucci's ruthless and humorless exec. is way too dark a character for this movie. Hector Azaria is a total waste of time here. For the amount of talent involved in this project it is amazing how much useless overhead is in the movie. Don't get me wrong here entirely I did enjoy the movie. What saves the movie are the wonderful talents of John Cusack and his natural chemistry with Julia Roberts. ZetaJones is believable as the selfabsorbed ice bitch Gwen let's hope that she does not make a habit of these kinds of roles. Julia Roberts is not stretching here as the good hearted smart and plain sister of movie star Gwen. Though Roberts unquestionably has the movie star quality she enchants on screen. Cusack is the quirky romantic leading man of the Milennium and plays Eddie with a bewilderment and smarts. You always get a sense of what's swirling in Cusack's Eddie's head. He is aware of his emotional instability while promoting a movie he has never seen with a woman he is no longer with. And the woman of his life is right in front of his face Kiki. Duh! Cusack is totally charming in his journey from cluelessness. Ultimately he and Roberts make Sweethearts worth watching which is saying quite a lot.".

	schema:reviewBody "And I mean ultra light.  This film features four giant stars about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that.There really isn't too much to say about this stinker other than that although it has a couple of really good bits most of it isn't very funny. Nor does it work at all as a romance. How about as a romantic comedy? Not on your life.  Most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated much less amusing.What's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all.  This movie could have been so much more especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted complete with phony quotes from critics.  The film uncovers the unmined territory of the press junket  those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews.  But instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance.The same with Catherine ZetaJones' character  the whinny self centered movie star. ZetaJones does a good job with what she's given but she's given practically nothing.  It's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years.In the end it is hard to understand what made ZetaJones Julia Roberts John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship which sinks like a rerun of The Love Boat. In fact as the old joke goes they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal. It would probably make a better story. So go ahead and tell us filmmakers what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this?".

Catherine Zeta Jones would be over stretching her abilities as an actress in a junior school production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. She's dreadful and should stick to attending movie star bashes with her dad no sorry he's her husband. At least he can bloody act.

Sounds like a formula for a good movie right?  Take real life movie stars that are loved by America and put them in a movie about hollywoodtypes and celebrities and call the movie 'America's Sweethearts.' Great idea sure until you go see the movie and realize that it is one of the most unoriginal uninspired idiotic scripts ever written.  The humor is at best predictable and cliche at worst deliberate and insulting to my intelligence.  Even the funniest character Christopher Walken's strange miser director is a ball of overused cliches about artsy film directors. I could swallow predictability and lame jokes if for one second I cared about one single freakin' character in the movie but that would be too much to ask.  Julia Roberts' character used to be fat but she's already gone through her transformation before the beginning of the movie so there's no pain with which to sympathize.  John Cusack's character is supposed to be connecting to himself and you're supposed to be happy for him but in flashbacks it seems like he was always pretty OK.  There is other stuff that really irritated me in this movie  one example is Catherine ZetaJones' Spaniard boyfriend who is the dumbest melting pot of misplaced stereotypes of Puerto Ricans I've seen on screen in awhile and would've offended me if I thought for the one second that the writer Billy Crystal...wasn't he funny when I was a little kid? actually cared the slightest bit about his movie and his characters but I know pray that couldn't be true.".

	schema:reviewBody "The question before us is this  how does one take an all star cast  a veritable who's who of today's top screen personalities including Julia Roberts Billy Crystal Catherine ZetaJones John Cusack Hank Azaria Stanley Tucci Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin  and produce a film as thoroughly inept and wretched as America's Sweethearts'?  I'm not sure I have the answer to the question but I am certainly willing to take a crack at formulating some possible explanations.Perhaps the fault lies in the thoroughly insipid and inane storyline which might actually have provided the pretext for some pretty sharp satire  if only the filmmakers had known what they were doing.  In this fictional Hollywood Gwen Harrison ZetaJones and Eddie Thomas Cusack have been America's favorite couple both on screen and off for a number of years. Their movies are almost guaranteed to be surefire box office bonanzas  until now that is.  Just recently Gwen has moved in with a Latin actor named Hector bringing to an end not only the famous marriage but also the lucrative career of the oncehappy couple.  Eddie has spent the last year at a Zentype meditation retreat trying to come to terms with all that has happened.  Meanwhile the studio is worried about how to promote the soontobereleased final film to feature the defunct couple the solution being to get publicist Lee Phillips Crystal to gather everyone involved in the making of the movie together for a press junket at an outoftheway hotel in Nevada with the express purpose of convincing the public that there is some chance that the estranged divorcees might be contemplating a reconciliation.As I stated earlier the plot could provide some juicy fodder for satirizing the workings of the movie industry but writers Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan have failed to provide even a modicum of wit for the occasion.  It's awfully hard to identify with or be charmed by characters who are either selfcentered and whiny Gwen or wimpy and whiny Eddie.  We really don't like either of these people and frankly when we see them together we don't believe for a second that the movie going public would be as enamored of them as the people in the movie we are watching keep telling us they are. We also don't swallow the fact that Gwen's sister Kiki Roberts would put up with her spoiled sister's tyrannical manipulations for two seconds let alone her whole lifetime.  When Eddie and Kiki finally wake up to the truth about Gwen and begin to discover the romantic attraction that exists between them we feel like we are already five narrative miles ahead of them  a position one doesn't want to be in when the need for audience identification with the characters is as crucial as it is in a film like this one.Most of the attempts at humor in the film are obvious and crude whether they involve Hector's insultingly contrived Spanish accent a scene of a dog nuzzling Phillips' crotch or a juvenile masturbation gag involving Eddie lurking outside Gwen's hotel room.  Even the filmwithinafilm when it is finally unveiled to us is a total letdown.  Although Walken brings a cleverness and energy to his overwritten role of the film's eccentricgenius director the movie that he finally unspools for the curious press and studio onlookers involves humor of only the most obvious kind.  That leads to a final confrontation scene  in which the characters act out their little real life drama for the benefit of the dumbfounded and aghast audience  that is utterly idiotic inane and unbelievable.   Crystal's performance as the nervousNelly publicist involves little more than nonstop dithering in the form of cynical quips and wisecracks.  It is grating and annoying from start to finish.  Only Julia Roberts manages to register as a likable person now and then  but even she can do only so much in a role as shallow in its conception as this one is.To say that America's Sweethearts' is one of the worst romantic comedies of the past several years would be to belittle it.  Considering the pedigree of so many of the people involved in its making and the expectations that inevitably go along with that pedigree America's Sweethearts' is one of the worst romantic comedies of any number of years.".

He is a national treasure. Joe Roth the director gets good performances out of the cast and keeps things moving.If you have to put up with BS from impossible people on a regular basis you'll laugh twice as hard.

Their movies are the stuff of romantic legend but Eddie is in a mental institution after nearly killing Gwen because she was cheating on him. Now the last movie they made together is being held hostage by the eccentric director Christopher Walken. The head of the movie studio Stanly Tucci is so desperate for a hit that he rehires the man he just fired Billy Crystal to gin up media hype for a movie nobody has seen not even the studio.The movie is absolutely fantastic. The humor is very clever not contrived or forced like in so many other films. The characters are well acted and entirely believable. The supporting cast is dynamite Seth Green Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin all have memorable and entertaining parts. My personal favorite is Christopher Walken his crazy director character is wildly entertaining despite only having a few minutes of screen time. America's Sweetheart's is easily one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen.".

At other times it's more situational downtoearth and amusing but not really laughoutloud funny. America's Sweethearts did indeed have 2 writers Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan but I'm only guessing that that's the reason. Regardless it's a good film worth watching.America's Sweethearts begins with the fastpacedhilarious satirical approach which had me choking in laughter. The opening is reminiscent of the classic Hollywood Shuffle with its merciless mockery of the film industry. But it quickly simmers down to a more laidback easygoing romcom with a storyline. Periodically it hits us with some of the former hilarity but only in spurts.John Cusack delivers a great performance as the borderline psychotic yet lovable jilted lover. Catherine ZetaJones is his counterpart perhaps not as mental but every bit as memorable. Billy Crystal plays his usual wisecracking self no need to describe that any further. Julia Roberts is the voice of reason or the straight man role.What ensues is somewhat predictable but packs enough surprises to keep you awake. Hank Azaria's portrayal of a Spanish gigolo is hilarious if not slightly offensive to Spanish gigolos? and that definitely keeps the momentum going. And then Christopher Walken makes a brief appearance or two bringing down the house.This is a fun movie for everyone but in particular entertainment industry folks and film geeks will get a real kick out of certain parts. Like Hollywood Shuffle or the more recent lashing of Hollywood For Your Consideration there are some funny inside jokes for movie buffs. But don't worry if you watch it as a straightforward romcom it still delivers.".

The situation of their breakup gets worse when the director of their new film has decided to withhold it until they are brought back together. Enter Lee Phillips Billy Crystal the movie publicist faced with the task of getting them back together while trying to keep the press  that want to see the new movie  at bay. However all is not to simple as that as Eddie is having his head turned by Gwen's sister 'kiki'...America's Sweethearts is a nice film but it's one that suffers from too much attempted satire and not a lot of jokes that work. Billy Crystal cowrote the script and strangely he seems to have given himself the short end of the stick jokes wise. The cast of America's Sweethearts is good on the whole. John Cusack adds to every movie that he's in his charisma and style are great and it's always nice to see him on screen. Catherine ZetaJones is an overrated actress but luckily this role doesn't require her to do much more than look nice which she does nicely. Billy Crystal whom I've already mentioned and Julia Roberts make up the rest of the leads and support is given to them by Seth Green Hank Azaria the excellent and underrated Alan Arkin and Christopher Walken in a hammy and memorable cameo as the director at the film's centre. The satire side of the movie is good but it flirts with missing the mark throughout the film. The overblown finale is nice and the way that the film shows the media handling things not to mention the 'films' that it shows Eddie and Gwen in at the start are highlights.If you want to enjoy yourself for ninety minutes with an enjoyable piece of fluff you could do a lot worse than this. Of course you could do a lot better but this isn't a complete waste of time.".

I took the bare minimum requirement expected of me and passed with something less than flying colours. The point is math is all that separates our heroes from certain death in this arena.Cube is an innovative little thriller that can safely dodge accusations of blandness or mediocrity. The premise is simple and the plight of the characters is highly relative despite its surrealistic science fiction setting. Six individuals find themselves trapped in a cube comprised of many rooms linked together with no readily visible way out no rations tools or explanation for being there with traps set up in some of the rooms. An apparent experiment on how people think and react to certain situations and the transformations they might undergo.The simplicity of the film and the cube itself are the film's strongest assets and can probably account for it's international success notably in Japan. It's low budget production costs came under 400000. But they got a really good bang for their buck with some help from special effects houses that provided their services free of charge. As the director has commented on the audio commentary track of the DVD one aspect they were going for was a way to have an action flick in one room. They pulled it off quite nicely. Another interesting tidbit brought to light was that each character's name is after a prison.A curious aspect of this Canadian film was its surprisingly short run in Canadian cinemas. In speaking with one of the film's producers Mehra Meh I learned that despite it's award as Best First Feature at the Toronto Film Festival of 1997 the film run in Canada came a year later and was just for a few short weeks before it was yanked from theaters and then showcased internationally. When time came for the DVD release I found another perplexing development. It was only available as an import. A Canadian film only available as an import in Canada? It wasn't until months later that it was released domestically.In any case the film is available now and worth checking out if you have interest in the psychological thriller fare. Those who work their days or nights or both in a cubicle may wish to pass on this one as it just might be too close to home.".

After this film the Cube Natali's follow up was the superb Cypher. He seems to be a master of a difficult genre SciFi. In a genre that is primarily known for having a high pap ratio the fact that Natali's first two features have been cult classic science fiction movies then bodes well for Scifi fanatics who will eagerly anticipate his next movie. The Cube is a superbly crafted low budget film. On a shoestring budget and a dangerously basic premise full of intrigue the film succeeds because of imaginative effects and taut directions as well as a superbly written script delving into the human psyche in such an extreme situation. The plot is basically thus A group of strangers wake in a cube room. They don't know where they are or how they got there but they know they must find a way out. It also transpires that when they leave each room the enter another room that is virtually identical in look. There will perhaps be a different colour in the lighting. The must find their way out before they starve tp death or go nuts but to add to their woes it seems that some of the rooms are booby trapped ranging from sound activated to pressure activated traps. They soon discover that each of them has a specific gift that can perhaps hold the key to their escape. There is a maths genius who may hold the key to discovering a way out. The rooms are numbered and the numbers could signify the type of room but also a map. The film is excellent and just when they think they have figured it out the Cube bites them in the behind. The dynamic of the characters is excellent as inevitably some go crazy. I do think that for a film shot for less than 300000 dollars this is amazing looking. It works well for a film that is set in the same environment for the 90 minutes of the film. I have to say this film is one of those pleasant surprises that comes from nowhere and when word of mouth finally gets to you please listen! ".

You only know as much as the charactersyou don't know how they got into the cubes what they're for or any of the typical exposition. And although most of the characters were annoying it put you side by side with them which helped a lot. If you get to be next to the characters you can understand their actions more. However you do somewhat find out what these cubes were made for which kind of dampers the whole thing but it's still very interesting to go through.But when the climax comes about the movie descends into hokey Bhorror land with a terrorized killer stalking most of the people.

	schema:reviewBody "Cube is certainly a unique movie. The brilliant absolutely irresistible premise grabs you instantly and the production design keeps you impressed. The first hour of this picture was thoroughly engrossing and full of surprises I would even call it astonishing if the actors didn't deliver some obviously forced unnaturally profound speeches and if the director didn't try to create dramatic moments by taking the easy way out  having the characters argue with each other all the time if they acted as a team and tried to overlook their differences THAT would have been the REALLY original approach. Still the movie was fastpaced and fully engrossing.And then about 20 minutes before the end it begins to collapse! The mathematical calculations become IMPOSSIBLE to decipher and follow.

The first hour of this picture was thoroughly engrossing and full of surprises I would even call it astonishing if the actors didn't deliver some obviously forced unnaturally profound speeches and if the director didn't try to create dramatic moments by taking the easy way out  having the characters argue with each other all the time if they acted as a team and tried to overlook their differences THAT would have been the REALLY original approach. Still the movie was fastpaced and fully engrossing.And then about 20 minutes before the end it begins to collapse! The mathematical calculations become IMPOSSIBLE to decipher and follow.

I'm no filmbuff and I'm not experienced yet either only 15 so far but I definately recommend anyone to give it at least a chance! The fact that it's so lowbudget but doesn't really reek of it and the simplicity of the setting is quite refreshing from the typical films of today. At first I was rooting for the cop since he had 3 kids but... well let's just say I didn't exactly want him to survive near the end that bastard! And also the actual scariest movie I've seen all year! I mean actual coveringmyface muttering 'No! God! No!' especially during the silence scene... despite what some other people have said I thought this movie wasn't predictable at all I was totally wrong about who was going to die and what happened in the end. The ending was also perfect and they should leave it like that... I came out of the cinema speechless only thinking 'Wow! What a cool movie!' and satisfaction that you have got your money's worth. The only thing that bugged me during the whole film was trying to remember what other things the girl that played Leaven had been in Deepwater Black and other scifi things  anyone else detect typecasting here? .

Because it relies on the story and the quality of acting to make it great not C.G.I. and overpaid mainstream actors. Not only is it a well presented thriller it's also a study of the breakdown of human emotions and sanity when kept in solitude outside of one's comfort zone. The cube tests the characters' ability to function and work together in alien territory while in constant imminent danger. This is just a brilliant film made by a brilliant writerdirector.

I thought this part was very cool. Unfortunately that was easily the sweetest thing in the movie. The only other death caused by the rooms was a spurt of acid that miraculously landed right on the guys face. Sadly the sweetness of the room effects was overshadowed by the atrocious acting and even more pathetic dialogue. Perhaps the saddest part of the movie was its attempt to incorporate mathematics. This could've been one of the best parts of the film if they'd decided to have even a single mathematician proofread the script. Using the words 'prime' 'factor' and 'cartesian' doesn't make it mathematically profound or philosophical or correct. Nor does mentioning Descartes' name. As the girl proved wearing glasses does not make you a math genius. They were all terrible actors but the doctor was so comically bad I couldn't help rooting for the psychopathic cop who dropped her off the edge. Was he supposed to be hero? But if they'd only stayed in the room they wouldn't have been driven mad and perhaps the cop never would've lost his mind and killed all the people...are you serious? And the annoying autistic man is the only one to make it out? What? No matter what way you try to justify the characters motives they're all idiotic. If you have even a semblance of logic this movie will not make any sense. What would be sweet is if this movie were remade in 510 years with a decent script some people who can act and at least one profound mathematical concept. I swear real ones do exist. Only someone 13 or younger could buy into this movie but it's slightly too gory for anyone that young. So who is this movie for? In the words of Gene Wilder you know...morons.".

It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan.He also saysThis is an accident a forgotten perpetual public works project. You think anybody wants to ask questions? All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck.I think one of the most important lines in the film is from Rennes the escape artist who says No more talking. No more guessing. Don't even think about nothing that's not right in front of you. That's the real challenge. You've gotta save yourselves from yourselves.He couldn't have been more right.The end of the film and who makes it out was a lesson on social breakdown. The Cube should never have been built but when it was the people who created it realized what they had done and simply decided to make use of it rather than let it sit unused. They put people in it.So in a way it doesn't have a greater purpose...but yet it does....in the lessons learned by watching the characters inside of it. The Cube is just a gigantic empty device until you add that human element to it. That's where the real fun begins and that's what makes it interesting.Quentin the evil cop was pretty accurate when he saidThis place is... remember Scaramanga? The bad guy in The Man With The Golden Gun? It's some rich psycho's entertainment.And in a way he was right. The Cube really doesn't serve any purpose but to provide its creators with a sick form of entertainment.Cube above all is a fantastic multicharacter study combined with scifi elements. One of the reasons I like it is because at it's core it is very simple...but yet it is also very complex at the same time. Kind of like a Rubik's cube. Sitting on someone's desk collecting dust a Rubik's cube will simply sit there...it has no purpose. But when a human picks it up and starts turning and twisting it....well you get the idea.

It's about how people react to stress. And it's about the design of the prison.The basic premise reads like a TwilightZone episode. 6 people wake up in a series of interconnected rooms. Some of these rooms kill their occupants in various ways.Each person was placed there with a specific function in mind. One person is a cop who has leadership qualities. One is a doctor able to treat the wounded. One is a highschool student who's math knowledge is still fresh in her mind. One is one of the people who built a component of the place who brings unique knowledge of the prison. One is apparently autistic able to perform complex math computations easily. One is an escape artist lonertype who gets himself killed early on to remind the audience that anyone can die.The prison acts as a personalityconflict engine as it forces people to interact to save each other's lives and their own.It's a great premise the interlocking prison that they have to figure out the secrets to. And as with any human endeavor dealing with each other becomes increasingly hard as dehydration and stress wear down their patience.The problem comes when one of them quite suddenly snaps and starts killing them. For no apparent reason.I understand that tensions were running high. But when the most likable and reasonable character in the entire movie starts going nuts and killing people for no apparent reason it kinda sullies the character interactions.Granted this was a problem with the dialog as a whole. People thrust into the situation seemed entirely too unwilling to tell each other things. I can understand panic. But after an hour in the death maze when someone asks what skills you could contribute I would expect people to give a full resumeCV including personal histories not I'm a doctor like 10 million others. There was a lot of confrontation in the movie even at the beginning when dehydration and exhaustion hadn't set in yet. They just seemed to want to argue rather than attempt to reason a way out.Despite the ending and a degree of contravity with the dialog the movie works reasonably well.".

David Kross is spoton as precocious softspoken worldweary 15 year old Michael struggling to survive in the new world he's been thrust into after his mother's wealthy boyfriend shoves them out on the street. He seems unfazed through his constant violent runins with a local gang as well as increasingly dodgy messenger assignments he gets through a friendship with the local drug lord holding his stoic gaze until the escalating events eventually break him and yet show his true strength and character. The movie is extremely gripping gritty and real the camera is intimate with its characters letting the audience marinate in the heaviness of a situation. The Soundtrack is notably powerful weighty and fitting as is often with quality German films Head On Run Lola Run Princess and the Warrior. Definitely recommended.".

There's a frenetic techno charged turbo driven soundtrack rapid editing and wonky camera angles but this is used skilfully. There's two scenes of incredible tension where the filmmaker slows down the camera becomes still which brings emphasis to bear on the events.

The script isn't really too exceptional but the stale naturalistic look of the movie still makes it worthwhile. I really liked how the frames just screamed desperation on behalf of every single character. One thing that struck me as odd though is that the movie's running time is so short the character of Michael Polischka just didn't seem like he was done yet.

Lead actor is played by David Kross before his international breakthrough in the Oscarwinning The Reader. In this German movie here he plays a teenager who is forced to move from the richer district of Berlin to the poorer when his mother breaks up with her sugar daddy. At his new school he quickly gets into trouble with the local mob and his classmates force him to pay money on a regular basis. He also makes friends but still it is a slow descent into crime as he is forced to steal the money. Not much later he gets into contact with real criminals and he starts delivering drugs for them. As a reward he does not only get paid properly but they also help him against his bullies. But the longer the film goes the more it becomes obvious that they are not his true friends.All in all this was a pretty decent movie and the final scene with Michael Erol and the others was truly gripping. Everything before that is fine too and this is certainly one of my favorite Detlev Buck films. Even Jenny Elvers is bearable in here and only has 1 or 2 notsogood moments. Kross I am not the greatest fan usually but he is okay too and physically works fine as well for the role with his innocent face. My favorites here are the supporting actors though who all play their parts realistically. If you get in touch with the wrong people in BerlinNeuklln stuff like that can actually happen. Kida Khodr Ramadan gives a good performance as always but everybody else is convincing too. Very gritty dive into the world of Berlin's organized crime that may be closer to us than we think and hope it isn't. Go check it out. The film also managed a great deal of awards attention and was picked as secondbest of the year at the German Film Awards only beaten by Das Leben der Anderen which went on to win Germany an Academy Award.".

	schema:reviewBody "Knallhart is in many points a typical German movie to me. The premise of a troubled teenager moving to a new flat in a low class Berlin environment and dealing with violence drugs and apathy is nothing new. The movie tries to portrait the depressing surrounding in long pictures of the main actor walking through the city in washed out colors. The surrounding and the characters to me seem typically German and unbelievable ... overacted or overscripted the mobile phone beating videos were implemented heavy to meet with modern day German news headlines as a very cheap catch. Acting wise the movie was pulled down by the incredibly untalented Jenny Elvers in the role of the lead actors mother. Several other characters are badly acted like the German dealer in the cellar or the Austrian cocaine dealer this scene is a perfect example for overdoing things by cutting to the baby every 10 seconds.... yeah its depressing but how come nonGerman movies like Ex Drummer or London to Brighton manage to be gripping and getting the message across with far less effort??. Oh and talking about London to Brighton.... like KNallhart its a 2006 movie but I really wonder about the strong similarities. The setting the telling of the story by beginning at the end and then resolving it the open ending the environment and long city shots the idea of the the main actor being forced to murder a person he hates although its not in his nature... can all this be coincidence??However the movies are classes apart.... the use of music was really bad in Knallhart and made it hard to feel for the main actor or the plot because it hardly ever transported the visual emotion. It rather sounded like the were selling a modern soundtrack or something. I think a 7.5 average rating is definitely too much for a movie with this many flaws. Even the editing was pretty weak at times... so do yourself a favor and watch London to Brighton or Ex Drummer if you want a movie gritty and getting you emotionally involved with great cinematography in a depressing underclassenvironment rather than this pretentious German effort.".

These are just some of a few lessons to be taken from the sequel nobody expected that snowballed into the franchise nobody wanted Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice. Picking up after the events of the first film a tabloidjournalist and his teenage son are passing through a small neighboring town of Gatlin Nebraska shortly after those cornhusking little munchkins laid it to waste. Looking for his big break the fatherjournalist decides to stay in town for a while. After merely a few days in town he receives his fairshare of whiteman's guilt from the resident Native America uncovers a moldy corn conspiracy a plot point which goes virtually nowhere and plows the field of a innkeeper. Meanwhile his son attempts to sow some seeds of his own with the girlnextdoor who appears to the only one under the age of 18 in town who isn't under the trance of the mysterious maze.It must be said that by no means is Children of the Corn II a particularly great film. Like the first it's pretty basic and predictable. It seems as if the script for the first film was tweaked just slightly to concoct a sequel and it shows with plotholes the size of Nebraska see what I did there?. Director David Price  whose resume is as equally unimpressive as the film's script  loves to inject a lot of ridiculous gore into the film but forsakes logic in doing so. You'll see corn husks slashing throats a nosebleed that somehow turns into an earache and a house falling on a woman who doesn't seem to understand she can either try crawling out or hide in between the beams. Nevermind that though. You don't come here for logic and Price knows that. With his madeforTV movie cinematography you can be rest assured you'll know exactly what you're getting into within the first five minutes of the film.But what about the cast? Kudos must go out to Ryan Bollman who does his best to look as menacing as possible as the leader of the kiddy cult. Someone ground that kid! On the other side of the coin you have Terence Knox resembling what would happen if Bill Pullman and Alec Baldwin gave birth to a bloated baby. Knox seems to be apathetic about the whole thing as best evidenced by his reaction to the death of a friend by the end of the film. He steps it up a notch when he is caught sinning rather vigorously by his son but this scene is so uninteresting you'll feel the same sort of apathy toward it as the actor does the film. I guess you just can't expect Academy Award material with these films but would it hurt to have actors who care about more than cashing in their paychecks carrying a film? When all is said and done in spite of its glaring flaws Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice is easily the best sequel in the Children of the Corn series but that's not saying much. When you consider the films that followed in its wake it's almost a backhanded compliment. Then again the first Children of the Corn wasn't groundbreaking cinema by any stretch of the imagination so the fact that any sequel to it can deliver the most basic entertainment is a miracle in and of itself. To that end The Final Sacrifice is a rather schlocky but suitable guiltypleasure followup. If you've suffered through enough Amityvilles or Howlings then there is no reason you can't sit through this one as well.".

Although having said that the movie did have its good points the children were good actorsactresses the violence was realistic and in moments semi chilling. Unfortunately this sequel shares none of these traits.spoilersThe first death scene is quite surprising I mean the guys are killed by corn well that is dodgy. In the Stephen King short story the corn was there to serve as the vector for the children's pagan blood lust. They were killing to make it grow though it is fantasyhorror it makes more sense than killer corn leaves that can smash through glass by simply being blown in a gust of wind believe me. Not only that but this scene reminds me so much of The Omen it's unbelievable and what's with the Friday the 13th sound effects and Predator visuals? Hell this monster in the corn even has Return of the Jedi force powers!And what's with the old woman's demise crushed to death by her own house? Now that is quite original and when I was first told of this by my Cousin I pictured it vividly. Someone slowly being crushed under their own house nobody finds the body nobody even knows she's dead until finally the smell of muddy hair rotted flesh and mushed bones greet the next visitor on that hot summers morning.Maybe I was putting too much thought into this segment because yet again this is a scene ruined by cheesy references to other films. The lady goes under her house after her precious cat. When she is directly in the centre the children surround it take the cat out and release the device raising it from the ground. The house slowly starts to come down on her and she wiggles backwards trying to escape. The children just stand there trying to look creepy she almost gets out why aren't they kicking her to force her to crawl back under? In the original at least the kids were violent in this they just try to be mysterious. Well luckily for them she is too old to escape certain death and the house reaches the ground level crushing her lifeless and leaving her legs poking out from underneath. But even that isn't enough for the cheesily poor script writers who wrote in that her last words should be oh what a world!? seriously they need to be slapped. All realism is thrown out the window at this point that is if you hadn't done so already what with the Journalist mentioning in a almost tribute manner Jones Town just to be controversial or maybe its just that all American news reporters are inconsiderate slimeballs and the killer predator in the corn bull.And how many times is the word corn used in this film anyway? Every time uttered its like a needle being drilled into my brain. Just stop already we get it.The Dr who was being nice to the children earlier on in the film gets the worst death ever and I mean worst luckily he gets a lolly straight after. I wish I could tell you more but unfortunately I fell asleep well it was 5am so it could have been that but let's put it this way I'm an insomniac.This film does have its good scenes mainly when Danny is arguing with his dad the teenage wit and angry demanding parent though stereotypical is realistic and at least gives the movie some sense of reality before it generates into the monomania of your average American teen horrorfest.If you're a fan of the original maybe you should ignore my small analyses it's possible you might like this. I mean the Freddy films became a bit silly humorous comic book and people still enjoyed them I know I'm one of them But the fact of the matter is if your looking for a serious creepy dark horror film then your best bet is to stay away from this horrid sequel.".

Once this pair arrive both instantly fall in love with beautiful women and discover that a young lad by the name of Micha leads a group of local children to stare intently at adults before dropping houses on them. If you watch this movie you will realise it has some of the most intense staring ever committed to film. Besides the beautiful women and staring brats there's also a wise old native American some 'Predatorvision' from the monster or 'he who hides behind the rows' and a sheriff who tries to kill people like he was a Bond villain.How this film was supposed to be taken seriously I'll never know.

	schema:reviewBody "The original Children of the Corn predating this first sequel by almost ten years had a pretty serious and demanding tone for being such a stupid horror film. The creators of this second chapter luckily didn't make the same mistake. The 1984 original tried to be an ambitious occult thriller while this film merely is a lightheaded slasher with a typically 90's touch and goofy gore effects. The opening sequences are rather atmospheric with the authorities and the press discovering the tragedy that took place in Gatlin. The surviving children are placed in foster families in the neighboring town Hemmingford where they reprise their murderous habits in the local cornfields. Newsreporter John Garrett arrives in town along with his estranged son Danny who finds both love and satanical commitment in the little farmer town. The script attempts to bring forward some possible explanations for the children's vile behavior economical conspiracies spiritual Indian theories... but it's very poorly executed. So you better don't pay too much attention to the brilliant plotting as there are silly but gruesome deathsequences to enjoy! An elderly lady get crushed by her own house ! while another is killed when her wheelchair goes out of control! The best kill definitely is the guy who bleeds to death inside the town church! Good stuff! The music is also good and there even is some female eyecandy to admire! Christie Clark and Rosalind Allen are both fine looking ladies and their characters even are the most intelligent ones of the whole bunch. There are about seven films in the entire Children of the Cornseries if I'm not mistaken although I only saw the first four. As far as I'm concerned this second entry is the most endurable of all.".

One thing it does do right is play around with the supernatural better than expected and did have some good moments to it featuring this. The very first attack in the cornfield is really fun as the howling wind and strange lightning blasts befalling the reporters while they're in the corn rows before the huge tree falls into the area while other really good action moments are packed in amongst the other supernatural occurrences here as housefalling sequence and the scene in the church provide some fun since they involve a great amount of suspense. There's even a few other really good scenes that come from the different meetings held among the cornstalks and a really tense moment later on where a couple make a particularly gruesome discovery among the corn that provides a good shock that comes out of nowhere. Even better than that is where the remaining adults are trapped inside a burning building which is one of the better scenes in the film with the fire and the panic providing plenty to like.The last big plus is the finale which is just all sorts of good cheesy actionpacked fun some wonderful ideas and an overall really great way to end the film. Allinall this is just cheesy good fun. This one wasn't that bad but there were a few problems. The most obvious one is the flaw concerning the back story. It's implied to be a continuation of the first one where the survivors are bused into foster homes of a neighboring town yet that raises a few problems. Firstly it's never stated whether or not this was true despite giving plenty of evidence that this was the case. The events of what happened there were wellknown yet the children here are allowed to go away without being questioned as well as having a method of still getting in touch with each other quite easily which simply makes their rampage later on seem all the more outofplace when it echoes what happened before in the the other town. Those doesn't make any sense at all and are quite annoying. There's also the fact that the pacing is a little off as the romance angles cut into the middle of the film when the mysterious stuff starts happening and way too much times goes by before anyone thinks anything is going wrong. The biggest one though is that it's way too cheesy. The film's concept and several of it's big action scenes do reek of cheese and the film as a whole does reflect this. These really keep the film down somewhat.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Brief Nudity and mild sex scenes.".

The acting may've not been Oscarworthy but the characters were way more believable. Ryan Bollman did a great job of preaching warped beliefs to the kids while John Franklin made you want to laugh. The deaths were too comedic at times but the special effects were equivalent to any bigbudget film. Of course we knew from the start that John and his son would escape. Still the film maintained some suspense and tension. Plus we get an explanation as to why the demon harbors hatred towards adults. If you ever want to watch a Children of the Corn film choose this one.".

In this sequel to 1984's Children of the corn the authorities find the bodies in Gatlin and the murderous kids responsible. The kids are all adopted by foster parents in the neighbor town next to Gatlin. But soon a boy named Micah is taken over by the evil corn deity named he who walks behind the rows. Micah gets the kids to go back to their murderous habits and soon the adults begin to die...again. I don't understand why the 1984 movie needed a sequel or sequelS I should say since there are seven of these movies. You know the original movie made 14 million dollars at the box office so if it didn't do good why make a sequel this movie made 6 million a box office disaster. The only 2 good scenes were when the character Micah is possessed he gets zapped and then he's falling through a strange shaft gets his body dismantled he who walks behind the rows enters his blood and he gets pieced to together and falls out into the cornfield. And 2nd is the nosebleed scene. Take my word for it don't see this movie.".

The plot is nothing original and there are no real surprises. The characters on the other hand are semiinteresting. The acting is far from Oscarcaliber yet at the same time it's pretty decent. I always feel that if you're not intending to make a firstclass horror movie you may as well go for camp. This sequel did not go that campy route but it still works. The scene where the old lady in an electronic wheelchair came flying through the window of a bingo hall is probably intended to be scary or creepy but it made me laugh my head off. Since I was so disappointed with the first movie which was the equivalent of watching paint dry I was even more impressed with this sequel. Plus that Christie Clark is a real cutie.".

The uprise lacked in both quality and total of murder scenes there was only one good scene. It's very disappointing since this is meant to be a slasher film mixed in with supernatural.  The supernatural is finally put into action for one of the murdersOverall this movie is worth a watch but if you're not looking to be disappointed on the basis of quality and total of murders esp. surrounding the town being overtaken then do yourself a solid and find another movie.";

And why old Lucifer has chosen to possess a billion ears of corn in Nebraska instead of the John Deere tractor sitting alongside of it is beyond me. Whatever the reason the fact that he's somewhere within that cornfield gave me the chills throughout this film. More chills than watching these children go on a killing rampage throughout the small town. Anyone over the age of 17 was quickly laid to rest at the beginning of the film and any kid about to turn 18 happily sacrificed themselves to He Who Walks Behind The Rows.The film stars Peter Horton and Linda Terminator 1 and 2's Hamilton. By accident they enter this small town and become the towns only two grownups. Once spotted they are quickly labeled Outlanders and are pursued throughout the remainder of the film until they are finally caught bound and prepared for sacrifice.I love this film. Its had a special place in my heart for years. There is not a boring moment in this film that would put you to sleep. There are many jolts winces and frights. And even though the He Who Walks Behind The Rows fella never shows his face you will definitely feel it's presence. Trust me. Just knowing that he's somewhere in the midst of that cornfield will be enough to creep you out.I give this gem a 910".

Isaac and Malachai are still creepy looking cats both played effectively by John Franklin and Courtney Gains. The musical score with the children chanting is an eerie effect too. The caf scene and the accidental hit and run are the standouts of the movie it's pretty grisly stuff. The rest is a bit mediocre. Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton are pretty good as the young couple trying to escape the murderous children. And an appearance by R.G. Armstrong is never a bad thing. The movie is a loose adaption of a Stephen King short story but the sequels are just absolutely King rapes. So do not bother with those.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the tale of a young couple Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton stranded in the deserted little town of Gatlin Nebraska and stalked by a pack of adult killing children worshipping a demon living in the surrounding cornfields. This very atmospheric piece is a rather humble bmovie that boasts an unusual and interesting premise thanks to a pretty good short story by Stephen King and delivers some decent performances from its cast which is rare with children in general. Although soft in its depiction of violence the movie offers some creepy moments especially in the still effective opening sequence. John Franklin excellent as the childpreacher Isaac makes for one odd and creepy looking kid and Courtney Gains inhabits his psychopathic Malachai character with obvious delight. The cornfields are beautifully shot and the overall is boosted by a pretty efficient score by Jonathan Ellias. And to top this all up R.G. Armstrong makes here an appearance albeit a too short one as a recluse gas station owner. Don't be fooled though. The movie is far to be a masterpiece. At leading endlessly its main characters around cornfields and then through the deserted town direct effect of superficially expanding a short story to feature film length the movie ends up suffering from its slow pace Things just aren't happening fast enough even says Horton at some point with the characters taking what seems like an improbable amount of time to realise what is afoot. The danger of young and impressionable minds blindly following extremist religious leaders is certainly an interesting theme but is here barely tapped into. Finally the climatic sequence with the manifestation of the collieflower looking He Who Walks Behind The Rows is a bit of a let down to say the least. Those not so minor details however are not enough to warrant the bad press the movie gathered upon release and Stephen King's severe criticisms. Children of the Corn is a well performed little soft core horror bmovie that surprisingly enough spawned a franchise and still provides eerie ambiance and creepiness that even at times make the few cheap scares work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stephen King is often cited to be the father of modern horror and this view isn't wholly unfounded. King's stories have had a large impact upon the horror genre and many of them are very good stories in their own right also. However when it comes to translating King's words onto the screen many filmmakers have proved that they are not up to the task. I haven't read the book 'Children of the Corn' but I'm sure it's better than this movie. While the film isn't especially bad it's hardly a tour deforce of horror cinema either and like many Stephen King films this one could have been a hell of a lot better. Actually this story isn't one of King's better efforts it follows a small town whose children murder their parents on the instructions of a mysterious preacher a little kid calling himself Isaac. The story picks up three years after this terrible event when a young couple drive into town for some reason. They find the village completely devoid of adults and it isn't long until they discover what's happened and seek to put an end to it! This film has missed several opportunities the most glaring of which is the subterranean manifestation that dwells beneath the soil in the cornfields. We get several glimpses of this creature but we never get to see it properly and because of this the monster is about as threatening as a bunch of little kids. Oh wait. Anyway the film draws parallels with other evil kids films such as Village of the Damned in the way it plays out but it never really gets out of first gear. While the atmosphere of the town is foreboding and well done on the whole the plotting isn't very exciting and there's very few moments of real tension or suspense which ensures the film isn't as engaging as it could have been. The cornfields and the corn that inhabits said field's makes for an unlikely horror prop and some scenes within the fields are genuinely creepy. The kids themselves are rather well done also with both of the main ones having good screen presence. If you were to pigeonhole King's films into 'good' and 'bad' this one would firmly be in the latter side. On it's own however it's not all that bad and if you're a fan of King's work you'll no doubt find something to like here. Or you might hate it for not living up to the book one of the two.".

Even the way the other children in the movie gasp when they hear his name makes me shudder. I would not want to face him either!!  Another aspect that makes this film so scary is the music.  The director adds clips at just the right moments but doesn't forget to leave ample silence.  There is nothing greater to add to the suspense than a good dose of silent screen.  Then all your senses get a jolt at once when the big horror scene comes alive.The most suspenseful scene is when the boy stumbles out onto the highway clutching his sliced throat.  It's a real hair raiser!!  But without revealing too much I guess I will close by saying that this is by far one of the best horror films I have ever seen.

Some viewers despise the plot and say the setting is cheesy and the acting is bad and that after watching it years later after we've all our bad tastes of horror flicks let us not forget the Scream series they find it is not as scary anymore. All I have to say is that if you're openminded and you're into a plot about what would happen if these kids took over sound familiar? sounds like my home town... then definitely see it. I personally love this movie although I started the second one and I couldn't finish it because I was laughing too hard. I'll try the third one but really the original horror movies are usually the best and in this case that is very true. On to the plot This is basically about two newcomers who come to this deserted town and find out that these children are actually killers and worship 'Thee Who Walks Behind the Rows' a demon in the corn fields that speaks to Issac only the leader of the children. Of course there's the rebellious Malachai who turns it all around for the children in the end and then to make matters worse there are now two new adults things really get busy! I think this is the most appealing because you pretty much find out everything as the adults do as opposed to the other movies where you pretty much expect just all these adult killings although I've only seen the 6th one which should be illegal in the US because it's so horrible. But anyway a 7th Corn Movie is on its way and it's on Post Production last time I checked so maybe things have turned around! All I can see is that a new sequel is coming out every two years but none will ever match up to this one. So see it! I give it an 8 out of 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a really disappointing adaptation of an excellent and terrifying short story which appeared as part of American horror novelist Stephen King's first anthology of short stories 1978's 'Night Shift'. King's story offers a dreadful sense of growing unease and a truly horrific ending which is completely scrapped in the movie version.The good news about the film is that Linda Hamilton stars if she has ever delivered a bad performance I have not seen it. She has a toughness and a vulnerability at the same time and is an extremely likable actress. I just wish she made more movies I remember seeing her many years ago as the violated wife in the harrowing telemovie 'Rape and Marriage The Rideout Case'. Hamilton made 'Children' shortly before playing tough heroine Sarah Connor in 'The Terminator' the role for which she is most famous.Burt Peter Horton and Vicky Linda Hamilton arrive in the small town of Gatlin Nebraska to find that a small group of mutinous children led by the Damien Thornlike Isaac John Franklin have risen up and murdered nearly all the adults in their town. At the unhinged Isaac's behest they worship He Who Walks Behind the Rows and they are not above sacrificing the odd grown up to this mysterious figure.The shadowy presence of He Who Walks Behind the Rows pervades King's taut tale. In the story Burt is killed by this thing a few hours after he finds his wife crucified her eyes plucked out and the empty sockets filled with corn husks. It is an incredibly downbeat and horrible ending to a great story and draws most of its strength and power from the fact that we do not ever really find out what exactly He Who Walks Behind the Rows is. Is it human? This clever method of suggesting rather than showing horror is discussed by King in his wonderful and nostalgic nonfiction book 'Danse Macabre'. He recalls always being disappointed when a monster was finally unveiled in a horror film. According to King your imagination will always summon a beast much more frightening than something that a special makeup effects man has dreamt up. Unfortunately the horror of He Who Walks Behind the Rows is totally diffused by this film. Instead of some terrifying presence we get an awful electrical current the product of some pretty shoddy early eighties special visual effects work.But the worst thing about this movie is the happy ending. As I wrote King's ending is far better and a hell of a lot scarier. It would have been extremely powerful had Burt and Vicky met a grisly fate more faithful to King's original vision. These are likable characters we do not want to see something bad befall them. So a downbeat ending would have been that much more effective. The loss of these characters would have been depressing and unsettling. Instead what we end up with is a forgettable ending to a forgettable film. 'The Shawshank Redemption' this most certainly is not.".

I liked the part with Sarah the young girl in the beginning and her nightmares but then it went downhill and then some. The movie lacked an explanation for anything that happened and most of the events seemed to jump out of nowhere. The whole The one who walks behind the rows thing was an attempt to have some type of mystery and intrigue but in the end we find that it really makes no sense at all when some random monster just appears from no where burrowing underneath the soil yeah that makes lots of sense? The worst part about this movie it that it really made no sense at all. It never explained anything that happened like why Job and Sarah seemed to be immune to the thrall of the cult that Isaac so easily asserts upon the other children in the town. Also why the town so swiftly became a mysterious and hidden down that yielded power so easily such as from the old man at the gas station in only a few days. The adults die and suddenly the town's off the maps and the sky seems to yield to the children's will it all happens too fast and with no explanation as to how Isaac and Malachai attain their godlike status.This movie seems to be quite the cult classic and must have done very well judging by the parade of sequels that followed in its outdated footsteps. It's really too bad perhaps if this movie had never been created all the other terrible Sequels would not have been made either. My advice is to stay away from this movie you'll expect too much due to its fame and come away disappointed and angry mumbling something to yourself about the structure that plots are supposed to follow in movies. I wouldn't even suggest this movie for a laughable scary flick I would instead shy away from it totally as it fails on both fronts I guess the problem is it takes itself far too seriously in correspondence to its laughable plot and story and ends up really sucking.".

	schema:headline " A wonderfully awful horror film";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1977 short story of the same name by Stephen King this is a wonderfully awful horror film. I have no idea how closely it sticks to the story since I never read it or any of King's work for that matter but the script is horrendously written with more plot holes than you can shake a stick at. The only even remotely clever bits such as the depiction of the mob mentality engendered by cults are taken from either much better works or unfortunately real life incidents.The film takes a dash of Village of the Damned 1960 and a pinch of The Wicker Man 1973 to come up with a storyline concerning evil children who sacrifice people to ensure a good corn harvest. Now I like corn as much as the next guy but this approach seems a little excessive to me. Isaac is basically an older version of Damien from The Omen 1976 crossed with Wesley Crusher and the film's score is a poor man's version of that film's. It's essentially a rehash of earlier horror classics. Unlike The Wicker Man however this film actually attempts to make the relevant crop frightening in a few scenes. Amazingly it doesn't work very well. The director Fritz Kiersch is hardly Richard Attenborough or Kenneth Branagh but he's no Ed Wood or Tommy Wiseau either. Some shots are downright or at least borderline competent.The plot concerns the lovely little town of Gatlin Nebraska which is ruled by Isaac and the other followers of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Three years earlier Isaac clearly a very persuasive guy convinced the rest of the town's children to ritually murder their parents and every other adult in town bar one mechanic. The town has been occupied only by the cultists since then and no one has noticed in the meantime. Isaac even used his powers of persuasion to convince cartographers to take Gatlin off the maps apparently. John Franklin's performance as Isaac could not be described as good but by God or should I say by He Who Walks Behind the Rows? it is entertaining. He steals all of his scenes and makes the film far more entertaining than it would been otherwise. My favourite line is Question not my judgement Malachai. I am the giver of his word. His delivery and contemptuous expression are simply hilarious. It's a great verbal bitchslap.Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton play the hapless interlopers  outlanders Burt and Vicki who wind up in Gatlin while on the way to Seattle. Hamilton and Horton are actually good actors who deservedly went on to bigger and better things the Terminator franchise and Beauty and the Beast 1987 for her and thirtysomething for him. On the bright side they keep the film from being even more terrible. On the less bright side they keep the film from being even more unintentionally hilarious. The two of them have good chemistry even though their characters express little affection for each other until the end of the film. However every time that Vicki yelled Burt! I mentally added Ernie! The only other actor in the film who gives a genuinely decent performance is R.G. Armstrong as Diehl the aforementioned mechanic. Courtney Gains whose career peaked the next year with his one line role in Back to the Future is awful as Isaac's disloyal secondincommand Malachai but he is not quite as hilariously awful as Franklin. But hey he at least put everything into it! The same is true of most of the other child actors none of whom went on to great success. Incidentally Back to the Future is my favourite film of all time. This film did not threaten that status.I mentioned a few of the plot holes already but this is one of the biggest. In the early part of the film Burt and Vicki exhibit genius level intelligence when they run over a child named Joseph who turned out to be already dead having had his throat slit. It just wasn't his day. They then decide that it is a good idea to bungle his corpse into the boot of their car and look for help. Right...Did it not occur to them that if they were stopped by the police and they found the body it might look just a tad suspicious? No one with half a brain would believe that he had been killed by someone else and they were on their way to the authorities. Besides which wrapping him in a blanket and shoving him into the boot would destroy any and all forensic evidence that may exist. He is never removed from the boot meaning that he is left there to rot. Very conscientious! Another notable one is that the cultists kill Diehl admittedly without Isaac's permission for no reason whatsoever as he seems just as willing to abide by the condition that he tells no one of their existence as he was before. Furthermore Job describes the brutal murder of his father which took place within several feet of him in a very calm fashion. One would think that this would traumatise a child but he and his sister Sarah take their parents' deaths and all the other horrific events in Gatlin in their stride. They actually giggle at the end amused by the fact that Burt and Vicki kiss. Oh and Sarah has the unexplained ability to predict the future through her drawings. Sure why not? When He Who Walks Behind the Rows manifests he is killed by a comparatively small explosion caused by a Molotov cocktail. One would also think that a demon from the fiery depths of Hell would be made of sterner stuff but apparently not.Overall this is a great so bad it's good film. It may not be down there with Plan 9 from Outer Space Troll 2 or The Room but it's still pretty far down there.".

I have no idea how closely it sticks to the story since I never read it or any of King's work for that matter but the script is horrendously written with more plot holes than you can shake a stick at. The only even remotely clever bits such as the depiction of the mob mentality engendered by cults are taken from either much better works or unfortunately real life incidents.The film takes a dash of Village of the Damned 1960 and a pinch of The Wicker Man 1973 to come up with a storyline concerning evil children who sacrifice people to ensure a good corn harvest. Now I like corn as much as the next guy but this approach seems a little excessive to me. Isaac is basically an older version of Damien from The Omen 1976 crossed with Wesley Crusher and the film's score is a poor man's version of that film's. It's essentially a rehash of earlier horror classics. Unlike The Wicker Man however this film actually attempts to make the relevant crop frightening in a few scenes. Amazingly it doesn't work very well. The director Fritz Kiersch is hardly Richard Attenborough or Kenneth Branagh but he's no Ed Wood or Tommy Wiseau either. Some shots are downright or at least borderline competent.The plot concerns the lovely little town of Gatlin Nebraska which is ruled by Isaac and the other followers of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Three years earlier Isaac clearly a very persuasive guy convinced the rest of the town's children to ritually murder their parents and every other adult in town bar one mechanic. The town has been occupied only by the cultists since then and no one has noticed in the meantime. Isaac even used his powers of persuasion to convince cartographers to take Gatlin off the maps apparently. John Franklin's performance as Isaac could not be described as good but by God or should I say by He Who Walks Behind the Rows? it is entertaining. He steals all of his scenes and makes the film far more entertaining than it would been otherwise. My favourite line is Question not my judgement Malachai. I am the giver of his word. His delivery and contemptuous expression are simply hilarious. It's a great verbal bitchslap.Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton play the hapless interlopers  outlanders Burt and Vicki who wind up in Gatlin while on the way to Seattle. Hamilton and Horton are actually good actors who deservedly went on to bigger and better things the Terminator franchise and Beauty and the Beast 1987 for her and thirtysomething for him. On the bright side they keep the film from being even more terrible. On the less bright side they keep the film from being even more unintentionally hilarious. The two of them have good chemistry even though their characters express little affection for each other until the end of the film. However every time that Vicki yelled Burt! I mentally added Ernie! The only other actor in the film who gives a genuinely decent performance is R.G. Armstrong as Diehl the aforementioned mechanic. Courtney Gains whose career peaked the next year with his one line role in Back to the Future is awful as Isaac's disloyal secondincommand Malachai but he is not quite as hilariously awful as Franklin. But hey he at least put everything into it! The same is true of most of the other child actors none of whom went on to great success. Incidentally Back to the Future is my favourite film of all time. This film did not threaten that status.I mentioned a few of the plot holes already but this is one of the biggest. In the early part of the film Burt and Vicki exhibit genius level intelligence when they run over a child named Joseph who turned out to be already dead having had his throat slit. It just wasn't his day. They then decide that it is a good idea to bungle his corpse into the boot of their car and look for help. Right...Did it not occur to them that if they were stopped by the police and they found the body it might look just a tad suspicious? No one with half a brain would believe that he had been killed by someone else and they were on their way to the authorities. Besides which wrapping him in a blanket and shoving him into the boot would destroy any and all forensic evidence that may exist. He is never removed from the boot meaning that he is left there to rot. Very conscientious! Another notable one is that the cultists kill Diehl admittedly without Isaac's permission for no reason whatsoever as he seems just as willing to abide by the condition that he tells no one of their existence as he was before. Furthermore Job describes the brutal murder of his father which took place within several feet of him in a very calm fashion. One would think that this would traumatise a child but he and his sister Sarah take their parents' deaths and all the other horrific events in Gatlin in their stride. They actually giggle at the end amused by the fact that Burt and Vicki kiss. Oh and Sarah has the unexplained ability to predict the future through her drawings. Sure why not? When He Who Walks Behind the Rows manifests he is killed by a comparatively small explosion caused by a Molotov cocktail. One would also think that a demon from the fiery depths of Hell would be made of sterner stuff but apparently not.Overall this is a great so bad it's good film. It may not be down there with Plan 9 from Outer Space Troll 2 or The Room but it's still pretty far down there.";

Trying to push their arguments aside they try to focus on being a couple. While driving through rural Nebraska the two run over a boy who's stumbling in the middle of the road. When Burt reaches him the med student finds that the boy's throat was already slashed when he stumbled into the road. Who is he? Where did he come from? The couple stops at a near by almost ghosttownish like gas station. The old man there tells them to turn back and go to the nearby town of Hemmingford. Discourged the couple decide to go to Gatlin a town that is closer instead. What they find there is every parents worst nightmare!!! The towns children are a cult of murderous malcontents. Children who wield sickles scythes and machetes and chant Spill the blood of the outlanders. The children are led by a boy preacher named Isaac Chorner and his henchman Malachai. And they worship an evil corn deity named He Who Walks Behind the Rows. These two characters Isaac and Malachai alone are enough to make your skin crawl! The machete twirling Malachai and the Giver of his word Isaac will have you hiding your head under the covers. As for the rest of the story if you really want to know you'll have to watch the movie yourself. But to it's credibility this one movie has now spawned 6 sequels. Some good some not so swell. But there is no denying that Children of the Corn is one of the best horror films EVER made. As my name suggests I am COTCgirl. I am probably one of the biggest fans of the COTC films. So take my advice see this 80's classic for yourself. Then pick a row for yourself and join me in loving this wonderful treat of a film! A CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM If you liked this one do see the sequels even though some are not so good.

	schema:reviewBody "Children of the Corn another translation of one of Stephen King's short stories is a movie that even when it has some good moments it never really makes a good impression. Let's focus on the good things first.A young couple travels across the U.S. Suddenly they hit what looks like a boy. When they return and examine the kid they discover that the kid was murdered in the corn fields. They take the kid to the nearest town Gatlin where they discover that something has gone horribly wrong ads they found that the adults have disappeared and the children act really strange.No doubt it's a good premise having children as the evil was done previously in Village of the Damned but here it's to the next level by having the children killing the adults following the orders of a bizarre religious preacher. It's like Village of the Damned meets The Wicker Man.Sadly the movie never turns that good. The good parts are the amazing score used in the movie it's very haunting and eerie. It goes well with the subject and the atmosphere of the town. That is something which also deserves recognition. The choosing of the location was excellent and the crew knew how to give the town the atmosphere of isolation and mystery the film demanded. Too bad the director could not manage the actors as good as he did with the crew.The acting for the most part is bad although John Franklin in the character of the creepy preacher Isaac deserves credit for giving the best acting in the movie. And maybe of the entire series.For the most part the movie is average but in the ending it falls apart when it breaks the atmospheric tone it was using and goes for an ending that the lowbudget SFX could not afford.To summarize it's a movie that will give you entertainment if you don't expect too much and the great score and the acting of John Franklin may worth the rent.610".

First of all is the plot a very thin and pretty generic when you think of horror films. This makes the movie bad because you know whats going to happen. Secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed. One of the questions and this is no spoiler is WHAT THE HELL ARE THE KIDS DOING IN THAT CORN???!!! Thirdly is the characters very bad not only because the movie is bad but also because of the sorry actors. They are bad as they can be.The last thing that make this movie bad is that its a horror movie. You are supposed to be scared of the killings or the sudden shocks but you are not scared you a not horrified because you know whats going to happen. Why? THEY SHOW YOU! yes when something is going to happen BAM you see what it is and well see the murder. In the scene where they are escaping through the corn field well I thought in the beginning of the scene it was scary but the way they delivered the scare ruined it! They have some chances to get scary but every time they are about to be scary they deliver it pretty badly. This has to do with a bad director who apparently doesn't know HOW to make a movie about a cornfield scary. Conclusion The movie is bad! I hoped that it was a very great movie but because the story is bad the actors are bad the film raises a lot of questions and because its not scary the movie is best unseen.".

Inevitably all that remains now is to let his imagination run wild and confess his boldly intimate and rousing thoughts to his elaborate diary in the hope that Teresa will soon find it and read it. There in his frank and unrestricted confessions against all risk of being judged as a vile and corrupt man Nino would admit all the things that he would never be able to say in person urging his Goddess Teresa to finally get rid of her painful and revolting modesty. The faithful diary may be locked away in safety but the precious key is hidden in plain sight. Will innocent Teresa ever discover it and with it the way to unlock what quickens the faint yet willing heart?";

The cover art of Stefania projects an allure that is only the begining of a very profound experience. Brass manages to create a film that doesn't make some epic statement of love society and relationships.  Instead he presents a rather odd and erotic situation that makes you think and feel in various ways the gravity of the characters situations.  The film is also not afraid to come accross as a little silly at times.Don't be mistaken this is first and foremost and erotic movie but it manages something masterful in that genre.  Tinto Brass has constructed a very nice platform for sensual expression in this film.  I wouldn't advise seeing it with your local bible study group but it isn't frat boy tissue party material either.  If you are open to nudity and sensuality this could be just the movie to share with your partner on a night alone together. The sets and the actors are well done but you still get to see plenty of sex. Tinto's Key is the perfect movie to potentially unlock those who are one the fence when it comes to erotic cinema.".

However for me the most difficult aspect was coming to terms with the fact that this has been transposed from the writer Junichiro Tanizaki's Japanese homeland to a wintry Venice. The whole notion of a couple each keeping a sexual diary locked up but knowingly made available as a way of communicating their hopes and desires is so not the way we consider Italians likely to behave. But never mind the film is great enough to overcome this and in no time I was under the spell of the beautiful and prestigious actress Stefania Sandrelli and to a lesser extent by Frank Finlay. I should also clarify the point that this fairly explicit film is about eroticism and not in the main erotic itself.

Mr Brass does of course indulge himself quite a few lingering shots of certain parts of Sandrelli's anatomy but I'm sure nobody would grudge him that certainly not I.";

I'm not into cuckolding but it's actually a sweet romantic film in a way just with a lot of visual fawning over women's exposed buttocks. Tinto Brass is like that.

He lays a plan to manipulate her into expressing her sexual side through the use of diaries purposefully left to be discovered erotic photography alcohol and finally a stagemanaged affair between Teresa and his daughter's fianc. Yet setting the workings of desire in motion this way leads to things slipping from the professor's control his wife becomes increasingly an agent in her own sexual liberation his fascist daughter schemes for her own ends and finally the professor's own body escapes the control of his mind leading to spasm thrombosis and death. Yet the death doesn't seem tragic as it frees both the professor from the evils of history which are about to be spectacularly unleashed and this is a man who has been helping the Jews of Venice and his wife from her socially imposed role of modest matron and submissive object.Brass' film shows sexual desire as a lookingglass world mirrors abound in which values are undermined roles are reversed and social propriety is challenged. As Teresa becomes increasingly liberated she puts men in the role of providers of pleasure gains her own enjoyment out of seeing them naked and even gets them parading about in her clothes the professor's collapse comes after he has been ordered by Teresa to wear her knickers stockings and bra and make love to her in them for because that's how she likes to see him. The film's narrative movement mirrors the story's progression at first the professor is the protagonist and Teresa is subject to the male gaze gradually she takes over as the focus of the film and men come increasingly under the naked scrutiny of the camera. Intriguingly the taking of photographs is one of the methods by which the professor manipulates the other characters and one feels that Brass is hoping that his photography will manipulate his audience male and female in similar ways. Also worth noting is the way in which Teresa's costumes chart her changes so that by the denouement she is wearing pure white for her husband's funeral. Yet the end of the film makes complex the focus on sexual liberation for the individual as the remaining characters are drowned out by history in the shape of fascist announcement songs and celebrations.Frank Finlay is aptly cast as the professor returning to Venice for the third time in his career having hatched Iago's plan to sexually manipulate Othello in the Olivier film there and then having been imprisoned in Venice by the Inquisition for his sexual transgressions as the title character in Dennis Potter's miniseries Casanova. Stephania Sandrelli gives a spirited and extraordinarily brave performance as Teresa throwing off her arthouse airs to luxuriate in the most lurid scenes of softcore erotica and having the voluptuousness and acting skill to trace her characters emotional and physical journey in the most eyepoppingly sexy and seductive way.Beautifully filmed designed and lit and probably as near as Brass ever came to making a cinematic masterpiece.".

The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored. Much of the story is shown rather than told which I find makes it more subtle and moving  and which also works well for a story based on a comic book or graphic novel.

	schema:reviewBody "This couldn't have been better. The strong restraints on Mike Sullivan's expressions couldn't have been portrayed in any other way. Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin drives an emotional wheel playing the basis character for the story. And veteran Paul Newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time.This film is based on a bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This is a fatherson story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles. Mike Sullivan had no father as a child so John Rooney took him in. Although a generous man Mr. Rooney involved himself in organized crime. Therefore the debt of Sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business. Now Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe but at the same time pay back his boss. The events to follow will test Sullivan's loyalty and embrace his family's fate.With a great adaptation by David Self the dialogue comes out seldomly but yet very virtuous. The story unfolds in a beautiful 1930's setting Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson  Nancy Haigh covered with a dark rainy snow on the ground exterior. Driving the story is Thomas Newman's wonderful Irish score settling in only when necessary.But the most important technical element in the film is Conrad L. Hall's beautiful photography. This is some of the best cinematography I've seen and I watch a lot of films. The scene when Mike and Michael are in the car entering Chicago is quite impressive. The shot starts at the front of the car revealing MikeHanks through the windshield.

	onyx:emotionText "This couldn't have been better. The strong restraints on Mike Sullivan's expressions couldn't have been portrayed in any other way. Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin drives an emotional wheel playing the basis character for the story. And veteran Paul Newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time.This film is based on a bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This is a fatherson story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles. Mike Sullivan had no father as a child so John Rooney took him in. Although a generous man Mr. Rooney involved himself in organized crime. Therefore the debt of Sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business. Now Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe but at the same time pay back his boss. The events to follow will test Sullivan's loyalty and embrace his family's fate.With a great adaptation by David Self the dialogue comes out seldomly but yet very virtuous. The story unfolds in a beautiful 1930's setting Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson  Nancy Haigh covered with a dark rainy snow on the ground exterior. Driving the story is Thomas Newman's wonderful Irish score settling in only when necessary.But the most important technical element in the film is Conrad L. Hall's beautiful photography. This is some of the best cinematography I've seen and I watch a lot of films. The scene when Mike and Michael are in the car entering Chicago is quite impressive. The shot starts at the front of the car revealing MikeHanks through the windshield. It subsequently dollys around to the side of the car to see MichaelHoechlin awakening and peering out his side window. As it continues it trucks sideways and dollys back completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930's Chicago.With a great cast and crew the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film.

There is no doubt this film will become a classic. Don't dare compare it with Godfather this is a GANGSTER film not a MAFIA movie! Godfather will never be surpassed so don't compare to it.

I'll remember this movie as proof of example outstanding directioncinematography cannot fully compensate for a lackluster plot.On paper the plot is an average set up. Relationships in a crime family are tested but none are ever stretched too far. In this sense it feels somewhat familiar and not very original.But what does keep this movie from being averageblah is the care put into EVERY shot. I give a huge amount of credit to the cinematographer. A good amount of noticeable techniques were used. I particularly liked one symmetrical pillar shot that used a zoom in dolly in trick. A slight variation of the Vertigo introduced zoom in dolly out.But with all of these wonderful shots I noticed something. There was so much technically stunning camera work I found myself completely drawn out of the story. Was this done intentionally? To some degree I think so. This nicely compliments the dark and rainy 1930's settings.Noticing this I tried to put more thought into the plot. There basically was none. The characters were cold and lacked development. Any dialog is important and used sparingly. I couldn't stop myself from drawing comparison to The Godfather. What Road to Perdition lacks is any underlying intensity between the characters. I never feel like they were a tightknit family and do feel as if I'm simply watching characters play their parts. The story has no poetry and feels more like a collection of parts that aren't worth its sum.I appreciate it in its stunning visuals but once the credit rolled I felt nothing.

This is a terrific movie and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the Michael Sullivan a father of two children played by great Tom Hanks I'm not his admirer but ought to say that is a hitman for local mafia boss played by Paul Newman. His eldest son a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr. perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder committed by John Rooney son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult fatherson relations in bad times. They are shown so deeply strong and believable. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful but one more time sad masterpiece. I believe Road to Perdition belongs to greatest achievements of filmmaking of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.My grade 10 out of 10".

Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes' extraordinary technical prowess. If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great then yes ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography editing music scoring and sound. What it doesn't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over. As with American BEAUTY there is a cold distancing feel to this movie despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love loyalty and betrayal.This story of a hit man Tom Hanks and his relationship to a surrogate father  figure who is also his boss an elderly Irish mob leader Paul Newman  seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past. The father son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity  the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought  and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent  this is obviously a gangster film  hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed  but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of  only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom.That being said  I have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film  indeed  it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have ever seen. Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for his work here . The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary  in fact  the entire film is a technical marvel. Mr. Mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color and he and Mr. Hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls  all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks blues and grays that dominate the movie's color scheme.If I have failed to duly note the acting  it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably  everyone in the film is top notch with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys  Daniel Craig is the classic man you love to hate the spoiled impulsive son of Newman's gangster father  and an almost unrecognizable Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half. But acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here. If a RollsRoyce was a movie  I've no doubt it would look like ROAD TO PERDITION.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frankly this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors.The opposite of perdition being lost is salvation being saved and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts. The movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the fatherson relationship. It should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes.The premise is that the fathers in the move hitman Michael Sullivan Tom Hanks and his crime boss John Rooney Paul Newman love their sons and will do anything to protect them. But Rooney's son Connor is even more evil than the rest. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son Michael witnessed it he mistakenly kills Sullivan's other son and Sullivan's wife in an attempt to silence witnesses.Sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price even at the terribly high price of perdition. Rooney who in one scene curses the day Connor was born refuses to give up his son Connor to Sullivan and hires a contract killer named Maguire Jude Law to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney joins his son Connor on the Road to Perdition.For the rest of the movie accompanied by his surviving son young Michael Sullivan pursues Connor Rooney down the Road to Perdition and Maguire pursues Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a Church basement and demands that he give up Connor because Connor murdered his family Rooney says  Michael there are only murderers in this room.. and there's only one guarantee none of us will see Heaven. As the movie ends somewhat predictably one character is saved and one character repents.I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan but he does step out of character to play hitman Sullivan convincingly giving a subtle and laconic performance. Newman does well as the old Irish gangster Rooney showing a hard edge in his face and manner his eyes haunted by Connor's misdeeds. Jude Law plays Maguire in a suitably creepy way. Tyler Hoechlin plays Young Michael naturally and without affectation.The cinematography constantly played light off from darkness echoing the themes of salvation and perdition. The camera drew from a palette of greens and greys. The greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of Depression era Illinois. The greens belonged to the younger sons and that State's rural flatlands. Thomas Newman's lush sonorous and haunting music had faint Irish overtones and was played out in Coplandlike arrangements. The sets were authentic midWestern urban  factories churches. The homes shone with gleaming woodwork.The excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes distinctive acting and enveloping music and cinematography. The only negative was a slight antigun message slipped into the screenplay y the movie's only nod to political correctness.I give this movie a10 out of 10 in time it will be acknowledged as a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the best movie but it looks the best has great acting and is directed perfectly by Sam Mendes who debuted with 'American Beauty'.It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan Tom Hanks who is seen by his son Tyler Hoechlin on one of his jobs. Michael's boss John Rooney Paul Newman thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney Daniel Craig sets both his father and Michael up leading to the death of Michael's wife Jennifer Jason Leigh and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hitman Harlen Maguire Jude Law to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti Stanley Tucci.In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that. This movie is good in its production design art direction sound music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks Law and Newman know how to act helps of course.Based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.".

	schema:headline " Among the most beautiful films in history";
	schema:reviewBody "Acting  This film is a very well acted film. I will say that the performances  are slightly weak at times but for the most part the acting is very  good. The only actor that blew me away with his performance was Jude  Law as Harlen Maguire. He was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed alittle  unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was  incredible. Paul Newman good as always.   Cinematography  This is what made the movie a masterpiece and I rarely use that word.  Conrad Hall is a true genius. If at any point in the movie you were to  pause it you will see the delicately crafted work of this man. He sets  up every shot so that nothing is left out. When the camera is still  there is a postcard like quality to the screen. When the camera is  moving every shot is planned to understated perfection. But it doesn't  stop there. Conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and  dark settings is a work of art. The way he lights the set is some of  the most amazing lighting work I've seen. His work on this movie made  it what it is. This movie is at the top of the list for best  Cinematography with LOTR Black Hawk Down Hero CTHD Moulin Rouge  and Vertigo.  Story  People will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but I believe  they missed the point of the movie. It is a love story about a hitman  who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose. It is a  brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between  two people who have nothing but each other. The screen Writing is  worthy of an Oscar.  Music  Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad  but hopeful story. The music is some of the most beautiful and moving  scores I've herd.   Direction  Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director.  The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a  rarity in todays filmmaking world. I will be on the lookout for the  next Sam Mendes Film.  1010 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I've ever seen.".

The Road to Perdition directed by Sam Mendes American Beauty is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time. Perhaps I'm just getting old perhaps I've just seen the same themes recycled time and again. But this movie is indeed different.The story opens with young Michael Sullivan Jr. facing out to the sea contemplating the duality of his father's legacy  one of the best men to ever live one of the most evil. This duality snakes its way throughout the movie. The story revolves around crime boss John Rooney Paul Newman and Michael Sullivan Tom Hanks the young man Rooney once took in and who now serves as his personal Angel of Death. Rooney is tied by blood to his own son but tied by love and loyalty to Michael. Young Michael Jr. intrigued by the stories he reads steals away in his father's car one night while Dad goes off to work with Connor Rooney heir to the family business. Connor lets the situation get out of hand and what was meant only to be a warning turns into murder  witnessed by Michael Jr. Upon the discovery that young Michael has seen what he should not have seen the plot is set in motion as conflicting loyalties collide. Soon Michael Sr. is on the run with his young son pursued by contract killer Harlen The Reporter Maguire Jude Law.I will disclose no further details in order to avoid any potential spoilers. However I strongly encourage viewers to examine the many dualities that present themselves in the movie Problems between sons and fathers Michael Sr  Jr. John Rooney  son Connor between the world at home and the world at work between good and evil between those who pretend to be men of god and those who really are between clean money and dirty between the town of Perdition and Perdition as hell. And along the way savor the visual brilliance of cinematographer Conrad L. Hall 9 nominations 2 oscars for best cinematography rain pouring off fedoras shots through mirrors especially on swinging doors tommygun flashes from out of the shadows absent any sound. Not only has 75yearold Hall given us perhaps the best cinematic product of his career but 77yearold Paul Newman offers one of his best performances ever.Yes ... I may be getting old. But I've seen a lot ... and this is fresh and invigorating. The Road to Perdition presents a lasting and loving tribute to the gangster genre to films of the 40s to dark comicbook figures lurking in the darkness to villains and heroes to American film in general. Go see it!".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this film four or five times now and it never ceases to amaze. There's both power and nuance in the performances of the principal players totally miscast some would say with Tom Hanks as a gangsterhitman and Paul Newman as an organized crime boss who's been like a father to him. That presumption is totally without merit as both actors deliver incredible performances in this tale of betrayal and revenge set in the winter of 1931.With each viewing I'm more and more impressed with the subtleties offered by the actors and director alike. Consider the following scenes  the Sullivan's abandoning their home along with young Michael's innocence as symbolized by the bike left behind to rust in the snow the bead of sweat meandering down the side of Michael's face in the diner scene opposite his intended assassin Jude Law son Michael's negotiating for two hundred dollars as his share of the bank jobs the hit on Connor Daniel Craig as viewed via his reflection in the swinging door of the bathroom in which he died.This is a finely crafted tale that demands close attention. Initially one would believe that the elder Rooney Newman ordered the hit on Michael Sullivan with that visit to Calvino. But it was Connor's doing all the way then botching the rubout of the remaining family by only taking out the wife and younger son. The senior Rooney's angst is palpable realizing that his own flesh and blood is inept and unworthy of forgiveness but unable to reconcile his fatherly instinct to preserve his own. The single fault I find with the characterization of the principals is during the failed attempt on Sullivan in the hotel room. After Maguire Law is disabled by the shards of glass the elder Michael should have put an end to the chase right there.Interestingly the story makes clever use of placing real life gangsters in the story's plot naming Mafia kingpin Al Capone as an off screen presence and using his top henchman Frank Nitti Stanley Tucci to bridge an untenable truce between the rival parties. The violence in the picture is never overdone unless one is squeamish about the up close and personal type of vengeance as administered by professional hit men.With any other film the ending might have been a tear jerker affair but there were no clean hands here. All of the principal characters were flawed in their own way including young Michael portrayed by Tyler Hoechlin in a stellar role. Narrated from the perspective of a twelve year old son's coming of age Road to Perdition earns it's place as one of the top gangster films of the modern era.".

It's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN  MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY  Irish gangsters is MILLER'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster epics. Despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . I've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role  probably better . Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent  Newman's performance works due to the subtle body language  his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top . While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become James Bond  a role which heralds the end of an actors career".

I think it was all about cool shots in the rain lighting and camera movement. Road to perdition would have been a much better film if it was not hijacked by the cinematographer. Through out the film shots are so well composed that you forget the character itself. It looks as if you are sitting in front of a TV to witness composition of each frame and not the story. I think the story is good for one hour. In the first half an hour you don't know what's going on and that the only interesting part. Once you know the characters there's nothing to watch except for rain suits and car. Extremely overrated film. Acting wise I don't think there was a scope for any great stuff. Recommended only for film students. 710".

	schema:headline " Road to redemption";
	schema:reviewBody "Road to Perdition is one of the few films that tries to recreate the film noir genre while basking in the modern light. Its use of light shadow and water can all be classified as stylistic and its cinematography could also get it elected into a genre so admirable. The film follows Michael Sullivan Sr. Hanks a hit man working for an Irish Mob boss Newman in 1930's Illinois. Sullivan has a loving wife Leigh and two plucky kids Peter Aiken and Michael Jr. Hoechlin yet tries to keep his sons oblivious to his involvement in the mobster lifestyle.One day Michael Jr. sneaks out to see his father and a mentally unstable mob member Connor Craig murder a man in a warehouse. Despite assuring Jr. won't tell anyone Connor goes to Sullivan's house late one night and kills his wife and his youngest son Peter mistaking him for Jr. While Sullivan and Jr. flee to Chicago it isn't long before Sullivan's former mob boss sends an assassin Law to track him down and kill him. The film becomes a relentless journey of trying to leave behind an old lifestyle and start a brand new one through a child.What must be lauded is the use of dark and grim cinematography the last work of Conrad L. Hall who died shortly after the film was completed. When the film is dark it is still beautifully lit by source lighting and little intricate elements such as headlights and streetlights. From what I've seen of the graphic novel written by Max Allan Collins it was like the film ominous dark and very very serene.Road to Perdition also has a great amount of symbolism which I favor over ambiguity any day. One of its biggest motifs is in the use of water and rain. The event is woven in when death comes up in the film sort of commenting on the randomness of humanity and the fact that death like rain is instantaneous and sometimes virtually unpredictable. Rather than being blatant it's woven in the film so naturally and subtly you may miss it.Hanks gives an electrifying performance as a stressed father focused on achieving redemption through his son. He believes that the sins he committed are unforgivable and irredeemable. All his life he has been involved with complex underground operations contentious relationships and secrecy from his lovedones. He feels he hasn't been a proper father and believes his son can do way better. On a little sidenote the acting from both Tyler Hoechlin and Jude Law is excellent as well and audiences should pay attention to little side performances that will likely go unnoticed because of a lot of enigma on screen.This is a cold bittersweet film for much of its runtime. It's hard to watch and difficult to recommend. It doesn't strive to be so much a gritty honest mobster tale as it does try to be a parable of father and son relationships and a tragic take on innocence lost. I think many will agree that Road to Perdition is a pretty shameless Hollywood film. From voiceovers to big name stars to cinematography to storytelling to the hefty budget to morals writing and tone it's all the components of a straightforward Hollywood tale. That's not a bad thing. I for one would rather see a big budget Hollywood epic than a poorly done incompetent indie work. It isn't until that indie work has proved itself to be more than meets the eye will I choose it over a Hollywood epic.Starring Tom Hanks Paul Newman Jude Law Daniel Craig Jennifer Jason Leigh Liam Aiken and Tyler Hoechlin. Directed by Sam Mendes.".

The cast of this movie was well put together. I also love the part when there is total silence when Tom Hanks' character shoots and kills all of the men in Mr. Rooney's group. There is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene just simply emotion. I love the look on John Rooney Paul Newman's character's face when he realizes even before seeing him that it is Tom Hanks's character getting revenge and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie I was blown away and knew I had to go out and get the video and I since have adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies.Tom Hanks is my favorite actor so this film has a special place in me.".

When Sullivan's son Mike hides in Sullivan's car to find out what he actually does for Rooney he finds that his father is a hired gun a gangster if you will.  Mike sees his father and Rooney's son Connor kill three men.  Connor begins to suspect that Mike could tell someone and thus expose that Connor is stealing his father's money and goes to kill the family.  His attempt on Mike and Sullivan fails but his wife and other son are dead.  Sullivan and his son take to the road with Sullivan's desire for his son's safety only slightly behind his desire for revenge on Connor.I have a problem with modern films.  No.  I have a problem with how modern films are hyped.  Can't anything just be good anymore?  It seems everything either has to be rubbish or a masterpiece.  Look how many films jump straight into high positions in the imdb 250 list to see what I mean.  But on top of that films are advertised as being amazing etc rather than slightly more subdued messages.Here we have the best gangster film ever made' and  better than the Godfather'. Neither of these statements are true but that's not to say that it is rubbish.  It's a good often wonderful film that is as good in some ways as it is poor in others.  I was lucky to approach it with not having read reviews and mostly managing to miss the epic' trailers that are everywhere  and I was the better for it with no expectation then you can't be let down!The plot is a little predictable in how it develops and where it ends but it's still enjoyable.  The weakness of it however is the use or misuse or the parental theme.  Where was it?  The foundations were laid with Sullivan and his son Rooney with his son and a fatherson thing between Sullivan and Rooney.  But what was done with it?  Very little  apart from some minor bonding between the two Michaels.  It felt like there was more there that either wasn't or didn't come out.  The story felt heavy at points too the relationship between the two Michaels didn't flow and there were too many scenes which felt ponderous.  I didn't want more action but I wanted it tighter or at least with a bit more soul behind the dialogue and the characters.The cast is like a heavy weight boxer and therefore I did expect it to hit harder.  To be blunt  Hanks is not right for this role.  A lot was made out of him being a bad guy' but was he really playing a bad guy?  He tries hard to not overplay it and lose the audience but I felt the film was trying to give him as much moral leeway as possible.  The majority of his killings are in the name of revenge which in film morals is fine.  The only killing before the death of his family we don't see him do and we have him say we're just going to talk?' before hand and then shout at his partner for putting him in a killing situation.  Compare this to Leon aka The Professional  he is cold and ruthless and we love him more for his emotional growth and love.  Here Hanks only really shines when being friendly or in the rare comedy moments.  I felt he laced the ability the desire or maybe the audience acceptance to be able to play bad' and take his character beyond it into a development.Newman is good in a few scenes but isn't working too hard for his money. His role is good but it's at his tiredest when he does well.  Law is excellent despite his cartoon villain character  he is best in his early scenes and his first meeting with Sullivan is good.  Tucci is good and Leigh is good for all she has to do.  Craig is good value and is very well cast. Hoechlin is very good and deserves the Oscar nomination that he will no doubt get for supporting actor.  But none of these were the powerhouse performances I had hoped for with such a top class cast available.The star of the film is Mendes himself.  People were surprised by how well he directed in his debut and if he got an Oscar for that then he simply must have one for this.  Ignoring the weaknesses in plot pacing and some of the performances visually this is stunning.  Normal shots from cars and of snow are really well set up and shot while the tour de force is a shoot out in the silence in the rain where the camera's focus is on one man's resignation and almost ignores the carnage all around.  The clichs of the plot and the slight ponderous feel of the beast may distract but I found myself admiring the shots and noticing the imagination Mendes showed in his direction.  There are so many well directed or clever scenes in this that I almost forgot that this was not the norm for films.Overall it isn't rubbish and it isn't the best gangster film ever made. Instead it is a good film about parental relationships and revenge that doesn't really address either.  Instead it feels sluggish at times and could have had more spark from a talented and deep cast. But Mendes makes everything feel and look clever and makes the film better.  A really good multiplex experience despite the failings'  put that one your poster!".

His role is good but it's at his tiredest when he does well.  Law is excellent despite his cartoon villain character  he is best in his early scenes and his first meeting with Sullivan is good.  Tucci is good and Leigh is good for all she has to do.  Craig is good value and is very well cast. Hoechlin is very good and deserves the Oscar nomination that he will no doubt get for supporting actor.  But none of these were the powerhouse performances I had hoped for with such a top class cast available.The star of the film is Mendes himself.  People were surprised by how well he directed in his debut and if he got an Oscar for that then he simply must have one for this.  Ignoring the weaknesses in plot pacing and some of the performances visually this is stunning.  Normal shots from cars and of snow are really well set up and shot while the tour de force is a shoot out in the silence in the rain where the camera's focus is on one man's resignation and almost ignores the carnage all around.  The clichs of the plot and the slight ponderous feel of the beast may distract but I found myself admiring the shots and noticing the imagination Mendes showed in his direction.  There are so many well directed or clever scenes in this that I almost forgot that this was not the norm for films.Overall it isn't rubbish and it isn't the best gangster film ever made. Instead it is a good film about parental relationships and revenge that doesn't really address either.  Instead it feels sluggish at times and could have had more spark from a talented and deep cast. But Mendes makes everything feel and look clever and makes the film better.  A really good multiplex experience despite the failings'  put that one your poster!";

Set in Austriasouthern Germany in the beginning fifties the story about the unhappy divorce of the famous musician and conductor Ludwig Palffy and the hardworking at that time!!! motherjournalist Louiselotte Krner is ever so realistic. Don't let yourself being prejudiced by it's old appearance this movie is worth watching! Sentiments and misunderstandings a laugh and a cry everything comes up. Here the switch is kept up for at least a couple of weeks with all the difficult situations to master. In the later movies like the latest Parent Trap how funny and nice that one is the exchange doesn't last more than a few days.

You really want them to get together again and are so happy when they finally manage! With as a symbol Palffy's atelier moved to the condo next door instead of somewhere else in the city.The only real minus is the fact that the twins Louise and Lotte don't really look alike.

	schema:reviewBody "Das doppelte Lottchen or Two Times Lotte is a West German blackandwhite film from 1950 so this movie is already over 65 years old. It is one of the two pretty famous works by director Josef von Bky and he also won a German Film Award for it but the real star here is of course writer Erich Kstner who also received a German Film Award just like the movie itself that was honored as best of the year with the Golden Candlestick the equivalent to the Lola back then. It runs for approximately 100 minutes and I cannot say I am too familiar with the cast here. But the lack of really wellknown actors at least by today's standards is not the major problem here. The major problem is the writing and this is especially disappointing given Kstner's fame and the fact that he adapted the book himself. It is one major aspect that was frequently a problem namely the complete lack of shades. All the characters were depicted as likable except the lover of the girls' father who was depicted completely unlikable so we would cheer for the parents getting together. It's really cheap and uninspired in my opinion and apart from that I cannot say that I liked the parents a lot. No matter how much they tried to justify it there is no excuse for denying your daughter that she has not only a sister but an identical twin. And I personally felt that the Gnther twins also did not display the greatest range really. Not surprised at all that they stopped acting quickly. Peter Mosbacher was by far the one who gave the best performance in here. But he alone cannot make up for all the flaws with this movie. I do not recommend the watch and the Lohan happy 30th birthday Linds! version is for example far superior.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thomas Pete Postlethwaite and his beautiful wife Julianna Greta Scacchi live in England around the beginning of the 19th century. They used to reside in town but have since moved to a large estate in the country. This has upset Julianna as she loves company games and excitement. To help smooth things over Thomas plans to have a gorgeous formal garden installed near the house for Julianna'e enjoyment and as a place for her to entertain guests. He hires Meneer Ewan McGregor to plan the gardens at almost unlimited expense. Secretly however Meneer is not the famous gardener he is supposed to be but rather an impostor. A cousin of Julianna's Richard E. Grant has arranged for Meneer to pose as the horticulture expert because he wants the young gardener to bleed the finances of Thomas dry to settle old scores. Thomas and Julianna have a beautiful only child a daughter Anna Carmen Chaplin for since Anna's birth Julianna has been barren. Anna is decidedly independent and outspoken and often chooses to walk the grounds by herself. This causes her father to believe she may have mental problems and he subjects Anna to a doctor's unusual and unorthodox treatments. Anna has strong feelings too about whether the natural beauty of the grounds should be sacrificed for a contrived showplace of formal gardens. So how will this garden grow? Will Meneer complete his mission or will he be found out? This is a lovely film with a nice cast and a terrific unusual story. Although set back in time the tale shows quite well how human nature changes very little over the years. Money lust deceit and revenge are as natural as breathing for some folks causing suffering to those around them. As the main heavy Grant is wonderfully evil while Postlethwaite Scacchi and McGregor fulfill their roles nicely. Chaplin however although very pretty gives a rather weak performance overall. As for the scenery and the costumes they are of the finest caliber making for a view that is visually compelling and the direction is faultless. Why not kiss off the mundane entertainment choices of an evening and watch this captivating gorgeous extraordinary film instead? You will most likely pat yourself on the back for doing so.".

It wasn't as selfreferentially dense as projects that followed but its an incredible structure. It references restoration drama in form. While it makes itself that way the story is of a illustrator who creates reality while drawing it. The reality in question is of an English country estate and it involves sexual intrigue toward and by the artist. There's a tussle about who is writing drawing the film we see.Now we have a film built directly on top of that. It stars Ewan McGregor who had the year before starred in Greenaway's most advanced film as of this writing. You really have to know both of those movies to appreciate this. You have to also know that the crazy young woman is the grandchild of our first lucid filmmaker and his wife herself the daughter of one of our most lucid playwrights. She seems at times to literally control what is seen by all. And it helps to know that the repressed but eager mother is played by the woman who was June Gudmundsdottir in one of our most lucid films. Lucid here in terms of films that see themselves as they unfold.The actual movie by itself is rather chopped up and directed in a somewhat incoherent way. But it doesn't matter at all and I only noticed it the second time. Its about the things behind the things we see. That's what it is and what the story is. It begins with the most amazing images behind the title. They are blurry images just barely noticeable as moving humans. Later they will be conflated with reapers fishers statues... and all folded in as the girl's dreams which are further folded into the book she reads the letters Ewan's character writes the design of the garden and its undesign. Its a mind game. Its lovely without being rich. Its not slick. It has holes. It was done cheaply and without visual flourish. But what a fun ride!What a ride.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

But Chrome begins having second thoughts about completing the plan after he becomes fascinated by Smithers's daughter Thea Carmen Chaplin. I think people who have criticized this movie are far too harsh. I found it to have an excellent story with a talented cast. The performance that I felt most touched by was Carmen Chaplin's. Her struggle to find disorder in a world that wants to have order is an interesting element to the story. What I didn't like was the movie's pacing. I felt the message the movie was conveying that you can not control nature. I think this theme would have been better expressed in a short story or a short movie not a feature length film.

Each scene has a plethora of knowledge and insight that proves at times to be quite the delightful opposite of what each character says. Yet make no mistake I definitely recommend this movie to anyone with patience and an infatuation for well written fully understandable stories with moral meaning. If none of this is important to you however I would still recommended it. If only on the basis that Ewan McGregor's acting is something to watch intently and eagerly.

Scacchi was as glorious as ever McGregor was as enjoyable as ever and the other three principles each held down their corner of the story.  The biggest weakness was the garden itself  it seems like the filmmakers were even less able to afford Chrome's vision than Smithers was with a result that was more suited to a stage production than a movie.  I'm not convinced that this movie was a good use of two hours of my time but I also find that I can't get some of the imagery out of my head  generally recommended if you have patience with period pieces and like movies that ask more questions than they answer.".

At the point of time that this film is depicting 1699 in the reign of William I in Great Britain the rich nobility even the nouveau rich that Peter Postlethwaite is portraying had this passion for ornate gardens. It was a style trend among those who could afford it. King Louis XIV in France designed the best for Versailles and everyone tried to copy him. So Postlethwaite who is a munitions manufacturer by trade and rich because of it has to have the most ornate garden in the kingdom so he can proclaim his status to the world.Enter Ewan MacGregor who plays a Dutch designer of gardens he even worked for William of Orange. He goes to work for Postelthwaite and his wife Greta Sacchi to do his own version of Versailles and he's encouraged in this by Sacchi's cousin Richard Grant who has more than a passing interest in this project. It's his hope to bankrupt Postelthwaite and in turn win Sacchi for himself. Grant got something on MacGregor and he forces MacGregor to help him in his designs.Without the ornate status symbol garden Postelthwaite may still go bankrupt as he has an ill daughter in Carmen Chaplin and he's paying some heavy duty bills to quack doctors for her care.Some really fine mansion gardens in the UK that are great tourist attractions still serve as the backdrop of a most aesthetically pleasing film. Things don't quite work out for the plotter Grant and the people he uses and the ones he plots against. But that you see the film for.If you understand the concept that in 1699 those ornate gardens were a status symbol than The Serpent's Kiss will make sense to you.".

The other poem The Garden  though too long to quote here could well stand as a model for major themes in the film and there are also some echoes of the Mower poems of Marvell. A minor comment relating to Ewan McGregor's character Chrome is that although he is clearly identified as Dutch reviewers unanimously call him Meneer Chrome as if that is his given name rather than mijnheer Dutch for mister or sir. Finally is is too far fetched to identify the reflexive symbol of the serpent's kiss with the fate of Fitzmaurice who after being essentially the instigator of all the action inadvertently poisons himself.".

The cinematography of the movie is beautiful but there is no valuable plot and the characters have no existence. This is definitely a failure.";

Even though I like to see action I was happy to see Jet in a semiromantic role. The tension and angst between himself Christy Cheung and her rich boyfriend is really nicely done and the romantic scenes are perfect although I REALLY wish Jet had kissed her!.Alot of people also dislike Christy Cheung's character. She is whiny hightempered and spoiled right? Jet's character has invaded her life and totally changed it. She has every right to be angry with him and act like a brat. She doesn't treat other people that way. Her character is sweet friendly and charming when Jet isn't around. Her behavior toward Jet changes when she begins to fall in love with him. And he in turn softens as time goes by.There was also a surprising amount of guns and bullets. Usually Jet is all hands and feet but this time it's more like guns and... more guns. Alot of Jet's got upset about how much gunplay there was but I say variety is the spice of life. You can rent Meltdown or Hero if you want kungfu.Although the picture and sound quality make you think the movie was done in the 50s the film itself is great. There's comedy mystery romance and of course action! Must see for any Jet fan!".

	schema:reviewBody "The first thing you will notice about this Hong Kong version of 'The Bodyguard' is the incredibly awful dubbing. I've seen badly dubbed films before but never anything quite like this. It's so bad in fact that it almost seems like someone hired voice actors that were nothing like the actor that they were dubbing out of spite. Maybe the director or Jet Li annoyed the man in charge of voice actor casting and he thought he'd get his own back. Perhaps the director requested terrible dubbing to give the film a seemingly unintentional comedy element? Whatever the reason the dubbing in this film is poor. Very poor indeed. Incredibly awful dubbing aside and it is awful make no mistake the film does feature some nice moments. The story follows that of a young girl who is one of three witnesses to a murder. The other two have been killed in accidents so the girl's rich boyfriend hires her a bodyguard complete with terrible dubbing to protect her. Naturally the two gradually fall in love as the film progresses. As I said despite it's awful dubbing the film does feature some nice moments. One of which involves an assassin taking out several guards with a bayonet another of which involves an awfully dubbed kid exchanging his pretend gun with a police officer's with hilarious comedy consequences and naturally for a Jet Li film there's Kung Fu and lots of it.The film has a rather profound element of comedy entwined within it's plot. As you know there's an unintentional element which is a result of the undeniably poor dubbing and there's also an intentional element which mostly comes from the little kid and the fat police officer. The cast on display here is nothing to write home about and they're all poorly dubbed too. Jet Li takes the lead role and he does fine but nowhere near as good as he would do eight years later in the sublime 'Ying Xiong'.As I said the dubbing in this movie is awful. Really really bad and it does go some way to spoiling the entire thing. It's so bad that it's almost farcical and at times it's hard to keep a straight face which does the movie no favours in the credibility department. However luckily for Jet Li and co this movie is entertaining enough to just beat the awful dubbing. It's not a great film but it is good and I recommend it to anyone that just wants to be entertained for an hour and a half. Or for anyone that wants to see proof of why subtitles are better than dubbing.".

The film is basically about a bodyguard Jet Li who is hired to protect a beautiful woman Christy Chung after she witnessed a murder.  Now many people will stop at nothing to have her killed and Li has invoked the wrath of a dangerous exsoldier whose brother Li killed.I was surprised by the fact that there was more shootouts and gunplay than Li's usual kung fu but the shootouts were quite thrilling and entertaining particularly the mall sequence that almost gets a bit absurd in the amount of people carrying guns inside.  For a while there due to the amount of gunplay I was expecting ChowYun Fat to just ram through a door and kill all the villains.As for the acting Jet Li is actually quite fun to watch in his transformation from a hardened bodyguard to a soft man falling in love. Christy Chung is decent though she's mostly relegated to the role of damsel in distress.My main complaint about the movie was the how the gunshots looked in the film's final shootout.  When the bullets hit the wall they look more like cartoonish sparks than rough bullet impact.  However the great martial arts fight at the end more than made up for it.  It's a great action sequence as it involves Li and the dangerous exsoldier kicking each other around while trying to get water from a faucet due to a gas leak.".

This one mixes the kind of gunplay familiar from John Woo and Chow YunFat movies with more traditional martial arts mayhem courtesy of Jet Li. The plot is lightweight and slim and the romantic scenes are more annoying than touching but nevertheless this is a film that delivers in the action stakes providing solid reliable fare.Director Corey Yuen is a dab hand at crafting beautiful action sequences and the choreography is topnotch here as usual. There's a massive shootout in a shopping mall at around the halfway mark which doesn't disappoint and an excellent climax using all kinds of props in a gasfilled house that does well to avoid the usual clichs. Some dodgy looking wirework pops up here and there but doesn't spoil the otherwise engaging action. I also liked the hard edge in the fights Li disposes of his enemies in a violent way and yet that violence is never gratuitous or dwelt upon too much.In the titular role Li is as fine as ever still looking as young as he did in THE MASTER and playing the kind of ruthless incorruptible figure that crops up time and again in his career. He's a tour de force in the fight scenes and good in the acting stakes too. Unfortunately Christy Chung is intensely irritating as his ungrateful charge but support from the likes of Kent Cheng CRIME STORY and Collin Chou FLASH POINT help to soften her presence and to be fair she does get less annoying as the film progresses.

This film is fun to watch and manages to produce some surprises despite the formulaic bodyguardandrichbrattygirl plot. The schmaltzy sequence with the song is the only part where the movie drags. However given Yuen's preference for gunplay Jet Li fans are apt to be disappointed since Li has less opportunity to showcase his kung fu skills.

This film is fun to watch and manages to produce some surprises despite the formulaic bodyguardandrichbrattygirl plot. The schmaltzy sequence with the song is the only part where the movie drags. However given Yuen's preference for gunplay Jet Li fans are apt to be disappointed since Li has less opportunity to showcase his kung fu skills. Christy Cheung gets the job done in the damselindistress role and to paraphrase Dorothy Parker she plays the range of emotions from A to B.";

There's also a brief fight and a classic fight scene at the end of the film. The story is also good. But this isn't your usual Jet Li film because it contains less action then any other of his films. But this film is really good to watch for a good story with a action twist. If you like Jet Li you will probably like this film. So go rent this film now!!".

All the characters are great and very likable! plus Jet Li is simply amazing in this!.Jet and Christy Chung had awesome chemistry together and the story is constantly interesting plus it also had a few cool action scenes as well!. The opening is really cool however the ending confused the hell out of me that being said it was still pretty cool and very emotional and as i said the final fight was just fantastic! plus The dubbing wasn't too bad in my opinion!. At 1st i found Christy Chung's character to be selfish and annoying however she soon became likable and the fight choreography was excellent! plus Jet had a really cool character!. Some of the dialog was bad but quite amusing at the same time and i find this film to be quite underrated! plus i though Jet's acting was fantastic!. This is a surprisingly great Jet Li Film i was pleasantly surprised it had a cool story and an awesome fight scene at the end i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good. Corey Yuen and Kazuya Konaka do a very good job here with great camera work awesome angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is great.Jet Li is amazing as always and is amazing here he is very likable intense had a very cool character had awesome chemistry with Christy Chung kicked that ass had some decent dubbing and was especially good at the end! Jet Rules!!!!.Christy Chung is gorgeous and does fine with what she had to do she was a little annoying at 1st but soon became likable and had awesome chemistry with Jet i liked her. Kent Cheng did what he had to do well i liked him lots. Collin Chou is excellent as the main villainhe is a great martial artist and was very menacing i liked him a lot.WingChung Leung did what he had to do well as Ken and was rather likable. WaiKwok Ng is okay as James but didn't have much to do. William Chu is terrible as the kid and was annoying to boot. Rest of the cast do okay. Overall i highly recommend this one!. 12 out of 5".

This is his 1st modern action movie that combines martial arts with gunplay. Jet Li is a bodyguard from mainland China imported to protect a prosecution witness  the gorgeous Christy Cheung from harm. Christy Cheung's character initially does not like the elite bodyguard hired to protect her. As she falls into danger Jet Li keeps her out of harms way she then finds appreciation for Jet Li and his dedication to his job. A bond and mutual attraction grows between them. Kent Cheng appears in this as well as a cop assigned to work with the bodyguard. Kent equally adept at drama and comedy is mostly the comic relief for the film. Corey Yuen did a fine job directing here with keeping the right tone telling the story fluently with the right amount of action and getting good performances from the cast. Corey also is the action choreographer so he is responsible for the quality of the action also which was done well with a healthy dose of guns explosion and kung fu. He also works with Jet Li as action choreographer on all of Jet's US films. Overall TBFB is a solid action flick and when I want to watch a Jet Li movie with guns this is my 2nd choice only to the awesome incredible action classic Black Mask.".

Jet Li wasn't all that well known at the time and this was Miss Chinese International 1992 Christy Chung's first big role  I actually liked the miss Chinese International 92 runner up more than Christy and she would have been perfect for this role . Jet Li's star was on the rise starting around the time this movie was made and he starts getting noticed in the US around this time also. Simon Yam was briefly wooing Christy shortly after this movie was made. Simon of course had many other options as he was one of the most eligible bachelor in Hong Kong.The movie's title is almost verbatim fact as Jet was from China and Christy was from Canada. The unusual mixture of the two culture shows in the mood of these two actors. The plot is also unusual in that an operative from China protects a rich capitalist girl. The movie's background looks more modern than the present day Hong Kong. Hong Kong seems to have slid backwards in culture since its repatriation. This is evident when you see this movie.So this is an interesting movie and the producers at Dimension Film did a really good job of capturing the character of Li and Chung and incorporating them into the story. Jet Li is like an unstoppable terminator in this movie and it correctly highlights his skills and power.This is an excellent movie and is worth a watch if you're a Hong Kong movie fan.".

This has been done with Witches of Eastwick coming out as Erotic Ghost Story Fast Times at Ridgemont High coming out as Yesteryou Yesterme and Yesterday and Die Hard coming out as High Risk. In some cases they come out much better as with High Risk other times they are just ordinary as with Bodyguard from Beijing.A school teacher along with two others witnesses the murder of an accountant. The other two are killed but the police manage to get to the teacher in time and protect her. The teacher's boyfriend is very rich and hires a professional bodyguard from China to protect her. It begins with the woman hating the bodyguard because he is invading her privacy and treating her like a prisoner but this changes after he saves her life she falls in love with him.The interesting thing about this movie is that the bodyguard Jet Lee is not interested in a romance and what makes this movie much better than the American counterpart is that he does not change at the last minute and come an professes his love to her. This is one thing that makes a superb movie and that is consistency of characters. Her character changes namely because he has saved her life in a very obvious way.The Hong Kong tendency to go overboard is not that prevalent in this movie. This is somewhat more American as it tries to have a realistic plot. It is true that the plot is somewhat more realistic than an American movie but it does fall down in scenes such as the shopping mall. There are a couple of characters which make the film interesting and that is Fat Po and Billy. Fat Po is a police officer that is fat and addicted to gambling. Billy is the nephew of the school teacher and these two characters bounce off of each other quite effectively. Fat Po is an incompetent police officer that bumbles through life while Billy is an eager child who wants to look good in front of his peers.This movie is more suspenseful than High Risk. It is not really an action movie though it has some reasonable scenes. Most of this time it is waiting for the enemy to attempt to kill the teacher because she is the witness. There and are some other suspenseful moments and the movie delivers it quite well.Bodyguard from Beijing is a rather average movie but enjoyable if you like the Hong Kong cinema.".

Thus it was a let down.The faucet fighting was interesting and even funny considering this was something totaly unexpected in a Jet Li film for me more on the line of say Jackie Chan.But alas I'd recommend Fist of Legend Tai Chi Master or even the Enforcer over this dissapointment.Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for overall movie score".

Thus it was a let down.The faucet fighting was interesting and even funny considering this was something totaly unexpected in a Jet Li film for me more on the line of say Jackie Chan.But alas I'd recommend Fist of Legend Tai Chi Master or even the Enforcer over this dissapointment.Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for overall movie score";

Jackie Chan had a series of brainless whining silly girlfriends women who made you wish for an overpass to shove them off of. And several chow yun fat movies that i've seen also contained truly lame girlfriends who just made you grind your teeth. Why is this? Is that what's considered attractive over in China? The girl in the Bodyguard goes from whining constantly about Li's attempts to save her life to turning horribly kittenishand still useless after he shoots up a mall killing over a dozen assassins making her see his value. The same could not be said of her as she has no value. The second problem was the ending. Not that I wanted Li's character to end up with bubbleheadfar from it. It made me particularly happy to see that he didn't. What i don't understand is the long shot of him standing in his uniform in front of the Chinese flag while music plays soulfully. What kind of ending is that? Was this movie bankrolled by the Chinese government as a propaganda film? I kept expecting Li to thrust out a forefinger at the audience and say Uncle Mao wants you! Otherwise this was a fairly good film with some excellent fight scenes and a truly interesting bad guy. Worth a watch or two.".

I honestly didn't understand why a girl whose being hunted by the mob went shopping in the mall days before she was about to give evidence. DUMB! Anyway this Chinese Bodyguard type movie took way to long to get going for me and the acting really wasn't that great. There's only one fight throughout the film which isn't that much for a Jet Li movie but there's plenty of running and shooting to try and keep the audience entertained. Personally I think that there was too many annoying characters and I did lose interest after a while. Disappointing!RoundUp I did have high expectations for this movie but I struggled to stay interested. I much prefer Jet Li in the more authentic oriental movies to the Americanized ones because he seems more natural and believable. I still have some more of his movies to go through but so far I am enjoying this genre because it reminds me when I used to watch old Kung Fu movies on videotape. I do prefer the older Jackie Chan movies to some of the Jet Li ones but I still have quite a few of his movies to get through.I recommend this movie to people who are into their Jet Li movies about a bodyguard who has to protect a wealthy man's girlfriend who witnessed a murder and is about to give evidence against the mob. 310".

	schema:reviewBody "Carter Page III Woody Harrelson is effete witty charming full of himself and full of ripe juicy trenchant commentary on the Washington social scene and its denizens. He has to be  it is literally his life. Carter is what's known in Washingtonian parlance as a walker. He squires about the rich and powerful wives of the rich and powerful men on the Hill whenever they require a male escort to attend dinners benefits and other social gatherings. You know  the ones their husbands would rather jump off a building than attend. And because Carter is a bonafied Friend of Dorothy there's none of that pesky bother of having to worry if he'll climb into the wives' beds the way he slips so smoothly into their confidences. But somewhere between the glittering parties and the bonmot laden games of canasta reality bites in the form of a brutal murder the victim being the lover of one of Carter's special friends. Ever the dutiful confidante Carter covers for her without realizing exactly what he's letting himself in for especially when the connections he thought he had begin to dry up and wither like the flowers on a table from a party that ended years ago. Though he literally has spent his life putting the art into artifice Carter must now look beyond the boundaries of his superficiality and that of his socalled friends and acquaintances if he wants to save his own hide. The outsider looking in even if he is part of the world that holds him at arm's length is one of director Paul Schrader's favorite themes one he has visited repeatedly whether he served as a writer TAXI DRIVER a director AUTO FOCUS or both AMERICAN GIGOLO as he does here. As he explores it yet again using the country's seat of power as his landscape he is certainly served well by an outstanding cast. Harrelson's acting has never been as subtle and yet powerful as he inhabits Carter rather than just playing the character. Kristin ScottThomas radiates beauty and desperation as his friendintrouble and the ensemble is wellrounded out by Willem Dafoe as ScottThomas's husband the regal presence of Lauren Bacall Lily Tomlin in a very restrained mode as a power broker's wife Ned Beatty as her husband Mary Beth Hurt as another one of Carter's canasta group and William Hope as an extremely unpleasant Attorney General who is very reminiscent of a certain Mr. Spitzer. Special mention must be made of Moritz Bleibtreu as Emek Carter's GermanIranian boyfriend and the only person who really stands by him when the designer crap hits the fan and has nothing to gain from it but his partner's love. Well there IS the matter of finding a gallery to exhibit his politicallycharged photo art based explicitly on the the Abu Ghraib scandal. But kudos to Bleibtreu for matching Harrelson as they modulate the complexities of their relationship without falling back on the usual stereotypical tics and camp flourishes. With the lush production design and costuming augmented by the ohso fitting songs of Brian Ferry which Anne Dudley's nearly ambient score is based upon THE WALKER is a pretty film to look at and be taken in by...as pretty and alluring as Carter is himself. Until you discover  as he himself does  that underneath all the trappings the wealth the elitist vanity is a void where friendship compassion love fidelity...not a single one of those things really exists. The movie isn't so much about him solving the murder mystery that hangs over him like the Sword of Damocles but the mystery of his own life  finding all of those things he traded in for life among the political elite.Not a light and frivolous way to pass the time much like most Schrader films. In fact many viewers might turn it off before getting halfway through. But the Oscarworthy work from Harrelson is definitely worth sticking around for.".

	onyx:emotionText "Carter Page III Woody Harrelson is effete witty charming full of himself and full of ripe juicy trenchant commentary on the Washington social scene and its denizens. He has to be  it is literally his life. Carter is what's known in Washingtonian parlance as a walker. He squires about the rich and powerful wives of the rich and powerful men on the Hill whenever they require a male escort to attend dinners benefits and other social gatherings. You know  the ones their husbands would rather jump off a building than attend. And because Carter is a bonafied Friend of Dorothy there's none of that pesky bother of having to worry if he'll climb into the wives' beds the way he slips so smoothly into their confidences. But somewhere between the glittering parties and the bonmot laden games of canasta reality bites in the form of a brutal murder the victim being the lover of one of Carter's special friends. Ever the dutiful confidante Carter covers for her without realizing exactly what he's letting himself in for especially when the connections he thought he had begin to dry up and wither like the flowers on a table from a party that ended years ago. Though he literally has spent his life putting the art into artifice Carter must now look beyond the boundaries of his superficiality and that of his socalled friends and acquaintances if he wants to save his own hide. The outsider looking in even if he is part of the world that holds him at arm's length is one of director Paul Schrader's favorite themes one he has visited repeatedly whether he served as a writer TAXI DRIVER a director AUTO FOCUS or both AMERICAN GIGOLO as he does here. As he explores it yet again using the country's seat of power as his landscape he is certainly served well by an outstanding cast. Harrelson's acting has never been as subtle and yet powerful as he inhabits Carter rather than just playing the character. Kristin ScottThomas radiates beauty and desperation as his friendintrouble and the ensemble is wellrounded out by Willem Dafoe as ScottThomas's husband the regal presence of Lauren Bacall Lily Tomlin in a very restrained mode as a power broker's wife Ned Beatty as her husband Mary Beth Hurt as another one of Carter's canasta group and William Hope as an extremely unpleasant Attorney General who is very reminiscent of a certain Mr. Spitzer. Special mention must be made of Moritz Bleibtreu as Emek Carter's GermanIranian boyfriend and the only person who really stands by him when the designer crap hits the fan and has nothing to gain from it but his partner's love. Well there IS the matter of finding a gallery to exhibit his politicallycharged photo art based explicitly on the the Abu Ghraib scandal. But kudos to Bleibtreu for matching Harrelson as they modulate the complexities of their relationship without falling back on the usual stereotypical tics and camp flourishes. With the lush production design and costuming augmented by the ohso fitting songs of Brian Ferry which Anne Dudley's nearly ambient score is based upon THE WALKER is a pretty film to look at and be taken in by...as pretty and alluring as Carter is himself. Until you discover  as he himself does  that underneath all the trappings the wealth the elitist vanity is a void where friendship compassion love fidelity...not a single one of those things really exists. The movie isn't so much about him solving the murder mystery that hangs over him like the Sword of Damocles but the mystery of his own life  finding all of those things he traded in for life among the political elite.Not a light and frivolous way to pass the time much like most Schrader films. In fact many viewers might turn it off before getting halfway through. But the Oscarworthy work from Harrelson is definitely worth sticking around for.";

	schema:reviewBody "THE WALKER defined as a man who escorts rich ladies around town in their leisure is both a pungent political comment and a fine mystery from Paul Schrader who both wrote and directed this smart film and had the good fortune to surround his tale with a fine cast of actors. It may not be a film for everyone but it will satisfy viewers who tire of superficial fluff films allowing time to ponder the way we live and converse today. Carter Page III Woody Harelson in one of his finest performances is an openly gay well heeled dapper man about town who devotes his life to pleasing the wealthy wives of men in high government levels in Washington DC. Together with Abby Lily Tomlin Natalie Lauren Bacall Chrissy Mary Beth Hurt and Lynn Kristin Scott Thomas the group gossips plays canasta in an expensive hotel parlor and confides secrets that are surefire rumor fodder. Lynn is escorted by Carter to her lover's home for a tryst only to find the lover murdered. Carter attempts to protect Lynn from scandal only to become implicated himself. Carter discovers secrets about his own insecurities and while he is solidly supported by his lover Emek the excellent Moritz Bleibtreu an artist of strange works that prove subtle background connotations of the mystery that is unwinding he must face the realities of his decision when confronting husbands lawyers police and intelligence agents portrayed by such fine actors as Ned Beatty Willem Defoe William Hope and Geff Francis. The story is in many ways an examination of the corruption in Washington DC  a fact that may explain why it did not enjoy a long theater run. For viewers who appreciate fine dialogue and a smart story with welldelineated characters portrayed by superb actors this is a film that should not be neglected. Grady Harp".

The first half of The Walker could be said to demonstrate such a principle particularly the mien of its chief protagonist Carter Page III flawlessly played by Woody Harrelson. Yet the second half would give that observation an altogether more cynical meaning. One appropriate to the very men that Page despises.Page exhibits the exquisite superficiality I'm not nave I'm superficial so often associated with camp intellectuals as well as a capacity for selfadulation. We first meet him during an opening panning shot that examines the luxurious wall fabrics in the room where several voices can be heard. Wall furnishings are something that Page III can associate with. Both in a literal aesthetic sense and also as a man that is walled in by the societal prejudices against his homosexuality. One step removed from the visceral world of those who can openly admit their true feelings Page III examines the details of everyday life with dispassion and critical elegance. But when his friend Lynn Lockner wife of a liberal senator discovers a murder he is torn between two paths both equally morally repugnant.While not quite a saint Page III has a much higher sense of decency than the political connivers and sexually bigoted people that surround him. These people use superficial appearances to make money win office or rise at any cost. Their 'wisdom' is simply that of the top dog  having torn and bloodied anyone who stood in their way.Bacall instantly recognisable by her charismatic voice is the perfect foil for Page's charm and mendacity. Quickwitted she reminds us of her early characters in films like To Have and Have Not and Key Largo. You were just a young slip of a girl not the beautiful woman you are now says Page. Cut the sht! she replies without for a minute losing her majestic gravitas.Page is a 'Walker'  although working one day a week in a real estate office his main income is comes from when he walks rich women from place to place. The term was coined for Jerry Zipkin who was Nancy Reagan's 'walker'. His duties include amusing gossip taking Lynn to the opera and a weekly game of canasta. Immaculately dressed and coiffured he inhabits the world of the unostentatiously rich without ever becoming a main player. His father was a respected governor and his father before him a successful businessman My grandfather always talked like a man with a bible halfopen in his head.. He is gay and therefore not a threat. And he is wellread wellbred and a delightful conversationalist.Yet although Harrelson stars in every scene The Walker succeeds very much as an ensemble piece. Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas have a fair share of excellent lines. Memory is a very unreliable organ says Bacall It's right up there with the penis. Kristin Scott Thomas also gives Page a fair run for his money. When he says dismissively in a conversation that it's just sex she retorts with And that stuff you're breathing is just oxygen! Page has an unlikely lover in the form of Emek Yoglu a GermanTurkish artist whose photography is too politically loaded for Page's tastes. But the main man in Page's life is his dead father who symbolises both the success Page III has never achieved and perhaps moral doublestandards that he loathes. Yet at the same time Page himself leads a life a doublelife not out of choice but because it is forced on him.Writerdirector Paul Schrader picked Washington DC as the setting for the film because of the deep hypocrisy of the town Washington and Salt lake City are two of the last cities in America where sexual hypocrisy is mandated and here is a character living a false and superficial life so it seemed an ideal place for it. It is one of Schrader's best scripts apart from a few unlikely coincidences to move the plot along and the performances are perfect. The lush cinematography sucks us into the world of the rich and stylish with Bryan Ferry songs to assure us it's OK so that 'reality'  in the form of murder most foul  is all the more unsettling. Only as the authorities brazenly attempt to implicate Page do some of his hairs come out of place. This is a mean crowd this administration he admits falteringly. Lynn calls them 'the cave dwellers'. They can't catch him for what he hasn't done so they'll find something else. It's perjury that catches people out the investigator says to him with shades of Clinton witchhunting.The lonerwhoseworldcrumblesaround him is a favourite premise for Schrader and the subtle political complexities are home territory for Harrelson who is no stranger to such themes in films such as North Country Wag the Dog Welcome to Sarajevo and The People vs. Larry Flynt. But the film's weakness is its constant subtlety. We are expected to be fascinated by the undercurrents the hidden cards  so much so that some audiences may switch off. The Walker is clever and perfectly executed but like its subject matter is a superficial observer of the dilemmas it grapples with at arm's length.Perhaps such prominence of aesthetics over substance is the way to provoke discussion of the problems dealt with so obtusely. I think film is a great medium to be able to discuss such issues says Kristin Scott Thomas. Although politics changes very rapidly it also repeats itself over and over in a different context. When you see films that are making a comment about the political situation of a certain time and then you see another film thirty years later and you have the same kind of issue it creates discussion and that is very important.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE WALKER is an extremely biting well written dark suspense thriller by Paul Schrader with a knock out cast of actors that blend right into their nasty characters with humor and a killing sense of themselves and their self worth. As one character points out it's always about the money and in THE WALKER I would say that it is ALWAYS about POWER and the perception of what people think of you and the power you hold.Woody Harrelson is simply terrific in his role of Walker and you are reminded of Truman Capote and the attention he gave to society women to propel his importance of being a gossip monger. The film also brings to the surface the superficiality of nail a star be a star and the underlying elements of what it takes to make it in Washington politics.

There was a projection problem midway into the film caused by a bad splice. An intermission was announced to give the technical team sufficient time to resplice the film.During this intermission which ended up stretching to nearly 45 minutes Mr. Schrader and Ms. Bacall took the stage and entertained the audience with a farranging and candid Q  A session. This was a very generous and gracious gesture and very much appreciated.It was a real treat to see Ms. Bacall in this film and at the premiere. She is a legend many times over and 60 years into her storied career she continues to exude class strength and glamour. They don't make stars like this anymore and we are the poorer for it.".

Why not just let it go and try to find some film which they like and say something good about it? I'm an avid moviegoer and collector as I have some 30000 titles in my library and I see hundreds of new films every year. The Walker didn't play in a theatre near me so I had to wait for the DVD to be released. I enjoyed it so much I had to sit through it a second time immediately. It's so rare to find a movie written by an adult for adults with an all adult cast. It's been years since I've been so entertained as I was with the dialogue and the cast all in one movie. So often in IMDb teens will review a movie which they would never understand even it they HAD been educated and write sordid remarks of how boring a movie is...or 'the worst movie I've ever seen...'. Too bad that the editors at IMDb can't cull out these remarks when all the teens are doing is destroying a work of art. I would bet none have ever been to a symphony concert an opera a ballet a live drama but they're quick on the draw when it comes to criticizing something without car chases or cheap gag lines.IF you are a person who likes GOOD movies do yourself a favor and see The Walker. It's Woody's best performance...and MAN! What a treat to see Lauren Bacall still strut her stuff. She may be an octogenarian but she can STILL act. Lily Tomlin was equally as wonderful. I won't single out all the actors just those three performances are enough to rent or buy the DVD.".

	schema:headline " Meditation upon the true meaning of loyalty";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fascinating film which seems to be something other than what it is. It is absolutely not a thriller although many people might be confused and believe it was meant to be one. In the film a great deal of corruption murder and intrigue is portrayed at the top of the political hierarchy in Washington D.C. But that is merely the setting and milieu for a wholly different story. The film is really about the true meaning of loyalty and hence it is a disguised morality tale. The lead character played by Woody Harrelson is an elegant homosexual who escorts wives of leading politicians to social events what is called 'a walker'. In the course of doing this he accidentally becomes involved in a serious scandal involving murder and ruthless intrigue which has no connection with him at all. The character whom Harrelson portrays is called Carter Page III whose grandfather and father of the same name had been famous Washington politicians from the South. His father had been a 'hero of the Watergate hearings' and is clearly modelled on the late Senator Sam Ervin Junior of North Carolina. Page 'the Walker' thus has access to all the top social circles of Washington but is looked upon with a certain amount of scorn because he is viewed as such a decline from the fame of his forebears. It is only as the film evolves that Page reluctantly reveals that in fact his father and grandfather had both been crooks and were not heroes at all and that he feels bad about his heritage the endless praise for which he has to sit and listen to silently while keeping his own views to himself. He is very camp and people don't really take him seriously as a person considering him a hopeless lightweight. He even says of himself 'I am superficial'. But this film is a study of what lies beneath the illusory surface of a supposedly superficial man. It is only in the last two minutes of the film that the full truth is revealed and the film has its sad and pensive ending where the meaning of the film really becomes clear. Harrelson depicts an unforgettable character 'a man in full'. His Southern accent is as thick as heavy cream. He has to a certain extent modelled himself on Marlon Brando in 'Streetcar' and 'The Fugitive Kind' not always successfully but it is a great effort and largely works with the elegance cufflinks and finicky mannerisms of a dandy added very successfully on top. Paul Schrader's script is wonderfully subtle and wellcrafted but he is a much better writer than he is a director and his shots are badly framed which indicates that his cinematographer did not make up for his deficiencies at all. The sound is also inadequate but then that is a common problem these days with Hollywood films where all the good sound men seem to be dead. One problem with the direction is that Schrader was too close to the material. He could not stand back from it and see where a bit more clarity was needed for the sake of a possibly baffled viewer and instead he worked to increase rather than to diminish the sometimes excessive subtlety of this tale. In other words it could and should have been a better film than it is. Harrelson needed a bit of toning down in some scenes. After all he was way out on a limb in his performance and although he didn't fall off a branch he trembled amongst the leaves sometimes and could have done with some more help. Kristin ScottThomas's performance is impeccable but when has one of her performances not been? Has anyone ever seen her do anything less than perfect on screen? I haven't. She isn't afraid to let herself look really terrible haggard and wobbly in a harsh light if it helps the story. This film is about Harrelson showing the ultimate loyalty the last man you would think capable of it as an act of personal redemption. The end of the film is so perfectly performed and directed that one forgives the film any previous imperfections it may have had. It was worth waiting for. But what a sad and devastating realisation comes then so impeccably presented. I cannot reveal what it is but it is the whole point. The way Carter Page III comes out of it all as a hero reminds me of the husband in 'Brick Lane' sometimes the most unlikely people outshine everyone else in the most unexpected way when you see the true depths of their character. Schrader's perceptions in this story are immensely sensitive. This was an extraordinarily ambitious undertaking and although the result is not perfect so that the film is not a classic Schrader and his actors all came close and can be justly proud of what they achieved. After all it is not easy to make films about what is not spoken and what is not seen. Most people don't bother. So please keep it up y'all.".

On the one hand it guarantees that The Walker doesn't end up as a total flop. Throughout the movie I felt there is a man behind the camera that knows which buttons to push when and there were some shots or short scenes I found really great. But on the other hand this routine makes the whole movie seem a bit dated. The Walker maybe would have had more relevance if made a few centuries earlier. But today a film that explicitly wants to be political but has nothing more to say than some often heard phrases or unmotivated side blows on targets like George Bush where everybody will agree anyway has to be considered a failure. What is just great about this movie however is Woody Harrelson. When he started talking I often thought I'm sitting in one of Schrader's great movies. The Walker is only okay.".

And his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process. The worst though is Woody Harrelson whom I ordinarily like when he's properly cast. He plays the walker a homosexual man in D.C. who plays social companion to the bored wives of the Washington elite. He couldn't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. His southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers as though the heat and humidity of the South is still draining him of every ounce of energy. It is monotonous. But his is not the worst accent in the movie. His boyfriend played by Moritz Bleibtreau attempts to affect some kind of a Mid East accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him. He is incapable of rolling his r's in spite of the fact that in real life he is German and speaks several languages  one of them being Italian! That's kind of a good reason to cast someone else don't ya think? From the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end. The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses Lily Tomlin Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact. In fact all three are excellent in spite of being trapped in a really bad film. Ufortunately no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws. If you like these three actresses watch them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.".

The movie is suspenseful but not because of artifice because of the corner that the Woody Harrelson character finds himself in and how that triggers a stirring of is own moral code. I love that about this movie how the plot is strong on it's own terms but that we get this added layer with the character study.

Carter's father was a powerful congressman for whom  even after his death  Carter harbors hate and resentment. Carter's father disliked and chided him for his sexuality and aimless existence. In DC society Carter is reminded almost daily of his father's reputation as a respected congressman. His confidential reply to friends is that his father left congress many times richer than when he entered and honor had nothing to do with that reality.Carter has an on and off relationship with a struggling artist but is not willing to give up his glamorous life as a walker in order to commit to a longterm bond with the other man.One of the favors he performs for the wife of Larry Lockner the minority leader of the Senate is to drive her to assignations with her lobbyist lover. On one of these occasions Lynn returns to the car in a state of shock having found her lover murdered. She begs Carter not to call the police and to drive her home. Carter does so and then returns to the apartment of the murdered man calls the police and says that it was he who discovered the body.Carter immediately falls under suspicion and spends the rest of the film in an attempt to unravel the truth of the murder. During that time he is basically forsaken by all of his friends in the DC scene with his lover Emek being his only true support.Twentyeight years ago Paul Schrader directed American Gigolo. This film calls up many of the elements of that earlier success. It is a beautifully worked tale of an outsider sought out by insiders who finds himself in a situation where support is needed but none comes from those who are able to exercise to greatest amount of power. We are privy to the private life of the man  one that he never exposes to the outside world. And we find that this man who is supposedly immoral  or at least amoral  is the most moral of them all.The Walker is filled with wellknown stars starting with Woody Harrelson in the leading role. I was somewhat put off by his heavy Southern Virginia accent but in retrospect such an affected way of speech might be actually observed in such a man  think of Truman Capote. In any case Harrelson gives a wonderfully restrained performance far different from most of his characters. He enables you to understand and care for Carter.Lauren Bacall is always a treat to watch and she gives this film a wonderful Washington grande dame who is so wise to the ways of all yet not totally immune to the forces of the tides of opinion.Carter's friend Lynn is played by Kristin Scott Thomas and her character is probably the most complex in the film. She surely is an actress who can portray such a character with great insight.Add Lily Tomlin as another DC socialite Ned Beatty as her powerful businessman husband and Willem Dafoe as Lynn's ruthless politician husband and you can hardly go wrong with the spate of great performances.The Walker has numerous references to the evilness and deceit of the current administration but gives all politics politicians and their supporters their honest due. It entertains and causes you to think. For what more could you ask?".

A whole whack of unexplained CGI deer. One wonders if they couldn't find horses to continue the story from the first movie so they figured fake deer was the way to go for part 2. And just to try to make it seem like it wasn't 100 lame and irrelevant they toss in antlers at the Morgan homestead. Oh well then it all makes sense now. Or not.Did anyone even listen to what Samara's birth mother said? She tried to kill her baby cuz the kid told her to in her head. Just like Rachel's son told her to in her head. To get rid of the thing inside her. So the thing in Aiden isn't even Samara it's just some damn nameless thing the writer's never explain beyond a casual line about some watery world beyond that possessed Samara as a baby. OK....whatever...Samara wants a mommy. You know what I want? Some friggin Vicodine to slip me into a drug induced coma so I can wipe the memory of that lame as lame plot contrivance out of my head. But wait it gets worse... she wants to watch TV with her mom. That's about it.Excuse me I need to go yank some of my hair out.This thing from some nether world that can make things happen with the power of its mind gets killed in a well comes back from the dead through VHS tapes and murders people within 7 days of witnessing said tapes then inexplicably possesses a living boy.....cuz she wants to watch TV with her mom? Who the hell wrote that? What drooling mittenspinnedtohiscoat ScoobyDoolunchboxcarrying lazyeyed fatnecked Lysolhuffing icecreamsmearedonhisface laughing at the antics of Uncle Joey on Full House idiot wrote that? That is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen in my life.Does she want to kill millions? Does she want to inflict suffering on mankind? Eat the living? Make a race of obedient slaves? Reign in darkness? No she wants to watch friggin cartoons from the 50's and eat sammiches with ma on the sofa. The mind reels at the absolute idiocy.So to reiterate this movie sucks. Do yourself a favour and stay away. If you hated the first one this one will make you wish you were stricken blind by burning embers before you put the DVD in. If you liked the first one this will make you mourn for a half decent story and a film that doesn't induce bile production. And if you saw this one and liked it we clearly can't be friends. I'm sorry I'm sure you're a nice person though.".

But wait it gets worse... she wants to watch TV with her mom. That's about it.Excuse me I need to go yank some of my hair out.This thing from some nether world that can make things happen with the power of its mind gets killed in a well comes back from the dead through VHS tapes and murders people within 7 days of witnessing said tapes then inexplicably possesses a living boy.....cuz she wants to watch TV with her mom? Who the hell wrote that? What drooling mittenspinnedtohiscoat ScoobyDoolunchboxcarrying lazyeyed fatnecked Lysolhuffing icecreamsmearedonhisface laughing at the antics of Uncle Joey on Full House idiot wrote that? That is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen in my life.Does she want to kill millions? Does she want to inflict suffering on mankind? Eat the living? Make a race of obedient slaves? Reign in darkness? No she wants to watch friggin cartoons from the 50's and eat sammiches with ma on the sofa. The mind reels at the absolute idiocy.So to reiterate this movie sucks. Do yourself a favour and stay away. If you hated the first one this one will make you wish you were stricken blind by burning embers before you put the DVD in. If you liked the first one this will make you mourn for a half decent story and a film that doesn't induce bile production. And if you saw this one and liked it we clearly can't be friends. I'm sorry I'm sure you're a nice person though.";

Yes the original Japanese director returns and he conveys the images and symbolism very well but he does not provide anything engaging here. The two movies do not seem to necessarily connect. It's almost as if they remade the first Ring with a few additions. There is not a lot of new material presented here. The movie tries to scare us by using either the same or similar events from the first. The ominous music playing throughout the film and the fact that this sequel was made so nonsensically are scarier than the movie itself. There are too many things that occur that you just have to accept without explanation. And then after the movie's done you'll be left with plenty of questions including how the first one relates to this one. I cannot place some of those questions here without spoiling anything so I'll leave that up to you. Okay let's move away from the negative and talk about the few positives this film has. The acting is much better than the average horror film and as stated before the images are presented very well. The visuals are nice and you come to slightly care about some of the characters although most of them do ridiculous things. Other than that I cannot think of much else to say that is good. This movie was just disappointing. Do not watch this with high expectations unless you are easily scared and jump at the sudden music and scenes. The first Ring was good. It was different and wellmade. I did not find it particularly scary but bizarre. This just relies on music and jump surprises. Fear doesn't even come half circle in this film. If you liked the first Ring and expect to see much more about the story you may be disappointed as well. But if you only want to see a different version of part one then you may enjoy this sequel. Good luck  4.810 Stars".

An opening scene in a horror film scares the audience to leave them scared the entire film. The Ring accomplished this. The Ring Two did not. Sitting there with my hands clamped together and my knuckles probably turning white I prepared to crap my pants at the opening scene. But two minutes into the scene I began to relax myself because to tell you the truth a five year old wouldn't have found that scary. A five year old with a bladder problem wouldn't even have wet themselves.This film was supposed to take place six months after the other film right? Well super idea because Aidan obviously LOOKS older. And I don't mean six months older. I'm talking and obvious change from eight years old when the first movie was shot to an eleven year old when the second movie was shot. Nice going. Give it another six months and they'll be trying to make him a nine year old. With a beard.Simon Baker. Ah Simon Baker. Watching Guardian so many times got me hooked on this man. So I was relieved to see him in this film. However twodimensional characters with less than 20 words in a film don't get me that excited. As much as Simon Baker is a good actor he was wasted in this film. He wasn't even developed into a love interest or anything remotely interesting for the audience. He was just ... there. And you always know that you are outside of a major city when people are wearing checked shirts. Baker used these to the extreme. Very cosmopolitan.Let us move on to the faces of the dead which look a lot like my face when I realize I have an assignment due tomorrow. You know all scrunched up with my tongue sticking out and veins all over my face. A small group of people in the theater erupted into laughter when seeing the faces of those who had been killed by Samara. And you had to laugh. They were nothing compared to the first movie which struck fear in our hearts matched with piercing music.I also found there was a lot of grabbing in this movie. Samara grabbing Rachel in the ambulance Samara grabbing Aidan in the bathtub Samara grabbing Rachel through the T.V Samara grabbing Aidan through the T.V Samara grabbing Rachel in the Hospital... I had no idea that grabbing people was the new scare tactic. And let me tell you if you go into this film with an intense fear of grabbing you shouldn't see The Ring Two. You might suffer a severe heart attack.Sissy Spacek. What a relief to see her name in the opening credits. What a displacement of that relief when we see her character playing a crazy ass woman with frizzy hair in her face stuttering and saying things that do not make sense. I have always been captivated by her Michael Jacksonlike nose and that nose kept me entertained for that entire scene.This movie was highly predictable. By this time my ass is hurting and I wish I had my watch on so I could see how long I had to sit through this fear fest. The story wasn't too bad. The acting wasn't too bad. The script did no justice to The Ring films. But if you want to see a movie that will make you jump up just a little then go for it and enjoy it for what it is. A movie assaulting checked shirts and screwed up faces.".

I have to agree it doesn't match expectations that the original made us hope for but still it is a well made movie. 'The Ring' and 'The Sixth Sense' were the movies which played a huge part in making me a fan of the horror genre. The first film and The Sixth Sense gave me sleepless nights for weeks because of the way they were brilliantly executed and it may also have something to do with my being a teen when The Ring films released. Hideo Nakata took over this film from Gore Verbinski and that is where the treatment of the film changed quite a bit. He goes for a lot more gore and cgi effects than an actual story it lost its spark there.Six months after the incidents involving the lethal videotape Rachel Keller Naomi Watts wants to move away from the city into a quiet town with her son Samara Morgan Daveigh Chase after the horrible deaths of her boyfriend and niece and start over again. She had freed Samara from her earthly prison and now she is free to terrorize anyway she wants and doesn't have the restrictions that the previous film rules set. Now Samara wants Aidan Keller's David Dorfman body so she could live normally again. She does all she can to get hold of his body without alerting Rachel. She even comes out of televisions to get hold of her victims. She is more evil than ever and it is upto Rachel to put an to all this mayhem.This movie is overloaded with cgi effects in scenes that is not exactly needed. Samara possesses hundreds of deers and stags in a forest. What's up with that? She couldn't control an animal in the last film. If so she could have controlled the horses. But the horses killed themselves due to her evilness. And the water is replaced by a black emf emission I think. That was more cheesy than scary because of so many effects. David Dorfman is not so creepy as Aidan in this film. In the first film I was convinced he was the ghost. He creeped me out in the first one. This time around he gave an alright performance and didn't scare me at all as he seemed more humane in this. My sympathetic view on Samara's plight was overcome with disgust in this one. Why does she want only Aidan? She could have any kid she wanted. And shouldn't she be thankful to Rachel for releasing her from her hellhole and go to heaven or something? I was very sad that Naomi Watts accepted this film her story is not so good in this film. Still she gave a good performance. I still give this film a 7 rating because it creeped me out the first two times I saw it.710".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a horror fan at all but got invited to this screening and decided to go see what all the hoopla was about. What I got was an interesting piece which I might sooner qualify as a supernatural thriller than a horror movie but I guess that's what Jhorror movies are. Sure it's quite gross in a couple of places and there are a few heartstopping moments as well but what really impressed me was that the entire movie from the first minute to the last is filled with this weird kind of suspenseful energy. Even when literally nothing particularly frightening in itself is going on it still feels off it's still unsettling uncomfortable on edge. And that for me was the strength of this movie. Not having seen Hideo Nakata's previous Ringu movies I was pleasantly surprised to find out that he seems to be a master of creating an atmosphere scarier than any specialeffect driven sequence could. All the actors did a good job as well  and Sissy Spacek's cameo was a nice touch  though I would have liked to have seen a bit more background to the MaxRachel relationship. All in all I predict a good show at the boxoffice for this one!".

	schema:headline " A letdown after The Ring and Rings but still worth seeing";
	schema:reviewBody "Series note It is imperative that you watch The Ring 2002 and preferably also the short film Rings 2005 before you watch this movie. The Ring Two is constructed as a further chapter in a novel. It will make much less sense and have far less significance if you do not watch the other films first.Set an unspecified but relatively short period of time after the events of The Ring Rachel Keller Naomi Watts has now moved from Seattle Washington to Astoria Oregon with her son Aidan David Dorfman. They're hoping the move to smalltown life will help them emotionally recover from the horrific curse they experiencednamely that watching a particular videotape associated with a strange little girl named Samara Daveigh ChaseKelly Stables would result in one's death if one didn't make a copy and show it to someone else within a week. But when Rachel now a reporter at a small Astoria newspaper overhears a report of a disturbingly familiar death on the police scanner she investigates and discovers that the Ring has followed her to Oregon. Apparently the videotape they made at the end of the first film to keep themselves alive wasn't the only one to be made. Rachel burns the tape she finds at the crime scene but does that bring about a new kind of curse? While this is a decent film it unfortunately does not come near the excellence of The Ring Rings or even the original Japanese film Ringu 1998. I was geared up to love The Ring Two. I think The Ring directed by Gore Verbinski is superior to the Japanese original and the short film Rings cowritten by The Ring Two scripter Ehren Kruger was just as good if different taking the story into an exciting new direction as suggested by the last few pages of Kji Suzuki's Ring novel that was prime fodder for social commentary in our Internet Age.But unfortunately Kruger didn't continue the same idea past this film's prologue. It's difficult not to believe that maybe the flaws in The Ring Two are the result of Hideo Nakata being in the driver's seat as the same blemishes also crept up in Ringu and especially Ringu 2 1999 both of which he also directed. The problem is that The Ring Two spends far too much of its time in a slow straightforward drama mode to the detriment of its horror aspects so that they often seem incoherent and tacked on. It seems like maybe deep down Nakata really wants to be doing realist drama instead.As realist drama there are a number of interesting things going on here. Watts and Dorfman both turn in impressive performanceswe wouldn't expect anything less from Wattsin a story that is more of a contemplative meditation on dysfunctional motherchild relationships. For much of the film the childrenAidan and Samara go from being the villains to being more like victims. The mothers and the system are portrayed more as villains. In the sequence prior to the climax our focus changes to cultural institutions and people upholding the norms within them as the antagonists. It's a weird but slightly effective shift that makes The Ring Two feel more like a paranoid conspiracy theory film for a moment. But the climax returns to Samara and reinterprets the curse as a symptom of the dysfunctional familial relationships that are the focus of the film.It's not that the kids don't do bad things with Aidan mostly as a channel for Samara in a more literal symbolic parallel between Samara and her mom and AidanRachel perhaps suggested by occasional interpretations of The Ring as eventually being about Samara trying to reincarnate herself as Aidan. On a surface level you can still read the film as an evil kid flick but the kids are doing bad things because they're seeking healthy parentchild relationships. It was weird in The Ring that Aidan kept calling Watts' character Rachel instead of Mommy but it remained unanalyzed. Here it is made an issue and eventually becomes a hinge for resolving the climax. The focus on parentchild relationships also suggests an odd reinterpretation of The Ring retroactively putting more of an emphasis on Rachel's neglect of Aidan while she was pursuing the mystery of the curse as well as the odd distancing suggested in scenes such as her conversation with Aidan's teacher.When Nakata does bother with more straightforward horror material it is usually rewardingly subtle and surreal aided greatly by special effects maven Peter Chesney. A number of sequences stand outsuch as the gravitydefying water the deer attack and the scene in the well which was strongly reminiscent of Nakata's Ringu 2. But again they do not have quite the impact they should because of the surrounding material. The rest of the technical elementscinematography production design score etc.are competent but The Ring two does not have nearly the stylistic panache of The Ring or Rings.The film is an odd amalgamation of genres. The emphasis on realist drama may be offputting to many horror fans. The horror and weird supernatural stuff may be offputting to many more mainstream film fans. In the end the people who will probably like The Ring Two the most are those who were very fond of Ringu 2 and Ringu 0 Basudei 2000. Although I enjoy both they're closer to average than great to me. If another American Ring film is made I'd like to see the story of the Rings short continued instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have always believed that the horror genre is the most difficult to master. To make an effective horror film takes an amalgamation of talent luck and one intangible that most cannot figure out. To me you have to love the genre and you have to have little studio interference. Films like Halloween Last House on the Left Evil Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre were all low budget and independent films and all were pioneers of the genre. All were also emancipated from any studio intervention which more often than not can destroy a director's vision. I would think that somewhere in Urban Legend and The Haunting's vernacular was a good film until the morons who knew nothing about film got a hold of it.I mention all of this as a precursor to the review because The Ring was a modern day miracle. It was the scariest horror film in twenty years and it was a studio project. I honestly never thought that a film made by Dreamworks would touch a nerve in the way it did. But with direction by Gore Verbinski and Ehren Krueger writing one of the best scripts I've ever been privy to The Ring scared the hell out of me.To do a follow up was almost a no win situation. Not since Nightmare on Elm Street 2 has there been a more disappointing sequel than this one. I don't know where to lay the blame because Ehren Krueger whom I respect very much returned to pen the sequel and you have the director of the Japanese film that started it all helming this one. So where does the blame fall? Was it the studio who interfered too vehemently? Was it that the Japanese original was that inferior to the Dreamworks version? Or is it just that lightning doesn't strike twice in most films? I'm not sure what the answer is to that perplexing question all I know is that this is about as much of a true dichotomy from the first. You can't get any further apart.Naomi Watts is adequate as Rachael and David Dorfman is passable as Aidan but the continuation of Samara story is perhaps the weak link here. In the original she was an enigma. Her story was such a mystery that it kept you guessing as to what she was and where she came from. There was a blend of The Changeling and a bit of The Shining all rolled into one. A sequel succeeds when it extends the story not just retells it. There was no continuation of the story here. No one bothered to explain why Samara can come through the TV and petrify you to death. No one bothered to explain why she is still haunting people through videocassettes. No one bothered to explain anything. Now maybe some are okay with that. Maybe a mystery should remain a mystery. But if you can get past the regression of the story then what is even more disturbing is that there is nothing remotely disturbing interesting or scary about the film and everything that was freaky about Samara in the first one is now like watching Scooby Doo and mystery of Samara. There is no fear of her now. There is nothing remotely disturbing about her. Maybe I was expecting too much but this film is one of the weakest sequels I have ever seen. If they decide to make a third they had better go back to their roots and get Verbinski back. Is it wrong to expect this much from a sequel? Maybe. But then again there are sequels that can match the original if not surpass it. At least two of the Friday the 13th sequels surpass the original and if you are talking non horror then you can also add films like Lethal Weapon 2 Bourne Supremacy and of course classics like Terminator 2 Aliens Godfather II and Empire Strikes Back to the list of sequels that either equaled or surpassed the original. Now in my opinion Nakata is not on the same level as Cameron Lucas or even Copolla so there is no reason to believe that he can create a better film that Verbinski did. But suffice to say that everything that made the first such a paradigm for years to come has vanished in this one. It is truly unfortunate as it feels like too many politicians in this one threw their hat into the ring and tried to make changes that did nothing but give us another Nightmare on Elm Street 2. And that is a shame.210".

Now in my opinion Nakata is not on the same level as Cameron Lucas or even Copolla so there is no reason to believe that he can create a better film that Verbinski did. But suffice to say that everything that made the first such a paradigm for years to come has vanished in this one. It is truly unfortunate as it feels like too many politicians in this one threw their hat into the ring and tried to make changes that did nothing but give us another Nightmare on Elm Street 2. And that is a shame.210";

I found myself being bored more than anything else and waiting for the next scary scene to shake me awake. The special effects were pretty good and all the cast members did a really good job with their roles but despite their abilities the movie failed to make an impression half as good as the original. There are several points in this movie when you feel like you begin to catch on to something that will eventually make sense and make it worth your money only to be let down at the conclusion of the scene.

Despite she was only months old she had managed to transpire her Mom to kill her so as to save her from being possessed.Failing this the Mom was institutionalized and the baby grew up. She was adopted but despite all her supernatural powers she had allowed her step mom to drown her in a well.She is now a ghost or whatever. She made a funny tape and whoever saw it will receive a phone call stating they will die within 7 days. From experience mankind know if they pass the tape onto others the curse will be passed onto them too. Otherwise Samara will climb out from their TV sets and scare them to hell.At times and just for fun she drove crazy some deers and sometimes horses.Occasionally Samara did some direct killings bypassing all these red tapes example Max and Dr. temple.But the police didn't even bother chasing up Temple's death at Aidan's house probably because mysterious death was no news in those days.Now Samara wanted to return to life through Aidan because she fancied watching cartoons with a beautiful Mom.Despite all her powers Samara still got tricked by Aidan and Rachel and she got out of Aidan's body. She could have easily got in again but she had chosen to drag Rachel into her well.Unfortunately Samara hadn't practiced wellclimbing lately because she has been busily climbing in and out of TV sets otherwise she could have stopped Rachel from closing the well entrance. After all this shouldn't bother Samara who could get through walls doors and TV sets.Having solved all the problems Rachel was so relieved that she decided to commit suicide. She jumped over the cliff but found herself suddenly in bed with Aidan who actually looks creepier than Samara.Dear viewers if you are still with me at this moment you are quite qualified to see this ridiculously ridiculous movie!".

Of course its predecessor the Ring.The Ring Two is of course the sequel to The Ring. To refresh your memory The Ring was genius. The creepy video tape. The mysterious deaths. The deep history of Samara and her family. And of course the infamous phone call warning you that you will die in 7 days. The first Ring movie was deep. The focus being on the video tape which is much like the creepy chain letters you get in your email and the suspense of Rachel Naomi Watts dying in 7 days. And finally you get your cheap thrills which Gore Verbinski accomplished masterfully making The Ring a new legend for our generation.If The Ring is deep The Ring Two is a kiddie pool. With all the things that went on during the first Ring movie there was nothing left for the Ring Two to do but MORE cheap thrills in between borrowed gags from other thrillers and horror flicks. Verbinski left the director's chair and passed it back to the director from the original Ring Series Ringu. This was proving to be the most anticipated thriller this year. I was real disappointed to find that the Ring Two simply shouldn't have been made.The Ring Two is about Samara who comes back and wants to be human again. Who does she choose? Conveniently the son of Rachel from the first ring.If you notice there's so much more to talk about concerning the Ring but all it takes is a couple sentences to sum up everything in the Ring Two. That's because there's not a whole lot that goes on. In this movie plot line wasn't as important as the cheap thrills. Even with the mentality of wanting to be scared The Ring Two doesn't deliver as well and leaves you thinking ehh... that could've been done a lot better. The opening sequence for example could've been a moment in the movie that all moviegoers will remember just like in the first Ring but instead it was in short... stupid.There's nothing new in the Ring Two. Everything is either recycled from the first movie or reused from other movies. There are three types of movies good movies bad movies and movies that should've never been made. The difference between a bad movie and one that shouldn't have been made is that the latter has a lot to live up to and has the pressure of satisfying the fans of the story whether it be a sequel or an adaptation from another text. The Ring Two dangerously ruins the mystery behind the first movie which should've been left alone.Everyone should just watch the Ring One get scared be happy then burn every copy of the Ring Two. That should put Samara away for good.".

	schema:headline " A fulfilling and welldone yet vastly misunderstood sequel...";
	schema:reviewBody "The Ring Two is everything you could want in a sequel to the surprise hit The Ring. That is assuming you have an open mind and are keen on looking for symbolism and deeper meanings in everything. That seems to be the problem with many opinions people have against the film... they just don't get it.The movie takes place presumably some time after the original. Rachel Keller has moved to a small town with her son Aiden to start over... And although we never learn what happened exactly we are to presume they have broken Aiden's curse by placing it upon someone or even several people. A dark subplot that is mentioned briefly several times this fact has been troubling the mother and son.But they want to start over and have been living well. Rachel has a new job and Aiden is seems to be doing better. But this does not last. A teenager is murdered and Rachel suspects the vengeful spirit of Samara is involved. An importent note The murdered teen is the lead character of the short film Rings which reveals that there are so called 'rings' or groups of people who pass around the cursed video recording anything they see after viewing it trying to learn it's secrets. As the film progresses it becomes apparent that Aiden is the target of Samara who takes hold of him fairly early on. The rest of the film is a dark investigation into Samara's true past and what has to be done to stop her once and for all.Thats the plot in a nutshell. But as I said before people have a tendency not to like this film. And I do believe the problem is the lack of sophistication in film audiences nowadays.Many reviews I have read Both professional critics and online fanreviews all point to different reasons as to why this film was not as good as the original. Some say that it simply isn't scary which is true in a way. However the film doesn't seem to be going for sheer scares. It wants to be suspenseful and emotional... not watered down into a pure frightfest. Other people say the plot is weak and that there is a lack in storytelling. Again I cannot speak for everyone but there was definitely power in what I saw. It was a story of a mother willing to do anything and everything to save her son... Even if it means what could be her own death and the death of others. Very powerful in it's own respect. And another final complaint is that the film is different than the original. I cannot argue with this because that is the whole point. The story to this film and it's keys are different than the original.Another interesting thing to look for is the symbolism and connections that both Ring films have. Water reflections and simple noises take on deeper meanings.Bringing on the director of the original Japanese film Ringu Hideo Nakata was also a good choice. He seemed to add another layer different from Gore Verbinski's first film. And the writer of both films Ehren Kruger again proves that he has a knack for suspense.Overall I felt this film was just as good if not better than the original. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspenseful and emotional stories or anyone that enjoys a good film in general.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Ring Two is everything you could want in a sequel to the surprise hit The Ring. That is assuming you have an open mind and are keen on looking for symbolism and deeper meanings in everything. That seems to be the problem with many opinions people have against the film... they just don't get it.The movie takes place presumably some time after the original. Rachel Keller has moved to a small town with her son Aiden to start over... And although we never learn what happened exactly we are to presume they have broken Aiden's curse by placing it upon someone or even several people. A dark subplot that is mentioned briefly several times this fact has been troubling the mother and son.But they want to start over and have been living well. Rachel has a new job and Aiden is seems to be doing better. But this does not last. A teenager is murdered and Rachel suspects the vengeful spirit of Samara is involved. An importent note The murdered teen is the lead character of the short film Rings which reveals that there are so called 'rings' or groups of people who pass around the cursed video recording anything they see after viewing it trying to learn it's secrets. As the film progresses it becomes apparent that Aiden is the target of Samara who takes hold of him fairly early on. The rest of the film is a dark investigation into Samara's true past and what has to be done to stop her once and for all.Thats the plot in a nutshell. But as I said before people have a tendency not to like this film. And I do believe the problem is the lack of sophistication in film audiences nowadays.Many reviews I have read Both professional critics and online fanreviews all point to different reasons as to why this film was not as good as the original. Some say that it simply isn't scary which is true in a way. However the film doesn't seem to be going for sheer scares. It wants to be suspenseful and emotional... not watered down into a pure frightfest. Other people say the plot is weak and that there is a lack in storytelling. Again I cannot speak for everyone but there was definitely power in what I saw. It was a story of a mother willing to do anything and everything to save her son... Even if it means what could be her own death and the death of others. Very powerful in it's own respect. And another final complaint is that the film is different than the original. I cannot argue with this because that is the whole point. The story to this film and it's keys are different than the original.Another interesting thing to look for is the symbolism and connections that both Ring films have.

	schema:reviewBody "The Ring Two stars Naomi Watts and David Dorfman reprising their roles as Rachel and Aiden Keller a family plagued by Samara Morgan a demon child that created a video tape after death that showed horrifying images and killed the viewers seven days after they watch it. The original was met with great praise labeled by critics as the scariest movie since The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby even though I didn't find it scary at all just a good mystery. In The Ring Two Rachel and Aiden have moved to a new town and evidence arises that a local death may have been caused by a mysterious video tape. This inspires Rachel a reporter to investigate.Most critics don't like this film because it doesn't have the atmosphere of the original. Since I've read the books and now how vastly different the first is from the second I didn't expect it to. You can't expect it to anyway seeing as how they have two different directors. I'm quite sure this movie would have been better if Gore Verbinski had been on to direct but the studio hired the director of the Japanese film. It didn't work for The Grudge and it didn't work for this but it turned out better than what I expected.In The Ring the mystery of the video tape was revealed including where it came from and the history of who made it. Though I will admit they could have explained it better. The book does. In The Ring Two we know what there is to fear so all there is left to do is throw it at us and see what happens. They try something new though that slightly resembles what occurs at the very end of the book but is much different and happens in the middle. I didn't like how they just threw the idea of Samara being adopted at us. I wish they had explained it. They also kind of overexagerated on the water. After a fact about the villain is later revealed it kind of makes sense but not really. I just hope fans react to Dark Water well when they see it. I also really liked the scene at the end with the well. There seems to be a scene like that at the end of both of them one that shocks you and makes you flip out. The first being where she crawls out of the TV. All in all it was a very cool movie one of the better ones I've seen recently. I'd give it 1010 because it did everything I thought it should. They did close it off but I still expect a third. Why wouldn't they do it?".

This time around he had a decent budget which not only allowed him to hire a few name actors but also with the production values. This movie looks REALLY nice from the scenery to the cinematography. Another nice thing about the movie was that it was somewhat less juvenile than other typical modern day family movies even the child characters are taking things more seriously than usual.The movie got a rare G rating from the MPAA and there is indeed nothing in the movie I think anyone would find inappropriate for kid viewers. But that also happens to be the problem that ultimately sinks the movie. There is virtually no peril no tension no action or anything else that would give the movie some real compelling drama. As a result kids will find the movie to be really boring. Their parents will have more patience but even they will probably wish there was more spark. It doesn't help that the movie also unfolds at a REALLY slow pace. In the end the movie is only worth a viewing for viewers who want an answer as to why they make so few G rated movies nowadays.".

This time around he had a decent budget which not only allowed him to hire a few name actors but also with the production values. This movie looks REALLY nice from the scenery to the cinematography. Another nice thing about the movie was that it was somewhat less juvenile than other typical modern day family movies even the child characters are taking things more seriously than usual.The movie got a rare G rating from the MPAA and there is indeed nothing in the movie I think anyone would find inappropriate for kid viewers. But that also happens to be the problem that ultimately sinks the movie. There is virtually no peril no tension no action or anything else that would give the movie some real compelling drama. As a result kids will find the movie to be really boring. Their parents will have more patience but even they will probably wish there was more spark. It doesn't help that the movie also unfolds at a REALLY slow pace. In the end the movie is only worth a viewing for viewers who want an answer as to why they make so few G rated movies nowadays.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is perhaps one of the most ambitious epic WW2 films to have been made certainly it is the last of the classic BW films made about the subject. Featuring an allstar cast John Wayne Richard Burton Kurt Jurgens... even a cameo by Sean Connery! it comprehensively details the buildup and execution of the Normandy landings in 1944 taking care to show how the event was perceived by Allied and Axis soldiers and commanders as well as the Free French resistance.  This is a film that takes great care in documenting the events of the day without lapsing into sickly sentimentalism or getting distracted with fictional characters' personal lives a failing of many WW2 movies since about 1970 or overemphasising any one nation's importance in the operation although admittedly Canadians may feel a little shortchanged.Classic moments abound notably the landing at St.MereEglise and the soldier who gets caught in the church steeple the frustrations of the frontline German commanders and fighters and the numerous cameos for film nerds to keep track of.If you want a wartime romance or an appearance by Matt Damon or Ben Affleck or long loving shots of the Stars  Stripes in slomo or a gritty blood'n'guts fest you'll be disappointed.  This film has broader concerns and was made with much more thoroughness.  There is no agenda at work here prowar or anti.  It is solely concerned with documenting Operation Overlord for the filmgoing public and succeeds brilliantly a shame then that it has not made the top 50 war films list.A mustsee for any fan of war films.".

The picture brings to life the famous images of WWII and splendidly the most sensational military operation of the history in an Allied hardfought effort. The film develops the previous days to the DDay invasion such as the landings and the advance over France. The film is magnificently produced with big budget by the great 20th century Fox producer Darryl F Zanuck. Evocative cinematography by Jean Bourgoun and catching song by Paul Anka with musical score by Maurice Jarre. Excellent casting by plethora stars. Special mention to John Wayne as Lt.

Grace was a famed set designer  while he worked extensively for many films his only appearance was an uncredited performance as Eisenhower  despite not being an actor  he was cast for his uncanny resemblance to the General. This famous event from how was orchestrated the dangerousrisky landings maneuvers is professionally directed by trio of directors Ken Annakin Bernhard Wicki and Andrew Marton. Adding more details along with the well developed on the movie the events were happened of the following manner  Shortly after midnight on June 6 about 23.500 US and British paratroopers landed along the edges of the landing beaches. Their mission was to seize vital bridges and communications centers. They also had to hold off any Germans counterattacks until they were relieved by the amphibious forces. The Airbone landings were largely successful. Some US troops missed their target and end up scattered over the countryside. The main amphibious landings took place after an artillery bombardment from some 200 Allied warships at German positions also came under attack from Allied medium and heavy bombers. They were part of the 11500 aircraft committed to DDay. They bombed the Germans on and behind the five landing beaches. US troops landed on Utah beach. Strong currents and inaccurate navigation meant that they were a little away from their precise target. They landed about 1 mile16 km south. The beach there was relatively undefended. The troops soon knocked out the only concrete gun position guarding the beach.Demolitions teams cleared paths through the obstacles the beach and the first tanks crossed the Atlantic Wall. They fanned out into the countryside to link up with the paratroopers. By nightfall of DDay some 23000 men and 1700 vehicles had gone ashore. The beach had been highly congested for much of the day. Utah was a triumph however Omaha beach was nearly a disaster the fight was the most difficult. The Us troops were unable to get off the beach to make room for later waves of invaders. There were better defenses there than on the other beaches and the German defenders were positioned on high ground from where they could pour fire down on the attackers.The allies also made mistakes. The naval bombardment ended too soon and the bombers missed their targets and launched landing crafts and amphibious tanks too far out from the beach may were sunk. When the first assault wave landed it faced a barrage of fire  some men were thinking of evacuation. However small groups began to make it off the beach to the high ground beyond. By dusk some men were ashore most were still crowed on the beach. The high ground beyond was only thinly held by exhausted survivors waves. Some 2300 US troops had been killed in the landings. The operation had come close to disaster. The three AngloCanadian beachesGold Sword and Juno stretched fore some 25 miles. They were wide and open and ideal for amphibious landings. The British on Gold and Sword quickly crashed though the Atlantic wall. Their success was due partly to a range of specially developed armored vehicles known as Funnies. The Canadians at Juno had a tougher time. They faced rough seas and alert defenders .By late morning they were also pushing inland. Despite the horror of beaches  overall Allied losses were far lower than expected. Some 6000 US personnel were killed wounded or missing along with 4300 British and Canadian troops. German losses totaled between 4000 and 8000. By the day's end some 128000 Allied soldiers were ashore and many more were on their way.".

	schema:headline " One of the Greatest War Films Ever Bar None!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Longest Day is one of the greatest war films ever. Bar none. The  acting the cinematography the storline and the acuraccy are great. if  any of you fans watch AMC watch the Backstory behind this movie. It's  amazing that it was even made. This is Zanuck's greatest work. The  perspective from the different combatants regardless of their rank is  great. Like somebody else said it did not portray the Germans as  cartoonish evil doers. It gave a good honest portrayal that I wish more  war movies would have. As a history buff I love to see movies from  other countries soldier perspectives. This captures it better than  every other war movie. The only one that comes close is Tora Tora  Tora. There is one drawback however and that is the rangers at Pointe  De Hoc. They did find the big guns butthey were further inland and  later destroyed before they could be used. Zanuck used this to show the  futility and waste of war. Other than that is a classic with very few  flaws. The comparison between SPR and TLD are well like comparing  apples and oranges. Yes SPR has gritty realism that stuns you but  like another reviewer said this was 1962 and the movie was about the  entire scope of the battle. It was not meant to be up close and  personal like SPR. Many of us  appreciate movies from different perspctives. This is not a movie you  should not rent. You should own it as part of your video collection.  This movie may appear to be prowar and patriotic but Zanuck himself  said he wanted to make an antiwar film. I think he did so  magnificantly. He captured the essence of the book where Cornelius Ryan  said he wrote about the mennot the battles. That is why Zanucks film  is so successful. He captured the men and their feelings whether they  were American BritishGerman's or French and what they were feeling  going into one WW2's most decisive battle. This is a Four Star  Classic!!!!".

	onyx:emotionText "The Longest Day is one of the greatest war films ever. Bar none. The  acting the cinematography the storline and the acuraccy are great. if  any of you fans watch AMC watch the Backstory behind this movie. It's  amazing that it was even made. This is Zanuck's greatest work. The  perspective from the different combatants regardless of their rank is  great. Like somebody else said it did not portray the Germans as  cartoonish evil doers. It gave a good honest portrayal that I wish more  war movies would have. As a history buff I love to see movies from  other countries soldier perspectives. This captures it better than  every other war movie. The only one that comes close is Tora Tora  Tora. There is one drawback however and that is the rangers at Pointe  De Hoc. They did find the big guns butthey were further inland and  later destroyed before they could be used. Zanuck used this to show the  futility and waste of war. Other than that is a classic with very few  flaws. The comparison between SPR and TLD are well like comparing  apples and oranges. Yes SPR has gritty realism that stuns you but  like another reviewer said this was 1962 and the movie was about the  entire scope of the battle. It was not meant to be up close and  personal like SPR. Many of us  appreciate movies from different perspctives. This is not a movie you  should not rent.

The Longest Day doesn't depend on special effects but on the minute by minute horror of its moment. It's also if I'm permitted to say it a lot of fun to watch. Strangely enough the all star cast is not distracting at all. It was much more in Saving Private Ryan with a cast of up and comings headed by Tom Hanks himself. In The Longest Day there are real moments film cinematic moments that are intimately connected with the profoundest sense of drama The clicking of the rifle. Richard Burton Richard Beymer and the boots of the dead German. Red Buttons hanging from the Cathedral. Paul Anka Fabian Robert Wagner the landing in Normandy. This film remains one of the best from every angle films of its kind.".

It was the great Daryl Zanuck's last hurrah and a fitting one not his last film  just his last worthwhile film. This is a great film. It's not perfect but its faults are few and minor. For me the most glaring fault is the amateurish delivery by the actor a near ringer portraying Ike. Also the very beautiful actress portraying the French resistance fighter is wearing a very 1960s hairdo a common problem with Hollywood films.I see this film every memorial day. It helps me to remember my father a Navy gunner's mate in the Pacific theater and my maternal grandfather an islandhopping Sgt. in the Marine Corps. Personally as a veteran I find this movie as realistic as I think it was possible to be in 1961.Is it the best American war film? No. I would place it in the top 10 alongside the following1. All Quiet On the Western Front 1930 2. Platoon 1986 3. Tora! Tora! Tora! 1970 4. In Which We Serve British  1943 5. Patton 1970 6. They Were Expendable 1945 7. Twelve O'Clock High 1949 8. Paths of Glory 1957 9. Grand Illusion 1940? 10.The Longest Day 1962".

	schema:headline " Gentlemen We Start the War from Right Here.";
	schema:reviewBody "Simply put if things had gone differently on June 6 1944 we would be living in a very different and very much uglier world than we have now. The Longest Day is Darryl F. Zanuck's tribute to all who were involved in Allied invasion at Normandy.Even viewing it now as opposed to the theaters back then back then I am staggered at Zanuck's incredible eye and grasp for the detail of the Normandy invasion. He did the smart thing and not only bought Cornelius Ryan's standard account of DDay but got Ryan to write a very coherent screenplay. Even one who has absolutely no grasp of military history will be able to follow exactly what was going on.Several of the people who are portrayed in the film also served as technical advisers of it. When you Peter Lawford as Lord Lovat or Robert Ryan as General James Gavin and many others these people aided in recreating the project.Zanuck may have had the largest movie set in history to work with at least up to that time. You are seeing the film photographed in the places it actually happened. The beaches the towns of St. Mere Eglise and Ouisterham even the embarkation areas in the UK. I doubt you could do The Longest Day today because of the changes in all these places now. Lots of cooperation from the British and French governments was necessary.You also couldn't do it because the budget would be the size of the U.S. national debt today. This was the last days of the all powerful studio system and even with a lot of the stars freelancing at that point Darryl F. Zanuck was still a most powerful man in Hollywood with a lot of favors owed. One example was Richard Burton who was shooting Cleopatra at the time The Longest Day was also shooting. For his two brief but memorable scenes as an RAF pilot they shot around him on Cleopatra also a 20th Century Fox production while he filmed his part for Zanuck.Even the Germans came in for a portrait of them as human beings. Curt Jurgens as General Blumentritt who was also a technical adviser put it philosophically best about how after he can't convince Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl to wake up Hitler to move the Panzer Divisions breaks open a bottle of cognac and decides to drink it before the Allies arrive.I have several favorites in The Longest Day. Richard Todd who actually was at DDay and was a decorated hero himself plays commando leader Major John Howard who is asked to paratroop into France and capture and hold a key bridge intact. Todd is channeling his own as well as Howard's war experience into the film and gives a performance of unusual depth.Norman Rossington and a preJames Bond Sean Connery who was just making his debut as Bond in Dr. No give some good comic relief as a cockney and Irish soldier landing on Sword Beach. So does Kenneth More as a British beachmaster with his bulldog Winston.The French are well represented by Arletty Bourvil Christian Marquand and by Irina Demich. Being that three of these play civilian roles they get the only two women's parts of any substance in The Longest Day. I do like the scene where some Germans checking Irina out in a low cut dress fail to properly search her. Irina also demonstrates how much the women were equal partners in the Resistance. Marquand as a captain of a Free French company is involved in a particularly bloody battle for a coastal town.Of course the American cinema is well represented. Charlton Heston was to originally play the part that John Wayne does but he couldn't get free of some commitments of his own and when Wayne became available Zanuck grabbed him. Heston was later quoted as saying Wayne did a better job than he would have in any event. Wayne's best scene was when he saw some American bodies dangling from roofs in St. Mere Eglise. As I've said many times John Wayne had one of the best faces for movie closeups ever. One look at the horror expressed in his face tells you all you need to know.Henry Fonda plays General Theodore Roosevelt Jr. who would within a month after the invasion die on Normandy Beach. Had he lived Roosevelt might have picked up the pieces of a stalled political career. But that was not to be the case. Roosevelt was found dead of a heart attack in his tent after the invasion when the Allies were trying to break out of the beach.The heaviest casualties on DDay were on Omaha Beach where Robert Mitchum plays General Norman Cota a division commander. Mitchum is involved at the climax of the film where American GIS after being hung up for hours break through and insure the invasion's success.The Longest Day is not only great drama and a great war film but it is as accurate a film as you will ever get depicting the Normandy invasion good history as well.".

No cost was spared.  Some good war sequences mixed with stock footage of WWII effectively present a version of DDay June of 1944.  We see it from the German perspective in subtitles the American plight and the rest of the Allied forces.  One problem  If you are seeing the film for the first time AFTER watching SAVING PRIVATE RYAN you may come out disappointed.  The war scenes are wellcrafted however the piercing reality is missing.  I tried to watch it as objectively as I could but it is hard considering the impression Spielberg's version of DDay left on me.The soldiers are led by a variety of huge name actors.  John Wayne is a noholdsbarred Captain who will fight broken foot or not.  Henry Fonda plays Teddy Roosevelt Jr. looking not to be treated as the son of an expresident.   Bob Mitchum is great as a cigarsmoking officer of the U.S. raid on Omaha Beach.  The only problem is authenticity.  The actors look good and realisticly warlike however they are kept in frame to showcase their talents and they never seem to be near death.  This is by no means an antiwar film like RYAN.  It can be harrowing at times but watching Richard Burton Sean Connery and Rod Steiger deliver cameolike performances meaning they know they are only onscreen for a short time was a bit contrived and distracting.Overall I did like the movie.  It is greatly detailed and it lets you know exactly who each actor is playing.  This is pure American propaganda but it is still exciting.  Too many fearful war experiences are handled with kid gloves.  The grand spectacle of the topnotch production values as well as nonstop action  make the picture watchable if only once.RATING 7 of 10".

Yes Ryan was a powerful piece of film making but The Longest Day has a far more epic scope and concerns itself with providing a more complete picture by telling the stories surrounding DDay from the perspective of British and American troops French troops German troops and French resistance fighters and civilians.  Continual involvement of the higher command officers particularly among the Germans helps give the viewer a sense of the 'big picture' that was probably unknown to most on the ground involved in fighting.This blending of the strategic picture and vignettes from individual soldiers  many of them underscoring alternately the horror the futility and the absurdness of war  was a prominent feature of Cornelius Ryan's book upon which his screenplay is based.  The same is true of the 1977 classic A Bridge Too Far.  And yes those more quirky scenes depicted in the film did apparently happen in real life truth being far stranger than fiction could ever hope to be and war being sprinkled with absurdities of all flavors.Attesting to the veracity of this film is not only the fact that Ryan was responsible for its screenplay but that among the military advisors were a host of generals and other officers from German and Allied forces most of them depicted in the film.  And some of those depictions were spoton in that the actors chosen naturally looked like or made themselves look like the historical figures for example the fellow who played Eisenhower looked more like the Allied commander than Ike himself did!.  The core story of Private Ryan is fiction the totality of The Longest Day is fact.Another difference between the two films is that many of the battle scenes in the 1962 movie were dominated by longshots whereas the newer movie kept things tight and far more up close and personal.  This difference reflects the difference in the films' scopes  bigpicture versus small divisional action and objectives versus platoonbased action and objectives.  On the subject of long shots some of the sweeping tracking shots especially of the French commando raid but also of the assault on Omaha Beach and in a few other scenes in this film were pretty incredible.The Longest Day shares another essential similarity with the later A Bridge Too Far in that both feature the proverbial 'allstar cast.'  I'm not sure that similar assemblages of talent and 'big names' have been cast for the same project since A Bridge Too Far.  Although it can be a tad disconcerting to see a famous actor occupy a tiny chunk of screen time apparently underutilized the approach does get across the idea of the sum being greater than any of the parts.As for charges that The Longest Day was a prowar filmI don't know where that comes from.  And that's even WITH John Wayne being among the cast!  The fact is that camaraderie and certain positive aspects of human character become magnified during war just as the more negative aspects do and elation over triumphing over adversity is not something that should surprise viewers who might wonder why some of the soldiers appear happy at times.  Also bear in mind that many of the troops were relatively inexperienced in battle and that they were embarked upon the 'greatest adventure of them all' finally delivering the enslaved nations of Europe from the grasp of tyranny etc etc.Heroism is real too no matter what motivates it.  Moreover the inherent waste and tragedy of war was  despite relying less on overt gore than is now the custom  a current that ran through the entire film perhaps being most obvious in such scenes as those concerned with the accidental dropping of members of the 82nd Airborne Division in Sainte MereEglise and the US Rangers' incredible and ultimately pointless scaling of the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc.  I was surprised when I saw Private Ryan that Steven Spielberg had included a scene that showed American soldiers killing prisoners.  I'd forgotten that a similar incident was included in The Longest Day the GI responsible mused about what bitte bitte meant but surely he knew what arms raised in surrender meant.  It's to the filmmakers' credit that the German cast are in addition to being allowed to speak German portrayed as real human beings with emotions concerns and real problems with those who command them.In summary this film is far from supplanted by Saving Private Ryan.  The Spielberg film is an incredible one and worthy of the accolades accorded it but its existence does not relegate The Longest Day to the scrap heap.  The two films complement one another and together provide a remarkably full picture of what happened in Normandy almost 60 years ago.".

Look at the way they're introduced  Mister big name movie star has back to camera  he turns round and wow we're looking at a big name movie star . All this is somewhat distracting . It should also be pointed out that many of the cast are let down by Corneilus Ryan's script . Ryan wrote the definitive account of the last year of the war via his trilogy THE LONGEST DAY  A BRIDGE TOO FAR and THE LAST BATTLE  he was a truly great historian but it's obvious he couldn't master the technicalities of screen writing  his characters are more like caricatures with the Americans all being butch and macho while the Europeans are somewhat eccentric save for a few Englishmen who have stiff upper lips . Like HG Wells with THINGS TO COME Ryan writes dialogue that sounds suspiciously like thought processes  an example being where the rangers fight their way into a bunker only to find it's a decoy and someone says  You mean we came all the way up here for nothing ?  . You can almost imagine the passage in the book saying  it was obvious to the men who had survived the battle  so obvious that no one dare say it but they'd fought their way to the bunker for nothing  Despite that I will congratulate Ryan and everyone else involved in the production for pointing out that the 6th of June was a multi national effort to free Western Europe from the Nazi jackboot  Brits  Yanks and the Free French are represented  Not sure about the Canadians but ?  unlike the rather overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that seems to indicate that D Day was an American solo effort THE LONGEST DAY is far more accurate and subjective as to what happened on the day . The script also has the temerity to suggest that the allies didn't win the battle but the Nazis lost due to the military incompetence of Hitler . It should be remembered that despite the overwhelming fire power of the allies they could have easily have been massacred on the beaches and that the Normandy landings was probably the most complicated military endeavor in all of military historyA word of warning  If you ever watch this movie only see the widescreen version because the technical aspects are awesome . The outstanding scene is where a few Americans sit on a bunk playing cards and one of them stands up pleading  Hey guys  anyone got five bucks  ten bucks  anyone got twenty bucks  . At this point the camera quickly pans out and the sound crashes in making the audience realize that the scene is set in a billets with hundreds of soldiers . Needless to say this scene is totally ruined when it's watched on a scanned copy THE LONGEST DAY is a flawed film but a great tribute to the men who fought in that campaign . As the veterans who fought there gather tomorrow for the 60th anniversary along with politicians who didn't have the guts to join the military but are very happy to use it for political gain I'd just like to say a big thank you to all the men who fought there . Thank you to one and all . If it weren't for you I wouldn't be here now".

	schema:headline " An editing masterpiece an epic day lots of great filming but also diffused and imperfect";
	schema:reviewBody "The Longest Day 1962This is an ambitious movie extremely well photographed filled with stars and secondary actors of fame and talent. And it covers roughly at 24 hour period leading up to and into the epic and dramatic June 6 1944 invasion of Germanheld France known as DDay.On all these levels the movie almost has to succeed. And it does. It's a popularizing account of an important event. It's history made simple for sure but it compresses the complexity with good intentions and with some fair handling of both the German and nonGerman sides of the battles inside and war rooms and on the beach.The movie is filled however with so many characters maybe fifty who are given enough camera time to take on some small meaning though the poster advertises 42 International Stars and shot in so many locations Germany France London on boats on beaches in villas by the bridge in the bunker in the strategic commands along the roads flying overhead on and on it is truly impossible to engage in any one part of it fully. Many scenes are superb even short ones sometimes with great actors like Robert Ryan playing with a light on his face in a comic scary way and sometimes with unknowns who for a moment shine in their terror.

I'm not kidding. I ask routinely. This is just life. Blame education if you want but it's a natural movement forward to more recent and still living world events. We had DDay they have 911.I watched the movie with my girlfriend who is not from the States and who knew only the outline of the war. Her country wasn't involved in it enough to make a dent on its own history. And so she watched with a kind of dulled boredom. The cameos by famous people were fun for both of us and filming was to be appreciated but the drama I felt even with the opening credits I saw was dependent on knowing the larger scope. And so this movie will have a shrinking audience and shrinking appreciation over time. It's a long watchthree hoursand it has a steady stream of great moments. But it's not a great movie in moviemaking terms. Exciting and important and with a wikipedia page to make this all clear but it's unlikely to fully integrate and take total form as a whole.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Longest Day 1962This is an ambitious movie extremely well photographed filled with stars and secondary actors of fame and talent. And it covers roughly at 24 hour period leading up to and into the epic and dramatic June 6 1944 invasion of Germanheld France known as DDay.On all these levels the movie almost has to succeed. And it does. It's a popularizing account of an important event. It's history made simple for sure but it compresses the complexity with good intentions and with some fair handling of both the German and nonGerman sides of the battles inside and war rooms and on the beach.The movie is filled however with so many characters maybe fifty who are given enough camera time to take on some small meaning though the poster advertises 42 International Stars and shot in so many locations Germany France London on boats on beaches in villas by the bridge in the bunker in the strategic commands along the roads flying overhead on and on it is truly impossible to engage in any one part of it fully. Many scenes are superb even short ones sometimes with great actors like Robert Ryan playing with a light on his face in a comic scary way and sometimes with unknowns who for a moment shine in their terror.

One of the five Normandy beaches was Canadian Juno but there is almost no mention of this in The Longest Day and I'm sure that one would be hard pressed to find many Americans and not a whole lot more Canadians who know this. Unfortunately it is movies such as this and other popular media that shape the historic knowledge of people on both sides of the border. In the near absence of Canadian content I find it ironic that a young Canadian Paul Anka not only played a part in the movie as an American soldier but also wrote the theme music. I find it also ironic that the legendary rifle used by US soldiers during WW2 and shown in this movie was designed by a Canadian as well Garand is a French Canadian name. The cruelest irony of course is the fact that thousands of Canadian soldiers were maimed or lost there lives on 6 June 1944 and the days thereafter with virtually no acknowledgement in this movie. I have always enjoyed watching this movie but it is unfortunate that I must use my imagination to see in it the heroic and selfless wartime effort of my father's generation in similar fashion to viewers in the US and UK.".

Some less so and some is just downright tokenism  Rod Steiger getting all of 43 seconds onscreen for example. But overall it's always a watchable movie  beautifully shot.Some previous comment have surprised me particularly the assertion that The Longest Day is in any way a prowar film. I'm not sure if there is such a thing but if there is then The LOngest Day certainly doesn't fall into this category  the scene of bewilderment between Richard Burton and Richard Beymer at the end about the confusion and directionlessness of war is the perfect example ending with the memorable line I wonder who won.I'm also surprised that a European reviewer should have accused this film of all world war II movies of being American propoganda. I wonder how many other WWII films include both German and almost unqiuely French perspectives of the war to such an extent that almost half of the dialogue in them is in a language other than English. I find the German sequences in The Longest Day to be amongst the most interesting historically and dramatically.The film is certainly as accurate as it's possible for a fictional movie to be  the list of advisors that it had working on it should prove that  including many people who are portrayed by actors in the movie itself. These include the characters played by Peter Lawford Richard Todd and Kenneth More along with several of the German field officers. Little touches that seem utterly out of place like the nuns procession through the French village bringing a temporary ceasefire are actually historically spoton.The final problem for the modern reviewer of course is the inevitable comparison between this film and Saving Private Ryan. But as several other contributors have noted SPR is not only the product of a different age with a different view of these events  historical as opposed to something which happened so recently that half of the audience are likely to have lived through them. But ultimately something usually forgotten about Operation Overlord is that Omaha Beach was merely one battle of a very long day indeed. Americans tend to focus on it because of the death toll but the taking of Utah Sword and Gold were just as important to the overall outcome. The Longest Day is a film about five beaches many battles and many men  some as Richard Burton says dead some crippled and some lost. It is an antiwar film which proves that you can be antiwar and still celebrate and acknowledge heorism. The heroism of the young American and British troops falling facefirst into the salt water of the Normandy killing grounds. The incredible bravery of the Rangers who scaled the cliffs at Pointe du Luc on and ultimately meaningless mission. The heroism of the two Luftwaffe pilots commanded to face the invading armies alone and who did so another historically accurate point.The Longest Day is a historic film about a historical event and it should be viewed as such.910".

In THE LONGEST DAY which was shot in semidocumentary style Zanuck's intent was to show the monumental effort involved on the part of the allies in mounting a successful cross channel invasion.

	schema:reviewBody "June 6th1944. The Allied invasion of northern Europe begins along the Normandy coastline. In the early hours of the morning thousands of British and American paratroopers are dropped inland to secure strategic objectives to be followed at dawn by the main assault force consisting of Americans Utah and Omaha beaches British Gold and Sword beaches Canadians Juno beach and French attached to the British at Sword. By nightfall it is hoped that the troops will be moving off the beaches and linking up with the Airborne forces inland.   This multifaceted account of the DDay landings was a mammoth undertaking in its day. Adapted for the screen by Cornelius Ryan from his book of the same name it is a very detailed look at the events of that momentous day in history. Every angle is covered from the commanders planners and soldiers to the French underground civilians and the German defenders. The cast list reads like a who's who of international cinema at the time to the point where this can detract from the drama of the events at times. Nevertheless the sheer scale of the production is staggering in its scope most of it filmed on the actual battle sites where possible. In terms of cost this would surely be impossible to film these days.   There are a couple of drawbacks however. Some of the dialogue leans toward the corny at times especially by todays standards. Also since the release of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Band Of Brothers' the landings on Omaha beach and the parachute drop sequences look tame and rather antiseptic. This isn't a criticism of the production so much as a comment on how the film is starting to show its age.  On the plus side there are some very well executed sequences. The scaling of the cliffs at Point du Hoc by the US Rangers is one and the storming of the town of Ouistreham by French commandos is another. This is probably the most breathtaking scene in the entire film as an airborne camera tracks the commandos through the streets and ends up circling a German machine gun nest on top of the casino building.   The film needs to be viewed in its original widescreen aspect ratio to fully appreciate its epic scale. The DVD print is a beautifully clean transfer in the original black  white. I and I suspect many others got quite a shock a couple of years back when I tuned in to watch it on TV to find it has been digitally colourised. In truth this version looks quite good but it's not available on DVD.   Despite showing its age a little 'The Longest Day' remains one of the great World War Two films and is still the definitive cinematic account of DDay.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sure if someone has hot as Jennifer Aniston were to offer you to touch their butt I'm sure almost every male out there would jump at the chance of doing so without thinking twice. It's a no brainer offer and a teaser of course to a larger more sentimental story out there about the relentless pursuit of love the romanticism attached to wanting to be with someone without being consciously bogged by the harsh realities of life and survival. With affairs of the heart to me at least it's a seizing of opportunities presented rather than to adopt the wait and see approach.The hook for the film written and directed by Stephen Belber is of course that much talked about scene between Aniston and Steve Zahn the former being Sue an art saleswoman who on a business trip had stayed at a motel which Zahn's Mike is the night manager of his family's business. Smitten by none other than her buttocks Mike crafts simple yet really strange excuses just to be close to Sue and talk to her and the initial scenes which they share in her hotel room is something that both actors brought out superbly  the awkwardness the suspicions and that hopeful look that something good might arise from all of the nonsense.Thus began Mike's obsession with Sue when she allowed him that grace to fulfill a fantasy and that translated to the borderline of stalking where he dumps everything and pursues her across state lines. Turning up at someone's workplace unannounced can have a very chilling effect especially when one is only nothing more than an acquaintance and a one nighter to pass time and in an attempt to claw out of loneliness. After all anything else is better than being holed up in your hotel room playing Solitaire on a computer.Management is pretty much about the idealistic and pragmatic lenses that we wear from time to time in our view of romantic relationships. Here it's a Mr Idealistic versus Ms Pragmatic in the approach. In Mike we see someone with a hope of going beyond his comfort zone of his parents' business in the pursuit of a romance that he only wishes to turn out positively. There's no plan there's no ulterior motive there's only the want to be with someone and spend time with her pure and simple. Heck he doesn't even have enough money to begin with.For Ms Pragmatic it's all about the plan where such a situation will lead to Complications arrive through the introduction of her exboyfriend Jango Woody Harrelson an expunk band member who is now an established businessman. This means a nobody Mike is against a somebody Jango and presents a choice for Sue to choose  the one for that undying romance or the one who can pay the bills and allow her to continue hiding behind charitable causes to coast through life without spontaneity that the former may bring. It's a matter of love for genuine love of a person or a love that is a matter of convenience and timing which in itself is truly sad because you know that there's a compromise which may not be for the better.The film also went beyond the usual romantic elements and tried successfully to insert other aspects of relationships such as family Mike's Mom and Dad played by Margo Martindale and Fred Ward respectively and friends. The role of Al James Hiroyuki Liao as Mike's best friend was curiously interesting as well as here's an almost mirrored character in having a waiter working in his parents' restaurant business too. Despite being present only in the middle act Al's role served as comedic fodder and to catalyze that life changing idea for Mike in learning to let go but never forgetting.In many ways the character of Mike had reminded me of a younger self where caution is thrown to the wind with the chasing of skirts in the same way zoning on that singular tree while forsaking the forest never mind the issues of incompatibility that loomed in the horizon. Not a very wise move of course on hindsight but given the intoxicating passionate nature then I suppose that was that. Naturally between then and now I had realized that there had been irreversible change in our characters probably and the ones in the past vaguely seem like distant characters who only remotely resemble who they are now.But Management somehow was more hopeful and optimistic in nature and I suppose that suited the movie just fine bringing you through the stages of passionate infatuation to love through the power of naive sincerity. With an excellent selection of songs in its soundtrack Management may just end up as a surprise when I compile my top 10 list for the year. For those who are looking for that little extra in a romantic comedy then Management may just be that little gem which will set you thinking.".

Despite being present only in the middle act Al's role served as comedic fodder and to catalyze that life changing idea for Mike in learning to let go but never forgetting.In many ways the character of Mike had reminded me of a younger self where caution is thrown to the wind with the chasing of skirts in the same way zoning on that singular tree while forsaking the forest never mind the issues of incompatibility that loomed in the horizon. Not a very wise move of course on hindsight but given the intoxicating passionate nature then I suppose that was that. Naturally between then and now I had realized that there had been irreversible change in our characters probably and the ones in the past vaguely seem like distant characters who only remotely resemble who they are now.But Management somehow was more hopeful and optimistic in nature and I suppose that suited the movie just fine bringing you through the stages of passionate infatuation to love through the power of naive sincerity. With an excellent selection of songs in its soundtrack Management may just end up as a surprise when I compile my top 10 list for the year. For those who are looking for that little extra in a romantic comedy then Management may just be that little gem which will set you thinking.";

From where I stand the casting was ingenious. In other words it couldn't have been better surprisingly enough since I've never appreciated Jenny as an actress but this was just her ideal role.C. The story is not over exaggerated which adds to its credibility. It's simple well digestible and not just funny but harmfully hilarious at some points. On top of that it's heart warming and free of superficial additives. D.

He makes it so it's not a crazy stalker film but a sweet romantic comedy. I'd also like to discuss this Rrating. It has a couple of cuss words and a sex scene that wasn't even shown. This deserves a PG13 at best. The movie also features a very funny performance from James Liao as Al Mike's newest helper. I wasn't expecting anything great. I thought this had a good chance of being mediocre but I was pleasantly surprised to find a romantic comedy as fun and original as this. The movie is about people in love and you love watching them. The movie may not be the Hollywood backbone of smart films but it's good for any Zahn Harrelson or Aniston fan. It's a movie that should be fine with anyone who's ever stayed at a motel or for someone who's ever been in love. Really it's the cast that makes this movie as good as it is.".

Let yourself be taken by Jennifer Aniston and Steve Zahn and their imperfect yet harmonious chemistry. Woody Harrelson is a comic genius. It's an endearing story about taking chance on love no matter how scary the uncertainties can be. Spontaneous and heartwarming enjoy the hospitality courtesy of MANAGEMENT.I love the story that writerdirector Stephen Belber has crafted. I like how he takes his time in developing the characters getting us to familiarize ourselves and connect with and understand the motivation behind their decisions. You notice the changes that happen within the span of time from the first meeting to the conflict in the basement all the way to buttgrabbing conclusion. The characters don't stay the same throughout the entire thing they go through interesting life changing journeys one after another.. nothing farfetched.. a bit silly maybe but still within our reason. Yes it's a comedy but it also has some very touching and sad dramatic elements and not in a way that would you put to sleep or plain tear jerkers. It's well thought out with the intention of making us rethink why anybody would wanna get in a relationship in the first place anyway is it for love or for security?! What a great blend of comedy and drama I might add. It's the type of humor that would break you and get you to chuckle or at least smile even when you try not to. It's a cute little movie.Jennifer Aniston gives the best performance of her career as Sue a successful corporate type woman who during one of her business trips encounters Mike played by Steve Zahn who's still stuck doing family business living a life that's going nowhere but once he catches a glimpse at Sue he knows that he would have to risk everything to be with her. Steve Zahn is the type of actor who may not be an Oscar caliber yet possibly because of his goofy presence he does have the talent and the heart to get the job done. He'll challenge himself and give his all for the story that he strongly believes in.Sue despite occasional interest in taking risks and having fun a little is the kind of woman who likes to play it safe. She goes out to feed the homeless and do all kinds of charity work while juggling a successful career at the same timebut she figures she wouldn't be able to do all that if there's no financial backup to support that certain lifestyle. The themes get even more relevant in this day and age where economy is in the craphole. Is it wise to just take a leap into unconditional love with your eyes closed?!I think what Belber's trying to emphasize that it can be a struggle being with somebody that you love that loves you back but at least you're truly happy instead of pretending to be. It's also some sort of a stereotypical study on woman and man. Some women tend to mature faster and is very selective when choosing a life partner. Some men still like being a kid just like Mike who doesn't have much vocabulary in his head resulting in hasty behavior such as flying thousands of miles away willing to go broke just to see if she feels the same way. But what's interesting is Sue's other option is a rich man but also an immature kid. An ex punk rocker named Jango brilliant played by Woody Harrelson who has the most perfect comedic timing one of the best actors of our time. Being with Jango proves that Sue has a type after all she keeps finding herself with the same type of guy. She's scared to give in to love that doesn't have money on the side while Mike isn't sacred to chase after love but he first needs to get out of the life that's been holding him back all these years. They're both taking a chance on each other. What comes after is an adventure they're going to have to figure out together.Rama's SCREEN".

Some men still like being a kid just like Mike who doesn't have much vocabulary in his head resulting in hasty behavior such as flying thousands of miles away willing to go broke just to see if she feels the same way. But what's interesting is Sue's other option is a rich man but also an immature kid. An ex punk rocker named Jango brilliant played by Woody Harrelson who has the most perfect comedic timing one of the best actors of our time. Being with Jango proves that Sue has a type after all she keeps finding herself with the same type of guy. She's scared to give in to love that doesn't have money on the side while Mike isn't sacred to chase after love but he first needs to get out of the life that's been holding him back all these years. They're both taking a chance on each other. What comes after is an adventure they're going to have to figure out together.Rama's SCREEN";

Aniston was so much better than her last couple of movies her character has life depth versatility. I think this is my favorite of her performances ever. And the movie is so simple but it has so much life in it ! No superheroes or not even heroes just simple people with simple feelings. I'd take that every day. Overall heartwarming and feel good.

	schema:reviewBody "Curious title Management. It comes from a very early scene when the character Mike is bringing a bottle of wine to the motel room of the character Sue and when she says Who is it? he answers Management.Kingman Arizona in the year 2000 had a population of right at 20000. It sits on I40 and the historic Route 66 nearly halfway between Phoenix and Las Vegas. The story starts in Kingman at one of the town's small motels when traveling salesperson Jennifer Aniston as Sue Claussen checks in. This is a familyrun motel and the couple's son is Steve Zahn as Mike. By all indications Mike is a pretty dull pretty unambitious guy. When dad tells him to he cleans the pool or unclogs a toilet. I suppose he just figures that is his lot in life someday the motel will be his and he will continue doing what his dad and mom did.But this fateful day he is absolutely smitten with Sue. She is pretty and neat a business woman that Mike probably rarely sees. So being on the night shift Mike figures out a way to see her again. He digs into the back storage and finds a very old bottle of cheap white wine and goes up to room 203 and knocks with the excuse that he is there to give their guest a free bottle of wine. He insists on opening it and when Sue tastes it she makes quite a face. But she was polite and bid him farewell. But Mike as dull as he may be was persistent. The next night he went up with a bottle of cheap Champagne with the excuse that 2nd night guests get that. We sort of feel for Mike and his pathetic existence and we know this type of approach never works. In a funny if also totally improbable scene Sue makes Mike an offer if she lets him feel her butt will he go and leave her alone? All that happens in the opening minutes of the movie which sets up Mike's illadvised pursuit of Sue. Surely a smart businesswoman from Maryland would never find anything remotely attractive in this small motel handyman in Kingman Arizona. But Mike never learned the art of quitting and he continues to pursue her even showing up in Maryland on a oneway ticket.The other key character is Woody Harrelson as Jango a former punk musician who now has turned to yogurt for his fortune in Washington state. He is an old boyfriend of Sue's and when it looks like they might reconcile Mike's pursuit takes on a different tenor.As I already said this premise should not work. This should be a flop of a movie. But it isn't. It is actually a very entertaining movie with a good message. Aniston and Zahn develop an onscreen chemistry that I didn't believe possible. SPOILERS Sue does in fact move in with Jango but we can see she can't be happy with this oddball guy. As she had told Mike when they were visiting once her real passion would be to run a soup kitchen for the homeless. Meanwhile Mike's mom died and dad signed the deed for the motel over to him. He decided he would turn it into a gathering place for the homeless along with a soup kitchen and he and Sue were destined to do it together.".

None of it's spoken which may confuse some viewers but it's what drives the romance throughout the film the fact that although Aniston's in no way in touch with her emotions and Zahn is not the brightest there is something alluring there that keeps them in contact and changes them both.I think people sell its subtly short but if you're willing to think for yourself you may enjoy it.

	schema:reviewBody "Jennifer Aniston makes her return to indie territory but this little clunker from writerdirector Stephen Belber Tape isn't going to earn her any new fans. Management is a romance that purposely seems to want to stop the romance from actually happening. How wrong are the two main characters for each other? If you were to swap their scenes together out and put a question mark on screen instead it would make more sense.Aniston plays Sue Claussen a traveling art saleswoman who happens to stay at the motel run by the parents of Mike Cranshaw Steve Zahn a manchild who all indications point to not having much of a social life. Sue catches his eye. Mike brings her champagne. He tells her she has a nice ass. To get rid of him Sue offers him a chance to touch and go to which he obliges. Can you feel the romance yet? This of course is not the last encounter Mike has with her but right before leaving the motel she explains to him why this relationship can't work. Then a couple seconds later she returns for some very passionate sex even though they don't know each other are complete opposites in terms of financials and personality and Mike seems almost I won't say retarded but way too simple for her. Why does she do this? Also why does Mike follow her to Baltimore afterwards? Cause she has a nice ass? And why does Sue keep giving into Mike's fairly bizarre behavior? The rest of the movie centers on the two meeting and splitting Mike stalking or wooing depending on your outlook of him her with everything from parachuting into her boyfriend Jango's Woody Harrelson pool to singing badly Feel Like Making Love outside of her window. Belber keeps giving us reasons why Sue should be running for the hills but the reasons for why she keeps staying with Mike are more ambiguous and the only reason I can think of for why he would want her is she's goodlooking and she makes a lot of money.Only Jennifer Aniston is a buttoned down sexless bore here and Steve Zahn is too childlike socially awkward and bouncy for there to actually be any chemistry. Zahn is capable of sweetness at certain points that most other actors wouldn't be able to accomplish but overall the romance just falters. It's not all their fault though. Belber is helming the ship and he has no idea where he's taking it. Perhaps that's why he tacks on a weak charactersneedingtofindthemselves subplot in the second half. The movie could use some tryingtofind itself of it's own.".

If you were to swap their scenes together out and put a question mark on screen instead it would make more sense.Aniston plays Sue Claussen a traveling art saleswoman who happens to stay at the motel run by the parents of Mike Cranshaw Steve Zahn a manchild who all indications point to not having much of a social life. Sue catches his eye. Mike brings her champagne. He tells her she has a nice ass. To get rid of him Sue offers him a chance to touch and go to which he obliges. Can you feel the romance yet? This of course is not the last encounter Mike has with her but right before leaving the motel she explains to him why this relationship can't work. Then a couple seconds later she returns for some very passionate sex even though they don't know each other are complete opposites in terms of financials and personality and Mike seems almost I won't say retarded but way too simple for her. Why does she do this? Also why does Mike follow her to Baltimore afterwards? Cause she has a nice ass? And why does Sue keep giving into Mike's fairly bizarre behavior? The rest of the movie centers on the two meeting and splitting Mike stalking or wooing depending on your outlook of him her with everything from parachuting into her boyfriend Jango's Woody Harrelson pool to singing badly Feel Like Making Love outside of her window. Belber keeps giving us reasons why Sue should be running for the hills but the reasons for why she keeps staying with Mike are more ambiguous and the only reason I can think of for why he would want her is she's goodlooking and she makes a lot of money.Only Jennifer Aniston is a buttoned down sexless bore here and Steve Zahn is too childlike socially awkward and bouncy for there to actually be any chemistry. Zahn is capable of sweetness at certain points that most other actors wouldn't be able to accomplish but overall the romance just falters. It's not all their fault though. Belber is helming the ship and he has no idea where he's taking it. Perhaps that's why he tacks on a weak charactersneedingtofindthemselves subplot in the second half. The movie could use some tryingtofind itself of it's own.";

The fact that his horrid approach worked is what makes the film sort of cute unique and original... because that crap would never fly in the real world.And that is probably the problem with the film... it's pretty unrealistic. Aniston seems to fall for him more so out of pity or simply because he's so peculiar in his resiliency.It's not a match made in heaven but it's a dream come true for a dork.All in all this is a film that will be forgotten if it was ever known. It doesn't need to be recommended because there's nothing groundbreaking but I will say while I'm not a fan of this kind of hairbrain romantic crap I didn't feel like it was 2 hours of my life I wanted back. So that's not bad. Recommended to women dorks losers guys who can't get a girl nerds.

	schema:reviewBody "Rev Francis Ashby is a bookish and retiring don at Oxford who reluctantly gives in to his colleagues insistences that he go for a holiday. Enjoying the peace and quiet in the Alps he is initially disturbed by the arrival of a group including an American woman Caroline and her teenager ward Elinor. However acting as their guide when the rest of the group returns to the lodgings Ashby starts to fall for the darling Elinor but after slight bonding he is called back immediately due to the failing health of the college president. When his American friends come to Oxford to visit their arrival throws the college into a tizzy and he finds himself in competition with others for not only the role of president but also for the hearts of his friends.Watching this film for the third time since its release in the early nineties I decided to review it and looking at the title page was astonished yes really to see that only 106 people have voted on it. I know this is not a total representation of how many people have actually seen it but I was surprised how such a wellknown film appears to be underseen although it may say more about the demographics of those that use this site most. This is not to imply that it is an excellent film but it is a well paced film that is enjoyable on its own terms. For those expecting great sentiment you will be let down likewise those expecting a Merchant Ivory film or a very comic film but those open to a nicely sensitive little tale that is slightly comic but more enjoyable for being restraining and being very true to the Englishness of its subjects and the polite behaviour of the period.Based on his own grandfather's diaries Palin has done a good job as both writer and director to capture the period and deal with the subject in a way that is unshowy but not stale sensitive and patient but never dull and comic without ever being so crude as to actually make you laugh out loud. It isn't fantastic of course but it is nicely lowkey and it is enjoyable for what it is. As actor Palin continues this good work and he delivers a very restrained and shy performance  even more amazing when you think this is a Python! Booth and Alvarado are both very attractive and restrained at the same time and effective if not memorable. Molina currently playing a superhero baddie plays a 'baddie' of another sort here and he pitches his character well to be dastardly while still keeping within the period. Support from Jones Firth Eddison and others is good and they all keep to the period and the material yet.Overall this is not an amazing film or even a really good one but what it is is a well written period drama that is delivered well enough to prevent it being dull and it comes over as a nice little film that is pleasing to watch even if it never sets the screen on fire. An undervalued little drama that is a well handled very personal film from Palin who does very well in all three of his roles.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is plenty of atmosphere in this film. It portrays the conflict that occurred in the universities of the day 1866 between the traditional and the newer blood that was required to bring the universities into the modern world. It is almost an allegory showing the old world Oxford as it battles against the influence of new ideas represented by the new world the 'American Friends'. Michael Palin is excellent in the role of Mr. Ashby. Throughout the film he portrays in a wonderful manner the bewilderment of facing the challenge of coming to terms with new order represented by Mr. Sime Alfred Molina in the challenge for the presidency of the college. In the end he follows his heart and probably his head as well and leaves the old world to its devices. Well worth watching.".

The answer is that Oxford did change but slowly and reluctantly.

Connie Booth Caroline Hartley manages to engage in some dialogue but the lovely Trini Alvarado Elinor is given very little to do except model Victorian frocks. Apart from perving at a distant male bather through binoculars the most interesting thing she does in the movie is to fall into a lake revealing a glimpse of ankles that are otherwise concealed under all those skirts and petticoats. But isn't all this authentic?  yes it is. A young lady was supposed to be decorously genteel  yes I know! But it takes a mental effort to realise that this code of female passivity was an essential aspect of an era that also featured Florence Nightingale Harriet Beecher Stowe George Eliot Ada Augusta King Annie Besant and Victoria Woodhull.Enter the villain. The villain is of course change reform progress  symbolised by Oliver Syme a role nicely understated by Alfred Molina. It's no surprise that Syme might have been considered by your typical puritan Victorian as a bit of a bounder  not entirely reliable in his relations with the fairer sex. Just like Ashby and the other college tutors Syme is a fellow  required to remain a celibate bachelor presumably for the rest of his life. The elderly college President is on his last legs and Syme is Ashby's main rival in the forthcoming election for a new President. But will a whiff of scandal discredit either of these candidates? Ashby met Caroline and Elinor when he was on holiday in Switzerland. Now they come to visit him in Oxford. But surely it's all completely innocent! Ashby is rather taken by these ladies but which one does he have the stronger feelings for? And which one has the stronger feelings for him? Nineteenth century decorum enables the movie to keep us guessing  or at least it tries to. And which impulse will win in the end?  Ashby's ambition to become college President or these unfamiliar stirrings of the heart? Meanwhile they're putting on an amateur production of King Lear  which doesn't seem to have much to do with the main plot. One of the people that Ashby met in Switzerland was an Oxford physician Dr Weeks Alun Armstrong. Weeks is trying to ingratiate himself with Ashby because he wants to get his son into the college. If the young chap is not up to it the oral entrance exam requires the memorisation of a hefty chunk of Latin will Ashby as chairman of the entrance panel turn Dr Weeks into a dangerous enemy? The bottom line You'll enjoy this movie? It depends. If you prefer a leisurely 10part TV adaptation of a Dickens novel to an overcooked twohour movie version then American Friends is probably for you. But you'll need to be paying attention. Things are happening even when nothing appears to be happening. I liked it.".

	schema:reviewBody "My wife saw this movie was scheduled to air uncut on the MGM channel and recorded it for me knowing that I'm a big Monty Python and Michael Palin fan. In fact I'm such a Python fan that I was surprised to find a film starring Palin and Connie Booth and featuring Simon Jones and Charles McKeown that I'd somehow never heard of. I'm guessing this movie wasn't very well promoted in the U.S. Which is not surprising as it deals with the very British subject of life at Oxford university in the nineteenth century and features dramatic roles from actors known on this side of the pond strictly for their comedy.Palin plays Mr. Ashby a teacher at Oxford who has devoted his entire life to his work and is in line to be voted the next president of the college when the elderly current president meets his end. Despite his protests Ashby's colleagues insist that he take a vacation. While hiking in the Alps he meets a single woman his own age Booth and her adopted daughter. For reasons that are never explained both women fall instantly and deeply in love with him. Seems pretty unlikely but there wouldn't be a film without it and apparently this is all based on a true story.Any hint of a romantic relationship would ruin Ashby's chances at the college presidency fellows at the college are expected to remain celibate so when the women follow him back to Oxford it becomes a scandal. Naturally Ashby's chief rival for the presidency Oliver Syme does everything he can to add fuel to the flames. Somehow no one seems to notice that Syme himself is a womanizer.In the end Ashby has to decide whether to keep trying to climb the career ladder at the college or leave and start a new life with one of the two women.So this obviously isn't a Pythonesque comedy  other than a few wry smiles it had hardly any humor at all. But the scenery is beautiful especially the scenes in the Alps and the atmosphere and acting are well done. The pace is a bit slow but it's a period drama so that's to be expected. In the end I enjoyed the movie even though it wasn't at all what I thought it would be.".

In fact I'm such a Python fan that I was surprised to find a film starring Palin and Connie Booth and featuring Simon Jones and Charles McKeown that I'd somehow never heard of. I'm guessing this movie wasn't very well promoted in the U.S. Which is not surprising as it deals with the very British subject of life at Oxford university in the nineteenth century and features dramatic roles from actors known on this side of the pond strictly for their comedy.Palin plays Mr. Ashby a teacher at Oxford who has devoted his entire life to his work and is in line to be voted the next president of the college when the elderly current president meets his end. Despite his protests Ashby's colleagues insist that he take a vacation. While hiking in the Alps he meets a single woman his own age Booth and her adopted daughter. For reasons that are never explained both women fall instantly and deeply in love with him. Seems pretty unlikely but there wouldn't be a film without it and apparently this is all based on a true story.Any hint of a romantic relationship would ruin Ashby's chances at the college presidency fellows at the college are expected to remain celibate so when the women follow him back to Oxford it becomes a scandal. Naturally Ashby's chief rival for the presidency Oliver Syme does everything he can to add fuel to the flames. Somehow no one seems to notice that Syme himself is a womanizer.In the end Ashby has to decide whether to keep trying to climb the career ladder at the college or leave and start a new life with one of the two women.So this obviously isn't a Pythonesque comedy  other than a few wry smiles it had hardly any humor at all. But the scenery is beautiful especially the scenes in the Alps and the atmosphere and acting are well done. The pace is a bit slow but it's a period drama so that's to be expected. In the end I enjoyed the movie even though it wasn't at all what I thought it would be.";

I usually hate Alfred Molina for no good reason but his character here although a villain actually became the most welcome presence on the screen because Molina at least brought some spark and energy and vibrancy to his part.The others seemed to be walking through a field of molasses. The casting was atrocious at least in my opinion. There was no one to root for. Palin is usually very likable but his approach to this part was wooden and monotonous. No shading at all. Not to mention that Michael Palin apparently thought that transforming his normal attractiveness into bigscreen unsightly was somehow more authentic and artsy. And if the audience is expected to care about his character's depicted romance how about casting an actress with some charisma some ability to enthrall and enchant. To make the filmed version of the truelife story believable. Or at least watchable.All in all it was a missed opportunity to make a good film. This one was in my opinion not worth watching. The back story is much more interesting than the film itself.".

When the movie took place 1866 they did not even allowing women on campus and it would take until 1959 until they were admitted as students. As it turned out he made the right decision choosing Eleanor over Oxford because the movie is based on his Great grandfather Edward Palin and as he said about the woman Elinor is based upon her name was Brita We married in Paris in 1867 and she has made me the happiest of men.

The producers interviewed several actual Freedom Fighters and other participants with various points of view so Torn from the Flag is not a mere repetition of the same news stories of the Hungarian Revolution we have heard many times before. In fact in 90 minutes the audience is shocked brought to tears witnesses the bloody struggle and the apparent shortlived victory which was achieved by the Freedom Fighters. Days later the Hungarians' joy of freedom and hope for independence was brutally crushed by a merciless overbearing dictatorial superpower which was followed by severe retribution by the new communist government. Desperation replaced hope in Hungary and the world stood by and did nothing. Why did the free world allow this suppression of liberty?This story must be told and kept alive so that current generations better understand what occurred and future generations do not forget this struggle for freedom.Thank you Ms.Kovacs and company for this valiant production!".

	onyx:emotionText "Torn from the Flag  How can I convey in words the emotion I felt and the education I received watching this documentary and do it justice?This documentary film shows the dramatic events which led to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and consequently the collapse of the USSR Communist state decades later. The producers interviewed several actual Freedom Fighters and other participants with various points of view so Torn from the Flag is not a mere repetition of the same news stories of the Hungarian Revolution we have heard many times before. In fact in 90 minutes the audience is shocked brought to tears witnesses the bloody struggle and the apparent shortlived victory which was achieved by the Freedom Fighters. Days later the Hungarians' joy of freedom and hope for independence was brutally crushed by a merciless overbearing dictatorial superpower which was followed by severe retribution by the new communist government. Desperation replaced hope in Hungary and the world stood by and did nothing. Why did the free world allow this suppression of liberty?This story must be told and kept alive so that current generations better understand what occurred and future generations do not forget this struggle for freedom.Thank you Ms.Kovacs and company for this valiant production!";

As a true documentary even though it presents facts by showing original footings of film reports and makes surviving participants speak  it does not draw conclusions. The viewer does that so much stronger. And the unavoidable conclusion is that communism is not the paradise for the working class but the hell that the soviet domination gained no friends only enemies and some collaborators who tried to get out that nobody was fighting for the system there are no elements of a civil war in that uprising it was only Hungarians against the soviet military that the young generation raised by communist indoctrination turned out to be the most ferocious enemy of the system and became the backbone of the revolution. The demand was not for material gains but for freedom and democracy not as a result of any outside influence but out of healthy human instinct the awakening of the soul. We also saw that the revolution was not planned prepared and organized it was completely spontaneous actually unexpected and surprising at that time. Because it would have been badly timed coinciding with the American presidential elections and the Suez Canal crisis. The West did not aid it to the contrary it was abandoned. I was lucky to see this film at its premiere as part of the AFI Fest. Everybody else should see it. The Hungarian 1956 event was the beginning of the collapse of the world communism and a proof that no system based on lies can survive too long.".

It looks at things with objectivity and shows the causes of the revolution the ensuing suppression and the eventual victory in the long run. To make this film which was an enormous task considering all the obstacles took a lot of courage on your part but you made it a success. For all of us who lived through the brutality of the dictatorial regime and then the Revolution the film gives back the sad and the shortlived happy memories of that time.

One problem is that there is too much time devoted to talking heads which got a bit boring at least for me. The director might have used more of the talk reminiscences and analysis as voiceovers while showing archival footage much of which is excellent. That could have tightened the film which needed greater variety of pace and a sense of buildup. That said I'm glad I saw it and I recommend it. It's good and worth seeing but don't expect a masterpiece. Some of the comments about it are from the heart and draw on personal memories and more intimate family? knowledge of the events.

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the film these are the initial words that came to my mind FAIR BALANCED AND EXTREMELY PROFESSIONALLY DONE! It is very hard not to be biased about this subject matter especially when almost all involved making this film are or were affected by that era. I am not just referring to the Freedom Fighters in 1956 I am also talking about those who were raised under Communism. One might think that this film could present an excellent opportunity for venting for hatred and everything that comes with that point of view however the film avoids it by all means. It shows both sides and gives a great historical recap of events before during and after 1956. The film would stand in history and could be shown to future generations as it is without bias or distortion about what happened. For that the filmmakers should be proud of themselves. The film's style may give you the feel of a History Channel program. I think that might be the case because of the outstanding production value and excellent professional work that we see on those TV programs. Today's documentary style is predominantly personal stories sometimes shot with a skeleton crew and shaky camera. Because this film's professional look one might think of television. Make no mistake this is a feature documentary that would stand in competition with others in film festivals and would have a great chance to rise above them. The technical aspect I would pay attention to the fantastic sound editing! Also the cinematographer's choice of showing the participants' faces in shadow is actually a fantastic choice. It makes it look interesting because we listen to their voice more so than watching the face that tells us the story or comments. The use of music is almost an extra character in the film the choices are superb. Overall I liked the film. As a Hungarian I imagine it likely speaks to me more than it might to a non Hungarian. However nonHungarian can use these historical events as a comparison to current events. The documentary films we see nowadays such as Michael Moore's Roger and Me or Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me started a trend take on gigantic corporations and fight them like Don Quixote. This film shows and states that this small country Hungary was able to fight a giant like the Soviet Unionand fought it by itself without any help. If the audience takes away from this film nothing else but this message of courage it is worthwhile.".

The Hungarians were free for 13 days. Even though the revolt was then militarily defeated the spirit of freedom never died. Hungary's revolt influenced other nations to stand up against the communist system. Multitalented filmmaker Producer Director Writer Klaudia Kovacs dreamt the story and carried through her dream.

	schema:reviewBody "The title Torn From the Flag is provocative. Since most of us hold our national flags to be sacred we know something is up when something is torn from it. The title foretold what I was about to see.My parents left Hungary in 1956 during the revolt. Compared to most viewers I thought I knew the story well both from dinner time conversation and from reading books about it such as Bridge at Andau or A Light in the Distance by Stephen Veres. We know how the story turns out and we think we know the story. As I watched the movie I realized that I had only a vague idea of the sociopolitical pressures that sowed the seeds of a revolution or how it got ignited. As it turns out I knew very little about the whole story.Watching this movie was like being punched in the gut. I was powerfully moved. The movie made me feel like I was there right in the middle of it. I was spell bound through the whole movie. The interviews were extraordinarily powerful. Each was a unique account of the same event from that individual's perspective relating how they were swept along by the events of the time. As a viewer my imagination filled in the pictures as they were telling their stories. One could even feel sympathy for the Russian soldier or the midlevel politicians trying to deal with things way beyond their control.The story of 1956 is both tragic and heroic at the same time. So many people sacrificed their lives seeking the freedoms that we take for granted here in the USA. This is a story that is still painful and tugs at the hearts of Hungarians everywhere for reasons that nonHungarians will never understand.What all people should understand is how absolute power corrupts absolutely the importance of civil liberties and free speech and how quickly a totalitarian government can install itself or be ousted. This is a story that could happen anywhere at anytime in any culture in any language. We would do well to learn the lessons of 1956. This movie helps us learn those lessons. Watch the movie.".

Rae's boyfriend Ronnie goaded by the man who nearly beat Rae to death misunderstands the relationship between Lazarus and Rae and vows to kill him. Lazarus exhibiting a streetsmart understanding of violence and its motives calls Ronnie's bluff senses that he is as troubled as Rae and becomes a guiding force in the young couple's resurrection.";

When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie. But of course I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another. The story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live. Of course I do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from Sam Jackson Christina Ricci andyes even Justin Timberlake I encourage you to see 'Black Snake Moan'.".

Last time I saw Craig Brewer he was singing Ike and Tina to the audience and turning Sundance upside down with his breakout film Hustle and Flow. This time around he fulfills on his big Sundance payday with another unique vision thats going to get everyone talking about Samuel L Jackson and if you thought Christina Ricci was just that girl in the Addams Family movies then think again. Ricci plays Rae a complete mess of a women who without her beloved Ronnie played by the getting better all the time Justin Timberlake has an uncontrollable need for all things sexual. When Ronnie leaves for the a tour with the Army Rae's demons send her tumbling down a bumpy road that leaves her used and abused left for dead on the side of the road. Along comes old bluesman Lazarus played by the great Samuel L Jackon Lazarus himself has a few demons lurking around in his head as well notably his exwife who done wrong by him. Lazarus gets to think about this young women and after some soul searching he takes it upon himself to cure her evil ways with some love some lessons and a 40 lb. chain. I don't want to reveal too much so I'll just say there's some dark moments some very funny moments and whole lot of great acting. This movie isn't by any means Hustle  Flow 2 however Craig Brewer does tie the two films together with his hope for redemption and change for the better for even the most unlikely of people. Audiences will find a movie worth watching here and worth thinking about well after it ends.".

It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the Black Snake Moan is by the time you leave the theater you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a great job and is thoroughly convincing in her role as is Samuel L Jackson. I think this is his best performance since his role in Pulp Fiction and probably his best including that because of the range of his character in BSM. The rest of the cast is solid with a few shining performances here and there particularly John Cothran Jr as Reverend R. L.. I'm a very selective movie watcher and this film honestly rates among my favorites because of its candid look at race sex religion and neurosis in a rural southern town along with its cinematic genius in my opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than Paramount Vantage's latest release 'Black Snake Moan'. Not exactly looking for what I just described you say? Well then you best get ya wits 'bout yaself and mosey on down to your local theater and still see it as Samuel L. Jackson's character Lazarus would say. As long as you're open minded and don't take everything seriously there's no reason you won't leave the theater glad you saw it.In the third offering from director Craig Brewer we are taken into the deep south where as the tagline to the film claims everything is hotter. While there we're introduced to the Godfearing bluesman Lazarus as previously said played by Jackson and the almost always half naked Rae a role bravely taken on by Christina Ricci. In the film this unlikely pair cross paths long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from one another. Both lessons ultimately convey the message to us the audience that no matter what we are all human. No one is perfect and if everyone would realize that then we'd be a lot better off. The question of if this will be understood or be accepted by all who see the film is another story.One thing not up for debate is how great Jackson and Ricci both are here. You'd think with the role of a sexcrazed woman overacting would be a given but no not here. Ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also doubles as her best to date. Then we have Jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he even is. Sadly the third star of the film Justin Timberlake who plays Rae's militarybound boyfriend isn't all that great. At the start he fails miserably as he appears to be trying too hard. Later on he steps it up some still he's far from the level he reached in January's 'Alpha Dog'.The other thing 'Black Snake Moan' boasts is a splendid soundtrack. Containing tracks from The Black Keys John Doe pieces from the score done by Scott Bomar  of course four count 'em four tracks from Jackson himself. It's actually one of his songs the main performance of the film 'Stackolee' that is the fuel to the fire of this great collection. It alone is worth the ticket price. Other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are Bomar's 'The Chain' 'When the Lights Go Out' from the Black Keys  the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where Lazarus sings to Rae on a stormy night.The efforts of Craig Brewer can't go without mention though. His last film 'Hustle  Flow' which ended up surpassing low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map. What he has done with 'Black Snake Moan' will be what sets him apart from other newbies to the industry. He not only directed 'Moan' but also wrote its screenplay. The end result is a story that is surprising and clever. As you watch you feel like you know exactly where it's headed despite its valiant composure. Just as you think you've predicted the next move Brewer shifts gears and takes an entirely different route. There are however some blotches within the screenplay. The background characters are drab and flat while the ending is somewhat disappointing. It left me craving for something more exciting. After so many highs I guess the final scenes were a tad weak compared to the rest of the film.I imagine the majority of people who see 'Black Snake Moan' won't enjoy it due to the fact they won't be able to stop themselves from thinking how unlikely the situations are. The depressing part about that is there are many other films with just as unlikely even more outrageous scenarios that are widely well received. It's the issues of race religious motives  sexuality the film exhibits that will have more effect on opinion than anything. The idea of a black man chaining a white woman up in his house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it. Simply put it's not for everyone. Like I said to fully enjoy it you have to go in with an open mind or else you're just wasting your money. For those of you who can do that I highly recommend it.".

But just to continue this honest streak I have to admit that Jackson and Ricci are so good in their roles that they were able to pull me into the story and keep a grip on my interest.Combining a sweltering Southern setting blood and guts blues riffs and a little unexpected Bible imagery Brewer has definitely given this film a style of its own and an atmosphere that's as effective as the actors in telling this strange little tale of love and redemption.Though its aspirations run higher there's no denying that the film has its moments of exploitation. Ricci's halfnakedness for 75 of the film is testament to that. Those of you with more delicate palates might experience a little discomfort watching this and understandably so. It's raw. It's ugly. It's dirty. Even Brewer agrees that this isn't exactly for everybody.And that's what makes this such an odd movie to pin down. On one hand I don't think I'd ever have a need to see it again. But on the other I'm kind of curious how my opinion might be affected via a second viewing. Did I really like it? Or did I merely appreciate the effort and success in Brewer's ability to tell his unusual story in his own unconventional way? It's definitely a film that inspires discussion ... and a wide variety of adjectives. Strange. Overthetop. Interesting. Unique. Uncomfortable. Take your pick. All these things combine to make it the theatrical experience that it unashamedly is.It feels like a gritty twisted blues song come alive on screen. It's a character study and if you have any hope of enjoying it then you must accept the fact that the film doesn't shy away from showcasing the underbelly of a very disturbed young woman and the path she's traveling.No it's not for everybody. But love it or hate it I feel safe in saying you likely won't see anything else like it this year. Proceed at your own caution. Just remember everything is indeed hotter down South.THE GISTBlack Snake Moan is the type of film that makes you stop and examine your audience before deciding who to recommend it to. It features very solid acting a great atmosphere and a strangely different story. But it also gets a bit sick and twisted at times and has no problems doing so. Take my words to heart and then go with your instinct on this one.".

It's a character study and if you have any hope of enjoying it then you must accept the fact that the film doesn't shy away from showcasing the underbelly of a very disturbed young woman and the path she's traveling.No it's not for everybody. But love it or hate it I feel safe in saying you likely won't see anything else like it this year. Proceed at your own caution. Just remember everything is indeed hotter down South.THE GISTBlack Snake Moan is the type of film that makes you stop and examine your audience before deciding who to recommend it to. It features very solid acting a great atmosphere and a strangely different story. But it also gets a bit sick and twisted at times and has no problems doing so. Take my words to heart and then go with your instinct on this one.";

	schema:reviewBody "I knew as soon as I saw the first trailer for Black Snake Moan that I would have to see it. I was not disappointed in the slightest in the film which was written and directed by Hustle and Flow's creator Craig Brewer. It tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake but also his own...yet it's so much more than that. It's complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty sticky sultry blue Memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterward.The characters are for the most part multifaceted and very wellwritten and performed. The accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly. However there was one weak link in the chain Justin Timberlake. The best I can say for him is that he can pull off crying...it's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. However Justin's Ronnie was flat but as an actor he was trying very hard. I would definitely give him another chance.Lazarus and Rae Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci respectively have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other. This is one of those films where it doesn't matter how good one actor is if the other one isn't up to the task and luckily both of the actors were up to the task.The music was very bit as good as you would expect especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson sings the blues. Phenomenal.On the technical side all was brilliance as far as I could see. It was welledited well shot and wellmixed...everything was great. The character and set designs were just right the casting of the supporting characters even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards was spot on... Loved it.".

	schema:headline " This little light of mineBlack Snake Moan";
	schema:reviewBody "Craig Brewer is now officially a writerdirector for whom I will see any film by no matter how bad it may look. His debut Hustle and Flow was one of my favorites from that year with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great the trailer used music effectively however it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity and fast. Fortunately Black Snake Moan hits all its marks deadon. The acting is astonishing the writing superb and the editing style as well as juxtaposed music riveting the whole way. Brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption.The first moment I knew I was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning. Like he did with Hustle and Flow Brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically. The 70's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema's best. From here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both Lazarus and Rae each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose. Rae's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and Laz's wife leaves him for his brother. Each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situationRae to sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear.Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him. There are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with his captivepatient. You never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well. Also the character of Rae is not chained up for very long despite what the trailers would have you believe. The situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two. As for that chained girl Christina Ricci really shines. I never really saw her as anything special but this role is a true breakthrough for her. This girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down. Any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away. Her nymphomania is not for pleasure but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids. Ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism. Mention must also be made of Justin Timberlake again showing some real acting talent. Where this guy came from I have no clue but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns out.While not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow Moan still ranks equally to it in my mind because when it is on it is spectacular. Towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with This Little Light of Mine singing out and earlier the interaction between captive and captor when the chain is first introduced shows some topnotch work. The truly magical moment though is when Jackson sings yes that is him throughout like it was Terrence Howard in Hustle the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker. If I don't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year I won't be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing I think I really enjoy with Brewer's work is the fact that he doesn't show sinners becoming redeemed heroes. Instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been or how bad life has been everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people. We don't have saints here but fallible people looking to right their ship. If the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness no one really knows but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could.".

	schema:headline " Black Snake Moan is off the chain great.";
	schema:reviewBody "The title of this film Black Snake Moan refers to a really old song by country blues musician Blind Lemmon Jefferson in which the singer talks about his sexual addiction and his moans for love once more. Full of explicit sexual nuances Jefferson's song full of unconventional melodic style and utilization of double entendres was able to fly pass the radar of censorship back in the 1920s. As much I like how Jefferson was able to pioneer this style of music. I have to say actor Samuel Jackson sings the song so much better than Blind Lemmon Jefferson ever did. Jackson was really able to update the song to fit with this new generation with his electric guitar playing deep shouting gravitas voice and depth of his character's backstory. It was very moving part of the film. Honestly most of this movie is very compelling with its controversial subjects that include but are not limited to rape sexual addiction parental abuse anxiety disorders and religious outlooks. Without spoiling this polarizing film too much I have to say I kinda like the story of the grumpy hermit former Blues singer Lazarus Redd Samuel L. Jackson trying to rebuild his life after a nasty divorce while also trying hard to cure a known nymphomaniac Rae Doole Christina Ricci from her faults. It made for a very welltold story. I love all the metaphors and symbolism that this film has to offer too. A good example of one is the chain that Rae wears around her waist during most of the film and the type of shirt she is wearing. If you don't realize it already Rae represented the South and its struggles after the American Civil War. Not only does her chain represented the heavy weight of learning to live with the mistakes and haunts of the past but her chained up character is also standin for the continuous ignored issue of modern day slavery. After all the region is known for being a strong bible belt but it also been known to keep that belt unbuckled when it comes to the dangers of having too lust over the sense of love. The high reports of human trafficking sexual abuse and sex slaves is signed of that. Although the chain can represented something bad and naughty it also can somewhat represented the unity that the South has with its supply chain when it comes to addressing the issue in hand. There is no bigger metaphor of that than the radiator in which Lazarus chain up Rae. It represented the ever changing social climate of the South as conflicts can indeed heat up or cool down. No matter how far you run away from your issues. You will always been weighted down by what society thinks and wants from you. It's only when you able to address the past and learn to live with yourself in a moral life is when the removal of the chain can be seem as a meaningful step toward a better future. Another thing I like about this film is that Lazarus isn't a mysterious 'magical black negro' type character with no backstory nor does Rae represented the 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' that is there to save his soul. In many ways both characters are welldefined with each having their own issues to deal with on their own with or without the help from the other. Nobody is depended on the other at all. Like Lazarus's namesake it's about the redemption and resurrection of two clearly mess up people. However people might not see that through the film's poster and exploitation marketing. The way they market this movie makes it seem like a more like a porno than a character study film. It really does overblows the potential fetish fuel of the film at the expense of everything else. It's not the best. Don't get me wrong Christina Ricci is one attractive woman but her character wasn't made just for nudity and fan service. She really put some work in showing how ugly and unhealthy Rae can really be. She really does look pale and pasty. Even Samuel L. Jackson ugly himself up by letting his hair grow out not dying or shaving to show how washup his character has become. Both actors really made their character their own. I also have to give mad props to both the supporting actors in this film. Justin Timberlake as Rae's boyfriend Ronnie was great. He really was able to show his character emotional crutch with the way his body language moves. He really did seem like he suffers from extreme social anxiety. It really shows Hollywood that the thennewly made solo singer can indeed acted. Another person that need some praise is Michael RaymondJames as Ronnie's friend Gill Morton. He was able to show both his loving cares and hateful lust for Rae making his performance a very sympathetically reallife person. Even thought he tries to make advances on Rae which is a nono in my picture I still can understand what stress he had to deal with when dealing with mess up people who supposed to be your friends. Overall While still many viewers will undoubtedly be offended by director Craig Brewer's representation of a stillsegregated racist South I have to say I love how the film acknowledges the importance of sex while also highlighting the danger of having sex irresponsibly all without being too heavyhanded and preachy. I also cherish the film for its use of 'Delta Blues' type music and how wellshot it was. In the end this clever morality tale about two unlikely characters is a mustwatch. I do recommended. It's pleasantly amazing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce abandonment sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North Midwest and West Coast the town minister who also grapples with his own problems becomes the counselor and mediator. It is a interesting concept and one that may not settle well with everyone.Brewer shows us the region he grew up in. Yes it is still tainted with racial problems though worse problems exist in many metropolitan cities. This is in the subtext and not the main plot of the story. People live a more simple lifestyle yet life is still complex and excruciating.Jackson and Ricci do a fantastic job in this film. Jackson the agingformer blues guitarist who eeks out a living on his small farm. His wife of 12 years leaves him for his brother so he spirals into depression. Meanwhile Ricci and Justin Timberlake have a last wild sexually charged night before he ships off to the Army. Ricci suffers from a childhood of sexual abuse though that isn't revealed until later her torment can only be quenched by sexual forays with various boys Black and White in the town.When Ricci is beat up and left for dead on the road near Jacksons farm he finds her and nurses her back to health. He believes it is divine intervention that this halfnaked White girl is left in his care. He clutches his Bible and prays for guidance. He refuses her sexual advances and instead treats her with dignity respect and care. Something few men in her life have ever done.She in time sees Jackson as a man of honor and morals yet he also carries his own pain. He plays his guitar and sings to her. Yes it's the Blues and damn good too With the minister counseling her she slowly understands how to deal with her childhood sexual abuse. Jackson through Ricci's transformation realizes he must let his own pain heal.Justin Timberlake comes back discharged due to anxiety problems. As he searches for Ricci who has been living with Jackson during her recovery he finds out she has been promiscuous and unfaithful to him.He finds her and Jackson at a bar where Jackson has decided as part of his healing process to come out retirement and play the Blues again. Timberlake follows them home and confronts Jackson and Ricci.You will have to see the movie to get the rest of the story. Should you decide to see this film remember to look at it from the aspect of a foreign or independent movie. It is a slice of life from a particular region of America that few of us get to see. It is interesting and revealing. It also shows us that regardless of the color of our skin we all have similar problems that can be fixed with similar solutions.".

Ricci suffers from a childhood of sexual abuse though that isn't revealed until later her torment can only be quenched by sexual forays with various boys Black and White in the town.When Ricci is beat up and left for dead on the road near Jacksons farm he finds her and nurses her back to health. He believes it is divine intervention that this halfnaked White girl is left in his care. He clutches his Bible and prays for guidance. He refuses her sexual advances and instead treats her with dignity respect and care. Something few men in her life have ever done.She in time sees Jackson as a man of honor and morals yet he also carries his own pain. He plays his guitar and sings to her. Yes it's the Blues and damn good too With the minister counseling her she slowly understands how to deal with her childhood sexual abuse. Jackson through Ricci's transformation realizes he must let his own pain heal.Justin Timberlake comes back discharged due to anxiety problems. As he searches for Ricci who has been living with Jackson during her recovery he finds out she has been promiscuous and unfaithful to him.He finds her and Jackson at a bar where Jackson has decided as part of his healing process to come out retirement and play the Blues again. Timberlake follows them home and confronts Jackson and Ricci.You will have to see the movie to get the rest of the story. Should you decide to see this film remember to look at it from the aspect of a foreign or independent movie. It is a slice of life from a particular region of America that few of us get to see. It is interesting and revealing. It also shows us that regardless of the color of our skin we all have similar problems that can be fixed with similar solutions.";

When her boyfriend Ronnie Justin Timberlake is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae and tries to kill him.Black Snake Moan is a weird tale of faith hope love and blues. The gifted Christina Ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp abused since her childhood by her father and having had sex with the whole town where she lives. It is amazing the versatility of this actress and probably this is the most mature work that I have seen Christina Ricci perform. Samuel L. Jackson has also a fantastic performance in the role of Lazarus. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I have ever heard in a movie with wonderful blues. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Entre o Cu e o Inferno Between the Heaven and the Hell".

	schema:reviewBody "If ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper it would be this one. Here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy softporn sm flick complete with the huge intheatre poster depicting a nearnaked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you if ever a film springs to life on celluloid major big time with soulful power to spare it's Craig Brewer's redemptive followup to Hustle  Flow Black Snake Moan.Unashamedly over the top from the get go this film sucks you in with the opening scenes and proceeds to dig deeper and deeper in with every subsequent frame. It's yer basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find in each other the strength and courage to move on in more positive ways with their lives. Been done before of course this tale but as I've always said it's the manner in which a story is told that gives it heart depth meaning and power.Ricci's damagedbychildhoodabuse wildchild character Rae and Jackson's equally soulsick musician character Lazarus find each other under desperate circumstances and Laz takes it upon himself to try to help Rae. This in itself is relatively unique the idea of a man trying to genuinely help a woman who is in serious pain rather than trying to take further advantage of her and we know from the onset that Laz's heart and the film's heart is in the right place. The movie at its core is about the redemptive healing power of love with music as a very close second and the film resonates profoundly with this truth  soulfully artfully and brilliantly.A major reason the film succeeds so profoundly is because of the fierce committed performances from Ricci and Jackson. Scenes that would have come off as laughable and pathetic in lesser artists' hands are instead powerful as all getout. In particular the film's arc scene in which Jackson sings and plays the song of the title alone in his house with Ricci amidst a serious thunderstorm and the abusive demons from Rae's past running amok inside her head leading her to crawl to Lazarus and cling to his leg comes off not ridiculous as technically it should but rather as gutwrenchingly cathartic. All the supporting performances are fantastic here too. Justin Timberlake is completely believable as Rae's anxietyridden boyfriend Ronnie and the alwayswonderful S. Epatha Merkerson is also perfectly cast as a character who obviously has feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is outstanding as well as Laz's reverend friend R.L. a nod to blues musician R. L. Burnside no doubt. Everything works about this movie let's face it including the musicsoundtrack which features Burnside Scott Bomar Bobby Rush Son House and most importantly Jackson himself whose fantastic version of Stackolee I am listening to as I compose this review. There's also a really beautiful and moving version of This Little Light of Mine featured in the film sung heartbreakingly tentative and soft by Ricci.Samuel Jackson has said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this movie is the best of his career thus far I could not agree with him more. This is work that he can be monumentally proud of along with everyone else involved in this audacious supremely wise and deeply heartfelt motherucker of a project.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie had a notion to be something gritty and provocative but with all its dirty talk and softcore sex ends up being some kind of whitetrash fairy tale where the fairy godmother is a black semilegendary bluesman who's having his own crisis of faith. If you don't automatically flash to Robert Johnson down at the crossroads there are some clips of Son House talking about the real meaning of the blues. Stereotypes abound in Black Snake Moan which isn't a bad thing when you're trying to create an allegory for race relations down in the delta and how much nobler rural southern blacks are than their ignorant immoral white counterparts. Having grown up white in the south in the 50s and 60s I know there's quite a bit of truth in that.Christina Ricci is pretty good in this symbolic role plenty ignorant and even more immoral a nymphomaniac who of course was a victim of incestuous abuse as a child. Sam Jackson is engaging as a soulsearching honest truck farmer who hung up his Gibson a few years before to marry and have a family which didn't work out the way he'd hoped. The extreme sex drugs and violence in the girl's life foreshadow a dark tale but the story quickly devolves into a black comedy with a tidy Hollywood ending.A little more realism would have helped. For instance when Rae takes four vicious punches to the face she should have looked a whole lot more swollen instead of her petite features smeared with some fake dried blood and 2 days later it's barely noticeable. If she had done an elephantman number for the middle of the movie imagine she probably would be frontrunner for an Oscar next year. Think Charlize. She still may be if only for the way she acts circles around Justin Timberlake who is not quite bad and keeps up pretty admirably with Sam Jackson.".

Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hookup with a man. After a party Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day Lazarus Samuel L. Jackson finds Rae and carries her home. Lazarus gives medical care to Rae and believes that he can also save her from herself. Rae is like a dog in heat so Lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men. Lazarus has problems of his own because his wife has just left him for another man. Lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain.My Comment The movie has a deep meaning to it once you get past the sex and violence. The film has a different feel to it. The story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there. The 40 pound chain is a good metaphor and symbolic of a chastity belt. You don't give love away to anyone but you keep it for your true love. The chain could also be a parallel to a wife who is chained to the kitchen yet Rae didn't cook. Rae only wanted to have sex all the time whereas a wife may not. I think Craig Brewer writer  director has made an extraordinary movie and Samuel L. Jackson sings a mean blues song. The story is emotionally charged tackling the subjects of race religion music and sex all into one. Paramount Classics Run time 156 Rated R810".

It is in these harrowing yet comical sequences of chained delight excelling no doubt with a nearperfect score where two entirely different souls learn to benefit from one another in this peculiarly endearing way that will have audience members shouting at the screen in joy for some of the new year's most hilarious and wicked scripting that is if they are not offended past the point of realizing how unrealistic it is all trying to be. Jackson in a positively refreshing return to character acting roots offers some of his strongest most perceptive line readings this side of the late 90's finally helping to burst my cynicism about all the similar lazy characters he has been coasting through for nearly a decade. Fans of this icon will be in heaven to see Mr. Jackson finally give out another noteworthy and memorable performance which sees the former Jedi and Hitman slip into guitarslingin dirty blues mode without batting an eyelash.

	schema:headline " Absurd SouthernFried Melodrama Never Transcends Its Audacious Premise";
	schema:reviewBody "It would be too easy to dismiss this strangely unsatisfying 2007 film entirely because I can't tell whether directorwriter Craig Brewer Hustle  Flow is trying to satirize the Southern Gothic sensibilities of a Tennessee Williams potboiler or replicate the excesses of an early 1970's blaxploitation movie. Either way he cannot seem to pull off his audacious premise which involves a cuckolded blues guitarist appropriately named Lazarus who enchains a nymphomaniac to his radiator. If the film was played out as overthetop as the premise then it might have had a fighting chance but as it stands Brewer is too ensconced in his chickenfried fable to mine the potential black comedy in this hilariously preposterous exercise.The hackneyed plot centers on Lazarus a selfrighteous man stinging from his wife's decision to leave him for his younger brother. Meanwhile a skeletal nymphomaniac Rae is so distraught over her boyfriend Ronnie leaving for the army that she goes on a hedonistic meltdown involving alcohol prescription drugs and indiscriminate sex. A violent episode leaves her unconscious on the road where Lazarus finds her limp body. The rest of the film focuses on how the principals change from the ordeal but not before facing a lot of inner demons along the way. However unlike Hustle  Flow I cannot really say that I cared about the fate of these misbegotten characters at the end. Brewer just can't seem to connect the absurdity of the central situation with anything resembling real life which ironically may be exactly his point here.The actors try hard to breathe empathetic life into the overripe characters but they are ultimately defeated by the lurid dimensions of the story. As Lazarus Samuel L. Jackson almost makes the situation palatable and even sings several blues numbers with surprising conviction but Christina Ricci makes Rae a primal stockpile of white trash clichs on top of a condescending back story. Justin Timberlake is completely out of his league as Ronnie and neutralizes every scene he's in with his amateur standing as an actor. Look for former child star Kim Richards Escape to Witch Mountain as Rae's defeated mother and a doozy of a fight scene between the two in a grocery store. The 2007 DVD has plenty of extras including an enthusiastic commentary track by Brewer and a halfhour makingof documentary Conflicted The Making of Black Snake Moan. There are a couple of shorter featurettes about the music and five deleted scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the ripe old age of 27 Christina Ricci already has almost fifty credits in IMDb but her work here as the redneck nymphomaniac in Black Snake Moan is the best I've seen with Monster a close second. A part like this almost can't be overplayed. Sporting a rebelflag tanktop and often little else and funky tattoos and armed with cigarettes booze drugs and other fun props including a very very very long heavy chain no false advertising here folks Ricci shoots the moon and swandives gloriously into her abusedandabusive character. I didn't even notice her enormous forehead this time mostly her enormous eyes and yeah other bodily parts which are just as waiflike as those of say Winona Ryder but edgier and less calculatedseeming. Like Blanche DuBois her character Rae really does depend on the kindness of strangers but gets precious little of that for most of the running time.With her boyfriend Justin somebody was in some band or something? off to the army Rae finds a huge void in her life and shades of Breaking the Waves tries to fill it with sex with anything on two legs. Beaten and dumped on a backwoods road by yet another wouldbe partner she's discovered by semiretired musician and small farmer Lazarus played by Samuel L. Jackson. Not trying to dis Jackson by not mentioning him earlierhe's great here goldcapped teeth and all just that his part seems an amalgam of parts he's played before even his shambling gait seems borrowed from a similar role in A Time to Kill. Lazarus is in a kind of funk of his own having been dumped by his wife for his younger brother whom he then almost kills in a bar. For me the least convincing moment of Moan is when Lazarus makes a seemingly snap decision to carry the unconscious Rae into his house instead of just going back inside to make an anonymous call to the sheriff we just have to make a leap of faith there. With his open Bible in front of him I'd be curious what passage that was he decides he must not only nurse her back to health but keep her chained to the radiator until she gives up her wanton ways.Kudos to writerdirector Craig Brewer for making what ensues seem not only believable but entirely natural even preordained. Here as in his previous Hustle  Flow he shows great talent for being lifeaffirming without the usual accompanying sappiness. His characters grope towards redemption with a little help from their friends. There's no conventional happy ending but at least they're off the path to selfdestruction for now. Both movies also have a musical theme I for one greatly prefer gutbucket blues to hiphop so I may even buy the soundtrack for this one. The food looked damn good too good thing I don't live in the South I'd probably weigh a ton. So treat yourself to Black Snake Moan possible sleeper hit of the year.By the way is there anyone who hasn't wanted to walk the road in front of an impatient truck driver and flip him off at least once in a lifetime preferably without getting killed?".

	schema:headline " Technically Stunning";
	schema:reviewBody "Tom Tykwer has truly proven himself as the filmmaker to watch. The little known German director has produced a modernday masterpiece a dazzling technical film about how life consists of the decisions we make.Lola Franka Potente receives a phone call from her boyfriend Manni. Moritz Bleibtreii Manni accidentally leaves a bag carrying 100 000 on a train which is picked up by a homeless man. This leaves Manni in quite a predicament. He is supposed to deliver the money to a gangster by noon if he fails then he is likely to be killed. Lola has twenty minutes to save his boyfriend. Twenty short minutes to somehow find the money and get it to him.Run Lola Run is a film you expect to see at a Independent film festival or in a Professor's office at a film school. In no way do I mean that in a negative way I mean not to intend that the film is of a lower standard with lower production values rather that the film is a beautifully mastered technical film that uses every filmmaking technique in the book. It is refreshing to see a film like this in the midst of the commercialised drycut 'traditional' filmmaking that we see on the silver screen so regularly.As stated before the film attempts to use a wide range of filmmaking techniques to help get the director's meaning and vision across to the audience. Some of these include speedup instant replay black and white and even animation in some parts.It may sound strange but the film is twentyminutes long. Well not really but it is in context. Tykwer focuses on the twentyminutes that Lola has and shows that twentyminutes three times over each time with small differences will affect the outcome of the characters. The danger with this kind of technique is that it can threaten to be repetitive. However the new additions added by Tykwer are very clever and link in perfectly which will have you gasping for more.Tykwer wrote and directed this film and while doing this he never lost sight of his meaning. His meaning that he is trying to express is that life consists of the decisions we make. While watching the film this becomes increasingly evident. He also likes to emphasise that time is against Lola during the film. This can be seen when a young woman walks past and Lola asks her for the time the next shot shows a much older woman answering her question hence showing the importance of time.Franka Potente gave a good performance as Lola. Yet it is hard to say that she was fantastic because it is a role that requires a great deal of physical acting and we didn't get to know a lot about Lola hence the film wasn't overlyfocusing on her issues rather her boyfriend's problem. The real standout performance from my point of view came from Moritz Bleibtreii. He actually took on a quite challenging role and pulls it off successfully. He achieves his objective of getting the audience to feel sympathy for the position that he is in.Run Lola Run is without a doubt one of the best technical films ever made. A profound exciting new age masterpiece that has well and truly left its mark on the film industry.Five out of Five.".

	schema:headline " One of the best circular narratives!";
	schema:reviewBody "This modern German film from 1999that was so stunning and brilliantly edited won many awards at the Sundance Film Festival. The audience was taken away on this fast pace exhilarating ride which in turn warrants those watching to think about the circular narrative and its elements. All elements of the film including soundtrack and opening credits are incorporated into this them of a story being told through three different threads and three different experiences. The opening credits are displayed in cartoon form as well as some of the travelingrunning that Lola Franka Potente does through out the film. The soundtrack fills the film with a fast paced feeling and adds to the heartpumping adrenalin rush that element of limited time creates. Fast camera angles the use of panning the incorporation of cartoons the use of outdoor scenery  no sound stage used and close face shots are some of the main filming techniques used to make what I can only describe as an MTV video style of film making. The use of high speed camera shows areas of the plot that remains constant while the hi 8 camera is used in portions of the plot that changes in each of the 3 episodes. Also the use of red tinting shows a difference from real life and inside the characters thoughts. The audience is placed into the middle of the plot there is no real introduction to the main characters Lola and Manni  Moritz Bleibtreu until after the main crisis of a loss of a bag filled of money that is suppose to be in the hands of a crook gangster with in the next 20 min from the time of the main character's conversation. This discussion is repeated 3 times until the characters successfully complete the task that lays before them. They either have to produce a replacement bag of money or find the missing sack. In each of the 3 episodes the same characters are present as well as the same events but they either are incorporated or interact differently. For example each episode has glass shattering. If the red ambulance does not crash through glass that is being carried across a main highway then glass is broken by Lola screaming. Each episode also has elements of time breaking of time the different use of fire arm running and the use of the same script by the characters. The episodes are broken apart by either Manni or Lola dying and in these deaths the audience is brought into the head of the characters to where they talk of love life death and loss. The audience is shown a place where the characters have a choice which in turn is how they can relive the same morning events. This allows the audience to discover new interactions amongst the characters discover new pieces of each story and how fit into one overall tapestry of a day in the characters lives. This film grabs the audience from the very beginning and proceeds to take them on an intense ride filled with lows and highs. One that can be watched over and over again due to the lack of information or images that is constantly being discovered. The complex and layered tale that unfolds in Run Lola Run is amazingly and almost unbelievably made better through the editing film footage style and soundtrack. The unusually dramatic images and different style than other films of the latter 90's sets Run Lola Run in a class of it's own".

	schema:reviewBody "Run Lola Run. What a cool title.It tells the tale of a young man Manni who one day was doing a job for crime boss. The job was just to deliver a bag of money to him with 100000 DM which roughly translates to 20000 or 25000 US. Unfortunatly Manni leaves the money on a train and is totally screwed unless he can get the money back in 20 minutes. So he calls his girlfriend Lola and no she is not the girl from The Fifth Element for help. From here the film follows Lola choosing three paths each going for 20 minutes to getting the money for Manni.Run Lola Run is a wonderful study of how life consists of the paths we take. Some say there is no right and wrong paths to take in life but Run Lola Run seems to illustrate that the right path is the best. Franka Potente Lola does a wonderful job and must have lost about 10 pounds for all the running she does in this film. But the real star here is Tom Tykwer the director who vison for this film is so fantastic and cool.In terms of coolness this has to be one of the coolest movies ever made. It contains black and white camera animation three or four different types of slow motion fast motion and the most amazing still shots taken for a film which is enough to keep anyone interested. Plus this film is only 80 minutes long but luckily it feels about 20 minutes longer than that.After being one of the most talked about films of 1998 I would safely say that Run Lola Run has inspired a large number of film makers. Run Lola Run is a modern masterpiece and should pave the way for the future of films.".

Mr Tykwer made an excellent impression with this film which introduced us to this talented director. Having seen Heaven and True Lola rennt is by far a superior effort from Mr. Tykwer.The premise of the film is a clever one. Lola in twenty minutes must solve the mystery in which she is drawn into. At each of this situations Lola shows great resources about how to help her petty criminal boyfriend who has lost 100000 DM and now must account for the missing money.Franka Potente is the main reason why this movie works the way it does. She is almost like the cartoon character one sees in the opening credits. Lola is larger than life and shows she can do anything she wants because of her resolve. Ms. Potente brings freshness to the role and she totally captivates the viewer in her nononsense approach to life in general. The supporting cast does good work under Mr. Tykwer's direction.It's a puzzle why Hollywood hasn't made an attempt to remake this film since the Americans are obsessed with redoing material like Run Lola Run. Let's hope they don't try!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen the movie several times and each time I find new details and nuances that add to the story and the movies as an audiovisual delight. Friends of mine introduced me to the sound track at first on a high quality stereo system. It was amazing. I went home and ordered the CD. I am no great fan of techno music but that first track made me hold my breath because of its beauty. It felt like sitting in a cathedral and listening to a simple choral. I know awkward comparison but...A few observations of my own. Lola's first run reveals that her father believes she is not his biological daughter calls her a cuckoos egg. And it's quite possible since we see her mom in all 3 runs talking on the phone with someone other than her husband. Lola is devastated. All three runs feature the bank security guard trying to calm down Lola giving her support. Every time they have intense eye contact some silent understanding. He once even greets her with Da bist du ja Liebling there you are darling. Quite strange for a bank employee to call his boss' daughter that don't you think? We also see early on that he might have a heart condition. In the last story segment we see the guard again in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Lola caught a ride for a change to her meeting destination with Manni. Miraculously the guard's heart condition improves as his hand reaches toward Lola's. The medic at first annoyed what the heck are you doing here? is puzzled. Lola's answer to his question as she reaches for the guard's hand is Ich gehoer zu ihm. Very important I think. Call me silly but somehow I have this feeling that he might be her illegitimate father. As bank employee he might well have had contact with Lola's mother and even time to have an affair with her considering the workaholic dad being gone so much. Ich gehoer zu ihm is badly translated in the subtitles as I'll stay with him while the German would better translate into I belong to him. And that is something Lola could well have realized after her dad abandoned her with the accusation of being a cuckoo's egg. The guard is also in the beginning of the movie quoting famous soccer coach Sepp Herberger's the ball is round. It's in the league with Yogi Berra's famous word creations. The ball is round meant for Herberger that anything can happen as long as the game is on. Expect the unexpected. Since this is a movie that wants the viewer to think about possibilities why not go all the way?".

	schema:headline " Best German suspense and action film ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "'Lola rennt' by Tom Twyker is the final step for German filmmaking towards a professionality and technical perfection that used to be Hollywood's alone.80 mins. of brilliantly shot action will keep the viewer enthralled with the love story of Manni and Lola who have to fight against time 20 mins. to be exact. It is 11.40 a.m. and Manni who is into smuggling diamonds across Eastern European borders has to turn over 100.000 DM at 12 o'clock sharp to Ronni a 'gangster' par excellence who would kill anyone for stealing a bottle of beer from him.Unfortunately Manni forgot the money in the tram and is now more desperate than ever. He calls the one person who has always taken care of him the love of his life Lola. She asks Manni to wait for her as he is going to rob the 100.000 DM from one the shops in town as he knows that turning up at Ronni's without the money would be his immediate death. Lola starts running immediately thinking of a million different ways how to help the man who is the most important person in her life and she runs and runs.....The quality of cuts and camera shots innovative techniques at the top of modern filming practically unknown to German viewers up to now will hopefully make 'Lola rennt' a blockbuster in the cinemas as it fully deserves it.Like 'Der Himmel ber Berlin' City of Angels' Ryan Cage' and 'Bandits' this film is surely to be copied by Hollywood. A symbol of the emerging new strength and innovative qualities of German filmmaking. You HAVE to see it  The worldpremier screening on 15th August Cologne Germany at the chocolatemuseum OpenAirCinema had a 1000strong audience screaming and laughing breaking into applause on several scenes as the story unfolded. The director and the actors and actresses were present and will have been delighted by the spontaneous reactions of the audience proving this film to be one modern masterpiece of filmmaking.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Lola rennt' by Tom Twyker is the final step for German filmmaking towards a professionality and technical perfection that used to be Hollywood's alone.80 mins. of brilliantly shot action will keep the viewer enthralled with the love story of Manni and Lola who have to fight against time 20 mins. to be exact. It is 11.40 a.m. and Manni who is into smuggling diamonds across Eastern European borders has to turn over 100.000 DM at 12 o'clock sharp to Ronni a 'gangster' par excellence who would kill anyone for stealing a bottle of beer from him.Unfortunately Manni forgot the money in the tram and is now more desperate than ever. He calls the one person who has always taken care of him the love of his life Lola. She asks Manni to wait for her as he is going to rob the 100.000 DM from one the shops in town as he knows that turning up at Ronni's without the money would be his immediate death. Lola starts running immediately thinking of a million different ways how to help the man who is the most important person in her life and she runs and runs.....The quality of cuts and camera shots innovative techniques at the top of modern filming practically unknown to German viewers up to now will hopefully make 'Lola rennt' a blockbuster in the cinemas as it fully deserves it.Like 'Der Himmel ber Berlin' City of Angels' Ryan Cage' and 'Bandits' this film is surely to be copied by Hollywood. A symbol of the emerging new strength and innovative qualities of German filmmaking. You HAVE to see it  The worldpremier screening on 15th August Cologne Germany at the chocolatemuseum OpenAirCinema had a 1000strong audience screaming and laughing breaking into applause on several scenes as the story unfolded. The director and the actors and actresses were present and will have been delighted by the spontaneous reactions of the audience proving this film to be one modern masterpiece of filmmaking.";

But unlike Kurosawa's RASHOMON these are not different perspectives of the same incident by different eyes. Instead it offers 'It could have been this way but for. or if only' scenarios. The film thus attempts to define what people loosely refer to as the luck factor. Luck the film tries to say is being at the right place at the right time or even the wrong place at the wrong time. Or it could be the right place at the wrong time or is it the wrong place at the right time. It is this clever scripting around the spacetime permutation that makes this film such a delight to watch. The scenario in which the young lovers emerge triumphant and richer makes out a strong case for being proactive and for taking risk. It is also amusing to see how wrong conclusions can be drawn from partial information. But the film offers more than an interesting case study for management students.  Cinema buffs would notice that time compression which is so common in film idiom is not resorted to. the action is nearly in true time. The quicksilver editing and the pulsating background score embellish Lola's running and make sure that the repetitions do not get jarring. The film is an unalloyed delight to the mind and the senses.".

	schema:headline " Lola Rennt";
	schema:reviewBody "Lola rennt or Run Lola Run as we say it is a German thriller written and directed by Tom Tykwer. This Film will contrast your emotions as it shows you how one little event in somebody's life can change there's and other peoples lives forever. This rollercoaster ride of emotions will keep you gripped all the way through as it jumps from soft dimly lit emotional scenes to the completely contrasting scenes of running and constant action. The music used in this film complements the scenes very well when it's a slow scene our ears are graced with soft classical music like when Lola is falling to the ground in a slow motion shot. The complete opposite of this is used in the fast paced running scenes as we get pounded by constant techno beats. I believe that the director has used techno to try and get us inside Lola's head as she is running and stressing about Manni and all the other events that happen throughout this amazing film. Lola's Determination to save her boyfriend Manni is very well projected as she enters the bank that her father runs and throughout the three different versions of the story uses different techniques to try and save him. This involvement with the characters and the three different storylines is very unique to this style of film. I think that the actors have delivered a very memorable and exciting performance which will leave viewers wanting to watch the film over and over again.I think that this director has used this style of film very well he is one of this first to successfully use this style and create a very interesting and exciting film. This film is almost the only one of its kind other than the film 'Sliding Doors' but even in that the character is living two parallel lives but in this film it is replayed over again. This film used interesting techniques that I had never seen in a film before. I think that the snapshots into the peoples lives gave you a good view of how one little event can change your life forever. By replaying through the same sort of events three times the director lets you really get a sense of feeling for the characters especially Lola and as the film progresses you actually start to care about the characters and I think this was a really good quality in the film. Overall I really enjoyed this film and think that it is one of the best foreign films I have seen in a long time and would give it a 910.".

Runner an HK film predates Lola and is quite similar for the running throughout the film to livesave life etcetera aspect. Not to mention films like Flirt which deal with the same roles in different situations or Sliding Doors with the 'what if...?' aspect.So this film though interesting was hardly new. It takes ideas already seen and twists them just a little bit. But it lacks the characterization and plot that made those other films so interesting. We learn very little about Lola just a few snippets from her encounters with her 'father' and the bed sequences with her boyfriend who we learn even less about. And the plot is all about cinematography and film style there's little essence to it. In other words it's eye candy and little more.What that means is that we see great colour with little flavour. Experimentation with technique and style sometimes it works other times it gets quite sloppy and not enough attention to fine detail or story. the cartoon part is cool though. And I would have liked a less Hollywood ending from a film that tries so hard to be contemporary and nonHollywood.Overall Fun to watch. Some of the experimentation really worked. It's hardly a classic though not even a terribly solid film. But it's interesting and doesn't drag too much. I almost gave it a 6 but relented and instead give it a 710.".

Watching it on DVD was better than the theater because the 5.1 sound is superior plus you have the option of a good dubbed version or the original German with English subtitles. I use either depending on my mood but I lean toward the German with subtitles.Franke Potente who has since gone on to become better known around the world from the Bourne films is the centerpiece of this film and very very interesting. The looks of shock on her face her flaming red hair and wild general appearance and the crazy things that happen to her are always fun to watch and hear. Added to the unique cinematography which includes tricks here and there is a pulsating electronic soundtrack that brings added life to this already kinetic involving film.

The film was 80 minutes and I enjoyed every second of it. Franka Potente's first film I've seen was The Bourne Identity second The Bourne Supremacy and the third was Creep.

Franka Potente plays Lola  she is one of my favourite actresses.3. One of The Simpson's episodes that I have seen before Run Lola Run is inspired from the film its called Trilogy of Error but it's slightly different it has three stories told one after the other all happening at the same time. SPOILERS START HERE While I was watching the movie it was a bit confusing when the whole story was repeated for the second time and then the third in all different ways  the question was that which is the real ending? But I managed to understand that the fate changes by the choices you make. In the first two perspectives of the story they both realised that if one of them died then they will know how much they love each other but in the third one was successful Manni got the money from the tramp and Lola got money without committing a crime so Manni got away from his boss plus Lola has the money to herself but she did not seem happy and Manni attention was on the money. So basically it's like a video game if you fail you try again. END OF SPOILERSThe only complain is that Lola is too good for Manni that guy looks like a shaved goofy monkey. Otherwise this film is a perfect thriller and I gave it a perfect 1010 because it deserves it.".

	schema:reviewBody "On his way to the dropoff Lola's boyfriend Manni loses a bag containing 100000 marks belonging to the local gang on the subway. Desperate and exasperated he calls up his girlfriend from a phonebooth and she is determined to help him  and now Lola has 20 minutes to run find the money and deliver them to Manni before he robs the convenience store.There are precious few films to which I award the perfect 1010  and Lola Rennt 1998 is one of them. I think German director Tykwer has done something really cool here to fit our fastpaced generation he has tailored the perfect adrenalinepumping ride filled it with interesting characters philosophical notions and overdoses of flair and fury. Sure it's mostly style when you think about it but it fits the concept  it's simple and totally brilliant. The film has Lola an energetic Franka Potente run across the city bumping into strangers falling prey to detours and diversions  such as the typical huge sheet of glass plate carried by construction workers the group of nuns the woman with a baby carriage  but always keeping her focus on the task at hand. She loves Manny and she WILL help him. This way Lola is an extremely likable heroine. So does she succeed? Well the film reaches its culmination alright  three times. As Lola makes her way to Manni for the first time it pauses interjects a meaningful flashback rewinds and starts all over again zooming back to when Lola received the call from Manni. Each time her journey is different from the last fantastically navigating the what ifs and should have could have would haves of the situation. Sometimes her journey is subtly different  the smallest thing the butterfly effect giving rise to some changes in pace and sometimes it brings about a new scenario altogether. This part is so exquisitely wellcrafted that if you study the background elements you will find differing details such as the position of the train in relation to Lola in the beginning the careful timing of vehicles and the fated movements of the people she encounters  it's a meticulous piece of filmmaking.For all its subtlety in craft and setting Lola Rennt is first and foremost a very vibrant and alive film  and dare I say  very inyourface. I really can't stress this enough. This vibrancy manifests itself in the hectic adrenalineboosting pace of the run the vivid colourizations Franka Potente's flaming red hair and highpitched screams and the fastbeating techno music that plays furiously in the background. It is so fast and alive in fact that once a pause is inserted it becomes both poignant and welcomed giving depth to the story by exploring Lola and Manni's love in the flashback between the journeys. Aside from the cartoon device in which the liveaction cuts to a poorlysketched cartoon figure of Lola which I felt was redundant in an already interesting film Lola Rennt really is a lesson in style that Tony Scott could benefit from taking by the way. Tykwer goes all the way here  especially for the third journey which is more aggressive and determined and the result is something glorious that easily makes my top 20 films list.10 out of 10".

Franka Potente and Moritz Bleibtreu are the said losers. Bleibtreu is a low end dealer who is doing a 100000 Mark cash pickup for his boss. Of course he loses the cash and is sure that his crazy boss is going to kill him.He gets on the phone and calls his girl Potente about the screwup. Now starts a series of events as Potente tries to round up the cash in just 20 minutes. Out the door she charges and starts running here and there in order to save her boyfriend's life.The film moves at breakneck speed as Potente tries to hit up her banker father for some cash. This does not work so it is back on the street as Potente races to her man's side. The deal here is that the boyfriend intents to rob a nearby market if Potente cannot gather the cash.The whole story starts over again when the first run is not a success. This one plays out slightly different but is likewise not a success. The third run is again different but this time there is a happy ending for Potente and Bleibtreu.This one is a film that really needs to be seen. It is damn near impossible to explain the story and do it justice. At only 81 minutes it rocket's along with top flight cinematography and a pounding soundtrack. It is well worth the time investment.I was lucky enough to see it on the big screen and was floored by the whole production. The audience all clapped and cheered at the end.".

It immediately states an answer The ball is round the game is 90 minutes. That's a fact everything else is pure theory. In other words no reason.Lola's boyfriend Manni lost 100000 marks belonging to his hoodlum associates. Lola needs to get that amount of money and meet him in 20 minutes or they'll surely kill him. So she hurries to get there. Along the way she runs into various people the film shows flashes of what will happen to them in their future without explanation of how or why.But things go very badly for her. She is killed so the events start over showing a different version. This time things happen a bit differently including different outcomes for the people she encounters. Again things turn out wrong again it starts over again different results this time with success for Lola and Manni. There's no reason for it no different choices anyone made it's just random. In fact she turns 100 marks into over 100 thousand in two rounds of roulette at a casino as if that ever happens when you need it.The movie is filled with unlikable characters. Manni is a crook apparently a thief and smuggler. Lola joins him in armed robbery of a grocery in one iteration then robs her father's bank holding her father at gunpoint in another. In the third iteration where things work out the two behave better not because they're better people making better choices but because they simply never had the opportunity to rob anyone.In between the iterations Manni and Lola are lying in bed discussing things that have nothing to do with anything further underscoring the fact that this is a pointless meaningless random plodding movie which is philosophically corrupt and only barely entertaining. But the music rocks which is why I listened to the very end I didn't want to miss the only thing good about this film.".

Though I doubt anyone will plow through the other 500 reviews to get to mine I still wish to express my love for this movie and submit it to the infinite void of cyberspace.SPOILER ALERTBesides the multiple medias BW animation handheld cameras etc. that made it visually appealing what I liked was the message. In Sliding Doors like fashion btw interestingly these 2 films were made the same year we get to see 3 as opposed to 2 in 'SD' scenarios each beginning as Lola has hung up with her boyfriend Manni who has lost 100000 marks and is facing certain death from those it belongs to and is pleading with Lola for help. Since I imagine the whole story has been given away in other reviews I'll just get to the moral of the story. In the first scenario Manni makes a poor decision and Lola pays for it with her life. In the second Lola is the one making the bad choice and Manni pays for it with his. In the final scenario and what we are led to believe is what actually happened at least that's my take on it Lola runs out of options and even prays for divine intervention. Good fortune comes to both Manni and Lola Manni is able to deliver the lost funds and they both end up better off than before. The message of the blessings that follow when people make the right choices was loud and clear. Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.My only complaint was that it was too short! roughly 80 minutes I give this movie 1010 and my highest recommendation.".

The suspense is high from the getgo with Lola's boyfriend Manni phoning her to say that if he doesn't get 100000 deutsche marks within 20 minutes a gangster will kill him. Immediately Lola sets off running through Berlin in a frantic attempt to locate the money. The fun part is that we see Lola's journey three times with three very different outcomes determined by little things that happen to Lola as she runs.Lola the engaging Franka Potente manages to be both an iconic supercool heroine and a believable young woman who just wants to get her boyfriend out of trouble. IMDb ratings show that this is the rare action movie that appeals to girls more than to guys probably because Lola is such a strong character. This is exhilarating filmmaking with a propulsive soundtrack a fast pace and many flashy effects like animated and blackandwhite sequencesin addition to the most stunning use of splitscreen that I've ever seen. Incredibly for such a young director these techniques are employed with great assurance. I also like how although the film is hip and sometimes amused by the crazy things that happen to people it's never cynical. Instead there's a sweet optimism to it a faith in karma and love.Occasionally Run Lola Run is a bit too clever for its own good. The rapidfire montages that show the fates of minor characters are superficially amusing but unnecessarily hammer home the theme that little things can have a huge effect on a person's life. However the movie's philosophies are still ambiguous enough that there's a lot to think about when it's over. Furthermore Run Lola Run is an extraordinarily good time it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen whenever Lola's on it.".

Twyker laudably abandons any notions of naturalism realism plausibility drama or character here in a film which raises formal gamesmanship to a remarkably populist level.  I bet Hal Hartley's kicking himself.Everything a mainstream movie is supposed to have is denied here  linear plot resolution character motivation etc.  The film's flagrant artifice is not just signalled formally we're told so by a couple of gloriously pretentious epigraphs and by one of the characters himself who blows the whistle and kicks the ball to start.  At no point does Twyker indulge in illusionism  the film is a textbook in Brechtian alienation cartoons jump cuts the idea that every plot we see is just the TV programme Lola's mother watches implausible situations coincidences chance elastic time etc. There can be no tension and drama because we know the director has stacked everything against us and Lola and can pull any rabbit he likes out of the hat and does which makes a mockery of those critic who see the film as dramatising the freedom of computer games or DVD.And yet we ARE thrilled with the drama and tension.  Because cinema has never been about character in the novelistic sense.  Syd Field may be discredited now but he was right about one thing action is character. We don't need to know anything about Lola's backstory  the geometric fact that she has a goal is enough.  We positively beg Twyker to wipe out the last story as a mistake and begin again.  It is cinema's urge towards denying death because deathinactionThe End.  And still Twyker even denies us this  death IS the film's motor it causes it to keep going success and reconciliation lead to inertia alienation and finish.So what does it all mean?  Without in any way overestimating Twyker's artistic worth LOLA bears many similarities to the works of Vladimir Nabokov with its playfully sadistic master of ceremonies authordirector constructing an elaborate labyrinth letting his hapless creation loose in it.  There is something cruelly godlike in this and the film's dilemmas ARE existential.  Twyker mocks Lola throughout constantly emphasising the circularity of her quest fastforwarding and affirming others' futures while she is trapped so lethally in the present her future oppressively to be created by her.The inverting of life and death however are only possible through art and this is where the film's melancholy lies.  Twyker has justifiably lost faith in cinema as a medium of observing revealing and experiencing reality. Nabokov can take his traumatised professor in 'Bend Sinister' and give him the saving grace of madness  those actually living in Russia weren't so fortunate.  We usually only get one choice and we're stuck with the one we make.  In this light the film does work on an emotional level.  Despite the variations on Lola's plot things remian desperately similar in its context. Are we really that important or like Mannie do we fear we'll be forgotten as soon as we're dead.  This isn't IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE where one life is inseperably bound up with the happiness of others.There is progress.  It may be misogyistic of the film to suggest that all Lola's seeming mobility is useless that it's only when Mannie takes control that danger can be averted.  The other viewpoint is thast Lola working on her own resulted in despair and death but once Mannie starts doing his bit and the two work in tandem that resolution becomes a possibility.  Isn't Mannie's flip relief at the end of the third story so brilliant so true?Each story for all their technical inhumanity has masterpiece flashes of human comedy largely focusing of Lola's gleefully unpleasant dad.  This is the ultimate film of late urban capitalism where mobility is a Maxwell's Demon overloading in information yet hurtling towards inertia where a life is worth as little as a craps risk and a clock.  While critical comparisons with Godard and Fassbinder only reveal how standards have declined in arthouse cinema and the danger of monotony isn't always averted the surprise of LOLA is that a film so light and polayful so impatient with angst and death should have been made by a German.".

It greatly surpasses the original '58 version.The film focuses on the relationship between Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis at the top and once it takes its turn towards horror it really pays off. It's not just scary it's a tragedy too. Jeff Goldblum is phenomenal. He is mesmerizing as he delivers great dialogue and once he's barely recognizable he still breaks through the makeup and you can feel the human inside. I can't believe he didn't get an Oscar for this it's easily his best performance. I can't express how much I love The Fly. It's more than just horror and it's proof that you just may find a truly great movie where you least expect it. My rating 1010".

Technically this is a remake but with a genius like David Cronenberg in the director's chair it's obvious that this isn't anything like the uninspired and irritating remakes that are being released nowadays The Amityville Horror The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Cronenberg's interpretation of this ultimate terrortale differs greatly from the original. In fact the only resemblance is the basic premise of a fusion between an obsessive scientist and an ordinary housefly. Goldblum is terrifically cast as the brilliant but slightly confused mastermind Seth Brudle whose lifework are telepods funny looking machines capable of transmitting matter through space. Journalist Davis with whom he has a romantic adventure closely observes the progress of his work but when he teapot's himself through space the catastrophe happens. Mentally as well as physically Brudle undergoes a horrible transformation into a fly and it cannot be stopped. The Fly is a very devastating film. Powerful enough but not exactly pleasant to look at. Like only the greatest directors can pull this off Cronenberg overwhelms the audience with a sublime mixture drama misery and repulsiveness. You feel as helpless as the characters themselves and you painfully wait for the unhappy ending to come! The screenplay is filled with genuine metaphors and the romance between Goldblum and Davis is beautifully illustrated. The special effects mainly created by Chris Walas who went on directing the 1989sequel are definitely still staggering and they don't look the least bit dated by today's standards.".

	schema:headline " Exceptional Horror";
	schema:reviewBody "Just last week in one of my Screen Analysis tutorials our tutor goodnaturedly decided that if we were going to be film students we needed to be exposed to disturbing things. What he showed us was an excerpt from an expressionist French film made in the late 20's the name escapes me. Before we had reached the climactic scene every one in the class had already guessed it as we had seen images so far of a man purposely sharpening a razor blade and then approaching a complacent woman in a chair and holding wide open one of her eyes. At this point one of the girls in the room rather loudly asked of the tutor jokingly but in something of a shaky voice Why are you doing this? This question I think could well be the definitive mark of really effective horror and it was certainly in the back of my mind nearly all of last night as I was watching David Cronenberg's The Fly for the first time. True horror films by their nature should strive to get their audience to ask this question because it means that they are transcending the illusion of moving pictures and becoming a film  suspending disbelief and getting under your skin. Effectiveness aside however I believe that the mark of exceptional horror is when the question stems from a concern for the characters' wellbeing and not your own. With both these thoughts in mind I suspect that The Fly could well be the second best horror film of all time behind Kubrick's The Shining which I admit got to first place by completely different criteria. Such is life I'm afraid.Remade from a 1958 concept starring Vincent Price and later popularized by The Simpsons the film follows a pretty archetypical horror premise science gone of course horribly wrong. In this case Jeff Goldblum in his tourdeforce performance plays Seth Brundle an independent scientific visionary who has been slowly designing a device that will change the world as we know it  a Teleporter. When he shows his invention to romantic interest Veronica Geena Davis it is not quite ready to handle living tissue demonstrated on screen in the first instance of quite confronting gore but as the two grow a relationship and fall in love the wrinkles in the technology are ironed out and so Brundle takes one small step for man and tests the machine on himself. Unfortunately in the process of teleportation his DNA is mixed up with that of a common housefly and although not immediately transformed as in the original the two species soon begin to genetically merge and transform Brundle into a creature that has never existed before  and for damned good reasons.Cronenberg of course never shortchanges his audience with graphic gore and even viewed with the critical eye of Generation Y the film's mideighties effects are still quite sickening none more so than Goldblum's slow physical transformation. What makes this whole affair really outstanding however is his psychological transformation the truly disturbing thing is how front and centre the humanity of these characters and their world is kept. Davis and Goldblum are the heroes in this regard  their chemistry is palpable and her affection for him struggling against her disgust at what he is becoming coupled with his own struggle to keep the fly in check create the kind of riveting discomfort usually only commanded by trainwrecks.I was in fact quite strongly reminded of Darren Aronofsky's 2000 filmadaptation of Hubert Selby's novel Requiem for a Dream  although the subject matter differs greatly both films derive their horror elements most strongly from a place that is completely removed from Horror  and in both examples the source is basically Love. In this sense the film affects a lot like real life tragedies do because it begins in a place truly pure and good and unsuspecting lets its characters discover how wonderful life can be and then Horror is unjustly and irrevocably forced upon them. This is why it is genuinely moving instead of tacky when Goldblum resigns to Davis with a regretful and yet matteroffact air that he is an insect who dreamt he was a man and loved it. But now the dream is over and the insect is awake. And in true Cronenberg style this prophecy becomes quite literal in the third act think Vincent D'Onofrio in Men in Black.Now in a film that had spent more time on sinister close ups of flies and haunting music cues and not on the bare and essential humanity of the doomed lovers at this point I probably would have asked Why are you doing this to me? and that could have been the end of it  dismissed as senseless disturbing cinema and forgotten. As Cronenberg Goldblum and Davis have done it what I asked was Why are you doing this to them? And that's the kind of film that you don't ever forget.".

	onyx:emotionText "Just last week in one of my Screen Analysis tutorials our tutor goodnaturedly decided that if we were going to be film students we needed to be exposed to disturbing things. What he showed us was an excerpt from an expressionist French film made in the late 20's the name escapes me. Before we had reached the climactic scene every one in the class had already guessed it as we had seen images so far of a man purposely sharpening a razor blade and then approaching a complacent woman in a chair and holding wide open one of her eyes. At this point one of the girls in the room rather loudly asked of the tutor jokingly but in something of a shaky voice Why are you doing this?

It's really not even a horror movie. It's a drama with amounts of romance and suspensehorror. Jeff Goldblum did the best performance of his career as Seth Brundle a scientist who has invented something he calls Telepods. They're pods that transport you from pod to pod space to space. He tests this invention with animals and objects until one night he gets very mad because he believes his girlfriend Geena Davis is seeing someone else John Getz even though his belief is wrong. He tries the pods out for himself unknowing that a fly got trapped in the pod with him. The pods splice them together and slowly throughout the movie Seth Brundle transforms into a gross and devastating creature half man half fly.The movie had no errors in it. The acting was great the terrifying score by Howard Shore was amazing the directing was exceptional the story was brilliant and the extremely sick and disgusting special effects were fantastic.

As he has evolved he has improved his writing and as a results the stories have become more hidden and more intelligent.I think the Fly Deadzone and Videodrome are his best work.  His more recent films Crash and the Naked Lunch have impressed me with his ambition and ability to try something new but have failed as entertainment. I can't really put my finger on how Cronenberg is able to create the intensity and atmosphere that he does even with very obscure subjects but I would love to see him try some less obscure subjects and make films of the caliber of the Fly again.

	schema:reviewBody "The Fly is a great SciFi thriller that brings excitement to the screen that the original did not. Even though yes it can be a bit much to watch with all that eew vomiting. I think any true SciFi or horror fan would admit that this is a great movie to watch at midnight. I'm not even really sure why I love this movie I just think you need a good scare every once in a while and the ending is always a shocker.Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brendel a scientist and meets Veronica played by then wife Geena Davis she is a journalist trying to find a breakthrough story that can make her career. Seth interests her with his telepods only these aren't just any normal telepods they can transfer things from place to place. Only it has not been perfected to where it can transfer a living creature and Seth offers Veronica or he calls her Ronnie to stay with him and film what will happen when he perfects it. There Ronnie and Seth fall for each other and begin an affair while trying to perfect the machines.There is one little past problem of Ronnie's her ex and boss Stathis played by John Getz he wants Ronnie back but she refuses and continues the project. When she's gone away from Seth he gets drunk and goes into the telepod not even sure of the results to come a fly accidentally gets into the machine with him and he telepods successfully! Everything seems fine at first until a cut he got earlier starts to have tough hair Ronnie notices. When Seth tries to get her into the telepod she refuses being too scared understandably he tells her that he'll get another person who'll do it. We notice also that his face is starting too look a little bit more rough he's only eating sweets and now has amazing strength. When he scares off another girl as Ronnie warns her Be afraid be very afraid Seth tells Ronnie to leave and never come back.But now Seth has a bigger problem he's now loosing his body parts and collecting the Seth Brendel Museum he is grossly disfigured when he begs Ronnie to come back into his life and help him. He cannot even eat solid foods any more he has to vomit on it and make it into liquid Ronnie loves Seth that she continues to see him and get him help. When it seems that Seth is first frightened of what the results will be he starts to embrace it with his amazing strength and ability to crawl on the walls and wants to become Brendal Fly! It's worth a Nobel prize or two don't you think? When Ronnie begs Stathus for help she shows him some video of what Seth is capable of she has a new problem she's pregnant with SETH'S baby! She wants an abortion but when Seth secretly finds out he's hurt that she'd want to kill the child and he decides the only cure for him is if he and shewith the baby inside her get in the telepods together and form the ultimate family of one person! The Fly is a creative and gross but nevertheless awesome movie with great performances and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't think you will be disappointed. It's just a fun watch for a midnight with your friends and you want a good scare. The effects are cool and not cheap and the make up well eesh! You might want a blanket to put up by your face. D 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "The film 'The Fly' has one of the saddest story lines I have ever seen in a horrorScifi and drama film. Its about a man named Seth Brundle Jeff Goldblum who invents a Teleportation machine and accidentally teleports himself with a fly from one transmitting pod to another which places the insects genetics into Seth Brundle causing him to slowly mutate into a giant insect. What mostly moved me about this film was the sorrow and pity I felt for Seth Brundle and his girlfriend Veronica Geena Davis as he was mutating into an giant insect. To see a man who loved life so much and finally making it in life by meeting the woman of his dreams and by succeeding in his six year goal in inventing Teleportation and then losing it all by transforming into a monster is enough to put a tear into my eye. I admit this film in many aspects was quite hideous but because Jeff Goldblums and Geena Davis' acting was so proper and convincing this is what made the film into what it is. The scene when Seth Brundle went smashing threw the abortion clinic window and then trying to convince Veronica Geena Davis not to abort his unborn baby as the baby was the only thing left of the real him I thought was very sad and moving for Jeff Goldblums acting was so real and professional in that scene I honestly don't think that any other actor could have played the role of Seth Brundle better than him. I recommend anybody to see this film for I rate it an 7 out of 10.".

Things are further complicated when Seth and Veronica start to fall in love after Veronica is forced to go and see her ex boyfriend Seth drunk and jealous decides to go thru the Telepods unbeknown to him a fly also went thru with him and the computer confused to find two matters in the system spliced the gene codes together the result is the terrifying birth of Brundlefly.Remaking an old and much loved horror classic was something that director David Cronenberg tackled with relish sensing the opportunity to update it with 80s set paranoia's he managed to not only splice many meanings in his picture but also to create one of the best horror films of the modern age. Where do you start as regards The Fly's heart? In essence it's a tragic love story a modern disease riddled Beauty and The Beast but Cronenberg is not just content with that he manages to play on mans fears of disease an 80s AIDS metaphor is hard to get away from death and of course change in general.Cronenberg pictures have generally suffered for poor casting and tiny budgets but here he gets full license to unleash the devilment and astuteness at work in his mind. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis put in excellent work as our two main protagonists both putting in career best work in the process a chemistry pretty much unrivalled in the horror genre post the Motion Picture Production Code demise in 1967. What is a major plus in The Fly's favour is that there is no camp veneer to the story unfolding Brundle's metamorphosis is slow and adroitly paced we follow each step as Brundle's body and state of mind changes and of course we have to witness Veronica clinging on to the love she has for Seth even as he monstrously evolves into Brundlefly.Drink deep or taste not the plasma springSome sequences are truly vile I remember vividly people leaving the cinema during one particularly gross moment the horror elements in the piece do not disappoint the genre faithful. But really it's the intelligence and crafty nous that lifts The Fly high above many of its contemporaries. Many of Cronenberg's early supporters frown at The Fly for its big budget awareness and mainstream success. Stupid really because it's one of his most accomplished and professional pictures dripping with goo and seeping with cranial splendour right up to the final shattering climax that is as unforgettable as it is emotionally wrought. A candidate for greatest remake ever? Definitely. And come the end credits as your stomach starts to settle and the ache in your heart begins to wane comes the realisation that Seth Brundle without the intrusion of a common house fly really could have changed the World as we know it! 1010".

During tests he finds it turns his monkeys inside out and kills them until he gets it to work.  He immediately tests it on himself and everything appears to work well.  However he soon finds himself going through a series of changes much to the concern of his girlfriend Ronnie that see him becoming fitter and stronger.  However it isn't long the changes become more concerning and it is clear that he is changing beyond his control and beyond recognition.Cronenberg is famous for his body horror and here is no exception.  The remake of The Fly loses a lot of his usual social comment etc but still leaves him open to do a great horror that has some intelligent touches.  The story is very much a horror  but Cronenberg has got rid of the concept of swapping a fly head for a human head and replaced it with the horror coming from within.  This allows him to feel more comfortable with his subject matter rather than it being silly.  The transformation gets more intense towards the end as his whole body begins to become a fly but the early parts allow tension to be built up.When the gore comes it is typical Cronenberg.  It isn't gore for comedy's sake it is quite shocking and very gory.  The real gore is kept for 2 or 3 key moments and is all the more shocking for the restrained nature of it's use up till then.  The end itself shows that it isn't just an out and out horror and that it does have a heart and a head to match it's strong stomach.Goldblum is good.  Unfortunately he has come to be type cast as the excitable Jewish scientist with a distinct speaking manner try Jurassic Park 1  2 Cats and Dogs etc.  However here it doesn't annoy too much. Davis is also very good and was going into a good run of hits unlike now! at the time.  She plays the horror of her situation very well.Overall The Fly is a very good remake.  It is a horror film that is actually chilling as well as gory  Cronenberg's fascination with body horror and the nature of ourselves is toned down but is still enough in evidence to add something.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eccentric brilliant and extremely likable scientist Seth Brundle Jeff Goldblum manages to convince a journalist named Veronica Quaife Geena Davis working for 'Particle Magazine' to accompany him back to his apartment so he can show her his invention that will according to him change the world. Eventually Veronica agrees. Seth shows her his 'Telepods'. Devices that reintegrate objects placed in one pod and reintegrates them in another. Veronica is suitably impressed and takes the story to her exboyfriend and editor Stathis Borans John Getz who doesn't believe her and says that Seth is trying to con her. Seth contacts Veronica again and asks her to cover the remaining development of the telepods. Veronica sensing a massive story that she will have exclusive rights to agrees. After some teething troubles Seth feels he is ready to test the pods out on himself. Unfortunately a fly is trapped in Seths pod as he is teleported. The computer which controls the teleportation decides to splice Seth's and the Fly's genes together. Veronica notices drastic changes in Seth's appearance and personality as he undergoes an horrific transformation into the Fly!Cowritten and directed by David Cronenberg I thought this was quite simply an excellent horror film. The script by Cronenberg and Charles Edward Pogue is gripping and really works on an emotional level unlike so many horror films I actually felt sorry for Seth by the end and the rest of the characters are fleshed out very well so that we care for them. The pacing is excellent starting off at a sedate pace but never becoming boring and then building up to the gory climax. The acting from both Goldblum and Davis is superb if they have ever turned in a better performance than I have yet to see it. There are actually very few characters in the film Seth Veronica and Stathis is about it. The special effects look pretty good. There isn't much blood or gore a bone sticking out of an arm and a melted hand is about it. But there are lots of disgusting gooey effects as Goldblum changes into a Fly. It's very well made and looks good. I've nothing really bad to say about it. It was an absolute pleasure to spend and hour and a half of my time watching this. Highly recommended especially for those who value a well written story with good characters. Don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Short preface of perhaps important informationI am fairly young born in 1998 but i have a passion for older horror films and i love watching them.I have not seen the original 1958 film.To give you a short summation of the story without spoilers. The Fly starts off in a science convention centre where brilliant scientists gather. Journalist Veronica is tasked with creating a scoop about the most interesting story she can find. She meets scientist Seth Brundle and asks about the project he's been working on. Seth takes her to his appartment and reveals he has been working on a teleportation device. The device is still a prototype and has difficulty with transporting meat or living beings.After some refinement Seth decides to try the machine out himself. While intoxicated he decides to hop in the machine in order to see if the refined machine can transport humans. However a fly manages to get into the teleporter alongside Seth. Seeing as the machine was unrefined it gene spliced Seth's DNA with that of a fly. Seth ends up turning into a gross humanfly hybrid being. How that resolves you have to see for yourself.One thing i admire about this film is it's pacing. I'm used to horror films being 2.5 hours long and the fact that this film is only 1.5 ours is realy refreshing. It cuts out all the longwinded and boring parts and makes you feel involved every step of the way.The make up and practical effects are extremely well done. It looks absolutely disgusting and i love it. The hairs the swollen faces the spit the gore everything looked great even by today's standards. I can't even begin to describe how glad i am that they didn't use CGI.The acting is great there wasn't a single moment or line that felt out of place or unnatural and i was throughly entertained all the way through. It wasn't very scary but it was entertaining and disturbing and i loved it. A definate reccomendation for any fan of horror films.".

The Fly starts off in a science convention centre where brilliant scientists gather. Journalist Veronica is tasked with creating a scoop about the most interesting story she can find. She meets scientist Seth Brundle and asks about the project he's been working on. Seth takes her to his appartment and reveals he has been working on a teleportation device.

In the beginning he transports objects and monkeys  but one night he decides to test the machine on himself . Unfortunately a fly into the device blends his atomic cells and the gens are mingled . Then he begins to evolve into a human fly . Meanwhile  he falls in love with a beautiful journalist played by Geena Davis who is investigating the strange events by orders of her chief  John Getz  and exlover .This frightening picture displays tension  suspense  shocks and lots of blood and gore . The film provides great loads of scares  grisly events and creepy atmosphere which becomes pretty sinister when the protagonist is become into a fly . The movie is rated R for the crude images  as many scenes are excessively disgusting and gross but it is solely apt for old people  no little boys  neither squeamish  as abound guts  slime and gore . Goldblum gives a vigorous physical performance and totally convincing as the brilliant  crazy research scientist turned into wild human fly . Eerie musical score by nowadays successful Howard Shore Lord of the Rings and nice cinematography by Mark Irwin . The film won an Academy Award for a terrifyingly makeup by Chris Wallas director an inferior sequel with Eric Stolz  Daphne Zuiga and it was a flop . Rating  Good but no for kids for violent  realistic and gory images . It's one the highest earnest terror pictures of the 80s  however  I prefer the excellent classic version by Kurt Newmann with David Hedison and Vincent Price".

The best thing about the movie is that he didn't turn into a fly straight away after he left the machine he was slowly throughout the whole film which really created the suspense  the tensive mood.It is a remake and a hitech update of the 1958 classic and is David Cronenberg's biggest hit to date granting Jeff Goldblum his finest role as the teleported monster hybrid and granting an Oscar for its gruesomely icky special effects. Generally flies are the most useless  annoying animals especially when they sit on your food but for once they did become useful for the idea of this terrific film. I've not seen the original Fly because I'm not keen in really old films and I don't think it will turn out to be as good as this one.It's rumoured that there is going to be another remake in 2008 I don't mind remakes as long as they turn out to be good but most of them are rubbish. The 80's was the best decade for movies e.g. An American Werewolf in London Gremlins A Nightmare in Elm Street The Terminator  Predator the list is endless. Overall The Fly is a masterpiece with a classic story that has been tackled in a lot of cartoons including Dexter's Laboratory  Johnny Bravo. It is really underrated because mostly people gave it an 8 instead of 10 out of 10 and it should be on the IMDb top 250.".

I've always thought that THE METAMORPHOSIS would make a great episode of a horror anthology in something like TWILIGHT ZONE THE MOVIE OR as an episode of a teleseries. One of the more interesting aspects of adapting the story would be to SHOW Samsa's metamorphosis. I tried something similar conceptually when I submitted a script entitled VAMPYRE to George Romero's TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE series in an effort to go undercover and infiltrate a group of vampires terrorizing a city I had the main character allow himself to be bitten by a vampire. The scenes immediately following depicted his transformation from a man to a vampire. I was told that the episode would be too expensive to do. THE FLY the remake helmed by horror meister David Cronenberg is the next best thing. Jeff Goldblum's absentminded muttering acting schtick is pitchperfect for the character of Seth Brundle and we BUY him as the scientist. Geena Davis does well as the love interest though I was never really a fan she does a GREAT job here and is 100 believable in an underrated performance but it's Goldblum's gradual metamorphosis into Brundlefly that makes THE FLY worth seeing. By far the best of the Cronenbug films. Boxing fans take note durable Canadian heavyweight champion George Chuvalo plays an armwrestling barroom brawler.".

	schema:reviewBody "This does not touch the Cronenberg movie or the Vincent Price movies from what I've seen of those but is definitely worth the watch for fans of grossout monster flicks. The plot? The son of Seth Brundle Harley Cross is born in a corporate laboratory. He grows up at a very fast rate now played by Eric Stoltz and falls in love while discovering the evil secrets of the bigwig and his scientists who have raised him. Nothing helps him on his quest to destroy them more than when the metamorphosis that took place in Dad begins to take place even faster in Son. It has its funny moments the underused John Getz from the original gets some big cynical laughs as well as very emotionally moving moments especially when Stoltz puts the mutant dog to sleep which is very sad and touching. There is a hackneyed element to be sure the romantic part with the awful country song is something that would be perfectly acceptable to fastforward through but overall it's still a kinda fun movie that's more effective than many people might tell you. As far as the gore quotient goes this one I would consider more of a splatter movie than Cronenberg's which had its grossout moments throughout but wasn't as bloody as this one was. Still if you like gore I would suggest it especially. I myself have no problems with gore as long as I like the movie around it and I liked The Fly 2 enough to actually watch it more than once without that choice being under the influence of substances! Also one way it was better than the first film was how it ended. While the ending to the first was somewhat abrupt even if it was a great movie and didn't really need anything extra this one features a happy ending that is not sappy always commendable as well as one of the greatest acts of vengeance ever agonizingly drawn out on film. All in all I agree that The Fly 2 doesn't really touch David Cronenberg's The Fly in overall quality but it doesn't deserve the terrible reputation that's been heaped on it over the years even if there's nothing to disguise the fact that is inferior.".

I myself have no problems with gore as long as I like the movie around it and I liked The Fly 2 enough to actually watch it more than once without that choice being under the influence of substances! Also one way it was better than the first film was how it ended. While the ending to the first was somewhat abrupt even if it was a great movie and didn't really need anything extra this one features a happy ending that is not sappy always commendable as well as one of the greatest acts of vengeance ever agonizingly drawn out on film. All in all I agree that The Fly 2 doesn't really touch David Cronenberg's The Fly in overall quality but it doesn't deserve the terrible reputation that's been heaped on it over the years even if there's nothing to disguise the fact that is inferior.";

Yowch!I do struggle a little with the notion that entering a telepod with another human being especially a full clothed one would revert a Brundlefly to perfect human form but since this was something alluded to in the original and there's a fitting payoff for the bad guy as a result I'll cut the film some slack.

Eric Stoltz and Daphne Zuniga actually put some effort forth here which is nice considering this was probably little more than a paycheck for both.The problem is the script.

It seems like entire scenes are missing or else they were never written.  The bare bones I watched were perhaps merely excuses to link together special effects and makeup from Walas's FX company.In that sense it's kinda like a porno film.

	schema:reviewBody "The Fly IIAs I write this review I have never seen the remake of The Fly with Ian Malcolm  err Jeff Goldblum  and Geena Davis. So I really have no basis to compare this sequel to. Therefore I will continue with this review in light that I have not seen the original remake...The film opens with a Geena Davis Lookalike giving birth to a son she dies the baby lives. Baby grows older and because he is 14 fly he grows at a rapid rate for some reason. I'm not sure why this would make him bigger instead of smaller but oh well. His name is Martin and he turns into Eric Stoltz when he is five. Yes you read that right. Five. Martin is looked over by the head of a company where he is kept and given medication to keep him from turning into a fly...But soon young Martin finds out that not everything is what it seems and he begins to mutate into...THE LIZARD. Well that's what he looks like anyway.As I watched this I kept a careful eye on Eric Stoltz. Why? Well as I'm sure everyone knows by now he was originally cast for Marty McFly for Back to the Future and they filmed much of the movie with him before Bob Zemeckis dropped him for Fox. In fact there is still a scene where he is diving into the Delorean that is intact. Freeze frame the film and you can see it's not Fox. I always thought that footage looked odd  like it wasn't Fox doing the stunt...Anyway I watched Stoltz and realized how bad he would have been as Marty McFly. He just isn't hyper enough  Michael J. Fox was perfect for Marty Stoltz would have ruined it. He's not a bad actor mind you. He's perfect for this role well at least good for this role but for Marty? Nah... On a side note I'm not sure if this is a coincidence or bizarre injoke but Stoltz's character plays a kid named Martin...similar to Fox's character Marty McFly...Martin...Marty.... And I thought of something else that I haven't seen someone point out before. Marty's last name in BttF is McFly. What does Martin turn into in this film? A FLY! Martin the Fly Marty McFly...taking a quote from Uncle Buck Is there a little similarity here? Ooh I think there is!The film was directed by the creature effects artist of the original  and sequel Chris Walas. You might recognize his name because he wrote Gremlins 2 and did the creature effects for Gremlins as well. Anyway he directs the film pretty good for a creature effects artist...I guess...What I like so much about this movie is its high campy quality. It is a hybrid of B horror movies from the fifties and sixties and the new breed of horror films in the eighties that were like B horror movies with gore. Lots of gore. I guess it doesn't qualify as strictly campy because the old horror movies were not so disgusting...so I just call these films the eighties B horror movies. Simple enough eh?I have always been a sucker for the campy horrors from the eighties especially when they are sequels that tread into old territory. For example in one scene we see footage of Jeff Goldblum being interviewed. Martin watches this with interest. And what I think is so interesting is that we can look back and say Oh yes that was before Goldblum knew he was turning into a fly. It's just interesting to do that. It seems like many films from the eighties would have archive footage from the original film. Anyway The Fly II is a lot like these films. It gives us a glance back at the original. I'm not sure if I can explain in words what this does. It just provides a feeling for me  kind of like campy horrors make some people feel good. I like when horror moviesor any movies for that mattertravel into the film before...we can look at the old characters and say Oh yes that was before this was going to happen... It's just fun to do. I can't describe it in words.This movie like many horror sequels from the eighties is just enjoyable. Odd but enjoyable. It's hard not to have fun watching it. If you take it seriously you're going to have a pretty hard time watching but if you turn off the brain for two hours you'll have some fun.My only two complaints is that this movie is about a half hour too long and the creature looks like a lizard and not a fly. Other than that it is a fun ride. Not great but a good well done horror movie that never takes itself too seriously. Perfect for a Friday night.35 stars John Ulmer".

	onyx:emotionText "The Fly IIAs I write this review I have never seen the remake of The Fly with Ian Malcolm  err Jeff Goldblum  and Geena Davis. So I really have no basis to compare this sequel to. Therefore I will continue with this review in light that I have not seen the original remake...The film opens with a Geena Davis Lookalike giving birth to a son she dies the baby lives. Baby grows older and because he is 14 fly he grows at a rapid rate for some reason. I'm not sure why this would make him bigger instead of smaller but oh well. His name is Martin and he turns into Eric Stoltz when he is five. Yes you read that right. Five. Martin is looked over by the head of a company where he is kept and given medication to keep him from turning into a fly...But soon young Martin finds out that not everything is what it seems and he begins to mutate into...THE LIZARD. Well that's what he looks like anyway.As I watched this I kept a careful eye on Eric Stoltz. Why? Well as I'm sure everyone knows by now he was originally cast for Marty McFly for Back to the Future and they filmed much of the movie with him before Bob Zemeckis dropped him for Fox. In fact there is still a scene where he is diving into the Delorean that is intact. Freeze frame the film and you can see it's not Fox. I always thought that footage looked odd  like it wasn't Fox doing the stunt...Anyway I watched Stoltz and realized how bad he would have been as Marty McFly. He just isn't hyper enough  Michael J. Fox was perfect for Marty Stoltz would have ruined it. He's not a bad actor mind you. He's perfect for this role well at least good for this role but for Marty? Nah... On a side note I'm not sure if this is a coincidence or bizarre injoke but Stoltz's character plays a kid named Martin...similar to Fox's character Marty McFly...Martin...Marty.... And I thought of something else that I haven't seen someone point out before. Marty's last name in BttF is McFly. What does Martin turn into in this film? A FLY!

The first Fly remake with Jeff G. is also a great movie but I see it as a drama with horror elements that escalates the level a couple can take commitment to horrific heights. It uses horror to punctuate the OMG! of the drama. It was an excellent movie.Fly 2 reverses the priority of drama vs horror. It adds the popcorn munching fearsome good time of the old horror movies updated to todays standards. The old Boris Karloff movies can be shown to a 5 year old today and he'd see it as anything but scary. If you scoff then you need to watch this at home with surround or the stereo lights off. IF you're not scared you'll at least be captivated. Fly 2 gives you enough character development to care but not enough for serious drama. That's fine. The story however has more twists than the original and rather than exposing the bug and killing him immediately at the end like the first fly this one gets to buzz around and do some damage. If it didn't it would be virtually the same formula as the original and the detractors would have even more a field day trashing this movie as would I.If you liked the original and also like movies like the remakes of The Blob and The Thing from the 80's you won't be sorry seeing this one. The creature effects are much better than those two movies as well. However if you thought those movies were trash then skip this one. You are just too um... deep for this movie.".

The Direction is pretty good. Chris Walas does a pretty good job here with cool camera angles some cool tricks however he is no David Cronenberg and it did get a bit long in tooth near the end but the pace was excellent for the most part and he did a solid job overall. There is TONS of gore just like the 1st. We get some very gory surgery scenes nasty child birth bitten off fingers lots of acid spray TONS AND TONS of slime TONS and TONS of weird gore that's hard to explain bloody corpse big puddle of blood ripped off face acid spray to the hand a head gets crushed very goryand more!. The Acting is very good. Eric Stoltz does an excellent job here he is very likable had good chemistry with Daphne Zuniga and was perfect for the lead. Daphne Zuniga is very pretty and does very well hereand had good chemistry with Eric Stoltz!. Lee Richardsonis excellent here he was mysterious and his character was unpredictable i liked him. John Getz is excellent reprises his small role here and i wish he had more screen time. Overall i highly recommend this sequel!. 12 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Did David Cronenberg's The Fly a very excellent film really need a sequel? I hardly think so. And even if it did I think they could have done a lot better than this garbage. It's nowhere near as good as the first and even worse it somehow ruins a lot of things about the original. At the end of The Fly you could draw your own conclusion on what Veronica would do next but literally within the first few minutes of part II she is killed off.The plot is terrible. They go with the old evil company wants the telepods and fly creature gimmick. None of the characters are likable and the relationship between Eric Stoltz and Daphne Zuniga is just tacked on to the horror unlike in first Fly which does the exact opposite. Once it gets to the climax where it might actually redeem itself with some good horror it instead just goes with old routine horror crap. There are at least two parts where an anonymous guard slowly and quietly looks around for the creature finds nothing says well there's nothing here and gets killed by the creature that is conveniently hiding in an area where he couldn't see it.I deeply hated this movie. The only thing it had going for it were its grossouts and I admit they are gross but they're pointless without a story to back them up. It's one of those sequels that you like to pretend never ever happened but it's pretty hard to do when every DVD of the first Fly film is a double feature along with this second part.My rating 110".

	schema:headline " Great sequel! Another underrated 80's horror film.";
	schema:reviewBody "A lot of horror sequels from the 1980's seem to get an unfair criticism. What happens is the first film becomes a classic. A staple of the decade. And the fansviewers expect a sequel to be of equal caliber and are disappointedangered when a sequel shifts direction style story or setting. For example Return of the Living Dead part II Halloween III Season of the Witch Friday the 13th Part 5 Bride of Reanimator. The Fly II falls in with the other mentioned horror sequels as underrated classic 80's horror flicks that should be enjoyed on their own merit.The Fly II features a decent enough plot about Seth Brundle's son Martin Eric Stoltz and the evil corporation that is trying to control him. There's some nice character interaction between Stoltz and Zuniga even though their chemistry is a bit off and a touching scene between Stoltz and a mutant dog. But the real reason to watch The Fly II besides Stoltz outstanding performance is to see the gore and carnage that ensues once Martin becomes the fly. It's some of the best gore I've seen and instantly launches the film into 80's classic territory! Heads get crushed people melt body parts gets ripped off. It's an awesome sight and worth sitting through the dull parts for like the chaseon the run scenes in the middle.The Fly II is not on the same level as Cronenberg's classic but that doesn't mean it's not a great film. The Fly II delivers the goods and that damn scene with the dog makes me tear up every time! Only bad part...no nudity.".

	onyx:emotionText "A lot of horror sequels from the 1980's seem to get an unfair criticism. What happens is the first film becomes a classic. A staple of the decade. And the fansviewers expect a sequel to be of equal caliber and are disappointedangered when a sequel shifts direction style story or setting. For example Return of the Living Dead part II Halloween III Season of the Witch Friday the 13th Part 5 Bride of Reanimator. The Fly II falls in with the other mentioned horror sequels as underrated classic 80's horror flicks that should be enjoyed on their own merit.The Fly II features a decent enough plot about Seth Brundle's son Martin Eric Stoltz and the evil corporation that is trying to control him. There's some nice character interaction between Stoltz and Zuniga even though their chemistry is a bit off and a touching scene between Stoltz and a mutant dog. But the real reason to watch The Fly II besides Stoltz outstanding performance is to see the gore and carnage that ensues once Martin becomes the fly. It's some of the best gore I've seen and instantly launches the film into 80's classic territory! Heads get crushed people melt body parts gets ripped off. It's an awesome sight and worth sitting through the dull parts for like the chaseon the run scenes in the middle.The Fly II is not on the same level as Cronenberg's classic but that doesn't mean it's not a great film. The Fly II delivers the goods and that damn scene with the dog makes me tear up every time! Only bad part...no nudity.";

It has to be one of the meanest monsters horror has come across Yet The blundell fly never seems to get any recognition which is a shame as anyone who has watched the movie i am sure will agree Blundell fly produced some of the sickest deaths and destruction known to the silver screen.You cannot judge The Fly II with out watching it at least a couple of times.

He meet a girl and they become friends or love interests but in this movie it seems like they were just friends with sex. He finds out that the company that raised him want him to transform. Then magically I might add he starts to transform by running from the company to his love interestfriend's houseboat that seems to be on land. After that they run to a hotel then back to the company. He ends up having his transformation into a Kaiju monster complete I say Kaiju monster because he looks nothing like a Fly then rampages to fuse his DNA with the DNA of his adopted father.The acting is awful the only exception is John Getz who reprises his role from the first movie. The only other person you might know is Daphne Zuniga who's most known role is Princess Vespa in Spaceballs. Anything that tried to come off as suspenseful was instead boring. Some of the script is laughable especially when the control room guy said that they wouldn't know what Martin Brundle would look like Hmmm have you thought he looked like a giant fly?. Not enjoyable except for completionists.".

Not THE GODFATHER please!!!in the IMDb top 250 films of all time and really memorable stuff like E.T. yeah it's corny but it was a GOOD film anyway!not on that list. For my money I think Chris Walas' THE FLY II is one of the most entertaining sequels ever. Trying to top Cronenberg's version was asking too much but I honestly think Walas' did a very good job in carrying off the story of Seth Brundle's son into an entertaining movie. Martin Brundle's mother dies at birth and is raised by the people who financed his dad's experiments the Bartok corporation. Martin Eric Stoltz grows very fast due to the mutant genes he's carrying. By the time he's 5 years old Martin has all the looks of a twenty something boy. Martin is also extremely intelligent and is put to work for Mr. Bartok himself. The boy has rarely seen the outside world due to his supposed illness. Within the confines of the Bartok plant he meets a lovely young girl Daphne Zuiga who befriends him before becoming lovers. Just as Martin was finally feeling accepted by others his inevitable transformation begins to take place something that Mr.Bartok was anxiously awaiting. Martin tries to get away from the Bartok compound when he finds Mr. Bartok has been spying on his private life when he was told by Mr.Bartok himself that he would be free and after knowing his awful truth that he's becoming a monster in much the same way his dad before him did. THE FLY II moves at a very nice pace without ever looking bored. There are plenty of shock moments and gore to please the die hard fans of the original. In fact I'm inclined to say that this sequel is gorier that the first one. The acting is passable but Eric Stoltz performance is the movie's golden asset. He is believable as Martin Brundle and you feel his frustrations and eventually his anger. I've seen so many sequels that are trash that I have to wonder why on earth did THE FLY II get such a low IMDb rating. THE FLY II may not be Oscar material unless you count the make up effects which are top notch! but it sure makes for a very entertaining sequel!".

	schema:reviewBody "The film begins as Veronica Quaife Saffron Henderson is giving birth to her and Dr. Seth Brundle's Jeff Goldblum offspring. She gives birth to a slimy cocoon  from inside which their son Martin Brundle emerges. Veronica dies during labour. Martin becomes the property of Bartok Industries run by Anton Bartok Lee Richardson because his company supplied the equipment and funding for Seth Brundle's original experiments. Martin becomes very close to Bartok and considers him his father. Martin grows at an astounding rate he is told by his Doctors that he has a genetic disorder called 'Brundle's accelerated growth syndrome'. For every one human year he ages at the rate of five. He never sleeps has a photographic memory and consumes information at a huge rate. He is constantly monitored by cameras and studied by Dr. Shepard Frank C. Turner and Dr. Jainway Ann Marie lee. Eventually as an adult Martin Eric Stoltz start to develop emotions and falls in love with night shift worker Beth Logan Daphne Zuniga Bartok also uses Martins brilliance to carry on his fathers work and perfect the teleportation devices. Beth is transfered to another lab across town and Martin begins to realize that he has been lied to and considered nothing more than a experiment since birth. Soon Martin starts to change his skin starts to ooze slime and goo and his whole body is gradually metamorphasised into a grotesque mutant and Martin is determined to gain revenge against all those who lied to him. Directed by Chris Walas whose company provided the special effects for this and the original. I quite liked it overall. The fist half of the script by Mick Garris Jim  Kim Wheat and Frank Darabont concentrates on building the relationships between the characters and the second half basically consists of a giant slimy genetic mutant monster on the loose running around killing everyone in sight. Acting is solid throughout and Zuniga makes for an attractive leading lady. The special effects are impressive Martin as the fly looks good even if the puppetry is a little stiff in certain scenes we get some decent gore effects too like a melting face after Martin sprays a security guard with digestive acid and a gorily squashed head. There is also a scene of a mutant dog which some people might find a little distasteful. The film has good production values and has a certain polish about it. Good enough in all departments but not outstanding in any. It ain't too bad and probably at least worth a watch for horror film fans.".

This one's about the son of the Goldblum and Davis characters from that movie as he grows to adulthood in five years and eventually starts to turn into a human fly thing all the while being manipulated by an Evil Rich Guy. Honestly who cares? It probably took them an hour to write the script for this. The movie stars Eric Stoltz and he's kind of expressionless through the whole thing perhaps intentionally. It's directed by Chris Walas who handled the special effects on the Cronenberg film. As you might expect there's a lot of effects here particularly of the grossout variety. But the whole thing looks dingy and cheap. It's a movie full of clichs with little to recommend in its favor unless you're a gorehound.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Going My Way' director Leo McCarey taps into one of the basic tenets of human nature that being the fact that even the most selfless individual has wants and needs that often go unrecognized or unexpressed.  It's a matter of understanding the human condition being sensitive to what drives our fellow man and responding to it.  A young woman of eighteen leaves home because of a conflict with her parents yet has nowhere to go a man with a touch of Scrooge' in him who runs a Savings  Loan has trouble setting his priorities a gang of streetwise kids need some direction an elderly priest after fortyfive years has allowed his parish to slip into financial straits.  All circumstances that are affecting in their innate humanity and it's into this that McCarey taps directly with his story and it's the reason for the success of his film.  Simply put it has heart and it makes it timeless.Father Fitzgibbon Barry Fitzgerald has been at St. Dominic's in New York since it was built but the financially strapped parish is in arrears on the mortgage payment and Mr. Ted Haines Sr. Gene Lockhart of the SL that holds the note would like nothing better than to be able to foreclose on the church because then he could raze the building and turn it into a parking lot.  Meanwhile the Bishop has sent a young priest Father Chuck O'Malley Bing Crosby to St. Dominic's to look into the situation and very quickly the good Father finds that he has his hands more than full.Sent to take charge without taking charge' in deference to Father Fitzgibbon's tenure Father O'Malley has his work cut out just trying to save the church but that's not all he has to contend with.  Found alone on the street by a local policeman a girl named Carol James Jean Heather is brought to St. Dominic's and Father O'Malley realizes that without some help she's headed for nothing but trouble.  He also encounters a lad named Tony Scaponi Stanley Clements the leader of the gang that has been terrorizing the neighborhood and turning that situation around becomes a priority on Father O'Malley's todo' list.  Then there is Mr. Haines Sr. to deal with.  But most especially in need of all though he doesn't realize it himself is Father Fitzgibbon and this too Father O'Malley recognizes. Now it's just a matter of addressing all of these needs at once and as Father O'Malley finds out it's no easy task.There's something of the Angel Dudley played by Cary Grant in The Bishop's Wife' in Father O'Malley as he is not only sensitive to the needs of those he encounters but knows how to resolve their conflicts in a way that suits the best interests of all concerned.  His solutions may be those of a perfect pieinthesky world and not necessarily a reflection of reality but it works because it captures the spirit of what this movie is all about  caring and lending a helping hand to those who need it.  The solutions may be unrealistic and overly simplified but the feelings and emotions of the characters are very real and McCarey's ability to capture that essence of humanity is what earned this film the Oscar for Best Movie of 1944 McCarey received Oscars as well for Best Director and Original Story.As Father O'Malley Bing Crosby gives one of his best performances which earned him an Oscar for Best Actor.  But as good as he is in this part the award is something of a surprise the Father O'Malley Crosby presents has the patience of a Saint and insight to match and his mild mannered approach to the character makes his portrayal the kind that are usually overlooked and underappreciated because of the apparent facility of the delivery.  And Crosby does make it look easy which also makes it very real striking a chord as perfect as the solutions to the problems he solves along the way. It's interesting to note that when Crosby recreated the role a year later in The Bells of St. Mary's' though he slipped back into the character readily enough it didn't seem to have that same depth or impact as in this one but more of a been there done that' feel.  Then again this story and the characters with which he is surrounded here are much richer and have much more definition than those of the sequel and this film is much more emotionally involving.Barry Fitzgerald received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Father Fitzgibbon and well deserved it was.  Father O'Malley may be the anchor of this film but Father Fitzgibbon is it's soul.  And the final scene unexpected and extremely moving leaves no doubt about it. That scene in fact so powerful in it's simplicity veritably sums up the sentiment of the entire movie.  It's a triumph for Fitzgerald as well as McCarey but the one who really comes out the winner is the viewer.The supporting cast includes Frank McHugh Father Timothy William Frawley Max James Brown Ted Haines Jr. Rise Stevens Genevieve Linden Eily Malyon Mrs. Carmody Carl Alfalfa' Switzer Herman and Adeline De Walt Reynolds Mrs. Molly Fitzgibbon.  A heartfelt and uplifting discourse on the brighter side of the human condition Going My Way' reflects the good there is to be found in humanity if we but take the time to seek it out.  An entertaining feelgood film this is what the magic of the movies is all about.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fairly oldfashioned film even when first released Going My Way is probably a tough sell these days compared to other 'feel good' movies of its time. It's a little too long a little too sweet a little too casual and has more than a little too much music. Then again it also has Bing Crosby and a Crosby picture without music is like a fishtank without fish.Bing plays a young progressive priest assigned to the parish of an aging stubborn much older priest Barry Fitzgerald who desperately needs help in dealing with his church and congregation and is too proud to ask for it. At first the old priest distrusts the younger one and regards him as too 'modern' in his outlook. In time the two men come to get along famously but with a few bumps in the road along the way. The movie is a comedy and a sermon a musical and a drama. It is at times painfully and at other times hilariously realistic. When it sticks to its central story it's just fine. But it zooms off in dozen different directions and at times seems to lose its way. In the end everything comes together neatly but it takes an awful long time for the movie to get there.Going My Way is literally the opposite of film noir. It is bright and sunny and aggressively optimistic in tone. Yet it is set in the slums of New York in a parish surrounded by poverty and crime. Director Leo McCarey does not minimize the negative aspects of the parish community if anything he emphasizes themin order to offer a cure or rather cures faith hope and charity. The movie's sensibility can be summed up in the face and demeanor of its star Bing Crosby who manages to be smart open breezy charming sly and decent all at the same time. One can't help but be reminded after seeing this film that life's problems heavy and complex as they are can be addressed in other ways and in other vocabularies than those of social scientists and existential philosophers and that simplifying matters cutting them down to their essentials is perhaps as important as verbalizing them. Most people do not read the great books or discuss the great ideas and for most of us complexity is a burden simplicity a virtue. Without resorting to any theory or idea Going My Way makes this point quite nicely and offers some pleasant songs in the bargain.".

	schema:headline " A movie that really sneaks up on you";
	schema:reviewBody "It's an easily underrated movie particularly because it flatly refuses to do most of the things that people expect movies to do today there's a defiant unwillingness to slip into easy melodrama though I often like melodrama or to spend too much time on comedy etc. The movie won't pigeonhole itself and I think this leads to its secret  at heart it really intends to be about what it's like to be a priest. You CAN'T pigeonhole yourself in that role because you can't possibly know what's coming up or really keep perfect track of all the different threads of a community at the same time. You have to take things as they come and this movie really does that all the way through.And there's also a sense of the wistfulness that comes from giving up that plotdriven style of living  in the scenes where Crosby visits his old girlfriend there's a tangible awareness on both sides that they don't really know what happened to the plot of their relationship  they just took things as they came and it really turned out OK for both of them. Most of the movie's separate narrative threads are left off and returned to almost at random  and the main focus on the relationships between the characters is what ends up shining through as intended.A lot of the film is spent on scenes that seem kind of inconsequential at the time like most of everyday life but they invariably lead to a payoff later in the film. There's a shot of Gene Lockhart watching his son leave  a silent shot that just holds on a medium shot of the father watching his expression for about 10 seconds  that I found absolutely sublime in its effectiveness. To me that single shot justifies the half dozen scenes that led to it. Ultimately the movie is almost happy to laugh at the audience for being so eager to expect more of a story. As one character aptly saysSchmaltz is in this year the people behind this movie KNOW that a lot of people will want to dismiss it but won't let them off the hook so easily. It's looks deceptively simple to make a film this easygoing and yet moving. Capra tried it later in his career sometimes with Crosby and yet he couldn't pull it off.The Oscar win is OK though I think Double Indemnity should have won and I also like The Miracle of Morgan's Creek a lot more as well THE SPOTS!!! but Going My Way belonged in the top 5 that year along with Laura and I'mnotsurewhatelse. Gaslight maybe? And I'll note that I do like the sequel The Bells of St. Mary's actually written first a little better too.But as I wrote in the summary this one really sneaks up on you the last scenes prove much more moving than you expect and the ending of the film  while initially seeming abrupt  leaves you suddenly saying Of course  it's perfect. Just moving on.......9 of 10P.S. Is it really set in New York? That's never said and there's so much talk of St. Louis that I think that more accurate a guess. The Metropolitan Opera House is mentioned but that's a genericsounding name. Honestly I think they went to great effort to make it as unrooted in a single locale as possible.".

He finds himself faced with many wonderful characters especially the grumpy old Irish master of the church Barry Fitzgerald who doesn't see eye to eye with the new guy. The interplay between Crosby and Fitzgerald is delightfully funny.This best picture winner of 1944 at the Oscars is one of the alltime greatest movies. Crosby was as warm and benevolent an actor as he was a singer as his performance in Going My Way proves.The film shows eventually that it is necessary in life to learn to accept everyone around you regardless of faults and flaws of character and to help your fellow people find their strengths and develop them in order to serve humanity. But believe me this film is anything but pedantic issues such as these do not drive the film but arise from situations often lighthearted that arise naturally in the story.An example of this is that there were some juvenille delinquents that the Crosby character rounded up not to pass judgement or scorn but to organise them into doing something constructive that made them enjoy life and give up theft as a means of dealing with boredom  he turned them into a choir. Sounds a bit like Sister Act? I'm sure Going My Way had some influence on this more recent effort but it is much superior in many ways. It reminded me also of Michael Landon's Highway to Heaven series without the supernatural components.If you are looking for an old classic with lots of spirit and warmth such as around Christmas time for your whole family to gather around and watch by the fire I recommend Going My Way. It is a mustsee. 10 out of 10.".

There's nothing wrong with Crosby since he is his usual self lowkey and amiable and he has a few chances to sing as well. But Fitzgerald and his character are what adds the depth to an otherwise fairly simple story.Crosby is rather wellcast as a young priest since his benevolent persona seems to fit rather well in the role. As his older more inflexible colleague Fitzgerald delivers one of his many fine supporting performances and in this case he has much more room than usual to develop his character as the movie proceeds. He makes the rather crabby old priest both interesting and endearing and the character provides a valuable balance to Crosby's straightforward wellmeaning character.The story is worthwhile and though it is simple the interplay between the two priests makes the rest of it work much better than it would have on its own. The somewhat episodic plot generally works well and it provides many good moments in addition to having some worthwhile thoughts to communicate.".

But if it's a lighthearted comedy you're after then pull up a chair and check out Going My Way.Bing Crosby stars as Father Charles Chuck O'Malley a newlyordained priest assigned to take over St. Dominic's a New York City church with a mortgage currently run by veteran priest Father Fitzgibbon Barry Fitzgerald. Both Crosby and Fitzgerald give good performances in this movie as attested by the fact they each won an Oscar and Barry Fitzgerald was nominated TWICE for Actor and Supporting Actor a move that necessitated a rule change at the Academy. If you ask me between the two of them I would go with Barry Fitzgerald. His portrayal of the crusty yet kindhearted Father Fitzgibbon was a role he was born to do and it shows.This movie also features the talents of soprano Ris Stevens who plays Jenny Linden an old friend of Father O'Malley's in town performing at the Metropolitan Opera House as Carmen. Though her acting is somewhat wooden it was only her second role she shines all three times she sings. Which leads me to the title of the movie itself.Going My Way is not a story about the Catholic Church nor is it about old friends reuniting or even about two young lovers James Brown and Jean Heather. It's about a song. That's right. A song written by Father O'Malley and upon which its success determines the very future of St. Dominic's. Like I said this is light comedy nothing too serious is happening here.At the time of this movie's release in 1944 World War II was at its crescendo. The newsreels and the papers were full of reports of the war. Some war veterans had made their way back home after getting wounded in battle. Major offenses like Operation Overlord DDay had succeeded but at tremendous cost. At a time when the world was at its grimmest this was the perfect escape. The only reference to the war in the entire movie occurs when landlord Ted Haines Sr. Gene Lockhart discovers his son Ted Jr. Brown quit his job and eloped with a young singer named Carol James Heather. Just when he thinks his son has lost all sense of reality he turns around and sees Ted Jr. in an Army Air Corps uniform. Only then Ted Sr. realizes his son hasn't gone mad he is off to join the war.If you are a fan of the Road movies Bing Crosby did with Bob Hope you most likely remember the occasional aside in which either Bing boasts about his Oscar or Bob grumbles about it. Well this is the film that gave Bing his Oscar. And he was nominated again the next year for playing the same character in the the sequel The Bells of St. Mary's. Obviously he must've been doing something right! Going My Way was a little ray of sunshine cast upon a pained world and even now it will still put a smile on your face.".

Yet Father O'Malley never steps over the older priest's shoes to make his rank felt.This film was shot after the more successful and better made The Bells of St. Mary's but it was released earlier than the other film probably to capitalize on Bing Crosby's popularity. The film in fact is a showcase for Mr. Crosby who was a likable actor and singer. He has good opportunities in the movie.As good as Mr. Crosby was in the film Barry Fitzgerald steals the movie with his Father Fitzgibbon. Mr. Fitzgerald's crusty priest was one of the best creations of his long career. Frank McHugh another excellent character actor of the era is seen as Father O'Dowd. Gene Lockhart also has a small role as the money man Mr. Haines. Rise Stevens the soprano is seen and heard in the film singing in her inimitable style.The film is a classic that should be seen during the holidays as it brings cheer and hope to everyone lucky enough to catch a screening of it during Christmas.".

	schema:reviewBody "Going My Way910.Sometimes I can be such a sucker for sap and this film nabbed me hook line and sinker.I think the reason this films works so well despite its sappy shortcomings stems from the interplay between its two stars Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald. Crosby plays Father Chuck O'Malley the new easy going yet radical and modern thinking replacement to Barry Fitzgerald's sweet and financially floundering Father Fitzgibbon. Being a radical and modern thinker for the time of the film's original release means that Father O'Malley can often be seen wearing a baseball jersey and sweat pants around the Church while Father Fitzgibbon is relegated to wearing the traditional frocks more becoming of an older and more respectable priest.At first Father Fitzgibbon is taken aback by Father O'Malley's radical ideas for the church but his fears are soon assuaged once he hears the results from O'Malley's new ragtag boys choir made up from the local neighborhood delinquents. Father O'Malley becomes more than a figurehead he becomes a real Father to these kids he takes them off the streets and into baseball games and gives them a positive outlet through singing to become a positive part of their community.What Father Fitzgibbon doesn't know is that Father O'Malley was sent to his church as his replacement. Once Father Fitzgibbon discovers this bit of information he runs away from the parish. Father Fitzgibbon doesn't get too far before Father O'Malley has him back in the church with the understanding that he will never get rid of Father Fitzgibbon. In fact O'Malley not only has to look after the neighborhood kids but also the aging Father Fitzgibbon. O'Malley decides to teach Fitzgibbon the game of golf perhaps Bing was scouting for his own pro am at Pebble Beach? as a way of keeping track of him and giving him a sense of purpose.Although the movie will have its moments of 'Gods Will' the fire that burns down the church and of 'redeemable sacrifice' Fitzgibbon's reunion with his mother the movie really is a centerpiece for Bing Crosby. The movie seems to get by on emotion and good vibes as well as some very fine performances.Even though the movie is quaint and goodnatured don't be surprised too much when you hear a couple of double entendres uttered by O'Malley while settling down to eat a turkey dinner that was acquired by Fitzgibbon only after the neighborhood kids stole it. O'Malley smirks aloud to the unaware Fitzgibbon that there's nothing quite like eating some 'hot turkey'. O'Malley then remarks that after the boys lost their turkey to Fitzgibbon that the boys must have 'given you the bird'. These remarks have the fingerprints of its director Leo McCarey.Yeah sometimes I can be such a sucker that I'll believe just about anything. This movie won me over and I feel good about that.910.

In the 1940s and 1950s Catholic priests were the good guys and likable actors like Pat O'Brien Spencer Tracy and even Bing Crosby made them even more attractive. Since the '60s Hollywood went in the opposite direction and made them villains more than anything else.Frankly I never found a nun who looked like Ingrid Bergman or Audrey Hepburn or a priest who could sing like Bing Crosby but what the hell er heck....better to see a positive cleric image than a negative I believe.The first hour of this movie was very good and the film might have wound up a favorite of mine but the second half petered out quickly and never regained steam except for a nice ending. The films bogs down with a romance that has nothing to do with the story. The music also lost its appeal to me when Crosby's fine voice was finished for the film replaced by the operatic high notes of Rise Stevens.Overall the film has a number of nice touching moments and Crosby is very likable but the story goes on too long and is not one I would watch a second time.".

Good support from Ris Stevens Stanley Clements Frank McHugh Jean Heather Eily Malyon and Gene Lockhart.

	schema:reviewBody "Going My Way is just great no doubt about it. By now if you're reading my review you already know the players and the plot. I'm not sure if reviews are posted with the most recent first. However I wanted to add my review because of just how powerful this movie is even today. As a young girl I grew up on these types of movies. I watched them and appreciate them however not as much as I do today now that I am a mother of two little girls. I wanted to show them great films for them to earn an appreciation of 'a feelgood movie' and I started with 'The Song of Bernadette'. My follow up was 'Going My Way' and they loved it  so did my husband who had never seen it growing up. We're 70s kids by the way and 'Going My Way' has timeless relevance. Quite the heady responsibility Fr. O'Malley has of turning things around at St. Dominic's! However with prayer faith and determination it is all possible. Fr. Fitzgibbons is so set in his ways that he's not receptive to Fr. O'Malley who unfortunately gets off to a bad start. In time though their friendship deepens and never once does Fr. O'Malley force his new role on the aging Pastor. The scene where after visiting the bishop to initially have Fr. O'Malley removed Fr. Fitzgibbons sits in a chair and tells of how without needing so many words he now understands the real reason that Fr. O'Malley was sent is very moving. There's a lot of music in this film perfectly fine when you have Bing Crosby in it! and a bit of opera from 'the Met'  definitely got my kids asking about the particular opera they featured. I hope you will show these types of movies to your children as I have now begun to. All the pieces come together and you can feel the segue to a 'sequel' in the last ten or fifteen minutes of the film. It personifies what putting the needs of others before your own truly means and how God works in those ways will cause you to experience a wide range of emotions. Overall this is a terrific film and tonight we will watch the 'sequel' The Bells of St. Mary's.".

I understand that in the 1940s there was a need for some escapism but there was Meet Me in St. Louis that year. And though I never cared for Cover Girl at least it moves. This is maybe the worst Best Picture winner though Gladiator comes close. I am not Catholic perhaps that is it. And I am also not an atheist though this movie seriously makes me reconsider that.".

Both a Christmas and St. Patrick's Day favorite it pays homage to what has today become a tired and tarnished icon the wholesome Catholic priest. Of the two films this one works better due to the more lively characters in the film Feisty old Father Fitzgibbon some of the Bowery Boys complete with Brooklyn accents the Michell Boys Choir that I'll get by girl whose part was no doubt rewritten to meet the 30's code standards. Also several lively tunes including two multimillion selling records Silent Night and Swingin' on a Star.According to legend all Crobsy's royalties from the hymn were donated to charities.

	schema:headline " Let's Pretend Was Never Better!";
	schema:reviewBody "It may be silly sentimental hokum but as Christmas movies go it just doesn't get any better than Going My Way. Bing Crosby is the world's perfect priest paragon of virtue Father Charles O'Malley Barry Fitzgerald its most lovable and the story that drives this film makes you wish it was all true. It isn't of course. It's fantasy of the most fantastic kind a feelgood warmfuzzies movie that is and always will be a Christmas tradition with me like hearing Gene Autry sing Rudolph The RedNosed Reindeer or Judy Garland warble Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas. Set towards the end of the second world war Going My Way opens at St. Dominic's Roman Catholic church a vulnerable bricks and mortar edifice teetering on the verge of bankruptcy threatened with foreclose by the Knickerbocker Loan and Trust Company as headed by Ted Haines Senior Gene Lockhart. To try to save the parish the bishop assigns Fr. O'Malley to take over the running of St. Dominic's without first telling fortyfive year incumbent Fr. Fitzgibbon Barry Fitzgerald. Conservative persnickety and extremely set in his ways Fr. Fitzgibbon does not initially take very kindly to the more modern hep younger man and his 'progressive' approach. But somehow O'Malley manages to bring the old man on board without once trespassing on his dignity or defiling his self esteem. With just enough music and plot twists to keep everything briskly flowing Going My Way is that rare film that never lags during its two hour and seven minute running time. The perfect Christmas confection it is never preachy thus making its core message that much more powerful. Yes it may be a schmaltzy old relic from a bygone era but its incandescent glow is as warm and comforting today as it undoubtedly was when first released in 1944. The perfect 'let's pretend' movie the multi Oscar winning Going My Way best picture director actor and supporting actor among others is the perfect antidote to our twentyfirst century seasonal madness of rampant consumerism fuelled by unbridled greed. Definitely not to be missed!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The most popular and highly acclaimed movies of the war years the Best Picture Academy Award winners in particular demonstrate the changing public mood as the Second World War ground on. The '42 and '43 winners Mrs Miniver and Casablanca respectively both dealt first hand with the war albeit in very different ways. By 1944 however with the conflict now becoming an accepted part of life alongside with the loss and suffering that went with it what people wanted most was escapism. And this is exactly what Going My Way offers.Adapted by Franks Butler and Cavett from a story by its director Leo McCarey Going My Way is a sweet and gentle outpouring of peace and kindness. It is religious yes but it focuses on a priest's role as a man of the community more than as a man of god and this gives it broader appeal. And more than just a story it is while not an actual musical certainly a very musical picture giving us dialogues which look at the role of music in our lives and the nature of emotion in music. It also happens to be an incredibly wellwritten screenplay. The aforementioned focus on music is by no means a dry analysis it flows organically from story and character. And the characters are brilliantly defined. Each has their flaws enough to make them believable  such as Ris Stevens and Fortunio Bonanova arguing over the following of the baton  but trivial enough that we can still warm to them.Going My Way comes from the middle of Bing Crosby's impressively long and even career as a leading man. Crosby's performance is like everything in this picture subtle and laidback. On the surface it is just another typical Crosby crooner act but it's much more than that. What really makes it stand out is that we are totally able to accept serial male loveinterest Crosby as a Catholic priest. He tones down the cheekiness of his persona without altering his familiar friendliness too much and conveys his inner thoughts through the simplest of expressions. Also very good is Barry Fitzgerald who creates and inhabits the character of Father Fitzgibbons bringing a consistent personality to everything from the creak in his voice to the way he hunches his shoulders as he walks.Director Leo McCarey is a real master of simplicity. He rarely moves his camera or changes its angle but still manages to keep everything that we need to see going on in the frame. Of especial note here is his use of depth in a fixedcamera shot. Sometimes this can be comical McCarey started off in slapstick and revealing of character such as the early scene where Crosby is cheerful on the phone behind a disgruntled Fitzgerald but it can be used to all sorts of other effects. The scene where Crosby plays the title song for Jean Heather and James E. Brown finishes with Crosby slipping out across the back of the shot while the two young lovers still lean entranced on the piano in the foreground. It's a wonderfully discrete and touching moment.This is in all ways a finely crafted slice of nonsickly sentiment which in its day surely must have been an effective distraction from the drudge of war. But what is in a way most poignant about it is that while it does not directly mention the war itself it somehow cannot escape from a few of the realities of life at the time. Towards the end James E. Brown shows up in a uniform and proudly states he's been accepted by the air force and will be leaving soon. Noone actually says war but you know that's where he's going. And then it's at this point you realise that the only males to be seen in this vision of New York are either boys old men or priests. It's a fact that gives the heartwarming cosiness of the story that little extra sense of urgency and the resonance of that still makes this a deeply affecting picture years after the context for which it was made.".

Some of the attitudes expressed in the film would never go over today.In 1944 Francis J. Spellman was the Archbishop of the New York Diocese he would not get to be Cardinal until after World War II. He had a degree of power that Thomas Becket would have wished for. The scene in which the Irish cop turns Jean Heather over to the local parish presumably after finding out she WAS a Catholicis bizarre but actually true in that time. It's a historical fact that when a priest was caught breaking a law no paper work was ever done. The errant clergyman was turned over to the Archdiocese to mete out punishment which usually meant exile. Crosby and Fitzgerald as priests take a great deal on themselves in getting involved with the lives of the parishioners. It would never do today. A sort of dark version of Going My Way was done in the 1980s in Heaven Help Us. And that was even before the sex abuse scandals became widely known. But this film is exactly how the Catholic Church sees itself and likes itself to be portrayed. This film brought Bing Crosby to the pinnacle of his career. It brought him an Oscar critical acclaim as an actor and number one at the box office where he stayed for five years. Going My Way was the highest grossing film Paramount had put out up to that point and stayed there until Cecil B. DeMille did his second version of the Ten Commandments. But it was a double edged sword for Bing. Before this movie he was popular but now he became Saint Crosby THE Catholic entertainer in the world. It was an image no one could really live up to so those hatchet job biographies that were written after his death brought an icon down. Hopefully with a multi volume biography of Bing half out now some critical balance will be restored and he can be appreciated for the entertainer he was.One other thing it was a running joke at the time that when Crosby wore a St. Louis Browns sweatshirt in the movie with such a religious background he brought the Browns luck and their only American League pennant during the team's existence.Going My Way is an interesting but dated piece of film making and a must for all us Crosby aficionados.".

The great character actor Barry Fitzgerald is wonderful as the older and much more cynical Father Fitzgibbons who has seen more than his share of pain and suffering in the world and is starting to lose his true outlook on life. These two actors give very fine performances and carry the otherwise simplistic story through the entire movie. There are other nice touches such as the subplot of Fitzgibbons wishing to see his mother in Ireland and O'Malley organizing a boys choir in order to make money for the church. The moral of the story is simple as well. No matter what obstacles come against you you can always overcome if you believe and have faith.

	schema:headline " The most absurd and ironic film ever made?";
	schema:reviewBody "Here we have a 24minute I read that it was much longer but most of it is lost blackandwhite documentary from 1944 Germany. If you have a bit knowledge about history you will know what was going on at that time. The writer and director is Kurt Gerron a prolific filmmaker and actor in the first half of the 20th century in Germany. This is his last work and he was forced to do it by the Nazis. It takes place entirely at a concentration camp and depicts its inmates from start to finish. This film was the Nazi party's attempt to make it look as if life in concentration camps was not all bad for Jews. They are shown smiling and joking around. They play football in their free time or make music. It is such an unreal experience knowing that basically everybody in this video including the children and Gerron himself were murdered in gas chambers in the weeks after this was made. This film is possibly the best example of how National Socialists were adjusting the truth for their despicable intentions.Now after I wrote this you probably wonder why would I give it such a high rating. The answer is very simple. Even with all the tragedy surrounding it this is a priceless piece of filmmaking and a historic document that is absolutely unique. Would less people have died if this hasn't been made? Absolutely not. These 24 minutes give us a unique insight into the mind of National Socialism and that is why I highly recommend watching this to everybody with an interest in 20th century history. But be aware Don't do it if you cannot deal with the contents depicted in here. Finally let me recommend you Prisoner of Paradise as well. I have not yet gotten a chance to watch it but it has a pretty good rating on IMDb and this Oscarnominated documentary from 2002 is about the life of Kurt Gerron and there is certainly a lot to learn from it. If you get your hands on it give it a go.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the novel by Jean Ray the socalled Belgian Poe Malpertuis begins with Jan a young sailor being summoned with a motley company of acquaintances and family to the death bed of his mysterious Uncle Cassave. Cassave soon dies leaving his considerable fortune to the dozen or so people he has summoned. However there are stiff terms attached to his gift The inheritors must all live for the rest of their lives at Malpertuis Cassave's mansion. Jan soon realizes there is something amiss at Malpertuis a name meaning either house of evil or house of cunning. There is something odd in the attic in the labyrinthine hallways and in the surrounding wood. There is something even stranger about Malpertuis' other inhabitants the mad hermit Lampernisse who haunts the mansion's dark corridors the coy and beautiful Euryale who will not look anyone in the face and the diabolic taxidermist Philarete to name only a few. When the secret of Malpertuis is finally brought to light among this bizarre cast of characters the mansion erupts into a seething cauldron of terror and both heaven and earth seem to collapse around Jan.While fans of Jean Ray's novel will find the story much changed the film is visually engaging at the very least and the casting is excellent for the most part. Orson Welles plays the dying Uncle Cassave delivering the second performance of his career as a large man stuck in a very large bed the other performance being of course in his adaptation of Kafka's The Trial. Susan Hampshire gives an admirable performance in four different rolesexcellently well disguised and madeover in eachas Euryale Nancy Alice and a nurse. The sets are extraordinary filling the screen with an unending stream of vivid detail. Also the film's cinematography is often both aggressive and intelligently creative employing just the sort of unpredictable perspective necessary to portray the mansion's mystifying interior.Disappointments with the film begin small. JeanPierre Cassel as Lampernisse does not look the part. Instead of a tall shadowy agedbutageless and profoundly mad hermit he looks like a leper who has wandered off the set of BenHur. Accompanying Lampernisse is the laughable highpitched babble of the creatures in the attic. In these rare instances the filmmakers miss by a wide margin the texture of Ray's novel. At other times the film slightly underplays or rushes some of the book's strongest scenes. The one serious offense though is the film's ending the muddled chaos here is a poor substitute for Ray's synchronized anarchy.This is not to say that the film loses itself completely. The strength of the first hour and more cannot be entirely undermined by the ending. The inspired cinematography and many of the sets performances and special effects are truly exceptional. The scenes with little crazed mousy Philarete and his morbid workroom are reason enough for the film to exist. Subtlety and humor are here as well perhaps best represented in the recurring static shot of the inheritors occupying themselves in Malpertuis' small drawing room.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harry Kmel's ambitious  courageous film version of Jean Ray's complex novel was offered one big chance to prove itself internationally and to instantly become a genre classic at the annual Cannes Film Festival in 1972. Sadly enough the shown version  which later got rejected by the director  didn't impress any audiences then and by the time Kmel came trotting along with his very own and much better reedited version of the film containing over twenty minutes of extra footage nobody really cared to see it anymore. Now that's a real pity because in this restored version Malpertuis is a truly brilliant work of Gothic art and unquestionably one of the greatest movies ever made in Belgium. A lot more than in the internationalorientated versions the emphasis now lies on obscure mystery and claustrophobic set designs. Both versions are so incredibly different that the common plot summaries of the international Cannes version which can be found in newspaper articles and movie websites actually reveal the mysterious denouement of Kmel's ultimate reedited version! Those reviews immediately explain what odd types of characters are living in the Malpertuis mansion whereas in the 'correct' version it is kept secret to the young protagonist Jan as well as to the viewer. I'm desperately trying not to include any spoilers in this usercomment while the same essential plot twists can be read everywhere over the internet Evidently this film didn't appeal to anyone in Cannes! You can clearly see where it's going right away and thus the sophisticated and enormously stylish hints that are given to unravel the mystery yourself become completely pointless.The legendary Orson Welles stars in one of his last glorious roles as the mighty and fearsome albeit bedridden patriarch of the immense Malpertuis mansion who gathered an eccentric collection of people to announce his last will to. Among them is young sailor Jan who swore that he would never set foot in Malpertuis ever again and he constantly tries to convince his sister Nancy to do the same. Quentin Cassavius' testament claims that there's a gigantic family fortune to divide only none of the persons present is allowed to leave the mansion and the last remaining man and woman have to get married. Jan is determined to stay around as soon as he falls in love with the mysteriously beautiful Euryale but other members of the pact that try to escape the domain are found dead soon after causing hostility and unrest among the remaining members. Harry Kmel builds up the tension and unfolds the mystery like a genuine master and all this without showing the slightest bit of graphic violence. Instead he portrays the ominous mansion like an inescapable surreal dimension with endless dark corridors and spiral staircases. Secondary scenery like paintings on the wall and statues in the grim attic magnificently add to the wondrous Gothic atmosphere. Meanwhile the constant elaboration of patterns and intrigues between the many supportive characters lead the story to one of the most grotesque and devastating climaxes in cinema ever. Of course you'll only be truly enchanted by this climax if you haven't seen the EnglishFrench versions or read any plot descriptions before you watch it. Orson Welles and Mathieu Carrire are great but the true star is Susan Hampshire playing no less than three different and very complex characters. Harry Kmel's Malpertuis is a small masterpiece combining visual artwork with extraordinary plotting. An absolute must!".

The picture was actually originally made in English French German and Dutch versions and then hacked to bits in the various markets. This film is a mustsee for any serious film fan with its fabulous photography stylish composition and surreal overtones  Magritte too was Belgian. It's more than a horror film as it has often been tagged but a series of dreams or perhaps nightmares with all the illogic of dreams. I am fairly certain that Welles did his own Flemish dialog and that too makes it a must for the connoisseur.".

The sailor is Jan portrayed by blonde headed blueeyed scrawny Mathieu CarrireBorn for Hell and he at first just wishes to leave but his demanding uncle has something of importance to tell him regarding a will which could prove profitable if he decides not to leave. Within the house are an eccentric group of oddballs all attempting to appease their master hoping to leave Malpertuis once Cassavius kicks the bucket. Even still Jan has no desire to stay until a ravishing red head EuryaleSusan Hampshire who plays multiple roles presenting an astonishing range making three specific characters completely unique and different a multifaceted performance that deserves praise his cousin arrives throwing his life into torment. The proposition in Cassavius' will is for those inside Malpertuis to remain until one couple survives gaining the inheritance. Relatives and hired help the greedy vultures they are remain awaiting for the chance to gain the giant piggybank and property entitled if they can outlast their peers. Meanwhile Jan decides to trek through the halls mysterious rooms and spiral staircases of Malpertuis a massive ring containing an army of keys hoping to unlock the secrets of the place hoping to understand Cassavius. Along the way Jan discovers that Malpertuis may be much much more than just a mansion and those people within it's walls could be more than they appear. The film incorporates dream logic which has you wondering what Jan might experience next. We are in a sense on the same surreal journey as Jan is experiencing what he does bombarded by unpredictable behavior always yearning to learn more. Lots of symbolism and director Harry KmelDaughters of Darknessestablishes the importance of faces..through the multiple characters portrayed by Hampshire..as not only Euryale the one Jan desires and seemingly can not touch but also his beloved sister Nancy and a lusting Alice who openly engages him for sexual favors longing to be human despite what she really is we realize that what we are seeing isn't a real world as we know it. The mansion itself..the astonishing spiral staircases and endless roomshallsis a veritable maze about as maddening as the unusual characters which inhabits it's domain. We keep discovering like Jan new things regarding the characters that remain in Malpertuis and what their true relation to him..in a dream faces of people that exist often derive from those you have contacted in real life. Harry Kmel's visual style is magnificent and his camera vividly captures the nuances of this remarkable habitat observing what Jan sees. Everything from the art direction..every room produces a different kind of mood and yields a startling coloratmosphere all it's ownto the editing..the way Kmel is able to feature three Hampshires in one single room is aweinspiring everything's firstrate developed with topnotch skill. Color me impressed because I hadn't ever heard of it's existence until just recently and I'm thankful I had an opportunity to see it. I watched the director's cut dubbed into French with English subtitles. Orson Welles entirely in bed commands the screen moving very little..it's simply amazing how much presence he had. Hampshire is positively divine her beauty hypnotic at times. The twists at the end..who these people are is revealed not once but twicereally dazzle but the pace slowly develops so many might grow impatient but I couldn't wait to see what was gonna come next.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before seeing Malpertuis 1971 I was already a fan of Belgian director Harry Kmel for his mesmerizing Lesbian Vampire film Les Lvres Rouges Daughters of Darkness from the same year which in my opinion is the best film of its kind. I had great expectations for Malpertuis because of my admiration of Kmel as a true master of atmosphere because I had heard the film was Kmel's greatest and because of Orson Welles stared in it. Even so this instant favorite of mine surpassed my greatest hopes and totally blew me away. Malpertuis is a bizarre and hypnotic mixture of surreal Gothic Horror macabre family Drama mad science and Mythological Fantasy that no cineaste should allow himself or herself to miss. Actually I'd like to correct myself. The film cannot really be narrowed down by attributing it to a particular Genre as such as it is simply one of the most unique films ever made. In one sentence The film has everything and more than that. Malpertuis tells one of the most fascinating stories ever brought to screen and does so in a brilliantly moody manner. The film maintains an incomparably rich eerie and foreboding atmosphere that becomes more intense with each passing minute. The sublime atmosphere comes along with breathtaking settings brilliant cinematography complex and demented characters and fantastic acting performances. The most fascinating thing about Malpertuis however is the story which is one of the most incomparable and gripping I ever saw in a film. Malpertuis is not a film that can properly compared to anything else. It is like a macabre haunting yet incredibly beautiful Fever Dream.The film is an adaptation of a novel by Jean Ray which I haven't yet read. I sure intend to though as the plot of Malpertuis is one of the most unique and fascinating stories that have ever been filmed. Great praise therefore also belongs to writer Jean Ferry. Jan Mathieu Carrire a young sailor comes to his hometown and without wanting to visits the family mansion owned by his creepy and mysterious uncle Cassavius Orson Welles. The mansion is named Malpertuis its inhabitants are equally creepy relatives who hate Cassavius but do everything to brownnose him in desire of his inheritance. A mysterious palace of a mansion bears fascinating and terrifying secrets... Though this is only a vague description of the film I shall stop at this point. I do not want to give too much away as the story is gripping and fascinating from the very beginning and should be experienced rather than read in a review. The sceneries are some of the greatest most aweinspiring I have ever seen. The house Malpertuis alone is one of the most fascinating settings ever in cinema. The atmosphere is overwhelming rich and uncanny throughout the film. Each character is fascinating most of them creepy and demented the performances are sublime. Orson Welles is of course great as always an I would personally even consider Malpertuis one of the greatest films this brilliant actor has been part of in his aweinspiring career. The other performances are also magnificent. Mathieu Carriere is great as Jan and other actors such as JeanPiere Cassel Victor Rilla Michel Bouquet and particularly Charles Jenssen are also brilliant in their roles. Particular praise has to go to the stunningly beautiful Susan Hampshire who is wonderful in her triple role playing three different female leads. The rich atmosphere profits from the Flamish Dutch language and an ingenious score. The film was once reportedly cut to shreds watching the uncut 126 minute director's cut is absolutely essential. Malpertuis is a film that simply cannot be praised enough. This ingenious and absolutely unique masterpiece is one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences one can have both atmospherically and storywise and must not be missed by anybody interested in cinema. As said above It has everything and a lot more. 1010".

When he comes round Jan finds himself being tended to by his sister Nancy Susan Hampshire in his Uncle Quentin Cassavius' Orson Welles imposing old house called Malpertuis they are also joined by various other family members  obscure relatives as Cassavius is not far from death  he has ordered a reading of his will. The will states that his immense fortune will be split equally but the inheritors can never leave the grounds of Malpertuis ever again which sounds a bit harsh to me but there you go anyway it becomes apparent to Jan that all is not right at Malpertuis  that it's hiding some bizarre secrets that Jan finds himself in the center of...This French Belgium  German coproduction was directed by Harry Kumel  didn't do much for me but that could be down to other factors besides the film at hand you see apparently there's a long 2 hour odd version of Malpertuis  shorter cut down version  since the one I watched yesterday ran for less than 90 minutes I think it's safe to assume I'm missing out on a lot so maybe you should bear that in mind although what the extra footage is  whether it would have improved my viewing experience I don't know. The slightly slow going script by Jean Ferry was based on a novel by Jean Ray  has a certain loose strange bizarre quality to it while it's an odd film for sure I have to say I always knew what was going on  it's not abstract or weird in that sense but weird in the sense of what's happening on screen. Who was the supposed killer? Is this answered in the longer version? Were little stitched together people really running around in the attic? Again is this made clear in the longer version? I don't know which is why I feel awkward about either praising or rubbishing the film because I'm not quite sure where the version I saw stands going by the 90 minute cut alone I thought it was OK  nothing more although I must admit I quite liked the twist 'come out of absolute nowhere' ending which I deify anyone to see coming...Director Kumel does a good job  there are plenty of memorable scenes plus the film has a great atmosphere about it. The house itself is nice  imposing  there's some cool production design. I wouldn't call any of it particularly scary though there's not much gore apart from a bit when an Eagle eats someone's guts  someone gets a nail through their head although it's off screen.Technically Malpertuis is good impressive even with decent production values. Since the film was made in Dutch  dubbed into English it's hard to tell about the acting although maybe Welles spoke English during filming  he stands head  shoulders above everyone else in the cast  puts in a memorable performance for the brief screen time he gets.Malpertuis also known as The Legend of Doom House is an OK horrormysterythriller but I can't help but feel I wish I'd seen the long version because as it stands I think I'm missing out on a potentially better film. However the version I watched is the version I watched  that's all there is to it as it stands it's a decent enough film but it didn't do much for me  I doubt I'll be in any hurry to see this 90 minute cut again anytime soon.".

The slightly slow going script by Jean Ferry was based on a novel by Jean Ray  has a certain loose strange bizarre quality to it while it's an odd film for sure I have to say I always knew what was going on  it's not abstract or weird in that sense but weird in the sense of what's happening on screen. Who was the supposed killer? Is this answered in the longer version? Were little stitched together people really running around in the attic? Again is this made clear in the longer version? I don't know which is why I feel awkward about either praising or rubbishing the film because I'm not quite sure where the version I saw stands going by the 90 minute cut alone I thought it was OK  nothing more although I must admit I quite liked the twist 'come out of absolute nowhere' ending which I deify anyone to see coming...Director Kumel does a good job  there are plenty of memorable scenes plus the film has a great atmosphere about it. The house itself is nice  imposing  there's some cool production design. I wouldn't call any of it particularly scary though there's not much gore apart from a bit when an Eagle eats someone's guts  someone gets a nail through their head although it's off screen.Technically Malpertuis is good impressive even with decent production values. Since the film was made in Dutch  dubbed into English it's hard to tell about the acting although maybe Welles spoke English during filming  he stands head  shoulders above everyone else in the cast  puts in a memorable performance for the brief screen time he gets.Malpertuis also known as The Legend of Doom House is an OK horrormysterythriller but I can't help but feel I wish I'd seen the long version because as it stands I think I'm missing out on a potentially better film. However the version I watched is the version I watched  that's all there is to it as it stands it's a decent enough film but it didn't do much for me  I doubt I'll be in any hurry to see this 90 minute cut again anytime soon.";

And as Nazi propaganda it is so subtle and well done that neither of the other reviewers to date have recognized it. One said there is no propaganda and the other says the British are portrayed as criminals which I suppose is technically correct if you can see propaganda in having English criminals in a story set largely in England. The propaganda comes from the perspective of Germans being the master race superior to all others. The only character in the film specifically identified as German is the young boy who has walked from Berlin to attend the exposition where valuable stamps are on display. German superiority is shown as the young boy walks across Europe unassisted recognizes the stamps as forgeries a fact missed by the experts from other countries and is the one who validates the real stamps when they are recovered in the end. The British are not only too dumb to recognize the forgeries but too foolish to even know that there is no Sherlock Holmes in real life... that Holmes and Watson are fictional characters. This fact gets brought out in the end.Germans watching this film in 1937 got a subtle reinforcement of their superiority over all others without interfering with a good story.I recommend catching this film if you get the chance. From any of the perspectives above you get a well done film.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the beginning to the end this is an absolutely enjoyable film. Not only thrilling and offering more than one good mystery to solve and full of surprises from the first sequences to the very end but also played by both Albers and Rhman with a goodhumored touch that suits them perfectly and adds to this new look upon Holmes and Watson. Albers had been a comedian before his detective role in Der Greifer 1930 brought him movie fame and was also a good singer with an easy style and Rhman was known for these kind of roles and was an established comedian. Yet this is not strictly a comedy but a merry detective mystery story.The story begins at night when two men with a strange resemblance to Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson stop a train and board it in a hurry. Word quickly spreads amongst the staff and passengers to a couple of crooks despair. Their two compartment neighbours orphaned sisters in their way to receive an inheritance are to be met again by our not so disinterested heroes adding a romantinc touch. And if Marieluise Claudius and Hansi Knoteck appear at first as simple charming young girls their importance in the development of the events to come is more than it seems. When our heroes reach Brussels they soon get involved in trying to solve the robbery of the valuable Mauritius stamps at the World Exhibition. So dont miss a detail and enjoy whats coming.Only a couple of weak points  even if the Sidney Paget drawings decorating the opening credits become amazingly tuned into Albers image in the train magazine Holmes is lean and angled by no means that rugbybuilt type of man and Watson is not at all a secondary reticent man but a true companion that has his own mind and intelligence something that at least can be occasionally noticed in this film so Rhman was luckier than Nigel Bruce. But that of course is part of the originality of this story. Conan Doyle on his side had nothing to do with the gaudy tipsy innkeeper type being a seriouslooking Scottish who instilled his characters with intelligence and subtle irony. Lacking this introverted sharpness both Arthur Wontner and Jeremy Brett amply displayed Albers has his own strong personality that brings the character into his own without loosing his principles nor the ones of his role for that matter. This is a film made in prewar Germany when things were getting difficult for a man Albers lving with the daughter of a Jewish actor and playwright and Rhman about to divorce his Jewish wife. It is a goal of the entire film crew that this is not noticed at all offering us a highly entertaining witty and impeccably timed story that has retained its qualities through the years.".

	schema:reviewBody "This would actually be a more fitting title for Der Mann der Sherlock Holmes war or The Man Who Was Sherlock Holmes or just Sherlock Holmes as this is the man that this 105minute German blackandwhite film from 1937 is about. It will have its 80th anniversary next year and if you know a bit about German political history you will know immediately that this film was made during the Nazi reign by writer and director Karl Hartl with cowriter Robert Stemmle an experienced filmmaker himself. I am not familiar with any of the supporting players but the two lead actors are among the most famous Germany had to offer in the 1930s and also decades after that namely Hans Albers as Holmes and Heinz Rhmann as Watson. Or I should better say as the men pretending to be this famous detective duo. While they had pretty solid chemistry and I was buying their portrayal of good friendship I must say that I was not too convinced by this film overall. The script just wasn't good or interesting enough. Then again it may have hurt my perception a but that I am generally not the biggest Sherlock Holmes fan especially not of the bad portrayal by Cumberbatch and Freeman and if these two here Albers Rhmann cannot get me interested in the subject then maybe nobody can. I also felt that the writers wanted to be too smart at times as the plot twists seemed forced and uninteresting and the film is at its worst when it tries to be dramatically relevant which is especially at the very end. There is no doubt that Albers and Rhmann have the talent but in this case the writers did not or at least they did not deliver accordingly. I do not recommend this German take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary character. Thumbs down.".

Following Taylor's known flight trajectory the search and rescue team crash lands on an unknown planet much like Earth in the year 3955 with Brent being the only survivor of the team. What Brent initially does not know much like Taylor didn't initially know when he landed here before Brent is that he has landed back on Earth in the future in the vicinity of what was New York City. Brent finds evidence that Taylor has been on the planet. In Brent's search for Taylor he finds that the planet is run by a barbaric race of English speaking apes whose mission is in part to annihilate the human race. Brent eventually locates some of those humans who communicate telepathically and who live underground to prevent detection by the apes. These humans who are in their own way as barbaric as the apes want in turn to protect their species. Brent has to figure out a way to save ...";

	schema:reviewBody "Major Spoilers!!! Beneath... has to rank as one of the meanest movies ever made in its treatment to its main character. Consider this...Brent wakes up to his space ship's crash landing realizing it's 3955?what happened to 3978? so everyone he ever knew except Skipper is dead...then skipper dies too! He finds out that gulp apes rule then gets shot for his discovery same as Taylor. Is rewarded with white stinging vet powder plentifully poured on his still bleeding gunshot wound by Zira. Gets captured and sentenced to ape target practice en route he gets an ape boot shoved into his larynx while said ape tries to pull his arm off. Escapes while apes on horseback fire their guns at him. Goes underground and realizes where he's at. Painful!...and the movie is only into its first 45 minutes. What else can happen to the poor guy? Well...as his mental stability starts heading toward the brink of insanity he does some depressing sightseeing watches helplessly as mind control forces him to near drown Nova then face telepathic inquisitors who proceed to scare the crap out of him with a whoosh of fire fry his ear drums with high pitch sound waves thoughtproject agonizing searing pain that contorts his whole body and again he watches helplessly as he's forced to near suffocate poor Nova with a brutal passionless loooong kiss. Then!... he's required to sit still during mass for some people this is very painful and realizes that everyone else in attendance is a replicant of Gray's Anatomy. He then catches up with friend Taylor finally...and Taylor proceeds to beat the crap out of him too by kicking him in the face and chest strangling him shoving his back into cell bars with long sharp spikes sticking out mercilessly stepping on his face strangling him some more and delivering some shattering right hooks to the jaw all under mind control of course. After the fight instead of friendly gossip they realize they're about 100 yards away from an active bomb not just any old bomb but THE Doomsday Bomb. And they're trapped inside a locked cell. And an army of Militia Apes are attacking!  Finally... escape! but Nova ain't coming. Back to the church Brent witnesses Taylor after spending the whole movie trying to locate him get fatally shot knows he's now alone and goes on a one man kamikaze assault with his one puny rifle against 100 gorilla sub machine guns. And if that ain't enough THEN he runs out of ammo! And he doesn't even get the satisfaction of seeing Taylor's final efforts. What happens to him is what you'd want to see happen to the worst of villains but not to the heroic character. After all this it would have been better to stay in bed.That aside Planet of the Apes WAS a tough act to follow. Beneath the Planet of the Apes cinematography does border on spectacle and alot of credit should go to director Ted Post for getting alot more out of the half baked premise and limitations he was trapped in. Many still frames and action sequences from the film are just as epiclike colorful and bizarre that is on par with and in many instances exceeds the original but the editing in the original surpasses the sequel!not Ted's fault. Still...Beneath's camera angles are far superior than any of the sequels that followed. Composer Leornard Rosenman created a very eerie foreboding music score that touches on some semblance to Jerry Goldsmith's music from the original while taking it into a different direction that effectively captures the mood of the film that works perfectly. It's unavoidable that both Planet and Beneath... have a flavor of their own considering all obstacles so it's appropriate that the both scores follow suit in different scales they're both brilliant.Charlton Heston can't be blamed for his lack of enthusiasm considering what he was presented with. If a more fuller and better continuation of the story was better fleshed out...who knows after all look at his lone survivor interpretation from The Omega Man not far removed from his position at the end of Planet.... But a more diversified storyline was necessary that needed splitting the story between Taylor and the Apes which changed the flow of what followed previously...because the first movie was presented subjectively through the eyes of Taylor. The addition of the new elements that carried the narrative forward was not going to be consistent with director Franklin Schaffner's original subjective approach to the first Apes that made it so successful. So it's very appropriate that James Franciscus' 'Brent' is allowed to discover Ape City because the Apes are one of the main reason people would want to return to the story anyway. The other reason is Taylor! and Nova.  And that is the main problem. Because NO sequel was ever planned for Planet of the Apes! If a storyline was preplanned then this may have paralleled author Pierre Boulle's excellent 'Bridge on the River Kwai' more closely if additional characters were already evident like the way the story in 'Kwai' continued after William Holden escapes from the prison camp as Heston did from Ape City while the events flipped back and forth between Holden's increasing dilemma and that of Alec Guiness' misguided actions. Sadly because it's only 1967 before sequels were recognized as obvious cash cows 'Planet...' didn't have the luxury of foresight of the epic possibilities that could have logically continued the story forward in the same care and quality. Thus we're left with a more emphasis on action orientation less on character growth and a more speedy presentation that's intended to camouflage the story's inadequacy.It's almost easy to say that Beneath... is better appreciated on its own merit as an almost separate entity from Planet... because of its radical introduction to science fiction elements new to the story. But it's not that easy! Comparison is unavoidable!On the many plus sides are  James Gregory's scene stealing 'General Ursus' that propels the conflict between ape and man especially his rousing calltoarms speech Maurice Evans' 'Dr.Zaius' who steals scenes right back the buried underground scenes the Ape Army on the move Cornelius and Zira's home Brent and Nova's underground odyssey the steam bath more if brief views of Ape City and the cages General Ursus' helmet symbolically backed by the many more militant gorillas and the under rated James Franciscus who took upon himself to further flesh out more of his character's heroic attributes. And ANY scene with Taylor! that is all too brief.One thing is near certain Beneath... is never boring in its breakneck pace in storytelling. but it could have been better if there weren't so many 'egos' involved in the decisionmaking process of delivering a quality continuation of the Apes saga. Just think of the possibility if Nova was able to retain her pregnancy scene cut from the first film the bomb wasn't doomsday and she survives the end of the second film.Still kind of fun entertainment!6 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Beneath was the best Planet of the Apes film bar none. Everything was bigger and better this time around bigger sets more gorillas the whole of New York instead of a mere Statue of Liberty and best of all faceless telepathic mutants than can kill with the mind. Yes I was once ten years old.Watched again with many years of hindsight it's clear that while entertaining Beneath was produced without anything approaching artistry. The ultimate in sequels it tries to tell the same story twice as big but with only half the success. Until Battle came along and picked the flesh off Apes' rotting carcass this was the worst sequel because it did nothing new with the format. Even the working title  Planet of the Apes Revisited  betrays the lack of thought and the desire for finance that went into this one.A virtually identical plotline rattles along at a fair pace meaning all subtlety is jettisoned. The allegories are also confused by not really being allegories at all. Look at the metaphor for antiwar protestors by casting chimps as ... er antiwar protestors. A look at how man often judges another man on the colour of his skin is alluded to ... er by having an ape judging a man on the colour of his skin. On this note perversely for a film that purports liberal satire the only one of the mutants to demonstrate real cruelty was Don Pedro Colley the sole black character in the film. And despite its worthiness I don't think I've ever seen another film where a man's credit is given as Negro. However I did have to smile at the chimp that punningly complains about gorilla brutality.The decreased budget a sensible studio idea to cut the finance of the sequels to a hit movie shows with some of the ape extras having decidedly ropy masks in the crowd scenes. The opening of the picture also recaps the first cannily highlighting the glaring difference between Roddy McDowall's and David Watson's performances as Cornelius. Watson standing in for an absent McDowall does reasonably well but really doesn't look anything like him even under latex. Note too how all the ape masks give the actors lisps something I never noticed before. Never mind apes anyone would think James Franciscus had landed on the planet of the Pertwees. There's also some abysmal back projection work when Franciscus is wrestling on top of the horsedrawn carriage. The mutants are pretty good though their prayers to The Holy Fallout are a little silly. Why do they wear human masks anyway? Where do they make them? I dunno I don't make the rules up do I?Of course the main problem is the pointless game of oneupmanship it plays with its source. There's no longer any element of surprise that this is Earth so the ruined monuments nice as they are no longer have any great effect. It misses the point also the Statue of Liberty is not just a relic but a symbol. New York Subway is just where people caught trains. And as impressive as the effects are if not directed well  which they aren't particularly  then it becomes fatuous.It's weird how all four sequels were made within a year of each other yet at least two of them tried something new. Beneath came two years after the original yet has a rehashed in it for the money feel all the way through right down to its abrupt slightly unsatisfactory climax. Yet despite the many many faults I've levelled at it Beneath the Planet of the Apes is still a very enjoyable film. Not in the sense of the first which genuinely had something to say but in the guise of pulp SF then this sequel is well worth seeing. In fact despite the slating I've given it I still awarded it 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first film is awesome. But the 2nd one was always my favorite. It has strange desert locations weird underground subway tunnels odd melted cityscapes telepathic mutants who worship a doomsday bomb. It has more of Linda Harrison of the fabled fur bikini. It has both Chuck Heston and James Franciscus beating the crap out of each other! It has naked apes in steambaths! I was always shocked by the nihilistic and superviolent ending when I saw this film as a child and a recent reviewing shows it to still be a disturbingly grim bout of gun play. The director Ted Post also directed the 2nd of the Dirty Harry films and he shows a Peckinpahlike ability to put the sting back in Death.What is amusing today is watching the film conclude with James Franciscus pinned to a wall with bullet holes stitched across his chest and Chuck Heston clutching his bloody fingers to the button thus leading to the complete destruction of the entire planet...and then an old MPAA rating pops up immediately telling you you have just watched a GRated film!".

It has strange desert locations weird underground subway tunnels odd melted cityscapes telepathic mutants who worship a doomsday bomb. It has more of Linda Harrison of the fabled fur bikini. It has both Chuck Heston and James Franciscus beating the crap out of each other! It has naked apes in steambaths! I was always shocked by the nihilistic and superviolent ending when I saw this film as a child and a recent reviewing shows it to still be a disturbingly grim bout of gun play. The director Ted Post also directed the 2nd of the Dirty Harry films and he shows a Peckinpahlike ability to put the sting back in Death.What is amusing today is watching the film conclude with James Franciscus pinned to a wall with bullet holes stitched across his chest and Chuck Heston clutching his bloody fingers to the button thus leading to the complete destruction of the entire planet...and then an old MPAA rating pops up immediately telling you you have just watched a GRated film!";

	schema:reviewBody "This first sequel to the '68 science fiction hit has all the markings of something rushed into production. There was no time to craft a story which explores the truly interesting possibilities of astronaut Taylor's continuing odyssey on a future world turned upside down. The story could have and should have concentrated on the evolving struggle between the ruling class of apes and the backward humans. Instead the filmmakers created a new threat for this film a secret society of human mutants living underground. They show up in the 2nd half of this feature and in prolonged scenes show off their telepathic powers in torturing the heroes. The heroes in this case are another astronaut Franciscus who followed Taylor's trajectory to this other planet and Taylor himself Heston reprising his role briefly. Wow what an original concept  another astronaut who in an accelerated version of the first film's events also finds Ape City encounters two sympathetic chimps gets captured and escapes. Are we watching some kind of a repeat? The quick pace of this picture is probably its best aspect this stresses action. However the pace is so fast that some crucial points in geography are sacrificed getting to the Forbidden Zone from Ape City is just a short walk in a tunnel for some while others have to trudge for days overhead. In a slight nod to the satirical aspects of the original film we do get to see religion being mocked the original satirized the social  political anchors of a community. But it's not a very subtle jab. The mutants profess to be more intelligent than either the heroes or the apes which they seem to prove with their advanced mind powers but they spend most of their time worshiping a nuclear bomb chanting silly songs  they really picked a strange form of idolatry but maybe they're simply crazed. This movie throws together a lot of science fiction concepts but the resulting brew is rather bland. It's a decent action piece not much more.Franciscus shows he is no Heston he overacts in most of his scenes as if he had no clue on how to depict a man realizing where he's actually landed but then again he wasn't the skipper on this 2nd ship the lead officer dies soon after they crashland we're not watching a leader but a follower try to carry the picture. I was struck by how Heston towered over him in their brutal fight scene. McDowall is also missing his role of Cornelius is played by actor Watson. Evans  Gregory are pretty good as the ape leaders but whoever stuck them in ape suits for the sauna scene should have thought about it a few more minutes. This movie ends everything on a grotesquely conclusive note but they managed to find a way to continue the story in Escape From the Planet of the Apes.".

I'm a big fan of corny '70s scifi anyway and Beneath is certainly cheaper and goofier than the original. But its themes and ideas are surprisingly intelligent and it creates suspense and excitement very well. It also expands the mythology of its universe which is always a positive to geeks like myself. I'd say the only big faults are the much smaller budget which causes the ape makeup to appear much less convincing than it originally was and the casting of a Charlton Heston impersonator to play the lead. The story is that James Franciscus is another astronaut looking for Heston and his crew. And since he eventually does find Heston I don't understand why they wanted someone who looked so much like their original star.".

For me it is the most watchable of the sequels only because it's the only one that stays in the familiar territory established by the first film.   But oh that ending....I really can not understand why the heck Richard Zanuck allowed Charlton Heston to talk him into going with that downer ending that has already been referred to by others.   The only reason why Heston pushed it wasn't because it made for good cinema but because he wanted to singlehandedly see to it that he never have to do another Apes sequel again.   It's a pity that Heston never realized that the best sequel story one could have explored was what happened to Taylor and Nova afterwards and could have made for some equally compelling drama as the first film did.  To me the main appeal of the first film wasn't the Ape society it was the character of Taylor and his fascinating odyssey from misanthrope to defender of the species only to see his earlier feelings borne out in the shock ending.   The question that should have been addressed next in a sequel was what would Taylor do now that he realized he was on Earth?   What other things were there to discover on the planet?  Heck you could have easily made a sequel movie without the apes returning as far as I'm concerned! Alas because of the plot device imposed by this film and Heston's inability to realize what a good thing he might have had going for himself the rest of the series had to veer off into what was for me a more uninteresting story line focusing on the Apes and their inevitable rise to power. Plot holes and depressing ending notwithstanding Beneath is still worth watching to see the traces of what could have been a great film that are there.  The mutant storyline and their dwellings underneath the remains of New York still has an irresistible viewing quality to it.  I do not recommend watching it in tandem with its magnificent predecessor though because that's only going to make you more angry about the ending of this film.".

He immediately bumps into a very demure woman who turns out to be Heston's mate goes on the hunt for him but then bumps into hundreds of warlike talking apes.

But 'Beneath The Planet Of The Apes' was a product of its time the studios rarely made sequels in the '60s writers and producers were always looking for new ideas and there were more talented and creative people in the film industry. They wanted something different and they made it. So you gotta take it or leave it on that.Now back to my mother and me when I was ten. Thank God I wasn't watching some Disney movie starring Kurt Russell and an invisible chimp that would have depressed me more. Instead I got James Franciscus crashing his spaceship in a nuclear wasteland imprisoned by apes forced to beat the crap out of a gorilla making his way through destroyed subway tunnels touring the subterranean ruins of New York defying murderous mutilated mutants killing people with spiked iron bars punching Charlton Hestonand finally attacking a gorilla army single handed with a cool looking machine gun as the mutants are about to set off their Doomsday Bomb. Heyyou cant get into that you ain't even an American! They don't make them like this any more. The era of creative filmmaking is long over. Nowadays Bruce Willis will make the same movie ten times in a row. For all its faults Beneath The Planet Of The Apes offered us something different and in a very short running time too. It was meant to entertain maybe throw in a little blatant social commentary sell a few candy bars and then fade away. But notice it hasn't faded away. People still watch this movie and still like it years after Die Hard disappears into a film vault. It has the mark of effort on it and it's never boring.The other reviews on here are all good and their points are well taken. This is a sequel from an era without sequels but it can stand on its own. I saw this never having seen the first movie. It was cool to a ten year old then and fifty years from now it will be cool to ten year olds of all ages.".

Yet it still works out as a good adventure film less of a cerebral experience like PLANET OF THE APES and more of a comic book story.James Franciscus plays astronaut Brent sent along the same trajectory as Taylor's Charlton Heston's old ship in an effort to rescue him. He crashlands in the same vicinity as his friend and goes through a similar nightmare when he comes to discover that the planet he's stranded on is dominated by intelligent talking apes with a decidedly low opinion of mankind. General Ursus James Gregory is a warhungry gorilla leader who's anxious to investigate strange unearthly occurrences in the Forbidden Zone with the aid of the everskeptical scientist Dr. Zaius Maurice Evans in a reprisal of his role from Part One. Luckily Brent runs into Taylor's mate Nova Linda Harrison looking prettier than she did in PLANET and she is able to lead him to kindly chimpanzee couple Zira Kim Hunter and Cornelius David Watson this time Roddy McDowall was busy directing a film. The pacifistic simians try to help their human friends along their journey to find Taylor but Brent and Nova only succeed in getting themselves captured by gorillas anyway.Up to this midway point in the film all we're really seeing is a rehash of the first APES movie which feels obligatory to set up the scenario. Where this chapter starts to develop its own identity and really take off is in its second half as Brent and Nova escape and find themselves going underground literally in the Forbidden Zone and discovering the ruins of a ravaged city along with a community of radiationscarred mutations who have mastered mental telepathy and worship an atomic bomb as their god who has created them. And they know it won't be long before the Ape Army will invade their sanctuary.Charlton Heston felt that sequels were not very challenging for an actor in those days so at first he resisted appearing in this movie. He eventually agreed on what gradually evolved into a more extended cameo in BENEATH as a favor to Richard Zanuck since the producer had taken a gamble on making the original film when Heston asked him to. The resulting sequel can be a downbeat and unusually pessimistic viewing experience but in an odd way that actually helps to work in its favor.

Which is how it should be the plot should always be the bigger star.Again great message but everything else didn't rise up much. The performances were just decentJames Franciscus was the best and some of the scenes had no proper continuity from one to the other.Verdict Anyways this movie takes you back to an old world charm you hardly find today and something for your mind to chew on long after it's over.".

	schema:headline " Classic SciFi Adventure with a KILLER Ending";
	schema:reviewBody "Of the five original Planet of the Apes films only the first one 1968 and this sequel Beneath 1970 are truly great and worthwhile. The three prequels devolve in quality Escape from 1971 has its points of interest and amusement Conquest of 1972 is okay but too onedimensional and Battle for 1973 is weak. Beneath is the only actual sequel hence both the original and Beneath should be digested as one long story.The plot revolves around astronaut James Franciscus landing on the ape planet in search of Taylor  his crew. He makes contact with a primitive babe who knew Taylor Nova played by jawdropping Linda Harrison and then embarks upon a quest to find him leading first to the ape city and then to the forbidden zone a holocaustruined wasteland with a cryptic underground refuge.Growing up I always favored Beneath above the original film. Why? Possibly because Beneath has a lot more action especially toward the end and the concept of the psychic mutants was both eerie and captivating. As an adult however I've come to appreciate the original in increasing measure it's deeper than Beneath more intellectual. Each film has its strengths and weaknesses and they compliment each other well.Many criticize James Franciscus as a Heston clone. Although this is a valid complaint Linda Harrison described Franciscus as a smaller version of Charleton Heston and Heston as Taylor is indeed inimitable so don't even try I never had a problem with Franciscus in this film. He does a fine job in the role of the stranded astronaut on a planet of madness. His character Brent isn't disillusioned with humanity like Taylor so he has less of an 'edge' but Brent is a fine generic 'everyman.'All the main characters from the first film are present. Aside from Nova and Taylor the story features Dr. Zaius Maurice Evans Zira Kim Hunter and Cornelius. Unfortunately Roddy McDowall wasn't available to play Cornelius so they brought in David Watson for the part which isn't much of a problem because you can't tell beneath all the ape makeup and Watson does a splendid job mimicking McDowall. A new character is introduced and that is Ursus the gorilla general played by James Gregory remember him from the original Star Trek episode Dagger of the Mind?. Who could ever forget Ursus' motivational speech The only good human is a DEAD human!!? There are numerous great scenes and images for example the gorillas marching in the forbidden zone and the gigantic appearance of their revered Lawgiver with a bleeding face then collapsing.Some criticize that the first half of the story is merely an inferior repeat of the original film astronaut crashlands discovers that apes rule the planet and ends up in ape city but it was great the first time around why not experience it again with some nuances? Especially since Beneath was released two years after the original. I admit that this section of Beneath isn't as great as the original it's even kind of boring that is after seeing the first film but WAIT till Brent and Nova escape ape city and discover a mysterious and intriguing underground lair.One beef I've always had with Beneath is that Leonard Rosenman's blaring score is a little mediocre compared to Jerry Goldsmith's original. It properly mimics the original and is serviceable but doesn't quite cut it. Why didn't they just reuse Goldsmith's score?On a technical level Beneath isn't nearly as good as the original due to obvious budget limitations. The subpar score is one example another would be the alltooobvious pullover ape masks in certain scenes. But these are minor cavils and never prevented me from wholly enjoying the flick. Still I could see why some would give the film a lower rating for this reason.The climax is KILLER and I mean that literally as Brent ultimately finds Taylor and the gorillas invade the underground turf. Some great action entails and then... well I'm not going to giveaway the nihilistic climax. Regardless I always loved the ending in its own way it's just as great as the iconic close of the original.The film runs 1 hour 35 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal at Malibu Creek State Park Calabasas Century Fox Studios Century City and Red Rock Canyon State Park.GRADE ASPOILER ALERT CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE MUTANTSIt is revealed that the psychic mutants are human caricatures who literally worship the doomsday bomb a bomb capable of destroying the entire planet. It would appear that human beings need something to worship even in a devolved state which suggests that humankind is incurably religious. This may be a negative reflection on religion which is the human attempt to connect with God 'religion' means to bind back but it isn't a negative reflection on biblical Christianity which concerns the Creator connecting with humanity through the death  resurrection of the Messiah and the subsequent lifebirthing power of the Spirit. In any case the perverted religious nature of the psychic mutants is nothing less than fascinating albeit a bit laughable at times e.g. the fellowship of the holy fallout. Nevertheless the portrayal of their psychic powers is the best depiction in cinema IMHO.".

Sure it is a sequel but it has the good idea to show us aspects of the POTA universe we could not guess watching the first movie. For example the citizen council part of the movie is amazing and allows us to see why this sort of theater in Ape city was built for. The existence of amazingly complex submachineguns can make us suppose that apes copied human military technologies for centuries and so on. To make it short we go further. Plus follow me or not I think Ted Post's very classical directing aged much better than Franklin J. Schaffner's for the first movie. The sometimes bizarre directing of POTA is IMHO becoming a weakness as time gradually passes. It does not mean this movie is unflawed. Sure from time to time budget limitations are obvious the first part of the movie is too much based on the first one we don't learn enough about the mutant society and Heston's part at his demand is too short. But this sequel really adds something to the first movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the spellbinding revelation of the original Planet of the Apes the sequel and subsequent sequels in the landmark series seemed critically doomed to suffer from substandard mediocrity in the wake of its apocalyptic aftermath yet Beneath the Planet of the Apes endures as one of the most reverent science fiction films among faithful fans of the series. A seriously flawed yet brilliantly misunderstood masterpiece that remains as an important testament to behold. What could not be topped by Planet of the Apes' unappeasable climax could only be subverted by going beneath it... literally.After Charlton Heston compromised with producers to only briefly reprise his role as Taylor in the sequel James Franciscus takes the lead as Astronaut Brent. While Franciscus gives a very strong and worthwhile performance his character still suffers at the expense of being a poorman's Taylor. The first half of the film reiterates a lot of the exposition of the first film to bring Brent's character up to speed as he travels with the beautiful Linda Harrison as the mute slave Nova into the Forbidden Zone to find Taylor who mysteriously vanished into a mirage at the beginning of the film. As Brent and Nova begin their descent beneath the subterranean caverns of a postapocalyptic city the film takes a much darker and cerebral turn that is both disturbingly bizarre and brutally nihilistic. Brent while under the telepathic mindcontrol of the underdwelling society of mutated humans shockingly tries to kill innocent Nova... twice. The malevolent Mutants reveal themselves to be a cult of hideously deformed worshipers of an atomic bomb who give praise to its awesome destructive power at an eerie mass in their tabernacle as they prepare for the inevitable confrontation against the surfacedwelling Simians who have ruled over the planet ever since it was ravaged by the inferno of nuclear holocaust two thousand years prior and the final battle for control of the Planet of the Apes will be determined by its prophetic Earthshattering outcome.Beneath the Planet of the Apes detonates with a shockwave of suspense that reached its apotheosis at the end of the first film and radiates unstoppably towards an inexorable conclusion at the end of the second. A brilliantly twisted and hauntingly cerebral sequel which may have proved itself to have been too intense and intellectual for its Grated audience who were simply engrossed by the film's adventurous fantasy and captivated by the apelike wonder of its characters. It would be almost impossible today for a major studio to gamble on making what was considered to be a franchisekilling installment because of its powerfully subversive imagery and sociopolitical narrative which ironically gives Beneath its characteristically unique dynamic not only as a worthy and important followup to its classic predecessor but a relevant and enduring testament of historic science fiction cinema.".

A credit to Dehn and to composer Leonard Rosenman who more than fills the shoes of Jerry Goldsmith in providing an riveting score for the film.Controversy has always centred around the film's ending more than any other feature of it.  Those who critisise it miss the point  this was intended to be the LAST apes film and although producer Arthur Jacobs kept his mind open for a possible 3rd film it was felt that another movie set in a postapocalyptic ape ruled world would just be ''flogging a dead horse''. One of the greatest features of these films started by the Statue of Liberty sequence in the original was that they all contained ''shocker'' endings designed to send a shiver down the spine of the cinema audience. Beneath is so final so clear cut so definate in its climax  and is successful BECAUSE of this.  'Escape' featured the talking baby Chimp at its end.  'Conquest' featured the apes take over in its ultimate moments.Beneath suffers less than the other films from having an inadiquate budget but is hindred by Chuck Heston's absence.  The fact that James Franciscus looks so similar is slightly irritating.

The first sequel to Planet of the Apes 1968 has two strikes against it. The film had only half the budget of the original film and Charlton Heston has a supporting part while the screenplay was clearly written with his character as the lead. In those days a star did not do sequels but apparently he was grateful for the success of Planet of the Apes that he did a cameo and donated his salary to charity. Heston became a science fiction icon and would go on in the seventies starring in the SF classics The Omega Man 1971 and Soylent Green 1973.The writers Paul Dehn and Mort Abrahams and director Ted Post took Beneath The Planet of the Apes serious enough and did excellent work despite these limitations. A couple of years later Ted Post would direct another sequel Magnum Force 1973. The first Dirty Harry sequel which could also be rated as a sequel almost as good as the original.The first 30 minutes of Beneath The Planet of the Apes is a quick rerun of the plot of the original film but when the lead characters get underground hence the title we get a first rate science fiction parable. The underground ruins of New York city are inhabited by mutated humans with psychic powers and worship an atom bomb as a God. This story line does make the ape race secondary characters in the second half.The ending is very nihilistic and seems like a very definitive ending to the series. But because of success at the box office and the ingenuity of the writers we got three more sequelsprequels. All of them are very enjoyable but nowhere near as powerful as this first underrated sequel.".

What the hey I said to myself I'll watch it again. About ninety minutes later I concluded that Beneath was serviceable efficient entertainment if a bit cursory and abrupt REALLY abrupt. I thought about it some more and tended to agree with the late Charlton Heston's assessment that the original 1968 movie Planet of the Apes hereafter PotA was selfcontained and that a sequel was unnecessary. Ultimately it seems that TwentiethCentury Fox's gleeful avarice overturned Heston's pragmatism and spawned the nearly identical Beneath.For at least half of Beneath in addition to a repeat of the iconic ending of PotA we witness a virtual reprise of the first halfhour of PotA with Brent James Franciscus discovering what viewers already know about the simianruled postapocalyptic planet. For human's sake Brent even closely resembles Heston's character Taylor except he's a bit slighter especially after Zira played again by Kim Hunter forces him to ditch his astronaut duds for a more revealing loincloth in order to escape immediate detection by the apes. Even so gorilla General Ursus James Gregory captures Brent and Nova for his army's target practice. With Zira's help they escape and plunge into the Forbidden Zone which is really the ruins of the New York City subway system.At this point Beneath does offer something new  Brent's gradual discovery of mutated radiationscarred telekinetictelepathic human survivors living in the subterranean shafts and ironically worshipping a Doomsday AlphaOmega bomb. It's established that the apes avoid the Forbidden Zone and the subway lair because of the hallucinatory images they can conjure up like the optical illusion fire and crevice that swallow up Taylor and compel Nova to seek help. The mutants mess with Brent's mind i.e. force him to attack Nova force him to fight Taylor after he is imprisoned with him. Meanwhile General Ursus's army desperate to replenish Ape City's food supplies dare to march upon the Forbidden Zone. However a female mutant reveals that the mind games they can play with Brent don't work on apes because of their brutishly thick skulls. So when Dr. Zaius Maurice Evans accompanying Ursus deduces that the mutant's optical effects are fake the mutants are helpless against them except for their aceinthehole bomb. So now let's see Brent and Taylor escape prison by killing a mutant then find Nova then Ursus's army breaks in and kills Nova then the army enters the mutant's shrinelike chamber with the bomb Brent and Taylor soon follow the apes kill several of the mutants wound Taylor and kill Brent and a vengeful Taylor detonates the bomb annihilating the world and seemingly future PotA sequels not!Was that all there was?Well maybe Beneath was not so unnecessary after all since it does introduce the fascinating human mutant angle oh and the increasing rift between the militaristic gorillas and the pacifistic chimpanzees early on. But Beneath glosses over these elements in its haste to get Brent caught up on ape lore and give the cynical HestonTaylor a reason to end the sequelape madness. Perhaps Brent is unnecessary. Maybe the movie would have been better if it dumped the Brent character altogether and just followed Taylor and Nova after they plunged through the fire mirage and encountered the mutants. That way Beneath could have given more time to explore this mysterious underground culture and as counterpoint the schism within ape society. After all PotA's premise and characters are intriguing and deserve more thorough development. Beneath literally blew up this valuable opportunity.".

They wear masks to conceal their horrific ugliness. In a scene that is both comic and disturbing Brent and Nova witness the extraordinary spectacle of these skinless beings singing hymns to a Doomsday Device  an atomic bomb capable of destroying the world.The Ape army shows up in force culminating in a battle. Nova and Brent are shot and before he dies Taylor triggers the Doomsday Device. The screen goes black and a sober voiceover informs us that a small insignificant planet in the Solar System is now dead...It is remarkable how good 'Beneath' is when one considers that it was a troubled production. Heston turned down the chance to star contributing little more than an extended cameo while the inclusion of another astronaut character necessitated the unfortunate need to repeat facts about Ape World the audience already knew. Roddy McDowall was unavailable  making this the only 'Apes' film in which he does not appear  so instead British actor David Watson put on the monkey makeup. His impersonation of McDowall's distinctive voice is spoton. Maurice Evans Kim Hunter and Linda Harrison reprised their roles from the original.

It is certainly not a 'feelgood' film. Ted Post the director worked with Franciscus again on 'Night Slaves' a scifi T.V. movie based on a Jerry Sohl story. He does a decent job with 'Beneath' ensuring that the social commentary is balanced with exciting action. The climax in which the Earth is destroyed  I do not think anyone would dare to do an ending like that now!  seemed to bring the series to a close. Far from it.

It opened to mixed reviews  some critics were angry with what they perceived to be the film's leftleaning political message  but audiences lapped it up. Good for them.Compared to the farrago that was Tim Burton's 2001 'reimagining' 'Beneath' is an unalloyed masterpiece.".

Realising that Taylor might still be alive he  Nova set out to find him but end up captured by the Apes with the help of friendly chimp Zira Kim Hunter they manage to escape into the forbidden zone where Brent sees evidence of a ruined New York  realises he is on Earth. While underground Brent  Nova are captured by a race of telekinetic mutant humans who worship an atomic bomb  when the Apes lead by warmonger General Ursus James Gregory come to wipe them out the only option the mutant humans have is to launch the bomb  wipe the Apes out at what cost? Brent who finds Taylor tries to figure it all out  save the day...Directed by Ted Post this turned out to be the first of four sequel's to the huge hit Planet of the Apes 1968 after French novelist Pierre Boulle's proposed sequel Planet of the Men was rejected generally not that well received at the time Beneath the Planet of the Apes is an odd film that for the first half is merely a remake of the original but then deviates in a totally different direction with mixed results. The first half has another US pilot crash land on future Earth  finds Nova have run ins with hostile Apes helped out by Zira  Cornelius before they escape into the forbidden zone where he finds relic's of the past that confirm he is on Earth but it's at this point that Beneath the Planet of the Apes takes a different direction as it introduces some telepathic mutant humans who worship an atomic bomb  it's here that things get really silly. Although the basic idea is alright  takes the series in another direction  adds to the mythology of future Earth scenes of a bunch of mutants sining hymns to an atomic bomb are quite ridiculous  verge on camp the telepathic scenes where we only ever hear Brent's side of the dialogue is annoying because of this intense irritating beeping noise an ending where the mutant humans put up no resistance to the Apes. Where the original Planet of the Apes dealt with the conflict religion  science  other issues here it's straight anti war propaganda with a strong ban the bomb message there's even a cute scene in which pacifist Chimps protest about the war hungry Gorilla's thirst for human blood. Beneath the Planet of the Apes moves along at a decent pace it's fun there's some good setpieces  ideas that don't work as well as the original's but it's watchable  the second half is certainly different if nothing else.Beneath the Planet of the Apes starts as the first ends  actually begins with the closing few minutes of Planet of the Apes Charlton Heston reprises his role but only at the start  at the very end. There are a few decent action scenes including a fight ontop a moving horse drawn cage shootouts explosions  fist fights. Beneath the Planet of the Apes is actually the most financially successful of all the Apes films if you consider it's boxoffice take  how much or rather little it cost to make.With a supposed budget of about 3000000 this is almost half of the original's  itself was apparently halved from 6000000  you can see the Ape makeup isn't as good as in the original  a lot of static mask's are used. The acting is alright Franciscus is OK Linda Harrison is just there to look good Heston has no more than a cameo while Kim Hunter  Maurice Evans return from the original to reprise their roles although this is the only Apes film that Roddy McDowall did not appear in apart from the footage used from the original at the start.Beneath the Planet of the Apes is a fun watch it's a product of it's time  while not as strong in any department as the original it makes for entertaining enough viewing with a few unintentional laugh along the way. Followed by Escape from the Planet of the Apes 1971.".

Brent who finds Taylor tries to figure it all out  save the day...Directed by Ted Post this turned out to be the first of four sequel's to the huge hit Planet of the Apes 1968 after French novelist Pierre Boulle's proposed sequel Planet of the Men was rejected generally not that well received at the time Beneath the Planet of the Apes is an odd film that for the first half is merely a remake of the original but then deviates in a totally different direction with mixed results. The first half has another US pilot crash land on future Earth  finds Nova have run ins with hostile Apes helped out by Zira  Cornelius before they escape into the forbidden zone where he finds relic's of the past that confirm he is on Earth but it's at this point that Beneath the Planet of the Apes takes a different direction as it introduces some telepathic mutant humans who worship an atomic bomb  it's here that things get really silly. Although the basic idea is alright  takes the series in another direction  adds to the mythology of future Earth scenes of a bunch of mutants sining hymns to an atomic bomb are quite ridiculous  verge on camp the telepathic scenes where we only ever hear Brent's side of the dialogue is annoying because of this intense irritating beeping noise an ending where the mutant humans put up no resistance to the Apes. Where the original Planet of the Apes dealt with the conflict religion  science  other issues here it's straight anti war propaganda with a strong ban the bomb message there's even a cute scene in which pacifist Chimps protest about the war hungry Gorilla's thirst for human blood. Beneath the Planet of the Apes moves along at a decent pace it's fun there's some good setpieces  ideas that don't work as well as the original's but it's watchable  the second half is certainly different if nothing else.Beneath the Planet of the Apes starts as the first ends  actually begins with the closing few minutes of Planet of the Apes Charlton Heston reprises his role but only at the start  at the very end. There are a few decent action scenes including a fight ontop a moving horse drawn cage shootouts explosions  fist fights. Beneath the Planet of the Apes is actually the most financially successful of all the Apes films if you consider it's boxoffice take  how much or rather little it cost to make.With a supposed budget of about 3000000 this is almost half of the original's  itself was apparently halved from 6000000  you can see the Ape makeup isn't as good as in the original  a lot of static mask's are used. The acting is alright Franciscus is OK Linda Harrison is just there to look good Heston has no more than a cameo while Kim Hunter  Maurice Evans return from the original to reprise their roles although this is the only Apes film that Roddy McDowall did not appear in apart from the footage used from the original at the start.Beneath the Planet of the Apes is a fun watch it's a product of it's time  while not as strong in any department as the original it makes for entertaining enough viewing with a few unintentional laugh along the way. Followed by Escape from the Planet of the Apes 1971.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is the only movie unless one recalls Spencer Tracy and Sir Cedric Hardwick in STANLEY AND LIVINGSTONE that deals with the Golden Age of European exploration in Africa. It began in 1769 when James Bruce went to Ethiopia and did a remarkable job finding the source of the Blue Nile and doing yeoman work on the anthropology of the Ethiopian people. Then there was the work of Mungo Park and the River Niger until his death in 1806 and there were naval expeditions up the Congo in 1819 and various internal expeditions. By far the greatest African explorer would be David Livingston a missionary who captured the hearts of Victorian Britain. Most of Livingston's work involved Lake Nyasa but he tried to also solve the greatest African possibly global geographic question the source of the Nile River. In the 1850s two British officers from India Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke mounted two expeditions into the interior of Africa from the island of Zanzibar. Burton was already a famous man  the first Christian to travel to Mecca and Medina. He was also a remarkable linguist. But Burton was a moody person who could be insulting. Speke was avid to go on both journeys but he lacked Burton's driving curiosity about the people of the continent of Africa. Speke also was extraordinarily ambitious and wanted to find the source of the Nile. So did Burton but he felt there was more to life than just settling a map problem. This film deals with what turned these two friends into enemies and how a remarkable series of explorationswhere Burton and Speke traveled togetherand where Speke led his own exploration with James Grant settled the mystery  but still left matters into greater confusion. On the second Burton  Speke journey they both saw a large lake. Burton with typical sense named it Tanganyika after the African languages he studied. But Burton became ill and was unable to continue circumnavigating this lake. Speke meanwhile had heard of another body of water to the north Burton believed it was part of Tanganyika. Speke went on alone and saw this huge inland sea. He was convinced that he found the real source of the Nile but his proof was insufficient to Burton. Speke took advantage of Burton's illness to get back to England first publish his findings only and get official support from Sir Roderick Murchison and the Royal Society for his own expedition. He and Grant returned to Africa just as Burton came home  to find himself being jeered at as having been lying on a cot while Speke was busy finding the source of the Nile. Speke came back with more details about his great discovery. He named this magnificent lake the largest in the world Lake Victoria. But his ego caused him to keep Grant from accompanying him on the final portion of this journey wherein he circled the lake and found the point it led to the Nile  which he called the Murchison Falls after the head of the Royal Society. So when he returned to England with his facts Grant couldn't corroborate them. Burton and his friends began showing that some of Speke's observations and facts were odd to say the least he had the Nile running up a mountain for ten miles. Soon a debate was arranged between Burton and Speke  a debate that Speke dreaded. Burton happened to be a very gifted writer and speaker and Speke was not. The debate was to occur at Bath in September 1864. It never occurred. As this film shows Speke was killed in a hunting accident the day of the debate  whether it was a real accident or suicide has never been settled. Speke's friends blamed Burton who was called a murderer by some of them. Burton never made a public comment again about the incident.It would not be until the late 1870s when Livingston's successor in Central Africa Henry Morton Stanley proved that Lake Victoria was the source of the Nile and that Burton's Lake Tangayika was the source of the Congo. The film faithfully tells the tragic tale of how a great explorer was destroyed by his ambition and how a close friendship was destroyed by a rivalry spurred on by a busybody  in this case a man who was jealous of both Burton and Speke Laurence Oliphant. Oliphant did not care who got injured. He is in many ways the real villain in this tragedy.".

	schema:headline " One of the best movies no one has ever seen";
	schema:reviewBody "Mountains of the Moon is one of my all time favorites. I saw it first when it came out in theaters and watch it three or four times every year after that. It is the true story of Richard Francis Burton and John Henning Speke two British explorers  once were great friends and how they allowed pride and envy to destroy their relationship. The focus of the film centers around Burton Patrick Bergin and Speke's Iain Glenn quest to find the source of the Nile river in Central Africa. In the process of the journey Burton becomes quite ill and Speke goes on ahead. It is then when Speke discovers a lake and declares it as the source they have been searching for. When they return to England however Burton is not convinced by Speke's data and becomes convinced that a larger lake has to be the true source. Burton decides to go back without Speke. This second expedition enrages Speke who becomes one of Burton's bitterest rivals and critics. Also thrown into this volatile mix is Burton's devoted strongwilled wife Isabelle Fiona Shawwho will stop at nothing to protect her husband's reputation.It's the complex very human relationships of this film which makes Mountains of the Moon stand out from other period pieces. This film has everything adventure romance scope and a great performance by Patrick Bergin playing a truelife swashbuckler whose life could be material for several screen epics. This film is the AntiTitanic a true epic that doesn't replace character and humanity for mindless eyecandy and spectacle. James Cameron should have screened this film before he started his Godawful Titanic script. See it. You won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was my good fortune to see MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON several times in its original theatrical release at New York's Ziegfeld Theatre in 1990. An article in the New York Times months earlier had alerted me to the possibility that this was my kind of movie. That easily proved to be true. MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON promptly became a great personal favorite leading me to read two biographies of Sir Richard Francis Burton.When MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON was originally released on DVD on the Pioneer label I bought it immediately. Once again I was lucky because the Pioneer release was in the original 185 theatrical ratio. The Pioneer release was withdrawn and this title was subsequently reissued on DVD on a different label. Regrettably it was in a full screen pan and scan version that spoiled this film's excellent visual compositions.MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON is superbly directed by Bob Rafelson. Although known as an excellent director of contemporary material there is nothing in his previous body of work to prepare you for Rafelson's outstanding achievement in a period epic. It is uniformly well acted and technical credits are on a very high level. This overlooked classic deserves to be restored to it correct technical specifications on DVD. Hopefully Bob Rafelson could do a commentary. Criterion Collection are you listening? If you have not had the great good fortune to see this film theatrically then let me urge you to seek out the Pioneer DVD release in the correct aspect ratio. MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON is practically the only film that I would seriously compare to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. Each one is what you might call a thinking man's epic. Both of them succeed in asking provocative questions without succumbing to giving the audience banal answers.Thematically MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON is one of the relatively few films that seriously deals with male friendship gone wrong. Although the theme of toxic friendships has been well explored in socalled women's films it's comparatively rare in films dealing with men. In order to accomplish this aim MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON takes some license with the facts. However it does so in order to serve a larger measure of the truth.MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON never resorts to clich. This is a film for people who have a taste for sophisticated epic story telling and intimate character study. It has an unflinching eye for the best and the worst in it's characters. Layer by layer Burton and Speke are revealed to be all too human.Allow me to recommend MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON to you without reservation.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hardly have the words to describe what I think and how I feel about this movie. Except that I find it stunning. The wild scenery where the two characters' friendship is shaped was splendid absolutely breathtaking. It was so interesting and moving to watch Richard and John evolve around each other and get so close and united when confronted with lifeanddeath situations in the wilderness. The story revolves around great ideals and principles in an age of innocence when human bonding friendship love still had that touch of solemnity honor and oath. It was very sad to see how John's deep feelings for his best truest friend degenerate under the manipulation of a man with no scruples. The ending was heartbreaking and liberating at the same time. The highpoint of the film was in my opinion when Richard is shown the unfinished bust of his late friend. The loving nostalgic look and smile he displays while adjusting John's cheekbones sums up beautifully the entire story of their friendship and also suggests that John will always be in Richard's heart as he knew him for real in Africa when they went through so many things together despite his naive reckless betrayal and despite the games of interests that followed when returning to the civilized world. Truly excellent I highly recommend it to everyone. It works magic for the soul.".

Not from the public the cinema's nor the festivals. Even journalist didn't pay much attention to it. Does that mean this movie isn't worth seeing? Certainly not although the subject probably isn't very attractive to the mainstream audience.The movie tells the story of Burton and Speke two friends and explorers who tried to find the source of the Nile in the middle of the nineteenth century. Burton was more of an anthropologist who wanted to learn more about the indigenous tribes which they encountered on their journeys while Speke was more interested in the discovery of the source itself. Once they were back home they become enemies because Speke tells everybody who wants to hear it that he alone discovered the source of the Nile namely Lake Victoria. There are different things that I liked about this movie. The acting was very good the costumes were nice but what I really liked were the images from the African landscapes the animals the people... Seeing the images from England just made me look forward to the next scenes in Africa. It never felt right to see these two explorers in England you're always left with the feeling that they belong in Africa. I guess that is where the strength of this movie lies ... It makes you feel exactly the way these men felt. I reward this little masterpiece with an 810.".

	schema:headline " What's amazing is...they went BACK.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is so atmospheric it makes you want to pack a rucksack some provisions bid the family goodbye and jump aboard a boat headed for the dark continent...welcome to Mountains of the Moon based on the true life exploits of 1850's explorers Sir Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke.Bob Rafelson has done a fine job directing this historical epic and it's a shame this great film is not more readily available. It begins when Michael Small's wonderful theme segues over the titles into some tribal drums and we see ships landing on an African shore. Speke Iain Glen has travelled to Morocco to meet Burton Patrick Bergin a seasoned explorer. Both men have a fascination with finding the source of the Nile River.The film jumps straight into the action with Burton narrating their first foray together into the fold of the dark continent the area on maps of the time that was simply a great blank expanse labelled Uncharted and Unexplored.Their camp is attacked in the dead of night by a hostile tribe who kill many of Burton's party along with most of the African porters along for the journey and take Speke captive while Burton flees to the ocean shore with the head porter but not before taking a spear through the face. Speke awakes in the morning to the brutal tribe picking through the camp and torturing survivors and after being tortured himself in a truly disturbing scene as we realise this tribesman that is stabbing him in the thighs with a spear is not doing it to interrogate he is doing it purely for the fun of it makes a knucklebiting escape to join Burton at the seaside where ships have come to take them home.After this dramatic opening the film settles into a nice rhythm cutting back to some scenes in England where Burton meets Isabel Arundel Fiona Shaw who would become the love of his life. Fiona Shaw's performance is great her powerful voice and demeanour a perfect match for Burton's larger than life persona and brash nature.Then it's off to Africa again and a wonderful trek across the endless savanna to discover the source of the great river that fascinates both men and indeed an entire nation back home.But Burton is struck ill on the journey and it is Speke who finishes the trek finding what he correctly though he didn't know it then thought to be the source of the Nile a great lake he named Victoria.Back in England again the story turns to the subsequent betrayal of Burton by Speke in claiming sole credit for the discovery and that drove a permanent wedge between the friends.As in Burton's own words he describes his relationship with John Speke as being as close as two men can become without being lovers. That is truly shown in this film the relationship is real and heartfelt by both performers in a truly amazing film. Particularly moving is when Burton is informed of his friend's deathsuicide while giving a speech and though he tries is unable to continue speaking. It's very well acted...he doesn't break down or anything but you can see the sadness crawl across his features like a shadow as he falters over his words.Costumes music photography it's all superb and to specify how superb it is would be redundant. It's simply better to experience it for yourself. It's immersive and rich and for a historical epic a genre notoriously prone to toolong melodramatic and ultimately boring films it moves along at a nice pace that never gets dull. The dialogue is wonderfully written as is the film itself adapted in part from Burton's own manuscripts.The scenes in England are all the more beautiful with the performance of Fiona Shaw. Her final words to Burton are stirring and so effortlessly believable. Another standout scene is a brief appearance by Bernard Hill as Sir David Livingstone you'll recognise him most recently as Theodan King of Rohan in the Lord of the Rings films.Perfect for a comfy night in on the couch this movie has adventure action humour depth of character and story great music and photography and a sitting round the campfire telling stories kind of feel that is just great. Highly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is so atmospheric it makes you want to pack a rucksack some provisions bid the family goodbye and jump aboard a boat headed for the dark continent...welcome to Mountains of the Moon based on the true life exploits of 1850's explorers Sir Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke.Bob Rafelson has done a fine job directing this historical epic and it's a shame this great film is not more readily available. It begins when Michael Small's wonderful theme segues over the titles into some tribal drums and we see ships landing on an African shore. Speke Iain Glen has travelled to Morocco to meet Burton Patrick Bergin a seasoned explorer. Both men have a fascination with finding the source of the Nile River.The film jumps straight into the action with Burton narrating their first foray together into the fold of the dark continent the area on maps of the time that was simply a great blank expanse labelled Uncharted and Unexplored.Their camp is attacked in the dead of night by a hostile tribe who kill many of Burton's party along with most of the African porters along for the journey and take Speke captive while Burton flees to the ocean shore with the head porter but not before taking a spear through the face. Speke awakes in the morning to the brutal tribe picking through the camp and torturing survivors and after being tortured himself in a truly disturbing scene as we realise this tribesman that is stabbing him in the thighs with a spear is not doing it to interrogate he is doing it purely for the fun of it makes a knucklebiting escape to join Burton at the seaside where ships have come to take them home.After this dramatic opening the film settles into a nice rhythm cutting back to some scenes in England where Burton meets Isabel Arundel Fiona Shaw who would become the love of his life. Fiona Shaw's performance is great her powerful voice and demeanour a perfect match for Burton's larger than life persona and brash nature.Then it's off to Africa again and a wonderful trek across the endless savanna to discover the source of the great river that fascinates both men and indeed an entire nation back home.But Burton is struck ill on the journey and it is Speke who finishes the trek finding what he correctly though he didn't know it then thought to be the source of the Nile a great lake he named Victoria.Back in England again the story turns to the subsequent betrayal of Burton by Speke in claiming sole credit for the discovery and that drove a permanent wedge between the friends.As in Burton's own words he describes his relationship with John Speke as being as close as two men can become without being lovers. That is truly shown in this film the relationship is real and heartfelt by both performers in a truly amazing film. Particularly moving is when Burton is informed of his friend's deathsuicide while giving a speech and though he tries is unable to continue speaking. It's very well acted...he doesn't break down or anything but you can see the sadness crawl across his features like a shadow as he falters over his words.Costumes music photography it's all superb and to specify how superb it is would be redundant. It's simply better to experience it for yourself. It's immersive and rich and for a historical epic a genre notoriously prone to toolong melodramatic and ultimately boring films it moves along at a nice pace that never gets dull. The dialogue is wonderfully written as is the film itself adapted in part from Burton's own manuscripts.The scenes in England are all the more beautiful with the performance of Fiona Shaw. Her final words to Burton are stirring and so effortlessly believable. Another standout scene is a brief appearance by Bernard Hill as Sir David Livingstone you'll recognise him most recently as Theodan King of Rohan in the Lord of the Rings films.Perfect for a comfy night in on the couch this movie has adventure action humour depth of character and story great music and photography and a sitting round the campfire telling stories kind of feel that is just great.

Still for all it's worth the movie is a great addition to the treasury of collected works on the Dark Continent. Delroy Lindo has a good part with his character 'Mabruki.'

	schema:reviewBody "MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON is a twentyyearold film that is beginning to find an audience via DVD release and word of mouth. Until now it has been a wellkept secret having disappeared after a too brief run at the box office in competition with such blockbusters as The Godfather Part III Dances with Wolves The Hunt for red October Ghost GoodFellas Ghost Pretty Woman and a host of others in that prime year. But as a cinematic achievement it was not like the O'Neill 'Misbegotten' just Forgotten. Perhaps now time has erased the problem of initial anonymity and we are impressed with this epic story based on the novel by William Harrison that explores the life and psyche of Sir Richard Burton who with Dr David Livingstone Bernard Hill was one of the greatest British explorers of the 19th century. The time is 1864 and Sir Richard Burton Patrick Bergin in a multifaceted magnificent performance that was Oscar worthy gathers financial backing to set out on an expedition to search for the source of the Nile River somewhere in East Africa. He is joined by the somewhat cocky but brilliant John Hanning Speke Iain Glen Burton seeks to understand the many cultural aspects of the tribes he will encounter while Speke brings guns and dreams on conquering the heathen natives that may block their discovery. They set off to East Africa and being their trek on foot across the impossibly difficult terrain encountering every hardship imaginable including hostile tribes who are part of the current slavery business. Burton brings along one Sidi Bombay Paul Onsongo who speaks all the languages of the various tribes and knows the terrain. Burton and Speke grow in their friendship and admiration for each other saving each other's lives during attacks and caring for each other's subsequent wounds. At one point Burton encounters a runaway slave Mabruki Delroy Lindo and honors his ancestry and knowledge of Africa when Mabruki is later captured by a tribe and is yoke of slavery is restored Burton is enraged and rather than seeing his friend suffer he performs the euthanasia that Mabruki requests. Burton comes down with bilateral lower extremity cellulitis and requires incision and drainage and Speke stays by his side during recovery at this point in time it is suggested that Burton and Speke had a loving physical relationship a theme that history books reinforce. Eventually Burton sends Speke to proceed on the quest to find the source of the Nile Speke discovers Lake Victoria and though Burton is uncertain as to the end of the expedition believing that their are several lakes that feed the Nile they return to England victorious. Once in England Burton marries a rather feisty feminist Isabel Arundell Fiona Shaw and together they face the fact that the Royal Academy is touting Speke as the discoverer of the Nile Source. Through a series of lies and illadvised plans Speke is lauded and Burton is to debate Speke before the Royal Academy. But Speke's love for Burton as well as his knowledge that the discovery is not his alone drives Speke to suicide. And the subsequent order of events is shared with the audience in written form as the film ends. There are so many superlative actors in this huge film that space does not allow mention of them all. The various tribes in Africa are resplendent in their costumes and customs and cinematographer Roger Deakins captures every aspect of the locations in both Africa and in England beautifully. The musical score by Michael Small is equally fine and Bob Rafelson's direction is tight and focused and yet lets us appreciate the vastness of the African countryside as well as the intimate moments between the actors. This is a magnificent epic film and while it may not be absolutely true to history it does give us a sense of that British obsession with conquering the unknown. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

Everybody seemed to be poking their European and sometimes American noses into the Dark Continent looking for slaves money maps treasure trophy animals conquest rivers or fifteen minutes of fame. The expedition of Sir Richard Burton Patrick Bergin and John Hanning Speke Iain Glen was one of the first the object of which was to track the Nile to its source. They never really did it. The trip was brutal. The two Englishmen and their bearers were plagued by illness and other dangers. The climate ruined much of their survey equipment. The two men returned separately to England where Burton found that Speke had claimed most of the credit already assigning Burton the role of a sickly companion. The former colleagues never spoke again. Speke died of a gunshot wound while hunting. Burton died later of a heart attack on political appointment in Trieste.Speke was always more of a Victorian conformist and colonialist like so many others. But as for Burton he hardly needed this trek to gain his fifteen minutes of fame. He'd already accumulated several hours worth.He was a burly darkly handsome eccentric adventurer and scholar something on the order of Lawrence of Arabia. He spoke a couple of dozen languages and wrote for the first time unexpurgated versions of The Kama Sutra and The Arabian Nights among other classics. I read Burton's Arabian nights as a kid looking for the erotic parts and wasn't too disappointed but more than that found it entertaining and even amusing. One tale has an attractive young couple spending the night in bed without touching one another and Burton had added a footnote The young man must have been a demon of chastity. Not very Victorian! I missed the first part of the film and tuned in while Speke and Burton are undergoing some frightening and dismal experiences in an African village. Their loyal chief bearer an early role for Delroy Lindo of the monumental jaw is put to an excruciating death before Burton's drugged eyes.Yes it's well done directed by Bob Rafaelson and the two leads are convincing approximations of the originals. The rift between the two and Burton's final fatalistic shrug are rather touching. Nobody weeps. Nobody punches anyone else in the nose. A young African king kills a couple of people with a toy revolver boy was THAT a bad gift but there's no shoot out. No Victorian gentleman ever even shouts at another. It's lushly photographed too. You wouldn't want to make the journey that Speke and Burton did.An allaround good job by everyone concerned.".

Their loyal chief bearer an early role for Delroy Lindo of the monumental jaw is put to an excruciating death before Burton's drugged eyes.Yes it's well done directed by Bob Rafaelson and the two leads are convincing approximations of the originals. The rift between the two and Burton's final fatalistic shrug are rather touching. Nobody weeps. Nobody punches anyone else in the nose. A young African king kills a couple of people with a toy revolver boy was THAT a bad gift but there's no shoot out. No Victorian gentleman ever even shouts at another. It's lushly photographed too. You wouldn't want to make the journey that Speke and Burton did.An allaround good job by everyone concerned.";

What is Mountains of the Moon I asked my self. This is the first I have heard of it. All of my friends and I were there to see Arnold kick some but.Which movie did I choose? Yeah..you guessed it.....Like a total brainwashed Zombie I chose the Arnold Movie. I was programmed and conditioned by hype to WANT to see Total Recall and noting else.I missed seeing a GREAT movie on the Big Screen. I would give anything to go back in time and choose differently. The visuals and scenes of MOTM were very fascinating even watching this on VHS some years later. The producersdistributors obviously lacked the big budget in 1990 for Advertising that the fat cats who made Total Recall did. ALSO most Americans are probably too ignorant of History to even know anything about the Colonial Exploration of Africa  so the desire to see a film of this genre was low staring out.IN SHORT I highly recommend this movie. If you are a thinking person it will inspire you to desire to know more about these men who braved impossible odds to explore new worlds.Richard Burton's books are available in reprints from Dover Press. Did you know that he was the first White European to visit Mecca? Yes that could have been a movie itself. He wrote about it in a great book.IMPORTANT This movie was based on a play called Burton and Speake and not on Burton's or Speake's writings. There are artistic licenses taken.".

	schema:reviewBody "If we hope to be educated by film Mountains of the Moon shows us why that's a slippery slope. Bob Rafelson wanted to make this film for years but he takes liberties about key things so that means he was looking to tell a very specific story about two people rather than evoke something of the reality of European exploration in Africa. This is romantic classical storytelling. For exampleSpeke is shown to hesitate when he returns to England before he goes before the Royal Geographical Society no doubt to show him as a pawn used by his publishers who hope to make a fortune on his findings. In reality Speke hastened back to England.In the end we're told that Speke's theory that Lake Victoria is the source of the river Nile is correct. In reality the White Nile flows out of a system of lakes in the region which would mean that Richard Burton's theory was correct. But Speke's betrayal of his friend in the film is so alienating for his character that his committing suicide is not atonement enough. The film also feels the need to vindicate his theory post mortem.What this means is that Mountains of the Moon takes liberties with fact but does so in the interest of likable wellrounded characters. A lot of the drama is riveting. There's good and bad in them and Speke is not allowed to become the villain. That reveals Bob Rafelson's method here there's too much 'film' in Mountains of the Moon. Africa is a central character in the same inescapable way the desert is prominent in Lawrence of Arabia it shapes and moulds the people and spits them back out in Victorian England scarred and tattered but this story of loyalty friendship and betrayal almost takes place apart from Africa. Rafelson doesn't have the affinity for the mysteries of a new world at once horrible and wonderful the capacity to be at awe as Herzog in his jungle films or Coppola in Apocalypse Now. The landscape is there but Rafelson doesn't quite know what to do with it. He shoots it like it's a studio backlot. The African desert is there but it doesn't have a presence. When the expedition sets off for the interior of Africa we get bouncy 'adventure' music in upbeat tempos.Then we're taken captives by a local chieftain and the movie takes a turn towards something that reminds me of Cobra Verde where Klaus Kinski suffers a similar fate off the West African coast and Cabeza de Vacas where the sole survivor of a conquistador expedition is held by Mexican indians elaborate rituals and peculiar ceremonies introduce us to a strange world where ornate violence is at the heart of everything. Rafelson is still doing a movie in the classical sense of the term though and for that movie little has changed since the 60's when British colonial interests in the area where again depicted in the historical epic Khartoum.If Terrence Malick is filled with lyrical wonder at everything around him in his tale of the settlement of New England in The New World Bob Rafelson is the complete opposite he's too banal about the Nile expedition in Mountains of the Moon. En route we get some great images like the slavetrading party Burton and Speke happen upon. Victorian maps showed the area as a blank spot of terra incognita but Arab slavetraders had filtered for centuries millions of slaves through to Zanzibar and knew those places. But they're never unforgettable images to burn themselves in my memory. Rafelson's way of making this film is too prosaic for that. Everything else is mostly simplified and simplistic. This is still the type of film where a voiceover narrating a journal takes us through the various steps of a journey. It's not special enough.".

The meandering surprisingly cruel first 40 minutes of the film become irrelevant.Speke and Burton's search to find the source of the Nile is great material for a film. The scenery alone would lead any director to jump at the chance but as so often occurs with films about Africa the Continent overpowers the human drama. Rafelson is a master of human intimacy and this story of two men's friendship which turns to rivalry is badly mangled by the screenplay. Burton's life alone is a huge trove for the subject of a film and Rafelson seems to never grip the nature of these men the essence of the story nor how to tell it.Yet the film is worth spending time with only to lavish in the effort of these two men and perhaps the last time when discovery meant a places on a map.".

	schema:reviewBody "Minor Spoilers!Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson reprise their characters of Wang and O'Bannon in this second installment of the series.  I hope there will be a third!Chan's slapstick fight sequences are even better here than in Shanghai Noon. They're bigger better and there are more of them!  In addition to all of the clever integration of set items fruit stands wax sculptures books ladders etc that we are accustomed to the Shanghai Knights sequences are also imbued with a wonderful sense of metahumor.  While he's using an umbrella in his kung fu against the Fleet Street gang there is a sudden brief and whimsical nod to Singin In The Rain complete with flawless stylisms by Chan.I believe the use of actual characters from the period was a bit overdone. At times they were cute winks to the audience while at other times they seemed needlessly inserted.  Distracting. One very nice addition was Jack the Ripper if only because of the brief and very decisive meeting he has with Wang's sister Lin.  Lin is played by Fann Wong and as the female interest is superior to Lucy Liu's character of the first movie.The villains are better too.  Aiden Gillen is good as Lord Rathbone then fantastic in his action scenes.  The best however is Donnie Yen.  Yen's portrayal of the evil Wu Chow is okay but who really cares?  The character itself is merely the vehicle to get Yen and his fantastic martial arts skill into a movie with Jackie Chan.  Seeing these two work together in beautifully choreographed fights was a dream come true.  And though partially edited out of the actual movie the DVD thankfully offers their climactic fight scene in its fulluncut glory.My only disappointment of note was Wilson's O'Bannon character.  He wasn't quite as consistently funny in this outing and the character itself could have been portrayed better.  There was no evolution in O'Bannon.  He had the exact same deficiencies as in the first movie.  I understand that the charm of O'Bannon lies in his irresponsibility but a little maturing could have been accomplished while keeping the charm intact.  Evolution is important to keeping the characters fresh but O'Bannon was the same as in the first.Overall I rank this a little better than the first and HIGHLY recommend it!6.5 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Minor Spoilers!Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson reprise their characters of Wang and O'Bannon in this second installment of the series.  I hope there will be a third!Chan's slapstick fight sequences are even better here than in Shanghai Noon. They're bigger better and there are more of them!  In addition to all of the clever integration of set items fruit stands wax sculptures books ladders etc that we are accustomed to the Shanghai Knights sequences are also imbued with a wonderful sense of metahumor.  While he's using an umbrella in his kung fu against the Fleet Street gang there is a sudden brief and whimsical nod to Singin In The Rain complete with flawless stylisms by Chan.I believe the use of actual characters from the period was a bit overdone. At times they were cute winks to the audience while at other times they seemed needlessly inserted.  Distracting. One very nice addition was Jack the Ripper if only because of the brief and very decisive meeting he has with Wang's sister Lin.

	schema:headline " Fantastic sequel!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's an odd thing this syndrome where people seem to automatically dislike a sequel more than the original. I don't know whether its subconscious or what but the IMDb proves it Almost everywhere I go people seem to agree at least movie lovers that Aliens is even better than Alien yet Aliens is listed 85 on IMDb's top 250 Alien is 61. Then there is another masterpiece The Godfather all though many people seem to agree that however great The Godfather Part II is even better. Not so according to the votes from IMDbusers The Godfather is 1 Part II is 4. Star Wars is 10 The Empire Strikes Back is 15 and the list goes on and on. It's as if the general public goes into sequelsucksmode before they see the film and automatically would give it a lower grade no matter what. This also seems to be the case with Shanghai Knights. Like many of my movie geek friends I thought the first film was great but Shanghai Knights took me by great surprise and turned out to be even better much more fun better fights greater villains greater scenery bigger plot more film references and I can go on. Still it gets a 64 average while the first one gets a 67. Apparently it is one of the laws of physics that all though you personally feel a sequel outdoes the original the masses would have you believe otherwise the Toy Storymovies being the exception that proves the rule.Well we're all better off without the masses anyway. That's why nature invented things like the plague!Now to my review of Shanghai KnightsI rarely laugh out loud to comedies unless it's Monty Pythontype comedy filled with unpredictable insane humour but Shanghai Knights had me in stitches several times. I really liked the first film but the sequel is filled with references to everything you ever found fascinating about Britain and the charming duo of Chan and Wilson this time reaches its peak. But what really gets this film going is fight scenes like you've never seen them before! I am serious I've watched Jackie Chanfilms since I was a little kid and everyone knows he is the Buster Keaton of martial arts but this time the fights  choreographed by Jackie himself  are so exhilarating to watch boasting with playfulness to such a degree it leaves you dumbstruck in awe. All though it is apparent they used wires on some of the stunts the mix of wire and wireless stunts seem to balance themselves perfectly giving a show fit for the greatest circus on Earth! It is hard to put to words the sheer delight it is to watch Jackie Chan now close to 50! beating up a gang of crooks while at the same time doing an homage to Gene Kelly and Singin' in the Rain! It gave me that rare sensation I remember getting the first time I saw Chaplin perform the dance of the rolls in the Gold Rush Buster Keaton caught in the middle of that hurricane in Steamboat Bill Jr. or when Donald O'Connor ran up the wall in Singin' in the Rain. It is a rare cinematic treat created by and performed to excellence by Jackie Chan again underlining what a rare and unique screen artist he is and how grateful we should be for him risking his back to give us that joy. People who still think of him as only a martial arts artist should take a hike. He's been a legend in his own right for close to two decades one of the greatest entertainers of his generation if not THEE greatest so I ask you this when will they give him an Honorary Academy Award!? I am sure Chaplin Keaton and Gene Kelly would have supported this wholeheartedly had they been alive today!A great deal is also owed to the writing pair of Alfred Gough and Miles Millar Made Men SpiderMan 2 who pepper the story with quirky charm  the type Chan  Wilson seem born to play once in a while serving up hysterical oneliners that should crack up anyone with an IQ over 50 the best one has to be the subtitle after one of the characters has an encounter with Jack the Ripper.Not surprisingly many of the people with an IQ under 50 bothered to fill the Goofsection up with all the factual errors in Shanghai Knights when it is just the thing you have to expect from a crazy comedy of this kind. For as long as I can remember I've enjoyed British history I know the first real automobile wasn't invented until 1889 I'm a big fan of the Jack the Ripperlegend who terrorized London in 1888 I love the work of Chaplin who was born in 1889 I know Arthur Conan Doyle was originally a doctor of optometry but not once did I mind all these things clashing in 1887's London it is pure fantasy and should be enjoyed as such. Wonderful escapism played to perfection by great talent in front of and behind the camera. The writers didn't intend to recreate history they just did as Jackie Chan would do in a fight take every thing available and throw it in to make it more entertaining to the viewer! Then again there are people who have NO relation to any of the abovelisted things and not surprisingly they won't find Shanghai Knights that entertaining. Which is really sad for if you love movies you should really learn to love history as well as the two can make a fabulous pair whether it is done in the name of fantasy or fiction. Of course director David Dobkin also deserves special praise for never letting the heart and soul of the film getting lost in all the commotion.I didn't mention Owen Wilson in all this but don't get me wrong he's great as usual. Wilson and Chris Tucker Rush Hour has to be the greatest thing happening to Jackie Chan since he discovered the art of mixing comedy with martial arts. And of course the supporting actors deserves mentioning especially Aidan Gillen who makes a wonderful sneaky upperclass villain named Rathbone not exactly the most inventive referance to Hollywood  legendary actor Basil Rathbone  but still wonderful the same and Aaron Johnson as a kid who looks and acts like he was just pulled out of Oliver! with great conviction a scene where Wilson tells him of for being a an orphan is both heartbreaking and sidesplittingly funny at the same time. Fann Wong also does a great English languagespeaking film debut as Jackie Chan's sister.To sum it all up leaving me laughing to the point of exhaustion Shanghai Knights is one of this years most pleasant surprises!".

Poorly shot with howlingly funny dubbing they nonetheless catch a KungFu master at the height of his considerable prowess.Hollywood and Jackie's sincere but imperfect effort at learning English  led to a series of films that are high budget such as Rush Hour with its sequel and Shanghai Noon now followed by this film.  Each has a sidekick for the irrepresible Chan but Shanghai Knights  is the first where the faithful companion is a strong character in his own right.Shanghai Knights begins with the Peking not Beijing it's the end of the nineteenth century murder of Chan's dad and the theft of the Imperial Seal a device to mark documents not a pet.  Chan is a Nevada sheriff who upon learning of the homicide and theft sets off to New York City to find his pal played formidably and with evident relish by Owen Wilson.The duo head for London where an unending series of misadventures brings the heroes along with Chan's gorgeous and martial artsskilled sister Fann Wong into the path of such diverse characters as little Charlie Chaplin Her Majesty Queen Victoria Jack the Ripper and others.  Of course all ends well and if the martial arts terpsichore is less breathtakingly complex than its predecessors  well let's cut Jackie some slack.The film is PG13 but Wilson provides a measured but running dose of raunch aided by a bevy of scantily clad beauties.  There's no doubt HE had a terrific time making the movie.Director David Dobkin keeps the pace moving and pays humorous tribute to films and stars from the Gilded Age of the cinema.  I won't spoil the amusing surprises but listen to the music as the intrepid trio sister now a fullfledged partner waft to and fro in a caricature of nineteenth century London.  Sad to say most moviegoers won't recognize the wellexecuted takeoffs of some great moments in film.As always a special Chan treat are the outtakes before the end credits scenes that prove making these films may not be good for the health of the nolongeryoung star or his cast but they all have a blast literally.And here's good news for the many who will enjoy this movie.  I don't know if there will be a Rush Hour III but last week I couldn't get within 150 feet of the venerable Yonah Schimmel's on the Lower East Side's Houston Street.  Chan and crew were filming a sequel to this new release  a flunky stopping pedestrian traffic told me the title would be Shanghai Knish!  I can't wait.710.".

IT was also very funny when they are in the hotel in New York City and we find out Roy really works there and isn't rich.  This has plenty of Chan stunts with ladders amazing kicks and swords.

If you want to go and be entertained and laugh for a few hours and see one of the best film chemistry between two actors in film history then you will enjoy this movie.  This is just a feel good comedy from start to finish. No more no less.  It's not the best movie ever made but for a few hours it will make you feel good.  So don't go expecting too much just go and have fun. I kind of wish they could make one of these movies every month.".

The story is about a former chinese warrior Chon Wang Jackie Chan who after his father gets killed by a ruthless heir of the thrown seek vengeance on him with the help of his old partner Roy O'Bannon Owen Wilson and his sister from China who told him about the death of his father. This one has actually more action and is more funny than the original by a long shot. I personally think that Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights are way better than the Rush Hour movies. I would say this is probably one of Jackie Chan's best movies and his best comedy for sure. I would recommend this to fans of both Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan and ActionComedy fans as well.

The movie is essentially one long wink and if you like that sort of humor your likely to find much of it amusing.

	schema:reviewBody "Fresh out after his boxoffice bomb The Tuxedo Jackie Chan is back again playing the role of Chon Wang. In this sequel to Shanghai Noon Wang and Roy O'Bannon Owen Wilson are in different parts of the country Chon in Nevada Roy in New York. However after Chon's father is killed by Lord Rathbone Aidan Gillen he must go to London to find Rathbone to avenge the death of the father. Along the way Chon's sister Lin Fann Wong comes in. Guess who is smitten by her?Another reason why Chon has to kill Rathbone is that he has a sacred Seal of the Emperor. That's just thrown in to make the plot make more sense. Mucho fight scenes and hilarity ensues.Chan does better in buddy action comedies like this instead of straight action. He's noted for using props around him in his fight scenes this movie is no exception. Chan just takes any old prop he sees and does what looks like improv. It's hard to imagine all of these scenes choreographed perfectly they seem so slipshod in a good way. All of the fight scenes have Chan's usual charm and wit you can't help but smile whenever he does seemingly impossible stunts.Many of the characters were onedimensional. Rathbone doesn't really have any depth except that everyone likes him. However in movies like this you don't really need twists and turns. Lin's beautiful but what is her background? Someone working for Rathbone has no depth whatsoever and just pops in. And of course there's the little pickpocket Aaron Johnson whose name is quite funny. He just comes and goes.The opening credits were almost exactly like the ones for Shanghai Noon with sweeps over Chinese letters. Something I enjoyed was how they incorporated famous figures though a little bit goes a long way. About halfway through it takes one of those obligatory buddy turns where they end up hating each other. However this time the roles are reversed from Shanghai Noon and it lasts for about two minutes which leaves you wondering why it was even put in. They took the clich lightheartedly. At times it did get heavyhanded especially at the beginning but managed to pull through.The sets were very authentic. Unlike the first where they could just use cheap facades they had to create a whole new world and they did so. You could really believe that the clan was in England. I also liked the transitions in between scenes. They were all swishes' but as the movie progressed and got more complex' so did the transitions from going out on both sides to diagonal. It may seem rather juvenile to put it in and even more so to mention it but I thought they were quite cool.I do wish however that they had spent more time in the West. If they had had more about the horse from the first one also whatever happened to Chon's wife Falling Leaves? it would have been better. However it almost immediately left the West for the East. Like The Tuxedo Chan allows himself to be pushed around and beaten.Chan is great as usual. He's a great diversion from the real life. He can make us believe that what is done can be done. Technically he can because he does his own stunts. Wilson is in top comedic form here as usual also. He's quickly becoming an item in Hollywood and his name's getting out there. Then again he did do I Spy.I laughed a lot during Shanghai Knights. Many came from the fight scenes and others were from Wilson's oneliners. I love how the writers can merge action and comedy seamlessly. I hope for a Shanghai Five where they go to Hawaii or some sequel since this franchise is going somewhere.My rating 7.510Rated PG13 for action violence and sexual content.".

Shanghai Knights is a very fitting sequel.  It has energy unlike many other films the past few years it has a very Indiana Jones style to it.  Also different from other comedies this movie has a plot. OThe beginning is typical someone steals something important to set things in motion.  As a student of history I found all the little nods at history Chaplin and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle being main supporting characters the Chinese Boxers to be fun while not always correct.  But when you go see an action comedy you don't expect historical accuracy right? Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson have what most duos don't chemistry. They work well together and they play off each other.  Wilson's rambling tirades about the differences between America and Britain and his constant bashing of England are hilarious.  The action pieces are top notch and as I already mentioned I was pleasantly surprised to find an actual story.It started off as an actiondrama film with a few gags in it then develops into humor where you're not just amused you chuckle then as the film progresses you start laughing out loud.  It gets funnier as it goes along as well as becomes more dramatic.A great film immensely entertaining.  I give it an eight simply because it's no Star Wars LOTR or Gettysburg but it's definately better than most of the junk floating around these days and will most likely find it's way to my small DVD collection devoid of comedies for the most part DVDs are expensive so I only buy movies I really really like mostly three hour dramas. .".

By all accounts this is an improvement on Chan and Wilson's last pairing.The laughs this time are indeed a good deal funnier.Wilson delivering the great wise cracks and Chan showing off his amazing fighting skills. Chan serves up his usual ingenious blend of high kicking martial arts and hilarious slapstick.We are subjected to a funny homage to singin' in the rain and amazing set pieces which involve a revolving door a museum and a show stopping fight inside Big Ben in the final reel. There is brilliant chemistry between Chan and Wilson who are both clearly having fun in their respective rolls.Wilson wrings about as many laughs from the witty script penned by Miles Millar and Alfred Gough who also wrote the original. Fann Wong is also a nice addition to the cast an Chon's sister.She delivers a good performance and her chemistry between her male counterparts works well.She is certainly more than the obligatory love interest to Owen Wilson. Where the film is let down however is in the presentation of the English characters the English characters.Gough and Millar resort to the stereotypical view that the Americans seem to have of the English. You need only watch Three Men and a little Lady and Buffy the Vampire Slayer to see that. Rathbone is sadly a one dimensional villain who could have walked out of a James Bond movie.Gillen doesn't help matters either by hamming it up wildly Artie DoyleTom Fisheris also a character who is badly served.Fisher tries his best but can do little to avoid him from being a one dimensional characiture. Millar and Gough also resort to some unsubtle historical references to Charlie Chaplin and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.That said the scene with Jack the Ripper is priceless. Those faults aside this is a lot better than I expected it to be.It's certainly an improvement on the last movie which I thought was okay but nothing to write home about.If you haven't already seen it I suggest you rush out and see it while you get the chance.It's makes an enjoyable night out to the movies!Robs Rating   ".

His funny and amazing fight scenes are more than half of this movies appeal.The combination of these two talents makes for one very ecentric and goood movie. Some movie critics may say this movie is corny and stupid but who cares what they think because we are all able to think on our own.

His funny and amazing fight scenes are more than half of this movies appeal.The combination of these two talents makes for one very ecentric and goood movie. Some movie critics may say this movie is corny and stupid but who cares what they think because we are all able to think on our own. I am looking forward to another sequel SHANGHAI PIRATES......or....SHANGHAI ROBOTS.....or even.....SHANGHAI ANGELS.....really its not my decision. i dont think it is jackie and owen rock!";

The fight scenes are more than punching and kicking.  The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed dances.  The fight scene in England with the gang that harassed the kid thief is a perfect example.  It was homage to the movie Dancing in the Rain' when Jackie Chan character John Wayne fought gracefully with an umbrella.I wish there were more fight scenes and stunts in this movie.  I felt the story was boring and formulaic and the only thing redeeming was the fightsstunts.  The script was corny.  Every person involved referred toor was a famous person in history.  This movie was the sequel to Shanghai Noon. It was mildly funny in the first movie when Jackie Chan's character was named John Wayne but this movie it was done overboard.  The kid thief ends up being Charlie Chan.  The detective at Scotland Yard is the writer of Sherlock Holmes.  Jack the Ripper even makes a lame cameo in this movie. It felt very lame and almost painful watching some parts.  For instance in the end they are knighted by the Queen Chan and Wilson bow in humility made me sick at the cheesiness of the situation.  I squinted my eyes and grimaced during most of the attempt to make an original story but I came alive during the action sequences of the movie.Hopefully in Chan's next movie there will be more stunts and fight scenes and less dialogue. 6.510".

Chon is still a sheriff in the West and goes to New York to get his money from Roy O'Bannon.  With the money gone Roy helps Chon get to London where they uncover a plot between Lord Rathbone and Wu Chow to allow them to rise to be leaders of their respective countries. Making some new friends along the way the pair with sister Lin in tow must recover the seal and foil the dastardly plot.Most enjoyable and all round American film Jackie Chan has made.  Simple as that.  I'm not saying this is high art or one of the best films ever made' but it is great fun and has all the things I need in a Chan film.  After the mauling The Tuxedo got from critics and fans alike Chan needed a return to the good old fashioned values away from CGI!  Knights is a great vehicle for Chan.  Here the weaknesses in his films are pretty well dealt with however first  the plot.The plot is as weak as you'd expect happily not too much time is spend setting it up and it isn't too tortuous.  The setting in London succeeds in making he film feel fresh and not just a sequel to Noon however it does bring some of the film's weaknesses in the crude and unfunny English clichs the awful cockney acting being the worst and lots of name dropping Chaplin Holmes Doyle Jack the Ripper etc.  Outside of this the film has two very simple foundation blocks that it builds it's potentially weak plot on top of  action and comedy.The action is great.  I saw Cradle 2 Grave last week and was bitterly disappointed by the fight sequences  not only were they uninspiring but the MTV editing made them impossible to appreciate.  Here Chan's sequences are as good as he has done in an USA movie.  They are clever athletic funny and very well directed  the camera isn't cutting every 5 seconds and we are allowed to see Chan in action.  Fann's fights are also excellent lacking Chan's comedy touch but yet very good traditionally.  The final fight between Yen and Chan is good  very tough and my only compliant is that I'd have liked it to be longer like the climax to Shi di chu ma but this is a minor complaint and the film's focus on the fight with Rathbone is almost as enjoyable.The second strand comedy is pitch perfect as long as you like Wilson's trade mark new age type wonder and philosophising.  I personally do and his remarks are funny in themselves but also because they are so out of place with the setting and action of the film.  It is a humour that is unshowy unassuming and just gives a whole comedic feel to the movie instead of a few big jokes spread thin.  Of course Wilson and Chan seem to have a good chemistry which really helps and Chan has brought out his classic mix of comedy with his physical routines.  Happily the outtakes are not the funniest bit of the film as was the case in some of his other US films  Rush Hour 1  2.  They are funny but that mobile phone one looked staged!On top of relaxed and natural performances by Chan and Wilson is a support cast that would be considered weak if it were in a film that took itself seriously.  Donnie Yen is OK but only really used to good effect in the last few scenes  only in his fight with Chan does he become a real screen presence.  Likewise Gillen Queer as Folk is a clich of oiliness but he has had enough training to bring off an exciting sword fight.  Johnson does a really forced accent and is a little annoying as the street kid while Fisher is only average.  The strongest addition to the mix is the model and actress Fann Wong.  Not only is she drop dead but she has fun during the film however when called upon to do martial arts scenes she is very fast and impressive.Overall this film doesn't take itself too seriously so why should you? Instead you should watch it in a light mood and it will be perfect.  It will quickly fade from memory shortly after watching it but that's OK cause chances are you'll want to see this light ball of fun again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am 50 years old and have been a professional musician most of my life. Cole porter's heyday was long before I was around but I was instantly attracted to his music in my youth and that love for his compositions has never ceased.I know many here are bad mouthing the movie DeLovely and they shouldn't be. There are so many unwatchable ridiculously bad movies being released nowadays that Delovely looks like Gone with the Wind compared to many of them. We have several generations of young people that do not have the benefit of the diverse media many of us older people had when we were young. Back when radio and television use to thrived on diversity. They are now totally market driven toward youth and offer little diversity. The rebirth of the musical these past few years is introducing youth to a quality of art that most were not even aware existed. The influence movies like DeLovely could have on young artist should not be underestimated. I remember many musicals in my youth that greatly influenced my future career as a musician.I found DeLovely to be a delightful movie. I found both Kline and Judd to be excellent in their roles. While the story has taken some lead way with the facts they got the majority of important points across and with a lot of style in my opinion. The makers of this movie had to do a balancing act between biography and entertainment. Between telling the story of Porter's life and paying tribute to his incredible talent as a song writer. I left the movie theater feeling upbeat and inspired. That told me they balanced the two very well.While I might of chosen a few different singers to sing Porter's songs in the movie I realize that using known modern singers helps get youth into the theater and that's important. The artist they choose to sing Porter's music in the movie did a wonderful job. While some renditions are a little too modernized any influence his music has on today's youth is a good thing. Our young people need to know that real works of art take skill training talent and time. Much of todays music is aimed toward an audience with a very short attention span wanting instant gratification and to counter that with the music of Cole Porter is a wonderful gift to an entire generation.This movie works on so many levels. The music the period the love affair and the pain. The story is about Porter looking back at his life during his last moments on earth he sees it as a theatrical production. Because of this the songs are not all in chronological order. A few of the songs were placed out of sequence to fit the story line. This idea works splendidly and it is beyond me why some reviewers seemed to miss this concept completely and thought the writers messed up. The truth is we really don't know that much about Cole porter. He was not fond of the press and the relationship between his wife Linda and him was very private. We do know Cole was gay but loved Linda deeply his entire life. The movie raises more questions than it answers as it should. Cole was a complicated person and lived a complicated life. This is movie making at it's best folks. I recommend this movie highly. I hope Hollywood keeps the musicals coming. It's about time.".

In this case the interaction onesided but still there between the old Cole Porter and his past made the transition to his life magical and fun. It didn't feel like a biographical view of his life.From the opening scene in the theatre it just got better as it went along. Kevin Kline's portrayal of Cole Porter was rich and nuanced. He seemed to be truly in love with Linda yet he still had his other side. Ashley Judd as Linda seemed perfect. When the old Cole Porter sees her again he says My god she was lovely! and she was. I identified enough with her and with Kevin Kline that I was saddened by her death in the movie. They sold me on their characters. I ended up feeling empathy for Linda the lovely lovable and steadfast and respect and admiration for the Cole Porter figure.But what made the movie fly for me was the music go figure!. It was Cole Porter release 1.1. A bunch of his great songs were rearranged and presented by modern singers  all the way from jazz Diane Krall to varieties of pop Elvis Costello. Each of the singers brought a new feel to the Cole Porter songs and really made the movie a pleasure.When my wife and I finished the movie on the DVD we spent another hour watching all the special features.

	schema:headline " DeLovely is indeed lovely";
	schema:reviewBody "As a biography DeLovely is not historically accurate but as drama and a tribute to Cole Porter a prodigious talent in musical theater it is sublime. Kevin Kline is perfectly cast in spirit as the songwriter extraordinaire who stormed Broadway as Hollywood beckoned. His marriage to Linda Porter a terrific Ashley Judd is a relationship of lasting love fraught with infidelity and heartbreak in which Porter is portrayed as an insatiable artist whose homoerotic dalliances were legend. The timeline spans the 1920's through the 1950's. This is not so much a simple biopic but rather an interesting depiction of Porter's constant struggle to find happiness in love and life and it proves to be an addictive intoxication. As his accepting and understanding wife grows increasingly frustrated with his lies and deception amid his growing list of male suitors Porter's life and health begin to unravel. Serving as a framework for the life events is a curious narration of sorts by an aged Porter and a mysterious hostangel a nice theatrical turn by Jonathan Pryce. This bracketing narration is reminiscent of A Christmas Carol and there are striking similarities to the classic All That Jazz in narrative and tone. The main story is told in a series of minivignettes some scenes are almost too brief. Then there are the songs. It is truly phenomenal just how many wonderful Porter songs became standards. The recreations of many of his top hits are interspersed throughout the film and are performed often by top vocalists including some amusing cameos by Elvis Costello Diana Krall Alanis Morissette and Natalie Cole. The songs serve to parallel and punctuate the life events throughout the story in much the same way paintings served as a conarrative in Frieda.Although production values are good for a period and location piece it feels a little less grand in scope than it ought to be. Perhaps that works in the films favor as a more intimate story. Standout credit goes to the makeup effects especially showing the aging of Kevin Kline's character. The camera work and editing are imaginative especially in a series of circular tracking shots which seamlessly meld one timeframe with another. The music is timeless and enjoyable even when sung in pedestrian fashion by Kline. And regarding Kline he deserves an Oscar nomination for a richly etched portrait of a tortured soul whose search for true love spanned his entire life. Perhaps in the hands of Bob Fosse or Baz Luhrmann this could have really launched into a wildly imaginative sendoff of a musical genius but director Irwin Winkler a respected producer turned director like Alan Pakula has done Cole Porter proud.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Irwin Winkler's Delovely isn't any more a determined attempt at accuracy  a biopic with integrity  than was its 1946 romantic predecessor Night and Day a star vehicle for Cary Grant. Delovely is a truly lovely retelling with much liberty taken of the life of the great song writer Cole Porter and the woman he loved  and who loved him intensely Linda his only wife.In real life Porter was probably exclusively gay and Linda a wealthy divorcee bearing sharpedged hurting psychical scars from the brutalization she experienced in her first marriage was happy to settle into deeply rewarding platonic matrimony with the brilliant witty Cole. Porter here is marginally bisexual and the two are shown chastely but lovingly entwined in bed. Cole and Linda from reasonably informed accounts probably never had sex.What makes this film work are the imagined powerful performances of Ashley Judd as Linda and Kevin Kline as Porter. The rest of the cast is fine and many songs are bellowed by famous singers but this is Judd and Kline's inspired genius from beginning to end. Winkler drew ecstatically engaging portrayals from these gifted actors. I can't imagine who could have played these roles as Judd and Kline do.The film begins with an aged Porter watching and commenting on rehearsals of a new production that will showcase his wonderful songs. Is Porter actually alive? The director tells him that his shouted comments can't be heard by the actors. The film goes back and forth to this rehearsal which affects Porter increasingly as the main story follows the couple's life together.Linda rich independent and very smart as well as glamorous knew she wanted Porter from their first encounter. When he delicately indicates his attraction to men she responds that she doesn't carehe simply likes men more than she does. Kline's Porter is a genius but also he's somewhat immature and as his fame spreads and his wealth grows innocently insensitive to how his activities create a wall of estrangement between himself and the woman he totally adores. Petty lies replace the earlier openness as Porter is attracted to a homosexual subculture.Judd  certainly one of the most intelligent women acting today  is grippingly compelling as she progresses from divorcee to globetrotting wife to indispensable muse to a premature death when she's racked by a progressively fatal malady. Folks were crying in the theater today.Perhaps in wry acknowledgment that he's messed about with the facts Winkler has the befuddled Cole and Linda watch a private studio preview of Night and Day which leaves Porter commenting that it can't be so bad to be played by Cary Grant. But both quietly recognize that their lives have been captured and transformed by Hollywood reality playing second place to the whims of powerful vulgarians like Louis B. Mayer who is parodied nicely.But seminally and for all time Cole Porter was and is about his songs and shows and Delovely offers an almost unending performance of tunes both familiar and not today's audience by the way largely remembered Porter. Both Kline and Judd singKline sounds remarkably like Porter and Judd gives it the good old Phi Beta Kappa try she's a member. In any event what a Delovely treat to see this extraordinary actress unleashed from her recent past of portraying women victimized by homicidal misogynists.At the least this film will probably garner the Oscar for costumes. Armani designed the wardrobe and Kline and Judd seem to change for every scene. The whole cast is attired in perfect garb suggesting the magic of Porter's circle.Rarely do I leave a theater determined to immediately get a film soundtrack but today I rushed from the Loew's Lincoln Square Theater across to Tower where I scoffed up the discI've played it twice already.Don't miss this dramamusical which shows that Hollywood can still bring beautiful and timeless songs to the movie houses. And do it wonderfully.The DVD release will have I hope many extra and terrific features but even if it doesn't Delovely deserves repeated viewings.1010".

	schema:headline " Worthwhile effort makes this musical sublime";
	schema:reviewBody "I am so touched by the beautiful film we have just seen that I'm almost too overwhelmed to talk about it. The movie is 'DeLovely' about the life of Cole Porter his music and most of all about an amazing unlikely and wonderful love. I don't know how much is true and how much is given to poetic license but I don't care and I don't especially want to know. I just want to hang on to the heartfelt experience. I was not alone in my reaction to 'DeLovely.' In addition to the spontaneous applause at the end of the screening an astonishing number of people in the audience were still in their seats savoring the impact when the last of the credits rolled. 'DeLovely' is such an integrated masterpiece of moviemaking that I will only reluctantly move on to crediting the pieces that contribute to the whole. Kevin Klein delivers a superb performance playing Cole Porter from middle age into his advanced years. Ashley Judd provides an equally compelling performance as Linda Lee the woman whom Cole meets and marries early in the film. The story starts in 1920's Paris and includes scenes in Venice prior to Cole and Linda moving on to NYC and the Great White Way Hollywood and finally Massachusetts. The sets and costumes together with direction by Irwin Winkler transport the audience flawlessly to the time and places of Cole and Linda's experiences. It was interesting to note that this movie was shot in England and Italy apparently none of it was filmed in the U.S.A. at all! 'DeLovely' also achieves its spectacular success by way of the strong script from Jay Cocks. And of course there is the wonderful music of Cole Porter sung by amateurs Kline and Judd as well as an impressive multitalented array of young musical artists. You could elect to see this film in order to learn more about the life of Cole Porter. You could go in order to enjoy the songs and show presentations of Cole's music. You could also go to experience the time and places in Cole's life. However the best reason to go is because this is a wonderful if improbable love story. The story of love evolving and maturing as it is nurtured by Linda's full knowledge and acceptance of Cole's homosexual or bisexual proclivities. Yet Cole says of his many love songs that they have always been for Linda and we never doubt that it is true. In the end after their relationship and love has been tested by terrible adversity they are still there for each other with an everdeepening love and tenderness.Rated A see 'DeLovely' for the story of Cole Porter for travel to a different time and to different places for the music and mostly to experience the love story. In my opinion the movie is decidedly delovely!".

	onyx:emotionText "I am so touched by the beautiful film we have just seen that I'm almost too overwhelmed to talk about it. The movie is 'DeLovely' about the life of Cole Porter his music and most of all about an amazing unlikely and wonderful love. I don't know how much is true and how much is given to poetic license but I don't care and I don't especially want to know. I just want to hang on to the heartfelt experience. I was not alone in my reaction to 'DeLovely.' In addition to the spontaneous applause at the end of the screening an astonishing number of people in the audience were still in their seats savoring the impact when the last of the credits rolled. 'DeLovely' is such an integrated masterpiece of moviemaking that I will only reluctantly move on to crediting the pieces that contribute to the whole. Kevin Klein delivers a superb performance playing Cole Porter from middle age into his advanced years. Ashley Judd provides an equally compelling performance as Linda Lee the woman whom Cole meets and marries early in the film. The story starts in 1920's Paris and includes scenes in Venice prior to Cole and Linda moving on to NYC and the Great White Way Hollywood and finally Massachusetts. The sets and costumes together with direction by Irwin Winkler transport the audience flawlessly to the time and places of Cole and Linda's experiences.

	schema:reviewBody "As I think of the many dimensions documentaries have taken recently from the ersatz 'Fahrenheit' to the authentic 'Metallica' I am pleased to report the biopic remains whole with Irwin Winkler's 'Life as a House' 'DeLovely' the life in song about Cole Porter and his wife Linda.I say 'in song' because barely a moment in not accompanied by Porter's music so recognizable I can cite 'Night and Day' 'In the Still of the Night' 'Anything Goes' 'Let's Misbehave' and 'True Love' without research help or the least provocation. Kevin Kline plays Porter with 1920's tuxedoed charm embracing the true love of his life Linda and the many men who helped him fulfill his need to love everything. Kline's refusal to lipsynch or take singing lessons effectively evokes the voicechallenged Porter and the passionate melancholy of a composer who lived for love.The difference between this version and the 1946 Cary Grant 'Night and Day' is in the hidden homosexuality of the latter and the overt acceptance in the former. Winkler recreates the moment when Linda acknowledges accepts and romanticizes Porter's alternative life. About men she affirms 'You like them more than I do. Nothing is cruel if it fulfills your promise.' This is fine writing by Jay Cocks 'Age of Innocence' and is her love expressed on a plane only Plato could fully appreciate. Thus Linda defines a story about love as music a story attempted in 'Evita' and 'Frida' but never so well expressed as in 'DeLovely.' Although 'Frida' parallels Frida Kahlo's artful life in her paintings 'DeLovely' so arranges Porter's music as to suggest each piece was written for that moment in his life. Judd's portrayal relies on her porcelain beauty wry smile and serene wisdom in the service of an unconditional love that cost Linda in embarrassment extorted money and time away from Porter.Songs interpreted by Elvis Costello Sheryl Crow and Diana Krall among others bring the film into the present with the 'timeless' effect without compromising flawless period depiction of the Jazz Age and Tin Pan Alley. In the end this biopic helped me understand the rewarding and demanding life of Cole Porter gave me over two hours of glorious song and dance and made me see again the allure of true love that transcends sex and ego. 'DeLovely' is 'music from a farther room' as Eliot's Prufrock would have heard it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a heterosexual male under the age of 70 I normally don't like musicals but I like to keep an open mind. Typically I will only see a musical if either the movie would be just as good without the music e.g. My Fair Lady Fiddler on the Roof O Brother Where Art Thou all Marx Bros films or the music is so good that I don't care about things like acting or plot e.g. On the Town An American in Paris Pal Joey all Beatles films. Of course since I have several older female friends and relatives I've seen quite a few musicals where both the movie and the music are just awful e.g. Rose Marie Seven Brides for Seven Brothers Chicago all Andrew Lloyd Weber films.But DeLovely is the first musical I have seen where both the music and the filmmaking are so good as to be great. Of course it doesn't hurt that all the songs are written by Cole Porter Broadway's finest composer and the subject of the movie. Although the plays and movies he composed for have mostly been forgotten the songs from them remain immortal in the hearts of true musiclovers of all ages.And as far as the movie's concerned it's near perfect. It gives a sly wink to the conventions of the typical movie musical i.e. never start or end with a ballad the hero is more articulate when singing than when speaking but it does not give short shrift to things like plot acting and emotional resonance. We are treated to tremendous performances by Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd in the lead roles and sparkling dialog by Jay Cocks. The cinematography is lush and frankly astounding. And the makeup people did a tremendous job. Only when we see Porter at 90 do we think anyone has dyed their hair or is wearing prosthetics.The premise of the film has put some people off Cole Porter Kline is sitting at his piano at home preparing to die when an omniscient director Jonathan Pryce tells him he needs to get ready for the show. The show of course is the story of Porter's life strewn with Porter's songs throughout sometimes done by the characters in the film as part of their dialog and sometimes done by professional singers as straight performances.Porter himself watching the show complains that this device is too avantgarde for his taste.Actually the previous paragraph is not quite right. The show is not about Porter's entire life only the parts having to do with his wife Linda Judd. What we see is not the story of a great composer's professional ups and downs. We get some of that but that is secondary to the story of a gay man who loves his wife as much as he can and a woman who stays faithful to her husband despite knowing that he prefers having sex with anonymous men than with her.For literalminded people there will be some problems. The real Cole Porter was short ugly and couldn't sing whereas Kevin Kline is tall reasonably goodlooking and a fine singer. Also although there is no doubt that Porter is having affairs with men we never see much more than a few lustful glances. And they cut out the more risqu verses of Porter's songs. We do not hear Roosters with a doodle  a cock do it from Let's Do It or I get no kick from cocaine from I Get a Kick Out of You. And perhaps Elvis Costello and Alanis Morisette don't have the best voices to sing these songs. But these are mere quibbles compared to the movie's strengths especially as we are treated to Natalie Cole Vivian Green and Diana Krall doing superb renditions of Porter's music.DeLovely is the first musical I have seen that I really liked and where I also found myself humming along to the music. Hopefully there will be more musicals like it in the near future Ray looks promising in this regard. Phantom of the Opera does not. And maybejust maybethe genre will be once again embraced by people other than older women and gay men. 10 out of 10.".

Of the latter in fact Elvis Costello and Natalie Cole in particular came off very well. My biggest beef however was with Sheryl Crow's performance of Begin the Beguine. I haven't heard or read it commented upon so apparently it wasn't noticed that she didn't sing the melody nor did the arrangement follow the fairly complex chord structure that Cole Porter wrote. Taking liberties in jazz is one thing. It's common practice among jazz musicians to take interpretative flights far from the source material and yet still stay fairly close to the general structure and melodic line. In this travesty of a straight nonjazz performance Ms. Crow quite simply didn't sing the tune as written and the arrangement fairly clobbered the carefully structured corelation of major and minor chords altered notes leading to secondary dominants and shifts of key and melody that lead to the tune's climax and denouement. I suppose it's some sort of comment on the general unfamiliarity with popular song of the golden age of Broadway in general and Cole Porter in particular that is to blame but it seems a pity that someone somewhere along the line didn't call her on this. It's plainly and flatly wrong and she should have been told.".

I didn't have much knowledge of the man himself. To my great delight I found a CD recently called 'You're The Top A Testimonial' which is a live recording of a dinner gathering at the University of Southern California in 1967 to commemorate the opening of the Cole Porter Library. Among the guests that evening were none other than Frank Sinatra Fred Astaire Ethel Merman Alan Jay Lerner Gene Kelly and Jimmy Stewart. They talk candidly about their experiences with Porter and also sing a few of his songs. For Sinatra fans I highly recommend this CD for Frank sings several intimate tracks with just Roger Edens on piano to accompany. One can learn more about Cole Porter from this CD then the entirety of 'Delovely'.I can't understand why with the talented people involved with this film the end result is so cinematic ally clichd and dull. The screenplay's structure simply misses. First of all there's somewhat of a contradiction in Cole Porter's lyrics and the life he lead. His songs are clever intricate entertainment. His life was a whole 'nother story put together and thus to imply that every one of his songs were inherently autobiographic and profound windows into his psyche is a misuse of the music. That's why the songs as employed here are all a dissonant fusion of Porter's delicate lyrical greatness and the rough mediocrity of such contemporary voices as Alanis Morrissette and Sheryl Crow. The songs aren't allowed to beam in their true nature and are forced to carry all this mysterious exposition most of which is historically inaccurate. One example is how the movie uses the song 'True Love' to depict the seeming duality Porter had in his feelings towards Linda and his 'other life' shall we say. In actuality the song wasn't written until around 1957 when Porter in conference with Saul Chaplin the Associate Musical Director for the film 'High Society' was asked to create a song that sounded 'old fashioned'. I wish somebody would explain to me why Hollywood bothers to make these 'biopics' if they aren't really interested in the subjects. What's amazing about 'Delovely' is how Jay Cocks's screenplay manages to make Porter's life less interesting or dramatic. I imagine Porter's life was filled with so many swellagant jet set parties and countless interesting anecdotes. I was just reading one in the New York Sun involving Cole Truman Capote and an airline steward. Porter's homosexual liaisons had to be a trifle more exciting then presented here otherwise he needn't have bothered. I know this film's PG but come on Hitchcock's 'Rope' was sexier than this. Regardless what we get for the most part is a fastidious Kline at the piano in a small room full of guests sipping tea like they're all living in Arthur Sullivan's era. I'm still bewildered at how a movie about the life of Cole Porter was actually made in today's culture. I'm reminded now of the great CD from the early nineties 'Red Hot  Blue A Tribute that featured a whole mess of contemporary rock stars performing Porter's songs. What is it about Cole Porter that the entertainment industry deems so commercial or universal? Especially nowadays when movies are becoming less and less about the art or the idea and are unctuously fixated on perspective profits only. Most new releases in the past few years are that of tired action formulas and boring special effects extravaganzas involving comic book characters and trolls and hobbits and whatnot. That's why 'Delovely' was such a welcoming notion and I'm moved towards commending the film as at the very least a sincere attempt at raising the bar a little. Yet in the end is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?".

This ill conceived miscast puerile piece of garbage has very little to do with the late Mr. Porter's actual life and even less to do with his music. The movie even admits on a certain level that it's a fake by using footage from another horribly miscast biopic about Cole Porter starring Cary Grant and Alexis Smith! Another review I've read mentions that At the first night parties there seemed a disproportionately high number of black people as guests and also in other scenes. Historical documentation supports that Cole Porter's life especially while in New York was more integrated than a casual observer might think. On the contrary there were many black people who attended the late Mr. Porter's shall we say...Night Parties. Primarily Black male prostitutes whom he patronized at the Harlem brothels he frequented. A few even served as inspiration for some of his more popular songs. This subject which is a key part of Cole Porter's life is conveniently leeched out of the story.This isn't the only bone of contention I have with this movie. Much of the movie's music is taken out of context not only chronologically but also stylistically and logistically. He wrote songs for key reasons at key times. For instance the very woman who was supposed to have inspired this movie Cole Porter's wife Linda also was reported to have given the song Delovely its name. This is referenced in many notable biographies of Cole Porter.If you actually want to know about his real life and his REAL music go to the library and read for yourself about the actual person. Then start by listening to his music. Ella Fitzgerald's Cole porter songbook serves as an excellent introduction. And if you're still intrigued there are actual recordings of the late Mr. Porter playing and singing his own music. If you're reading this you've obviously got online access so do yourself a huge favor start by visiting some of the online multimedia book and music outlets and enter his name in a search. For the time investment of a few simple keystrokes and mouse clicks you'll be able to learn and truly appreciate more about Cole Porter his life his music and his genius than this blanched consumptive Kevin Kline vehicle could ever hope to provide.".

Some like Elvis Costello's effort are just able to slide in under the radar and Natalie Cole's is pretty reasonable. But somebody in charge should have stricken the songs sung by Alannis Morissete Let's Do It and the even worse Sheryl Crowe Begin the Beguine or at least replaced them with other singers in body or at least in voice. I can see how Morissete's croaky glitchy vocal stylings work for her in her own pop music but they only annoy in this context she also has no sense of the style required. Crowe's voice is actually less irritating in her number but what were they thinking otherwise? Doesn't she know the melody? Does she only have a range of 5 notes? Instead of attracting younger people to Porter's songs I expect that it will only make them ask 'why do people like this rubbish' not realizing who is really at fault.This one would be a DVD keeper for me if it were not for this glaring problem.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this movie to be turgid in the extreme. The character played by Kevin Kline Porter lacked depth movement and motivation. His wife played by Ashley Judd was simply a pastiche of every other 'wife of a famous person supporting and abandoning and supporting him again'.The setting in which the story is told simply doesn't work. There are transitions from the 'stage' to other settings  which cinematographically work well. In fact many of the filming techniques are successful and maybe it is these which save the film from having been a complete waste of time. Visually it is a good film but as for the way in which the story is told  what went wrong?The film boasts a list of well known stars including Robbie Williams Elvis Costello Keith Allen James Wilby and Peter Polycarpou who appear in the musical numbers as singers. The songs are well staged well orchestrated and sometimes very appealing. However even with these big guns the musical fails to be cohesive and indeed coherent. Please do check the full list of the cast  you'll be surprised at just who is in this movie.Ultimately a depressing film the songs of Cole Porter really are not well suited to being made into a biographical movie. They are to my mind uninspired forgettable and dull. To be sure some of Cole Porter's musicals were and remain huge hits  Kiss Me Kate being I think the prime example. But taken out of context the songs seemed unconnected with the narrative.Kevin Kline appeared to make every effort to look like Robin Williams throughout and succeeded. Ashley Judd made every effort to be a convincing wife... and failed. Oh her performance was heartfelt but Judd seems to be another of those actors who no matter what part they play are always identifiably the same. Jonathan Pryce was clearly miscast laying on a thick American accent which simply doesn't convince. As Fagin he may be a wonder but as this character ... no.Generally then 128 minutes of DVD movie to be avoided I think. If you want a biographical film which is sad rather than depressing but tells a great story  look for 'Shadowlands' C.S.Lewis's life and times.".

The songs are well staged well orchestrated and sometimes very appealing. However even with these big guns the musical fails to be cohesive and indeed coherent. Please do check the full list of the cast  you'll be surprised at just who is in this movie.Ultimately a depressing film the songs of Cole Porter really are not well suited to being made into a biographical movie. They are to my mind uninspired forgettable and dull. To be sure some of Cole Porter's musicals were and remain huge hits  Kiss Me Kate being I think the prime example. But taken out of context the songs seemed unconnected with the narrative.Kevin Kline appeared to make every effort to look like Robin Williams throughout and succeeded. Ashley Judd made every effort to be a convincing wife... and failed. Oh her performance was heartfelt but Judd seems to be another of those actors who no matter what part they play are always identifiably the same. Jonathan Pryce was clearly miscast laying on a thick American accent which simply doesn't convince. As Fagin he may be a wonder but as this character ... no.Generally then 128 minutes of DVD movie to be avoided I think. If you want a biographical film which is sad rather than depressing but tells a great story  look for 'Shadowlands' C.S.Lewis's life and times.";

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein in the form of corrections.Unlike most of the commentators here I knew a lot about Porter before seeing the movie maybe too much. Back in the '70s I was a radio station program director and wrote a series of Musicographies about various American theater composers and the first 3hour show was about Cole Porter. In 1993 I wrote a book titled Broadway's PrizeWinning Musicals for Haworth Press. There was a time when I knew more about musicals than any straight man should admit to. Consequently I went into the movie DeLovely hoping for accuracy. On that level it was very disappointing. Or to paraphrase a song it was oh so easy to hate.If I wanted to be facile I'd simply say DeLovely isn't.Mistake Number One Letting Kevin Kline sing too much. While he does sing better than Porter himself who is heard warbling You're the Top as the closing credits roll that's no excuse for letting Kline go on and on and on. Mistake Number Two Of the more than one thousand songs Porter wrote only a relative handful were used and those were mostly covered up by dialogue or cut short even the title number had a lot of talking over it. This happened so often that I wanted to scream at the director and writer It's about the lyrics! It's about the melodies! Let's hear them!While the scene using Night and Day was very effective it was also nonsense. A young actor is on stage during rehearsal and can't grasp the intricate melody. A voice is heard telling Porter I told you to give it to Astaire. In fact Astaire did indeed sing the song on stage in The Gay Divorce. So who was this person on stage?! In any case Porter hops on stage and leads him through it and the camera pans over them and the stagehands and when it gets back to the audience it's opening night and we're hearing the actor in performance the scene was smoothly and beautifully filmed even if totally absurd.Mistake Number Three Allowing Sheryl Crow to butcher Begin the Beguine. What she did to that glorious melody should be a criminal offense punishable by jail time in a maximum security lockdown unit for the rhythmically challenged. Or make her Martha Stewart's cellmate. Lance Armstrong might have sung it better maybe with Crow on his handlebars ala P. Newman and K. Ross.Mistake Number Four Putting the songs in lessthanaccurate order. It's disconcerting to hear songs written in the 1950s for example sung in the 1930s or '40s and so on. OK like others Porter sometimes dug into his trunk of old songs to revive them later Well Did You Evah? is the prime example of that here one of his society songs stuck into High Society much later but not as often as this film would indicate to those who know the approximate order of the songs.Mistake Number Five Having Porter write I Love You for an unnamed Hollywood film to please L. B. Mayer whose advice to Cole is Write funny funny not clever funny reminding me of the emperor in Amadeus who told Wolfgang his piece had too many notes. And then having an actor playing Nelson Eddy sing the song in a Mountie uniform at the end of this unnamed movie! Eddy only made one film with Porter's music Rosalie in 1938 while I Love You was part of the score of the Broadway musical Mexican Hayride in 1944 where it was sung by Wilbur Evans. I don't think it was ever used in a movie. If Eddy ever sang it it was at home in the shower. Though composing it as a bet with Monty Wooley was accurate.Mistake Number Six Leaving out the following songsI Get a Kick Out of You C'est Magnifique You Do Something to Me Too Darn Hot Brush Up Your Shakespeare Make It Another OldFashioned Please Most Gentlemen Don't Like Love Down in the Depths Don't Fence Me In Take Me Back to Manhattan Always True to You In My Fashion Now You Has Jazz Stereophonic Sound All of You Cherry Pies Ought To Be You a personal favorite and My Heart Belongs to Daddy. Surely if they could find a Merman imposter to sing Anything Goes and You're the Top couldn't they find a Mary Martin lookalike to sing and strip to My Heart Belongs to Daddy?! That was a Golden Moment in Broadway history young Martin peeling off her clothes from under a mink coat!Mistake Number Seven They got Porter's riding accident wrong having him out riding alone when the horse fell on him. In actuality he was with friends. And if memory serves it was his mother not Linda who refused to let the doctors amputate his legs.For that matter where was Porter's mother in this reviewrevue of his life? She was a major force in his life but nowhere in the movie.All in all parts of the film were better than the whole which was a greatlooking flop. And it had such potential! Nearly every time a good foottapping number starts and you get into it it stops dead or gets covered by dialogue perhaps trying to appease the shortattention spans of modern MTV viewers which they needn't have worried about as there were no MTV watchers in my audience at 57 I may have been the youngest person there. Forget the soundtrack. Buy Ella Fitzgerald's Cole Porter Songbook or find the 1974 original London cast album of Cole which manages to include more songs and biographical detail.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the most disappointing movies of 2004. The two main things wrong with this movie are as follows the screenplay is NOT true to Cole Porter's life story and some of the vocal and musical performances are truly terrible.Cole Porter was homosexual. Yes we are aware that for a huge bulk of his adult life he was married. To a woman. The film DeLovely attempts to make out the married life of Cole and Linda Lee Porter as if this were some classic Hollywood love story. The whole POINT of their marriage was that it was a platonic marriage of convenience. Linda Lee had escaped and divorced her physically abusive husband which was major scandal territory in the 1910's and married Cole with the sole intention of escaping her murderous and physically violent exspouse. Linda Lee was nine years OLDER than Cole. In the film Ashley Judd appears to be at least thirty years YOUNGER than Kevin Kline and the entire film makes out their marriage to be some neverending romance in the fading sunset. This WASN'T the case! This wasn't the true story! DeLovely makes Cole Porter out to be bisexual which he wasn't. Linda Lee in real life was probably fully aware of her second husband's sexual extramarital entourages and in real life she probably couldn't have cared less. In the 1910's and 1920's this marriage of convenience meant a new life to Linda Lee and that was the extent of it.Apart from Natalie Cole and Robbie Williams the majority of the musical performances are dreadful. Natalie Cole sings a lovely rendition of Every Time We Say Goodbye and Robbie Williams likewise sings a fine noteworthy performance of the title song DeLovely but the rest of the singers are anywhere from barely tolerable to truly dreadful.My advice is  check the soundtrack out from the public library. This flick is for diehard Kevin Kline fans only.".

He doesn't have a great singing voice but he has phrasing and personality and he knows what the song needs how to put the witty lyric across. None of the currentday performers heard in the movie are as successful with their assignments although Natalie Cole doesn't completely disgrace herself..Fortunately for those who would like to hear performers who can really do this stuff there are a number of movies with really good performers singing these songs the way they were meant to be. There's the wonderful Begin the Beguine number in Broadway Melody of 1940 with Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell dancing to it or any other movie where Fred Astaire has a Cole Porter song. There's High Society where Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra sing What a Swell Party This Is and there's just everything in Kiss Me Kate. I had the good fortune to see this last movie in the 3D version at the Charles Theatre in Baltimore and it was a treat for the ear and the eye that can only be hinted at in the little selection they used in DeLovely'.The only real reason to do a revised biopic since the original had Cary Grant is to illuminate the relationship between Cole Porter and his wife but I felt the movie failed to do that.

It follows Porter's rise from playing at parties to producing Broadway blockbusters and Hollywood soundtracks whilst his wife has to contend with his lifestyle.The film stars Kevin Kline as Cole Porter  perfect casting and should hopefully sometime do a musical  play in London before too long  and Ashley Judd as Lynda Lee Porter  wonderful  elegant and has a good singing voice as well.The film also stars Jonathan Pryce John Barrowman Keith Allen Kevin McNally as well as cameo's by Robbie Williams Elvis Costello Diana Krall Alanis Morrisette and many others all singing Porter's songs.I thought the film was wonderfully tender and a love story about two people who accepted each others wants outside of their marriage and whom were devoted to one another.Added to this some stunning renditions of numbers from Anything Goes Kiss Me Kate Night and Day and many others.The two hours plus flew by and I'd recommend taking some tissues.I'd recommend this film to anyone who likes love stories the music of Cole Porter and want a film which doesn't involve car chases gratuitous swearing and nudity.PS I really like Moulin Rouge saw it twice and went to the UK Premiere".
