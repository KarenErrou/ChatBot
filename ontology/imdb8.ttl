	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. The nature of class war was always going to be a subject worthy of poking fun at but this TV series exploits it better than most. The chemistry between Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy was always electrifying and the writers wrote almost entirely flawless episodes every time. In my opinion it is the best British sitcom of the mid to late1970s surpassing the likes of RISING DAMP ROBIN'S NEST ARE YOU BEING SERVED? and so on. With the ON THE BUSES series having finished a few years earlier GEORGE AND MILDRED became the next pride and joy of ITV or ITV 1 as it's now known enjoying a fouryear run on the channel.The movie however is absolutely terrible in almost every respect. The general essence of the TV series has almost entirely been stripped by the writers of this abysmal movie who anyone will immediately notice are not the same ones who worked on the series. As one commenter has already pointed out Mildred lacks the sharpness she had on the TV series and does not come across as anywhere near as overbearing.The plot instead of focusing on the class war with the Fourmiles that was the very foundation of the TV series actually writes out the Fourmiles almost entirely after the first halfhour. The plot if you can call it that consists of George and Mildred going on holiday to some hotel and getting mixed up with gangsters. First rate talent in the form of Stratford Johns Kenneth Cope David Barry and Sue Bond are all wasted here. Most of these are well past their heyday and all of them look very embarrassed as if they very well know that the only thing worth hanging around for is a paycheck which probably won't be much.The jokes and gags in the movie if you can call them that rely heavily upon traditional British farce including mistaken identities embarrassing situations poorlytimed slapstick characters losing control of what is happening to them and general confusion. And it all fails miserably. As another commenter has pointed out it seems as though the writers of this movie have never seen an episode of the TV series and instead crafted out a something resembling a CARRY ON romp. The scene where George is stripped down by Sue Bond's character is particularly out of context.A mystery surrounding this movie is the BBFC certification provided  15. Just why is it rated 15 when all there is to see is harmless nonvulgar entertainment?Not surprisingly the era of sitcom spinof came to an end not long after this movie was released shortly after the sad death of Yootha Joyce. And the company behind this movie Hammer well known for producing first rate horror movies back in the 1950s to mid 1970s soon disappeared into total obscurity.All in all the movie is a near total washout. My advice  skip this and stick to the TV series. You won't be missing anything I assure you.".

It's just a shame that the Fourmiles the snobbish next door neighbours are reduced to minor roles and the car chase scene at the end is poor and predictable and some of the jokes are too obvious. Also could a socially inept and not very intelligent middle aged man really pass for a contract killer and would a top gangster be taken in by this.Yet when the alternatives are football and property shows and Murder She Wrote George and Mildred is passable and I always seem to end up watching it with such dire alternatives on the other channels. My advice would be if you expect it to be as funny as the television show you'll be disappointed as I was when I first saw it in the eighties but if you want an amiable way to pass the time on a wet Easter Monday the film is watchable".

A whole plethora of bitpart British actors of the period gives a slight pleasure since the viewers can entertain themselves with the What's his name? I recognise the face. Wasn't he in? game. Otherwise this is a painful experience. The script is dreadful even by spin off standards. Everything here is lazy and more importantly unfunny. Typical scene A hitman runs up a flight of stairs to kill George and out of breath he talks to Mildred about his children then takes the lift down only to run up again spots George by chance but then not kill him. Its a drawn out and embarrassingly bad sequence and not remotely amusing. In the end the villains chase George and Mildred in their car. We are told repeatedly they are going down a dead end. However the road unlike the script is not a dead end. After the villains have a cheaply shot and unfunny crash the Ropers end up on an airfield which seems to be created merely so George can elicit the hilarious line He's flying a bit low.".

I counted at least four people shot to death by Kenneth Cope which sat uncomfortably with me for a film of this genre.Roper and Joyce are perfectly fine in their respective roles and although it's an awkward marriage at times they have wonderful chemistry.So it's a comedy of mistaken identity much like 'Blame It On The Bellboy' and it's as British as meat and two veg.We have pratfalls amorous blondes threatening bikers with Love and Hate tattoos car chases and your token Spanish stereotype.It's pretty funny in a 'you won't laugh' sense and it's quite sad that the last image in the film is the late Yootha Joyce breaking the fourth wall and winking at the audience....".

	schema:headline " George  Mildred's Final Frolic!";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1980 'George  Mildred' went down the same route as its predecessor 'Man About The House' and became a feature film. The original cast were retained Peter Frazer Jones  who had worked on the series  has stepped on board again as director whereas Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke relinquished their roles as scriptwriters and instead entrusted Dick Sharples  creator of the Thora Hird sitcom 'In Loving Memory'  with their duties. The film is generally despised by 'George  Mildred' fans largely due to the fact that Yootha Joyce was ill during filming  and it showed  and sadly died not long after the film went on release. Well I may be in a minority here but I liked it better than the series itself in fact. At least the jokes used here were not ones already used in the series.It begins like this  Mildred is keen to ascertain whether or not her husband George has remembered their wedding anniversary. Needless to say he hasn't. By the time he comes to remember he books a table at the restaurant where he first proposed to Mildred but to his horror he discovers on arrival that it has been turned into a greasy spoon caf run by Hell's Angels style bikers.Later at Mildred's insistence George then books a weekend for two at a swanky hotel. No sooner have they arrived than George is approached by vicious gangster Harry Pinto  who believes that George is a hitman  who instructs him to murder a rival crook.I think by now you can see where this is going. Yes it is contrived and yes it is impossible to watch the film without cringing occasionally but somehow it still manages to be endearing. Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy were as marvellous as ever particularly the former despite her ill health. The Fourmiles played by Norman Eshley Sheila Fearn and Nicholas Bond Owen aren't used terribly much here sadly though Stratford 'Dixon Of Dock Green' Johns makes up for it. The film ends with George and Mildred returning home having somehow managed to evade Pinto and his angry mob  as well as Pinto's rivals  talking affectionately of their weekend away before heading upstairs to bed. A caption  ''The End or is it the beginning?'' appears on screen prior to the credits hinting that another series was on the cards however this plan collapsed when Joyce died from liver failure just four days after her 53rd birthday.Les Reed supplied a lively theme tune for the film a great improvement over Roger Webb's dreary theme used for the series. Kenneth Cope Sue Bond Dudley Sutton and Michael Angelis all appear in supporting roles.Earth shattering? Hardly but it is nowhere near as bad as many make it out to be. It makes for simple unassuming entertainment best enjoyed with a cup of cocoa. Funniest moment  One of the bikers at the cafe makes a pass at Mildred so George in anger asks him outside for a fight. As the man is twice the size of George Mildred covers her eyes at the thought of George getting beaten up. However moments later the man reenters the cafe with his clothes in tatters as though George has given him a good hiding. Mildred is not stupid however. She soon susses out that George has paid him to feign being beaten up.Second funniest moment  George getting suspicious about Mildred's behaviour towards him so he wonders if she has been gossiping about him to Anne. He asks Jeffrey ''Has your missus said anything about me?''. ''We don't discuss you it encourages Tristram to pick up bad language!'' replies Jeffrey.".

I was never a Natalie Wood fan so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb in what is arguably her best role. Everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful.

Mildler overacts the second half of the film dreadfully. Roz Russell correctly built her emotional level to peak at the finale Rose's Turn and in so doing she has wonderful depth of character.True Midler sings better than Russell but with less emotion.Peter Reigert is in fine form as Herbie and plays it with more energy than Maldenhowever lacking Malden's depth of character. in the 1962 filmCynthia Gibb is a charming Louise and a Gutsy Gypsy. Other high points are Ed Asner's cameo as Pop and the show stopping you gotta get a gimmick song lead by Christine Ebersole. Its a good film that would have benifited from a different leading lady or one that could take direction?.".

Roz Russell correctly built her emotional level to peak at the finale Rose's Turn and in so doing she has wonderful depth of character.True Midler sings better than Russell but with less emotion.Peter Reigert is in fine form as Herbie and plays it with more energy than Maldenhowever lacking Malden's depth of character. in the 1962 filmCynthia Gibb is a charming Louise and a Gutsy Gypsy. Other high points are Ed Asner's cameo as Pop and the show stopping you gotta get a gimmick song lead by Christine Ebersole. Its a good film that would have benifited from a different leading lady or one that could take direction?.";

The spirit is droll and sincere and the story has so much heart to it. The music is wonderful and the lyrics positively delight. The production values are kitsch bright and colourful. While I prefer Malden and Wood in their respective roles in the 1962 film Peter Reigertthough his singing leaves a lot to be desired and Cynthia Gibb are truly charming and entertaining and Christine Ebersole steals all her scenes. If there are any preferences I have at all over the 1962 film it is the staging and choreography which is less clunky and moves more effortlessly and Bette Midler's singing Russell's was raspy and offkey sometimes whereas Midler's is big and brassy. Midler is just superb as Mama Rose although Russell was superb also Midler's Mama Rose is truer to what Mama Rose should be like. Overall a fine Gypsy. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite stellar orchestrations and a more faithful screenplay to the original Broadway production this version of Gypsy suffers from a notsosolid leading lady and a super cheap dull production. On paper Bette Midler seems ideal. She's loud brassy fun can sing like an angel and is a pretty great actress. Well I don't know what went wrong but Midler is terribly uneven. Don't get me wrong she has her moments the quieter scenes between Rose and Herbie the songs small World You'll Never Get Away From Me and Small World reprise etc. but all in all she butchers her two biggest numbers Everything's Coming Up Roses and Rose's Turn by over telegraphing and hamming them up. During the film's finale it's actually pretty embarrassing to see such a talented actress deliver such a wonderfully written monologue in such a one note and goofy fashion. She reads more like a cartoon than a human being. Is it Bette's fault or the directors? Apparently the director was dying during production and wasn't able to be as present as he'd hoped so that left Bette to essentially direct herself which is never a good idea given the heft of her role. This leaves us with one hell of a strange over the top and campy performance that isn't even enjoyable on a so bad it's good level. Without a solid Madame Rose to lead the cast poor Peter Reigert and Cynthia Gibb have very little to play off of. They both have their moments as well but they can only do so much without a strong Rose to back them up. The production values are cheap and tacky not to mention overly colorful for a tale about parental neglect and lost dreams. It's just a huge missed opportunity. The sets and furnishing would have probably been more at home in a Tim Burton movie than a fairly realistic musical. One wishes the marvelous Tyne Daly had been able to recreate her brilliant performance in this TV version. While not possessing the strongest voice she gave Rose more pathos than anyone else I've ever seen. It's not all bad though. The orchestrations are lovely and brassy and the screenplay is much more faithful to the stage version than the equally disappointing 1962 movie version starring Rosalind Russell and Natalie Wood. Worth a look for more forgiving Bette Midler fans.".

I have heard every recording of Gypsy from Merman Lansbury Tyne Daly Bernadette Peters Patti LuPone and two movie soundtracks with Rosalind RussellLisa Kirk and this version featuring the phenomenal Bette Midler. When this first aired in 1993 I was working as a v.j. at a gay bar in West Hollywood and was told to play this in a small portion of the bar which got instant boo's from the crowd. Needless to say within five minutes it was back on in the entire bar.More than 20 years have gone by and in comparing this to the 50 year old Rosalind Russell movie I have to say that this version outshines it. Bette is much more believable as the mother of youngsters teenagers and eventually a young lady and her devotion to her children is more believable than some of the older women who have played this part. Singing wonderfully with the dramatic flair that only Bette can she truly is coming up Roses.Supported by a sweet Peter Riegert as the longsuffering Herbie and Cindy Gibbb as the initially shy Louise who ends up becoming the legendary Gypsy Rose Lee. Familiar stage film and T.V. stars appear in bit parts giving this T.V. version a friendly appeal. Even without saying a word Michael Jeter's expressions say it all. Funny lady Andrea Martin adds flair in a bit as a secretary while Christine Ebersole is a great headliner of the three strippers. All those bits include five Tony wins not to mention Bette soon to attack Dolly Levi. But any version of this classic musical is going to be judged by how the perfect score is performed and it is without a doubt flawless. Colorful and perfect in period detail this helped bring the T.V. musical back. Not live like recent entries it is an amazing feat. Movie musicals have made a slight comeback on the big screen but it took the step that the producers of this T.V. special did to speed that up.

Yet all she was able to produce was a cute funny glitzy trademark Bette Midler...weighed down with all the familiar Midlerisms.  Roz Russell has nothing to worry about. She can rest in her grave knowing she is still the definitive Mama Rose of film anyway.I thought Midler was really going to put it across this time...to throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time...like she did in The Rose.  But no she played it safe.  She played herself. She made Rose a total dinnertheatre cartoon.  Even her songs were uninspired. It was maddening to watch knowing Midler has the talent to rise above her moneymaking schtick.  She showed promise only once in this Gypsy and that was with Rose's Turn.  But by then it was too little too late.A sincere Cynthia Gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of Gypsy outshines that of Rose you know there's trouble in River City.A huge huge letdown.".

It didn't have an ounce of believability anywhere.  And when you don't have a Rose you don't have a show.Bette Midler seemed born to play this part.  Yet all she was able to produce was a cute funny glitzy trademark Bette Midler...weighed down with all the familiar Midlerisms.  Roz Russell has nothing to worry about. She can rest in her grave knowing she is still the definitive Mama Rose of film anyway.I thought Midler was really going to put it across this time...to throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time...like she did in The Rose.  But no she played it safe.  She played herself. She made Rose a total dinnertheatre cartoon.  Even her songs were uninspired. It was maddening to watch knowing Midler has the talent to rise above her moneymaking schtick.  She showed promise only once in this Gypsy and that was with Rose's Turn.  But by then it was too little too late.A sincere Cynthia Gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of Gypsy outshines that of Rose you know there's trouble in River City.A huge huge letdown.";

	schema:headline " If you liked Identity this should be right up your street...";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a self confessed slasher addict means that it's very rare that I get the chance to review many bigger budgeted movies with creditable casts. Aside from James Mangold's successful box office draw Identity there have not been any big name entries since the Scream trilogy once again put Wes Craven's name back on the Hollywood map. That's why Mark Malone's The Last Stop  a mystery thriller with blatant slasher overtones instantly intrigued me. With a decent lineup including Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow and an intriguing soundtrack that even finds space for Lynn Anderson's Rose Garden I must admit that the initial signs were very positive for this claustrophobic feature. To the best of my knowledge there have only ever been three other snowbound slashers unless of course you consider Demon Possessed to fit in the category. The first slice and dice on the ice was the bonedry Satan's Blade then came the Lisa Loring cheesefeast that was Blizzard of Blood and the enjoyable Shredder followed some fourteen years later.During an extreme blizzard state trooper Jason Adam Beach battles through the snow to reach a remote lodge in the Colorado Mountains. His task is to inform the guests that the road is closed and they must stay for at least one more night until a path can be cleared through the hazardous conditions. This news doesn't go down to well with the suspicious bunch which includes two troublemaking brothers Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming a truck driver that really doesn't want to hang around William S. Taylor a randy couple of lovers Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson and Jason's exgirlfriend Nancy Rose McGowan. The motel owners Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson aren't overjoyed by the news either but they offer rooms to the stranded guests and attempt to calm the tense situation. Things take a turn for the worse when Jason finds a mutilated body and a bag full of stolen cash lying in the snow behind the cafe. Just like a chapter out of an Agatha Christie mystery the lodgers begin dieing at the hands of a masked assailant that seems intent to reclaim the money. With so many dodgy characters to choose from and no way of leaving the crime scene Jason has to attempt to stop the maniac before he kills again A good mystery needs at least a handful of shady suspects who each have a credible motive a remote location that no one can escape from and a smart protagonist to help unravel the clues. Fortunately The Last Stop provides each of those essential ingredients in a thriller that has its equal moments of brilliance and downright stupidity. The film kicks off superbly as the dubious personalities clash in a claustrophobic environment that manages to keep the tension running high throughout the runtime. Malone keeps the interest levels raised as each character unveils their own reasons to attract some of the suspicion and to be fair the essential twist isn't one that you'll guess easily. In fact I found myself watching the movie through once again to see if I could pick up on any hints that I missed first time around. Unfortunately when the maniac is revealed to be an over the top psycho that wisecracks like a comic book bad guy The Last Stop forfeits a huge amount of credibility. Thankfully all is not lost when an unexpected and brilliantly orchestrated plot twist salvages the film's finale.Similarities can be drawn with the excellent Identity as the two plots are almost interchangeable. James Mangold's effort has to be the better of the two mainly because of the star billing of John Cusack and the everreliable Ray Liotta. With that said though Adam Beach does a good enough job in the lead while Jurgen Prochnow Amy Adamson and the brilliant Callum Keith Rennie add some credible support. Rose McGowan acts as conceitedly in this role as she probably does from day to day in reality and Winston Rekert started fantastically before going completely overboard with the film's climax. If you're a diehard slasher fan that's watching this for some bloody killings then you're going to be disappointed. The balaclavawearing psychopath only pops up once and the rest of the murders are committed offscreen. But as I said earlier Malone's directorial talent means that the suspense is never too far off the boil and you can forgive the few flaws because the positives just about triumph.The Last Stop is well worth a look for slasher addicts and movie fans alike. Yes there are a handful of negatives but overall this is a solid example of emerging Hollywood talents. If you liked Identity then certainly give this a try".

With a decent lineup including Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow and an intriguing soundtrack that even finds space for Lynn Anderson's Rose Garden I must admit that the initial signs were very positive for this claustrophobic feature. To the best of my knowledge there have only ever been three other snowbound slashers unless of course you consider Demon Possessed to fit in the category. The first slice and dice on the ice was the bonedry Satan's Blade then came the Lisa Loring cheesefeast that was Blizzard of Blood and the enjoyable Shredder followed some fourteen years later.During an extreme blizzard state trooper Jason Adam Beach battles through the snow to reach a remote lodge in the Colorado Mountains. His task is to inform the guests that the road is closed and they must stay for at least one more night until a path can be cleared through the hazardous conditions. This news doesn't go down to well with the suspicious bunch which includes two troublemaking brothers Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming a truck driver that really doesn't want to hang around William S. Taylor a randy couple of lovers Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson and Jason's exgirlfriend Nancy Rose McGowan. The motel owners Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson aren't overjoyed by the news either but they offer rooms to the stranded guests and attempt to calm the tense situation. Things take a turn for the worse when Jason finds a mutilated body and a bag full of stolen cash lying in the snow behind the cafe. Just like a chapter out of an Agatha Christie mystery the lodgers begin dieing at the hands of a masked assailant that seems intent to reclaim the money. With so many dodgy characters to choose from and no way of leaving the crime scene Jason has to attempt to stop the maniac before he kills again A good mystery needs at least a handful of shady suspects who each have a credible motive a remote location that no one can escape from and a smart protagonist to help unravel the clues. Fortunately The Last Stop provides each of those essential ingredients in a thriller that has its equal moments of brilliance and downright stupidity. The film kicks off superbly as the dubious personalities clash in a claustrophobic environment that manages to keep the tension running high throughout the runtime. Malone keeps the interest levels raised as each character unveils their own reasons to attract some of the suspicion and to be fair the essential twist isn't one that you'll guess easily. In fact I found myself watching the movie through once again to see if I could pick up on any hints that I missed first time around. Unfortunately when the maniac is revealed to be an over the top psycho that wisecracks like a comic book bad guy The Last Stop forfeits a huge amount of credibility. Thankfully all is not lost when an unexpected and brilliantly orchestrated plot twist salvages the film's finale.Similarities can be drawn with the excellent Identity as the two plots are almost interchangeable. James Mangold's effort has to be the better of the two mainly because of the star billing of John Cusack and the everreliable Ray Liotta. With that said though Adam Beach does a good enough job in the lead while Jurgen Prochnow Amy Adamson and the brilliant Callum Keith Rennie add some credible support. Rose McGowan acts as conceitedly in this role as she probably does from day to day in reality and Winston Rekert started fantastically before going completely overboard with the film's climax. If you're a diehard slasher fan that's watching this for some bloody killings then you're going to be disappointed. The balaclavawearing psychopath only pops up once and the rest of the murders are committed offscreen. But as I said earlier Malone's directorial talent means that the suspense is never too far off the boil and you can forgive the few flaws because the positives just about triumph.The Last Stop is well worth a look for slasher addicts and movie fans alike. Yes there are a handful of negatives but overall this is a solid example of emerging Hollywood talents. If you liked Identity then certainly give this a try";

So when I found out that Rose McGowan was doing a Ten Little Indians type of movie I knew that I was in for a treat. Rose McGowan was the biggest name actoractress at the entire festival.The best way I can describe it without giving away too much of the plot is that it's not quite like Scream. And it certainly is worth seeing. It's set in the middle of a snowstorm it was filmed in Vancouver B.C. Canada at a mountaintop motel which adds to the suspense. Rose McGowan puts in a great performance as thegirlnextdoor?! along with the rest of the cast. And as for what happens at the end well the only thing I'll say is that you'll never guess the ending.Sadly it probably won't make it into mainstream North American theatres because the only decent money maker in it is Rose McGowan. But if you get the chance to see it I would recommend you do. And if worse comes to worst there's always video.I gave it a 9 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Splendid Columbo episode with a razorsharp script and lively performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Alex Benedict John Cassavetes is an orchestra conductor having an secret affair with his pianist. When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he doesn't leave his wife he sees he has no choice but to murder her and make it look as if she had committed suicide. Too bad for him our rumpled detective Lt. Columbo Peter Falk is on the case.Stephen Bochco has written another razorsharp episode for the series following marvelous detail with marvelous detail. We watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twentyfive minutes and we're completely engrossed. Then when Columbo appears on the scene it gets even better.We first see Columbo after the murder as per usual. This time he's at the vet with his new dog. Scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest ones in the show think Columbo's discomfort over the nude model in Suitable for Framing. Columbo is hilarious when he's dithering or bumbling deliberately in order to trip up his quarry but too many writers make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he's with nonsuspects. Bochco by contrast shows Columbo a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of lowkey scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story. And I'm grateful he didn't strain for a punchline to Columbo's quest to give the dog a name. As far as we learn the dog remains nameless. Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode and Peter Falk makes the most of them. He's particularly good in a monologue where he expresses disbelief that anyone could kill herself much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist. And he's even better in his scenes playing catandmouse with Cassavetes. That these two longtime friends and collaborators would play off each other brilliantly is to be expected and that's what we get. Notice how Alex Benedict can't help but admire the deceptively dimwitted Columbo even as the brilliant detective is tightening the noose around his neck.Bochco makes the most of every situation in his script. When Columbo goes to question Benedict's snooty mechanic of course  of course!  he asks the man to look at his own beatup heap. And when Benedict finds Columbo at the Hollywood Bowl before rehearsal of course  of course!  he's on the piano playing Chopsticks. And what should our audacious lieutenant bring with him but the victim's typewriter with the phony suicide note still in the roller.Columbo also has good scenes with a precocious little girl Dawn Frame and the lovely Blythe Danner who plays Cassavetes's wife. It's nice to see Myrna Loy show up as Danner's mother though she does little with her minor role.The director Nicholas Colasanto who also acted most notably as Coach in Cheers does a perfectly creditable job though he follows the lead of nearly every other Columbo director by adding one or two silly flourishes. Scenes end by going out of focus and begin by coming into focus. Then there's that bit where Cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped at the scene of the crime  and we see a zoomin shot of it reflected in his sunglasses. There's also one scene with Myrna Loy and group of old fogies that is atrociously performed by everyone except Cassavetes.These are quibbles though. This is a splendidly entertaining episode the kind that made me a Columbo fan.".

I agree it is not noteperfect the scene with Myrna Loy and the fogies is very badly played and one or two of the clues were a little too obvious too early especially the carnation at the scene of the crimewhich the mystery revolves around and while I loved the chemistry between Columbo and Benedict I personally would've liked more mind games between the two perhaps.However when it comes to the production values Etude in Black is one of the most visually beautiful and interesting of the Columbo episodes with skilled camera shots and lighting. The music is a sheer delight and part of the reason why this episode holds a special place in my heart. The premise is a clever one and the story is very well constructed with some fun scenes. Here Columbo is delightful he does get increasingly irritating throughout Etude in Black but deliberately so. There is also a razorsharp script satisfying chemistry between Columbo and Benedict and good direction.The acting on the whole is great. Peter Falk is exceptional once again particularly in the monologue which cleverly expresses Columbo's disbelief at how anybody would kill themselves. I also liked the scenes with his new dog which thankfully were appropriately awkwardfitting Columbo's character and lowkey. Blythe Danner is divine as Janice she looks lovely and acts very convincingly Myrna Loy has a smaller role and is merely okay. John Cassevetes however is brilliant very sexy and deliciously stonecold as well. His way of conducting is the only part of his performance that rings falsenot only was it an odd way of conducting but some of it was out of time as well but his voice mannerisms interaction with Columbo and delivery more than compensated he is both dark and wacky in the ending which wraps things up well.All in all a fine episode and while not perfect it is a personal favourite. 8.510 Bethany Cox".

He has a mistress on the side Anjanette Comer a prominent pianist but she announces she wants more. She's sick of being back street. On the night of their concert he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide. Columbo picks up a few problems immediately. One thing he notices You have a beautiful woman here  bedroom eyes  she has money a body and a career. Where's the man? It's wonderful to see Falk and good friend Cassavetes together.

First of all a conductor who merely produces these pedestrian performances of the most basic examples of the repertoire Eine Kleine Nachtmusik Strauss Waltzes Beethoven... is never going to have a house like that or fame like that or cars like that much less be called a genius. And the conducting that the actor does is so bad as to be laughable. No orchestra would take him seriously. There are several little things too such as his rehearsal of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik why rehearse it when they've just performed it for TV? Any orchestral musician would be able to play it in his or her sleep anyway.... His instructions to the ensemble are downright nonsensical and when Columbo asks Blythe Danner what 'quasi fantasia' means she says it's 'Latin'. It's Italian as are the vast majority of musical instructions. And finally no two great musicians would EVER have the following interchange Play something. What should I play? Chopin. Music is their job and passion they know it well. Something far more specific would be asked for and offered! I know. I should get out more...".

	schema:reviewBody "Given the friendship between Falk and Cassavetes I'm a little disappointed that some of the interplay between them is less entertaining than it could be at times especially during the scene where Columbo asks Benedict how much he pays in taxes how much his house his worth etc. which seems totally irrelevant and is just plain boring except for one amusing line Benedict Can I ask YOU a personal question? after Columbo has been interrogating him about his assets as is the scene where the dog is having an injection where Columbo speaks ridiculously fast for no apparent reason. Why does Columbo ask Benedict for his autograph? That left me expecting the murderer's handwriting to become a crucial clue but it never does so I'm baffled as to why Columbo makes that visit to the killer's home at all.The character of Jenifer Welles interesting spelling of the first name seems so clingy manipulative and irritating that I found myself almost willing Benedict to kill her off. This is the second episode where the victim is killed while playing a piano the first being the far superior Suitable for Framing. The moment when the carnation becomes visible in the conductor's sunglasses is slightly surreal and wholly unnecessary.The upstart Audrey she used to tell me how to handle men reminds me of the boy genius in Mind Over Mayhem. Why is it that when Columbo meets children they seem to be even smarter than he is? Is the fact that Columbo never comes up with a name for the dog supposed to mirror his own lack of a first name? How prophetic that one of the ideas he comes up with is Beethoven 20 years before the film of the same name came out.There are two major flaws for me in this episode. First Columbo doesn't actually see Benedict pick up the carnation from the floor in Welles' house. He only turns round when Benedict is holding it and about to put it back on.

	onyx:emotionText "Given the friendship between Falk and Cassavetes I'm a little disappointed that some of the interplay between them is less entertaining than it could be at times especially during the scene where Columbo asks Benedict how much he pays in taxes how much his house his worth etc. which seems totally irrelevant and is just plain boring except for one amusing line Benedict Can I ask YOU a personal question? after Columbo has been interrogating him about his assets as is the scene where the dog is having an injection where Columbo speaks ridiculously fast for no apparent reason. Why does Columbo ask Benedict for his autograph? That left me expecting the murderer's handwriting to become a crucial clue but it never does so I'm baffled as to why Columbo makes that visit to the killer's home at all.The character of Jenifer Welles interesting spelling of the first name seems so clingy manipulative and irritating that I found myself almost willing Benedict to kill her off. This is the second episode where the victim is killed while playing a piano the first being the far superior Suitable for Framing. The moment when the carnation becomes visible in the conductor's sunglasses is slightly surreal and wholly unnecessary.The upstart Audrey she used to tell me how to handle men reminds me of the boy genius in Mind Over Mayhem. Why is it that when Columbo meets children they seem to be even smarter than he is? Is the fact that Columbo never comes up with a name for the dog supposed to mirror his own lack of a first name? How prophetic that one of the ideas he comes up with is Beethoven 20 years before the film of the same name came out.There are two major flaws for me in this episode. First Columbo doesn't actually see Benedict pick up the carnation from the floor in Welles' house. He only turns round when Benedict is holding it and about to put it back on. Perhaps he already knew it was there but we are shown no evidence of that. Secondly at the very end Columbo has to rely on Janice's remembrance of the fact that Benedict didn't replace his carnation in the dressingroom after the concert.

	schema:reviewBody "After repeatedly saying how brilliant so many Columbo episodes are it's time to honour an episode with maximum points. Etude In Black is not 100 percent perfect but it's certainly more than 90 percent...maybe 96 or 97! Last week I reviewed Just Married and compared it unfavourably to Meet The Parents. Well here's one of the parents Blythe Danner in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor Alex Benedict played by the legend that is John Cassavetes. Alex has been having an affair with Jennifer Wells a girl in the orchestra not his first affair one suspects. She is blackmailing Alex to leave his wife but as his wife's mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra Alex doesn't think it'd be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight. Instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicide.Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide. It doesn't take much longer for Columbo to connect Alex to the victim and soon he's following him around wherever he goes. Even though Columbo is certain Alex is his man it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads none of which Columbo really swallows before he has the vital piece of evidence.Along the way there are some topnotch extra characters ranging from the precocious young neighbour of Jennifer Wells and the English mechanic who sounds like he would be more at home on Coronation Street through to the bedraggled looking brass player who nearly finds himself fitted up for the murder he had also been seeing Jennifer Wells the busy girl!. And there's even a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy films. As with Leslie Nielsen in Lady In Waiting it's impossible to take him seriously I bet you're thinking of that speech he made at the podium aren't you?! But it's Blythe Danner John Cassavetes and Peter Falk who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as Mrs Benedict. From the moment she spots Alex dialling Jennifer Wells' number from memory she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her something is very very wrong. Columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about Alex's relations with members of his orchestra.As for John Cassavetes well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the alltime greats of the show. But this performance is superb! He's another one who falls into the highly irritated category losing all patience with Columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge Columbo's genius.Well it's a really really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music as highlighted by many of the posters here but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good dramatic and exciting!Finally if you haven't come across it there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. I'm totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act playing circus music while Falk Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.It might not be strictly relevant to this review but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It's clear to see from the quality of Etude In Black just how well the pair worked together!".

This entry in the Columbo series pretty much follows the usual formula  we know the killer and the perfect plan but then watch Columbo follow his hunch and gradually starts to pick holes in the story he is told before eventually finding enough to prove his suspicions. Saying this is not a spoiler  it is simply what happens in all the films. With this strict adherence to formula it is usually down to several factors whether or not the Columbo film stands out or if it is just average. From the very start of this film the clues scream out at you Alex recalls Jenifer's number too easily the missing flower the mileage on the car  and this is a problem because it takes the mystery out of it and leaves us just waiting for Columbo is work out something that we already know. Although the film manages to pull it back you can't help feel that it is deliberately avoiding the easy clues in order to drag things out a bit longer than it should have taken. The script fills the film with other stuff but none of these really engaged me in the way that the usual formula does.It is a shame because the cast are good on paper. Falk is as good as ever here he brings out the more calculating side of his character playing his cards early in this case. The potential for Cassavetes was there but it doesn't work. He doesn't click with Columbo and the lack of mind games reduces the tension. Smaller roles for Olson Danner and Loy are OK but nothing special. The cast also includes some reoccurring faces in small roles Police Academy's Gaynes has his first of two Columbo appearances Macaulay has his second of three appearances Perry Mason regular and constant on screen cop McEachin has a small role in his first of two appearances in the series before settling into a much more steady job in the 1980's. And of course Fred makes his first appearance. These are minor distractions though and the film is very much on the shoulders of the lead two as is always the case but here I just didn't think the combination worked that well.Overall this is an OK entry in the series that does enough to please fans but it is hard to ignore the abundance of clues here and it takes away from the mystery by giving the audience that Columbo isn't being as sharp as he was in other films.".

John Cassavettes in my opinion was the coolest murderer on the show. The chemistry between John and Peter Falk is beyond amazing and you can probably tell that they were great friends of the set as well. Although not the toughest murder for Columbo to solve due to obvious clues left by Cassavettes this one just had to be the most entertaining one to watch. Cassavettes is given no room at all to even think his plan out without Columbo harassing him every moment possible. Also Etude in Black features the absolutely brilliant Myrna Loy as Cassavettes mother in Law and she is just perfect in the role and still beautiful after all these years. Do yourself a favour and watch Etude in Black because I have about 10 times since I bought the DVD 5 years a go.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alex Benedict is a noted symphony conductor married to a wealthy socialite and having an affair with a pianist. When his mistress gives him an ultimatum he kills her and makes it look like suicide. Lieutenant Columbo however is unconvinced ...This is one of my favourite Columbo TVmovies probably only beaten by Murder Under Glass but I'm not exactly sure why. The story is a good one but mostly revolves around an incriminating buttonhole dropped at the scene of the killing and the characters are pretty routine types  the conniving twotimer the jealous wife and the jilted boyfriend. I think it's entirely down to Cassavetes an extraordinary actor who is so naturalistic he's almost impossible to read is he a stone cold killer a prima donna artiste or just nervous and guiltridden ? He doesn't behave like the villains normally do in Columbo matey or dismissive and seems much more real and complex as a consequence. Ironically in real life Falk and Cassavetes were very close friends and made three movies together. There is a lot more to enjoy however Colasanto's direction is terrific there is some fabulous music by Beethoven and Chopin the Hollywood Bowl locations are wonderful and Cassavetes' two classic motors  a Jag EType Series 1 and a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow  are simply gorgeous. Also for Columbo regulars this flick is about twenty minutes longer than normal and features the first appearance of Dog the basset hound. As with all of these stories though it is Falk's complete immersion in the character which it makes it so compelling  check out the scene where he examines the murdered woman's effects and compares it to the police department dossier. Genius.".

	schema:reviewBody "Storywise this isn't among the best or most cleverly written Columbo movie but the movie is extremely well made with excellent directing and truly fine acting.Especially the acting within this movie attracts the attention. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a great job with the actors in the movie. Appereantly he allowed Peter Falk and John Cassavetes lots of space to play with also since both are being credited on here as uncredited directors of this movie. Must be part of his directing style to allow the actors this much room. It works out extremely well for this movie. Perhaps he did this because Colasanto himself also used to work as an actor. He is perhaps best known for playing the role of Coach in the hitseries Cheers from the very start of it in 1982 until his death in 1985.So Peter Falk seems better than ever before in his role as Lt. Columbo. Also veteran actor John Cassavetes does a real great job as the movie its murderer and is a good match for the lieutenant. Beside them the movie also features Myrna Loy. A big star from the silent movie era and also Pat Morita in a small early role.But not just the actingdirecting within the movie is real good. Visually and technically it's also a really great made movie with slow long shots without the use of any cuts. Also obviously the reason why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. It really takes its time to set up things and tell its story. The movie also features a couple of nice artistic and experimental kind of shots. Of course all really fitting for the '70's.But like I said before storywise this just isn't among the best Columbo movies. Also the clues being left out for the lieutenant are a bit too obvious this time. It makes the murderer come across as a bit dumb like he didn't thought his plan over good enough while the character obviously is an intelligent man. Columbo this time also tries to irritate the suspect and other characters a bit more than he usually tries to do in order to solve the crime. This and Peter Falk's different acting approach are a reason why his character might come across as different than he does in other Columbo movies. But different does not mean worse in this case.The movie also features a quite good musical score by Richard DeBenedictis who after this became sort of the steady composer for the Columbo movies. A great Columbo movie to watch!810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The directing seems too pretentious. The scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace. And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.

	schema:reviewBody "This episode is a personal favourite of mine. A conductor whose career is at threat of ruin if he doesn't go public with his mistress murders said mistress and sets it up to appear as a suicide. Murder dressed as suicide has to be one of my favourite plot lines in a murder mystery and this one certainly delivers. Benedict's confidence irritation and slow smile are a delightful foil to Columbo's deceptive fumbling and bumbling ways. The plot itself is good although I can't bear to watch Columbo handling crucial evidence with his bare hands and even taking objects from the scene of the crime with him in his car! The clues with regards to the typewriter seemed unnecessarily complex to me rather the fact that the alleged suicide letter had no fingerprints let alone those of the victim would have been more than sufficient to indicate murder. Some say that the flower clue was a little simple. I actually think that Columbo could have solved the mystery had the flower been left at the piano been noticed by Columbo and then matched to a picture of Alex Benedict or the set of carnations that Mrs. Benedict had at her house. But that doesn't bother me too much as a murder suspect returning to the scene of the crime soon after to retrieve something is plausible enough. The best part of this episode is of course the interplay between Falk and Cassavetes. I am given to understand that these two had a close friendship which works excellently here and is also the reason why Falk's episodes with Patrick McGoohan are considered classics in the repertoire. The irritation the condescension and the arrogance displayed by Benedict are glorious as are Columbo's reactions. The dialogue is great throughout. Columbo's offhand surmise that Benedict might have been the murderer is one of the best parts of the movie as is the slow and almost taunting response from the conductor who knows his crime. And it is completely fitting that the murderer concede defeat with a Goodbye genius. This is very satisfying along with Columbo's kindness and courtesy to Mrs. Benedict. As some have noticed Benedict's conducting is ludicrous. Furthermore quasi una fantasia is Italian not Latin. I don't understand how the scriptwriters could have missed that. Also the choice of classical music was pedestrian by any stretch of the imagination. Still that's just my inner critic speaking. But I did enjoy Blythe Danner's performance as Mrs. Benedict sharp languid and suspicious throughout. Her insecurities are entirely understandable and she made for a thoroughly sympathetic character. A great episode fit to be watched again and again.".

The alternative is that she reveals all to the tabloids the orchestra's financial backers back out and disaster prevails. So he murders her.Cassavetes makes it look like a suicide but Columbo is nobody's fool. He's a sartorial shambles but he's not a fool. Piece by piece he puts together the case against Cassavetes discarding Olson as a suspect and enlisting the aid of a young girl and of Danner. It all hinges on one of those clues that had Cassavetes been as quick on his mental feet as he is at the podium he could easily have gotten away with it.Cassavetes almost always gives a decent performance and he does so here but he's the most energetic conductor you ever saw. Instead of beating the shape of harps into the air he seems to be sawing wood. Blythe Danner with her big cornflowerblue eyes and generous lower lip is infinitely appealing. She's the daughter of the guy who ran the First Bank of Pennsylvania where I once had an account and probably owned half the state. She's also the sister of an opera singer and has another brother who is a violin maker so we can assume she knows music and snobbery. Most of the snobbery rests with Myrna Loy who is jealous of her guardianship of the orchestra's funds. But James Olson is at least as notable as anyone else as the trumpeter with a troubled past. For those who are into modern jazz there's a very neatly executed trumpet solo backed by a rhythm section. It only lasts a few minutes but there's a good deal of skill involved.".

You have to remember this movie was made long before there were cell phones or caller id and the calls are genuinely creepy.My only complaint about this movie is that I wish that the makers of this film would have spent more time answering some basic questions such as why would the calls start suddenly after 15 years? Who is the voice of the young boy on the other end of the line? These questions are never explained and I think it would have been nice to have the answers to these basic questions. There are a couple of not real scary murders until the killer is revealed at the end. Despite some minor flaws I love this movie and remember watching it when I was a kid when it came out in 1972. I recently got to see it again when it aired on the Fox Movie Channel. It was also fun to see Michael Douglas in the picture as he is very young and basically at the beginning of his long and storied career.

	schema:reviewBody "When Michael Calls 1972  12 out of 4Mildly effective madeforTV flick about a woman Elizabeth Ashley who begins receiving phone calls from her nephew Michael but the only problem is that he died fifteen years earlier. Soon her exhusband Ben Gazzara and other nephew Michael Douglas begin to investigate is Michael could actually be alive or if someone else is just trying to do her harm. These TV flicks from the 70s always have that certain atmosphere that can only be found in movies like this BAD RONALD and DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK. This here certainly isn't as good as those two examples but we still get that eerie atmosphere and that alone makes this worth sitting through even if in the end this isn't a classic. I think the best thing going for the film are the performances by the three leads. Gazzara plays a lawyer who doesn't mind throwing his weight around to get what he wants and I thought he was pretty good in the role. That tough rawness he brings to all his roles is always fun to watch and he certainly helps keep this thing moving along. Ashley is also very good in the film although it's hard to believe her as the aunt to Douglas especially when in real life she was only five years older than him. With that said she certainly displayed a certain vulnerability that made the movie a bit more effective. Douglas is billed as a Special Guest Star but he actually has a pretty big role here and appears throughout the movie. The screenplay tries very hard to be like something you'd expect to see from Hitchcock as it tries to keep the suspense up by having you constantly guessing what's going on. I think it's pretty simple to figure out what's up after about the fortyminute mark but I'm sure some might be kept in the dark up until the ending. While I didn't fall for all the twists and turns this still turned out to be fairly fun thanks in large part to the cast and whoever it was that voiced the kid on the phone. Another good thing about these films from the 70s that dealt with phones is that they were always able to find someone creepy for the voice work.".

While I didn't fall for all the twists and turns this still turned out to be fairly fun thanks in large part to the cast and whoever it was that voiced the kid on the phone. Another good thing about these films from the 70s that dealt with phones is that they were always able to find someone creepy for the voice work.";

I'll admit that the first one or two phone calls did give me the creeps  that boy's voice would give anyone the creeps! But it began to ware off fast and the entire divorce subplot was stupid. I also figured out that Michael Douglas was the antagonist about a half an hour before the movie ended. As soon as that story was told about how Elizabeth Ashley's character had locked up his mother I knew something was fishy. Plus didn't anyone ever think to ask him why he happened to suddenly appear that night when the fire occurred in the barn? I'll admit that I thought he was coaching a boy at the school to make the phone calls. I didn't guess the mute boy part or the prerecorded tapes did they ever say whose voice that actually was? I doubt Douglas could ever get his voice that high?.I am only giving this movie a four out of ten because I actually liked most of the acting in it. Ashley especially is great.It's a shame because this movie has such a great premise but oh well thats what happens sometimes when one gets his or her hopes up for a movie too much.".

Ashley is now the mother of a young girl and is estranged from her husband Ben Gazzara a highpowered lawyer. Gazarra comes to visit his wife and child and he seems like a nice loving guy. Michael Douglas has become a bland psychologist who works with exceptional children at the nearby Greenleaf School.That's the set up. Then suddenly Ashley and the rest begin receiving phone calls from what sounds like the voice of a terrified young boy who claims to be Michael. The calls say things like Help me! and I'm dead aren't I? So where are the calls coming from? Are we into the supernatural? Or is there something more mundane going on? Everyone is puzzled. The local doc is puzzled too but he's murdered  stung to death by his own bees. His death has absolutely nada to do with the plot. A sheriff is murdered too. And well there's a reason for the sheriff's death though it too has nothing to do with the plot. The sheriff must be murdered so that his dead body can plop unexpectedly into the middle of a Halloween display and cause the audience to erupt in shrieks.After half an hour or so I was fairly convinced of two things 1 Ashley and Gazarra would get back together again at the end and 2 Michael Douglas was the murderer. I figured Douglas was the killer not because he acted strange in any way and not because he had a motive but because of The Law of Excess Characters. He had too prominent a part and too little to do.After the New England setting was established I was hoping the film would convey a strong sense of place. Not picturepostcard pretty of course. We don't necessarily want maples aflame because this is early winter after all and anyway autumn foliage in Vermont would be trite. Not to worry. The dismal chill of Toronto defeated any effort in that regard. The whole movie in fact seemed to be made for TV. I swear there are even miniclimaxes before what appear to be breaks for commercials.Ashley is attractive sexy and competent. She has the eyes of a calf and her long nose slopes down and out in a fascinating French curve. Gazarra is competent too and a bit more light hearted than his usual persona. Michael Douglas is here in an early role. He's vaguely handsome. How does he do at this stage of his career? Not too bad actually. He plays the character as wispy and at times almost feminine but that's what the role calls for. Only once at the climax does he flood out in a spasm of excruciating insight. His old man handled that kind of scene even better  in The Juggler and Champion.".

Less good seems the quirk of the hypnosis and remote control a plunge into '30 silliness that makes the denouement look explained away. Both murders with the bee venom that prompts the swarming and at the harvest festival are unlikely laborious and too staged. After a couple of such nerdy murders the psychotic arrives at his aunt's home with a bat .After having exported so many players and people in the showbiz Canada rented these two actors and a likable TV movie has been made. M. Douglas improves very much upon the script and looks almost too urbane for the modest setting on the other hand Gazzara is too convincing as a ne'er do well cur or marten .In the early '90s I remember being very keen on M.

But either way his death was because of something Craig said or did to him.  why after all these years do the phone calls start up etc?Again it happened because of Craig. Something set him off and he had a mental break down which caused him to seek revenge for Michael's death. First he pretended to be him and then he enlisted a young boy who was around the same age as Michael at the time of his death to play the part for him. I say enlisted but I'm pretty sure what he had actually done is kidnap the boy.Ironically enough it was his guilt over what happened to Michael that caused his final mental breakdown which is why the calls didn't start right away. It must have taken years for him to come to grips with what he did but in the end he just couldn't handle the guilt anymore ergo he lost his mind and assumed Michaels identity and the subsequently had another child assume Michael's identity as well. His guilt over what happened was obvious I think things happened the way they happened because part of him wanted to be caught and punished for his role in the death. The other part to that equation of getting rid of his guilt was to attempt to convince himself and everyone else that Michael wasn't actually dead. Which would be why he fixated on another little boy the same age and wanted to make him become Michael.".

His phone calls are more bothersome than creepy and the characters' react with so little concern that there is absolutely no sense of urgency or suspense and the characters are the dullest group of would be suspects ever assembled and the actors seemed to have phoned in their performances. My advice If Michael calls hang up! If you like films featuring menacing phone calls try Talk Radio Who Killed Teddy Bear? Black Christmas or When a Stranger Calls instead. Even Sorry Wrong Nuumber or I Saw What You Did! have more substance. Besides being awful When Michael Calls is outdated. Thank God for caller ID!".

Hauser's Skinhead had no redeeming qualities and so it passed by the wayside. But... just for a moment forget the politics of dancing and just take the delivery of the words into account.

Unit One is a mobile police unit that travels over Denmark in a semitrailer that is their office. The group are not only colleagues they're like family. Each week a new crime must be solved sending them from one end of the country to the other. But the stories also dive into their personal lives. Ingrid's son Allan's wife Gaby and Johnny's relationship... Each week is a new and exciting episode. That is what keeps me coming back despite the bright yellow subtitles I have to put up with.

	schema:reviewBody "First off I'm an American  I haven't seen any comments on IMDb about this series yet from a U.S. viewer. Secondly I work in the television business in development. So I wallow in much of the sludge that comes out of American broadcast programming. Unit One is an example of television that's a throwback to what I would attribute as '70sstyle scripting featurewise. Namely those films made by young autueurs who had free rein to make the dramas feel more realistic and to allow for organic character development. It tacks more along the lines of stellar British dramas like Cracker and Prime Suspect as well as Australia's brilliant Underbelly. Unit One features standalone cases that are committed then solved each week. The mysteries aren't extraordinary or particularly byzantine. They usually center around one single twist clocking in generally at the 40 minute mark and resolution is neatly wrapped up in the 15 minutes thereafter. What makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it features main characters that you are hooked on and find relatable by episode 2. These are real breathing alive characters that have personal baggage yet it's not a talky batty type of baggage that American flotsam such as Grey's Anatomy or Desperate Housewives spoons out. These are realistic individuals whose backstories unfold leisurely over the course of the series as if you work with them on a daily basis. After the mindless decade of CSI's NCIS's and Criminal Minds along with their subsequent spawns it's refreshing to actually sit down to watch friends you want to spend time with as is the case with Unit One. The quippy banter the unemotional wooden dialogue and the overthetop jeopardy that those American series I mentioned bludgeon us with each week are absurd compared to the nuance and the quiet resonance you get with this remarkable Danish series. I'm on episode 7 of the first season but I've already bought all four seasons and am in for the long haul. If you need explosions and farcicallyhopped up testosterone along with music by The Who and fastcutting neonlit jittery palsycam action with cipherlike main characters as your main diet of television drama viewing I suggest you stay away from this series. If you are an adult with a hunger for subtle poignant thoughtful and yes sometimes straightforward procedural crime dramas I urge you to check this show out.".

The danish police force has a team that can move out and assist the local police in cases where expert knowledge is required. Each episode is based on reallife crimes commited in Denmark and so far the neighboring countries of Sweden and Germany. The story follows the away team and much of the plot is focused around the character's interaction between themselves their private life and the people they meet during the cause of the investigation.What the series lack in action is made up in the show of realism presented. The crimes are not solved at gunpoint but rather in careful examination of the crimescene and the general public's help remember Denmark is a small country so often someone is bound to know something or have seen something.The acting is quite good and very realistic compared to most contemporary danish shows and films. Especially Mads Mikkelsen as Fischer and Lars Brygmann La Cour stands out. The two characters suplement each other very well and are the ones with most depth.What also makes this movie very popular is the fact that a lot of neglected locations in Denmark is shown in the show. No town is too small for a crime and most danes will have their city or one close to them featured in one of the episodes.It is no wonder that almost a quarter of the danes watch this series every week. And it is also no wonder that the concept has been sold to other tvnetworks  so look out for your own version of Rejseholdet soon.".

Supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes this has at times been a gritty well acted believable and dare I say entertaining series. The fact that the powers in Denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least never failed to get their man! It's a definite 1010 for me.".

This is often done in ways that are just unbelievable. It's like going from Point A to point C without showing the viewer what happened inbetween at point B! One can only hope that the series is really not representative of the state of Denmark's Justice and Police system! I should not have continued with series 2 but did so because I hoped the writers would produce better scripts. Unfortunately that was not the case. The downward spiral continued! Now to be fair this series is over 15 years old and is probably not as well developed as the later Nordic Noir offerings such as Borgen The Killing and the Bridge. Perhaps the genre was finding its feet at that time and evolving into the excellent productions we see today. On the other hand every country that produces TV series will produce some pretty horrible shows sometimes and this may be an example of that. I believe there were 4 seasons produced but I don't think I will be spending more to find out if season 3 and 4 got better......just not worth the money to do so!".

Moreover through 32 episodes the viewers are able to get a glimpse of pleasant Danish citiestowns and natural areas as for many of them joy of recognition to me but many other nice unknown areas such as Aalborg or Bornholm... The scripts are also logically created cases portrayed were loosely based upon actual incidents but it is still better if you watch all of them in a row and far more often than weekly. However no Scandinavian crime series can apparently do about crossborder sex traffic and child pornography... As of the cast it is splendid and many of those having small roles have obtained bigger or even leading roles in subsequent Danish crime series such as The Killing The Eagle Anna Pihl or Irene Huss... Or just provide memorable performances e.g. Nicholas Bro Thure Lindhardt. The main cast is quite even but still Lars Brygmann and especially Mads Mikkelsen give stronger performances than the rest when they appear then the rest become supportive characters inadvertently. Anyway Rejseholdet is highly recommended to all fond of Scandinavian intense crime films where the line between good and evil cops and loafers is thin at times...".

The scripts are also logically created cases portrayed were loosely based upon actual incidents but it is still better if you watch all of them in a row and far more often than weekly. However no Scandinavian crime series can apparently do about crossborder sex traffic and child pornography... As of the cast it is splendid and many of those having small roles have obtained bigger or even leading roles in subsequent Danish crime series such as The Killing The Eagle Anna Pihl or Irene Huss... Or just provide memorable performances e.g. Nicholas Bro Thure Lindhardt. The main cast is quite even but still Lars Brygmann and especially Mads Mikkelsen give stronger performances than the rest when they appear then the rest become supportive characters inadvertently. Anyway Rejseholdet is highly recommended to all fond of Scandinavian intense crime films where the line between good and evil cops and loafers is thin at times...";

Although the crimes and the procedural paths to their resolution are competently staged and handled I think the real standout of this series is the way the personal lives of the unit members and their interaction with each other are portrayed. Many series originating in other countries sensationalize the private lives of the protagonists to the point where such scenes either induce disbelief or jar the continuity of the plot. Here the lives of these police officers are characterized with subtlety and dignity in spite of some personal situations that are sad and irreconcilable. If you are tired of the predictability of series emanating from Englishspeaking countries then give this one a chance and be surprised by its freshness. Also 'The Killing' a series from Denmark is just as good. 910".

	schema:headline " A masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse...";
	schema:reviewBody "'The English Patient' is a love story set in Europe as World War II ends... It is a wartime romance mystery epic like 'Hiroshima Mon Amour' 'The Sweet Hereafter' and 'After Life.' Anthony Minghella weaves extravagant beauty around a central character whose condition is grotesque and puts emotional barriers between the characters and the audience...This adult love story is an intimate portrait in the tradition of 'Casablanca' and 'Dr. Zhivago.' The film sweeps gracefully attaining a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films had missed... Told in flashback it is a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse...Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient Count Laszlo de Almasy a Hungarian cartographer of few words who works for the British government and is stationed in the North African desert...Count Laszlo is the unidentified survivor of a plane crash turned over to the Allies taken into custody by a medical convoy in Italy and essentially left to die in peace in an isolated monastery in Tuscany under the care of an inspiring pretty nurse who injects him with morphine and reads to him a book considered his great treasure and his one surviving possession...Hana seeks to stimulate his touching memories wrapped up in his head released in lost pieces from his disturbed mind...Fiennes gives a haunted pained performance playing the young man whose veneer of charm cannot plainly cover his heart's capacity for passion... He makes us sympathize with the character in showing selfdoubt and weakness... As a badly burned man he has only cherished memories... His joy and heartbreak are completely clear and visible in his eyes... He remembers falling under the spell of an attractive English married woman... He remembers the way this turns him from a harsh abrupt wanderer into a man willing to betray everything for love... His tragic love affair forms the heart of the motion picture...Kristin Scott Thomas matches Fiennes' work with a radiant sensuality... She is captivating as the married European woman conveying the audience with the energy and enthusiasm for life that the Count finds irresistible... Their different world despairing and hopeful menacing and resilient is simply beautiful... With intense passion and intelligence this attractive blonde burns the screen as the different wife...Juliette Binoche seems to shine as the FrenchCanadian nurse full of life and energy... This vibrant young woman has a heart of gold kissing wounded soldiers but she thinks that she is a curse as anybody she ever loved tends to die on her...Colin Firth is good as Katherine's husband... He is a British spy flying into the tough desert in a yellow biplane to take aerial maps of the whole North African continent...

	onyx:emotionText "'The English Patient' is a love story set in Europe as World War II ends... It is a wartime romance mystery epic like 'Hiroshima Mon Amour' 'The Sweet Hereafter' and 'After Life.' Anthony Minghella weaves extravagant beauty around a central character whose condition is grotesque and puts emotional barriers between the characters and the audience...This adult love story is an intimate portrait in the tradition of 'Casablanca' and 'Dr. Zhivago.' The film sweeps gracefully attaining a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films had missed... Told in flashback it is a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse...Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient Count Laszlo de Almasy a Hungarian cartographer of few words who works for the British government and is stationed in the North African desert...Count Laszlo is the unidentified survivor of a plane crash turned over to the Allies taken into custody by a medical convoy in Italy and essentially left to die in peace in an isolated monastery in Tuscany under the care of an inspiring pretty nurse who injects him with morphine and reads to him a book considered his great treasure and his one surviving possession...Hana seeks to stimulate his touching memories wrapped up in his head released in lost pieces from his disturbed mind...Fiennes gives a haunted pained performance playing the young man whose veneer of charm cannot plainly cover his heart's capacity for passion... He makes us sympathize with the character in showing selfdoubt and weakness... As a badly burned man he has only cherished memories... His joy and heartbreak are completely clear and visible in his eyes... He remembers falling under the spell of an attractive English married woman... He remembers the way this turns him from a harsh abrupt wanderer into a man willing to betray everything for love... His tragic love affair forms the heart of the motion picture...Kristin Scott Thomas matches Fiennes' work with a radiant sensuality... She is captivating as the married European woman conveying the audience with the energy and enthusiasm for life that the Count finds irresistible... Their different world despairing and hopeful menacing and resilient is simply beautiful... With intense passion and intelligence this attractive blonde burns the screen as the different wife...Juliette Binoche seems to shine as the FrenchCanadian nurse full of life and energy... This vibrant young woman has a heart of gold kissing wounded soldiers but she thinks that she is a curse as anybody she ever loved tends to die on her...Colin Firth is good as Katherine's husband... He is a British spy flying into the tough desert in a yellow biplane to take aerial maps of the whole North African continent... He quickly becomes friend of the Count yet when he realizes that his wife has committed adultery his face reflected a peaceful fury...William Dafoe plays a doubleagent spy who covers his anger with a strange charm... He is a crippled war veteran who has a hidden agenda... This cunning Canadian man seems to know of some dark secret in Almasy's past... He believes the 'English patient' is partially responsible for the mutilation of his hands and is busy seeking revenge on everyone even remotely involved...Naveen Andrews is Hana's ardent lover He is a handsome Sikh and an explosives expert with a dangerous job There's a scene that is stuck in my head because it literally had me on the edge of my seat for what seemed an eternity In this particular scene the military sapper has to cut the wires on a bomb that has been hidden on a bridge It's on a timer and he only has a few minutes left The scene cuts back and forth between his tense face the wires and his dirty fingers as they try madly to figure out how to untangle and cut the wires without detonating the bomb All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence in The English Patient.

	schema:headline " A Magnificent Motion Picture";
	schema:reviewBody "In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean this romantic love story sweeps across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set.  It's a film which purports that one does not choose love but rather that it's love that does the choosing regardless of who where or when and furthermore that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances.  And thus is the situation in The English Patient' directed by Anthony Minghella the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times proving that when it is predestined love will find a way.It's WWII flying above the African desert Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy Ralph Fiennes is shot down his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft. And though he survives the crash he is severely burned.  To his great good fortune however he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital.  But existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war and Almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to a different facility.  Upon reaching Italy he is too weak and ill to continue on and a Canadian nurse Hana Juliette Binoche volunteers to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery.Hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery as Almasy remembers nothing of his past and not even his own name.  Thought to be English the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash but even they are as cryptic as Hana's patient.  Slowly however under prompting from Hana Almasy begins to remember bits and pieces of his life and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio Willem Dafoe who suspects that Almasy is the man he's been looking for a man with whom he wants to settle a score. But burned beyond recognition Almasy may or may not be that man. Meanwhile Almasy's memories continue to surface memories of a woman he loved Katherine Clifton Kristin Scott Thomas as well as memories of Katherine's husband Geoffrey Colin Firth.  And crippled in mind and body as he is those memories become the only thing left to which he can cling with any hope at all even as his life seems to be slipping farther away with each passing moment.In addition to directing Anthony Minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaatje.  The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's Doctor Zhivago' and Lawrence of Arabia' a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty.  Simply put Minghella's film is genius realized crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection watching it is like watching a Monet come to life.  From the opening frames Minghella casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is binding and transporting with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engagingly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by John Seale's remarkable cinematography images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer.  In every sense this is a film of rare eloquence with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental.  Nominated in twelve categories it deservedly received a total of nine Oscars including Best Picture Director Supporting Actress Binoche and Cinematography.If one had to choose a single word to describe the essence' of this film it would be excellence.'  Even an extraordinary film however does not receive nine Oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind and the performances given by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here transcend the term Oscar worthy.'  Nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Almasy Geoffrey Rush was awarded the gold for Shine' Fiennes has never been better achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable.  Private and introspective Almasy is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection Fiennes however finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in enough so that you taste the honest passion welling up within him.  And it works.  Almasy does not seek your friendship he will however gain your compassion.Kristen Scott Thomas too received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress Frances McDormand received the award for Fargo' for her portrayal of Katherine a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging within her born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly casting off her shackles of repression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her.  The reserve Katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience as Scott Thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect.  It's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast taking you as it does beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion.  Understated and shaded with subtlety it's terrific work by Kristin Scott Thomas.Binoche gives a stunning affecting performance as well as the kindhearted nurse Hana it is her humanity in fact which defines love in it's purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film.  Her relationship with Kip Naveen Andrews affords us a glimpse of passion of another kind which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between Almasy and Katherine.  The English Patient' is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally one you will not want to see end. 1010.".

Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and Geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by Colin Firth. The scene in the sand storm where Catherine  Elmasy are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the highlights of the film and where the affair really starts.

	schema:reviewBody "'The English Patient' can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean whose sweeping epics such as 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Bridge on the River Kwai' must have inspired the director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed and like 'Lawrence' is set in Northern Africa but during the second world war.  The story is complex but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas.  The story based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje is told in flashbacks by Fiennes' Count Laszlo de Almasy   the titular character.  The fact that his name does not sound like he's English plays a key role in what unfolds. He has been badly burned in a plane crash occurring just as the film opens and is being cared for back in Europe by Hana an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time and the development of characters beyond that of the two illfated lovers.     The film makes clear that true love and passion even with dreaded consequences can make life worth living or worth dying for. If you're a romantic at heart and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes you may find that 'The English Patient' speaks directly to you.".

	schema:headline " Epic story that mixes lust with a mystery story  worthy stuff but a touch too slow";
	schema:reviewBody "Tuscany WW2.  Traumatised by the loss of anyone she cared for or loved Canadian nurse Hana stays behind her unit with a dying patient Count Laszlo de Almsy.  de Almsy is burnt all over and has lost his memory.  When a vengeful mysterious thief arrives at their abandoned monastery with a past that seems to include de Almsy  and as Hana reads from his book memories return regarding his past.  He relives his story of lust and love and the destructive force that forbidden passion unleashed upon his life.This is quite a modern epic.  It has the running time of an epic it has the gorgeous cinematography of an epic it has the acting of an epic and it has a story of love lust against the backdrop of major events in history. Even though it changes or leaves out a significant amount of the original novel it still manages to be a great mix of passionate desire and mystery. The mystery of the story is represented by the thief Caravaggio who casts light on what he knows of de Almsy's past as he sees it while the love story is unfolded as it develops in a passionate affair between him and Katherine a colleagues' wife.  The story is compelling enough to carry the long running time at times the pace seems a little slow and when I saw it in my local multiplex there were some moments where large portions of the audience seemed to be shifting in their seats.The love' of the story was interesting as it seems to be contrasted with Hana's relationship with Kip the bomb disposal expert.  While de Almsy's relationship with Katherine starts as lust and desire before growing into what seems to be love or could be grief at the result of their affair Hana's is portrayed as purer and more careful as she fears those she loves will die.  This difference helped me see that the film did want to show the destructive power of lust and affairs however the fact that the central relationship was based more on lust than love took away from the emotional core of the story.The acting is almost impeccable.  Fiennes is excellent even when he is lost behind an unrecognisable mask of burnt flesh.  Thomas is actually very good I find she tends to be very wooden in some things but this type of very English character brings the best out of her.  Binoche is excellent as Hana and carries the heart of the film.  Dafoe is truly excellent  his element of the story is the mystery and he does it well.  He is a great actor and deserves to be in things this good.  The support cast include plenty of good actors including Colin Firth Jurgen Prochnow and Naveem Andrews.The film is beautifully shot  even though it's all a bit too picturesque to be real!  However the director can handle himself well with many different scenes  a tense bomb diffusal a passionate love scene a dangerous sand storm etc.  Overall the slow pace may frustrate some younger audiences but this is a really good film that draws it's values from classy sources.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tuscany WW2.  Traumatised by the loss of anyone she cared for or loved Canadian nurse Hana stays behind her unit with a dying patient Count Laszlo de Almsy.  de Almsy is burnt all over and has lost his memory.  When a vengeful mysterious thief arrives at their abandoned monastery with a past that seems to include de Almsy  and as Hana reads from his book memories return regarding his past.  He relives his story of lust and love and the destructive force that forbidden passion unleashed upon his life.This is quite a modern epic.  It has the running time of an epic it has the gorgeous cinematography of an epic it has the acting of an epic and it has a story of love lust against the backdrop of major events in history. Even though it changes or leaves out a significant amount of the original novel it still manages to be a great mix of passionate desire and mystery. The mystery of the story is represented by the thief Caravaggio who casts light on what he knows of de Almsy's past as he sees it while the love story is unfolded as it develops in a passionate affair between him and Katherine a colleagues' wife.  The story is compelling enough to carry the long running time at times the pace seems a little slow and when I saw it in my local multiplex there were some moments where large portions of the audience seemed to be shifting in their seats.The love' of the story was interesting as it seems to be contrasted with Hana's relationship with Kip the bomb disposal expert.

	schema:reviewBody "Count Laszlo Ralph Fiennes has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He is horrifically burned from an ambush. His nurse Hana Juliette Binoche tends to him body and mind for she fears quite rightly that he may be a very troubled soul. In the course of his care the Count starts to tell Hana of his recent past. It seems he worked in a government capacity in Africa where he met a beautiful married lady named Katherine Kristin Scott Thomas. Although they tried to avoid each other they fell in love. After a brief affair Katherine called it quits leaving the Count desolate. Even so the two would meet again under heartwrenching circumstances. Meanwhile Hana herself falls for a Sihk man in the British bomb squad. Yet the war is raging relentlessly. Can love exist when the world is in turmoil? This is a tremendous film based on an equally fine but complex novel. The plot has many story lines that are woven together beautifully each of them poignant beyond description. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is magnificent both as the burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also quite fine as the woman who fights against her passions. As for Binoche she richly deserved the Oscar that she was presented as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation. The scenery is utterly gorgeous as are the costumes the direction and the production. If you have missed out on viewing this film rectify that soon very soon. The English Patient will remain one of the greatest achievements in film for centuries to come.".

	schema:headline " Every night I cut out my heart. But in the morning it was full again";
	schema:reviewBody "Anthony Minghella's 'The English Patient' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grand and impressive in scale and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. At the 1997 Academy Awards the film owned the night taking home nine awards from twelve nominations the most decisive cleansweep since Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's 1992 Booker Prizewinning novel of the same name 'The English Patient' is a touching meditation on life love and loss tracing the history of a criticallyburnt man in the aftermath of World War Two.During the war a man Ralph Fiennes is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane. With his face scarred beyond recognition and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia he is assumed to be an Allied soldier and is simply referred to as the English patient. After the war in the mineridden hills of Italy a kind nurse Hana Juliette Binoche who has apparently lost everybody close to her remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man. Over time she comes to learn more and more about her English patient who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer Count Laszlo de Almsy. Rather than losing his memory in the plane crash we learn that this scarridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love. Via numerous flashbacks we learn of Almsy's former exploits in the Sahara desert and his romantic liaison with a married woman Katharine Clifton Kristin Scott Thomas.It's certainly easy to see why 'The English Patient' was so successful at the Oscars. It is such a beautiful film blending the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape to perfection not since David Lean's magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from Almsy's plane. Even in the film's more intimate moments excellent use of closeups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene coupled of course with the brilliant performances from all the cast members.A longtime favourite actor of mine 'The English Patient' might just contain Ralph Fiennes' finest performance and considering his history includes such films as 'Schindler's List' and 'The Constant Gardener' this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly. His Count Laszlo de Almsy is initially a very sympathetic character but as we slowly learn more about his past his likable qualities are eroded by his lessadmirable tendencies towards others. Ownership is a major theme of the film. When asked by Katherine what he hates most Almsy replies with Ownership. Being owned. When you leave you should forget me. However as the relationship progresses and Katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him Almsy reveals a hint of arrogance insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine which belong to me.Juliette Binoche who received an Oscar for her performance here is excellent as Hana the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her. After some time of caring for Almsy alone she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief David Caravaggio Willem Dafoe who lost his thumbs during the war and who suspects that it was Almsy who betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with Kip Naveen Andrews an Indian bombdiffuser in the British Army. However due to her past history Hana is afraid that becoming involved with Kip will doom him to death particularly considering his very dangerous line of work.At 160 minutes in length 'The English Patient' wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old successfully finding a balance of mystery love joy and tragedy. The ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful but also uplifting in its own way. Whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. Nevertheless in every case it is always better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.".

	schema:headline " An epic story of love.";
	schema:reviewBody "A passionate tale of determination and romance. Like with all of Minghella's work every single character is so layered and complex. He takes time and devotion to give each character a sufficient amount of intricacy that we truly feel like we know these people and when one of them feels pain we do as well. When one of them is joyous the rain scene for instance our faces light up with glee.There's Hana the caring nurse who is too afraid of love to let anyone near her since right from the start the two closest people to her are destroyed by the war. Slowly her friendship with Almasy becomes stronger and stronger and it gives her the courage and determination to pursue a sexual relationship with Kip who is also a very complex character. On the surface we see him as a kind man who is very spiritual and loving. But near the end he realizes how isolated he is and the fact that he barely even knew his best friend whom he worked side by side with for years sends him into a complete breakdown. This leads to a very emotional scene where Binoche really shines. Next up there is David Caravaggio a spy who eventually gets captured and loses his thumbs while being tortured for information. He sets out on a vengeance to murder everyone connected to his capture which leads him to Almasy his final target. But being around Almasy and realizing the pain and suffering that he has been through leads him to look deep inside himself and realize that he doesn't need his revenge. He relieves himself of all this pain and anguish and in the end we see him with a bright grin just happy to be alive thumbs or not.Katharine Clifton is a character very similar to those in the past but she has an extra spark that makes her very unique. As her husband spends less and less attention to her she becomes involved in a tumultuous love affair with Almasy which leads to some of the most beautifully romantic scenes ever brought to cinema. Minghella easily could have made her another whiny confused housewife who just passed in and out of the film with no real connection the audience but he bestowed her with a certain grace and dignity which made us want her to have a happy ending and made us adore seeing her and Almasy enjoying each other's company. Even Geoffrey Clifton becomes a layered character when we learn that he isn't venturing off to do photographs but is instead helping the army explore territory. So while he could have just been another ignorant husband to an adulterous wife Minghella adds intricacy to him. And of course the entire story all revolves around Almasy the man who would do anything even sell out his country to the enemy just to be with the woman he loved. A truly romantic and beautiful tale.What I found very interesting though was how Minghella subtly displays the horrors and terrible effects that war has on the people that aren't even physically fighting it. Through Hana we see a woman who is permanently destroyed and almost unable to love due to the fact that this awful war took away everyone who became close to her. In Kip we see a man who is so blinded by his job and duty to his country that he never even takes the time to appreciate the man he considers his best friend. Caravaggio takes abuse after abuse with unimaginable pain being inflicted on him as a result of the war. The Cliftons are a loving couple who have no troubles whatsoever until the war starts and Geoffrey is off helping his country while Katharine becomes involved in an affair. But the most horrific effect of war is shown constantly through Almasy's story. All he wanted was love and companionship but the war wouldn't allow him that. He only gets his love because of the war and due to it's changing seriousness his love is ripped away from him and he falls into complete heartache. Then we see him reclaim this love and he does whatever he can to save her life. But as Binoche mentions early on the film when war times come even your name means a great deal. We see this terribly through Almasy who is beaten dragged away and arrested merely due to his name when all he was trying to do was save the woman he loved. Of course we see the effect of war physically through Almasy in the horrific burning of his entire body. This film shows no huge war scenes and terrible travesties that blow off limbs and open chest cavities but it manages to send an antiwar message stronger than I've ever seen before. No physical battle is shown whatsoever yet it makes me absolutely detest war due to the effect that it has on those who aren't even directly involved.As always for a Minghella work the performances are absolutely brilliant. Fiennes Binoche Thomas and Dafoe deliver some of the best work of the decade. Simply through their eyes we can see all of the pain and emotion searing through them. The right actors were definitely cast in this one. We never hear them shout or break down into a ten minute fit of crying and throwing objects across the room but we see all of their anguish and torture simply through their eyes and facial expressions. It's a beautifully subtle way of showing emotion and really helped make the film the brilliant masterpiece that it is. I highly doubt that any other cast could have pulled it off so seamlessly.".

I don't want to say the best of allbecause that is simply too 'broad' for me to make a statement like that. However I feel very passionately about The English Patient as well as millions of other people do. The awards say it all. I don't agree with critics on many levels however the ones that picked this one I couldn't agree more.9Oscars. 41wins.37other nominations makes this love storyon the top of the bunch. From the director Anthony Minghella the story that bursts onto the screen and as Mr. Peterman from T.V.s Seinfeld said Elaine I simply can't take my eyes off of it! In this instance I don't agree with Elaine's response. But the story builds and takes the right time needed to make it's case beautifully. The cinematographyJohn Seale won multiple awards as well as it ought too. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche until now. Well not entirely true I loved her performance in Sabrina Lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship next to Harrison Ford. But this was simply an incredibly differing character for her and as deeply talented as she is she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way she was just what this film was looking for I'm truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes was also spectacular in portraying Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability after seeing this one! What can you say except see this picture again. ".

Slow and broing?When I heard that this movie was slow and boring I thought I'd see for myself so when I finally did last Saturday there was not one moment when I was bored. The entire time I was watching I just felt so...captivated and amazed at how amazing not only the story was but the acting was just perfect! I seriously do not understand why this is not in the top 250 it's one of the BEST romance movies one of the best WWII movies and a Best Picture win deserved 250. All of the casting in this movie was just absolutely perfect even if Fox would've preferred to cast wellknown American actors but they wouldn't have been anywhere near as good as Ralph Fiennes Kristin Scott Thomas Juliette Binoche or Willem Dafoe. Seeing Fiennes as this damaged burn victim dying and then seeing him before all of it shows how great and underrated of an actor he truly is showing diversity right there but not only resting on the makeup. The story might seem like a typical love story but it's much more than that. Sure there are tons of movies with this similar storyline but the main reason this one stands out to me is because of how much passion is really told through it how Almasy had to leave Katherine's body in the cave and let her die was the most heartbreaking scene from a movie that I'd seen in such a long time. A true masterpiece even if it has been forgotten about now this is a movie that I certainly will never forget and Anthony Minghella will never be forgotten either.".

	schema:headline " Dreary sordid tale of lust...though spectacular desert scenery";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the dreary tale of the self absorbed affair between two unlikable people one of whom is married to someone else. It ranks high on my list of most boring movies ever and I'm a die hard romantic. My husband opted out after the first hour of its three by which time little had transpired. The desert scenery is spectacular with the endless sand and the sunshine on Katharine's golden hair. However cinematography does not a brilliant film make unless it's a National Geographic travelogue. The magnificent Saharan scenery in this ill conceived tale is like putting perfume on a pig.The movie revolves around a badly burned dying pilot named Count Laszlo de Almasy who is left in the care of a Canadian army nurse Hana during World War II Italy. He appears to remember little of his life but through a book in his possession his story is VERY SLOWLY revealed with the help of a man from his past named Caravaggio who mysteriously appears at his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer employed by the Royal Geographical Society to chart the Sahara Desert. He entered into an affair with the wife Katherine of a fellow explorer who proved to be a British spy. Meanwhile in the present Laszlo's nurse has her own affair with a Sikh nicknamed Kip who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming mines.My quarrels with this movie are many length and tedium for starters. I don't fault the acting in particular it simply isn't a good story. Caravaggio seems unnecessary his connection to Almasy sketchy. He provides a torture scene but appears to serve no essential purpose in the film.The core problem is that the two parties of this affair Almasy and Katharine are woefully unsympathetic characters shallow and dull. They simply aren't very nice thus there is no one to cheer for. Almasy is cool aloof haughty and eventually disgustingly possessive of another man's wife. Katharine is likewise detached and nasty not to mention having a deplorable lack of guilt or feeling whatsoever for her imperfect but loving husband...apart from managing one minuscule tear at the corner of her eye when he dies. This is a tale of LUST rather than love with such pearls as 'I can still taste you'. Almasy ridiculously vocalizes to a colleague his erotic obsession with the indentation in his beloved's neck surely more indicative of a focus on Katharine's body. The victim of this unrepentant adultery is the hapless husband Geoffrey who is treated as little more than an unpleasant nuisance. It's all quite sordid and disgusting Katharine's charade of feeling faint so that these lovers can indulge in their much vaunted unbridled passion all as Silent Night is being sung in the background. I'm not sure whether the intent was to contrast the carol's purity with their selfish lust but I definitely was not impressed by the sacrilegious undertone. We have full frontal nudity with Katharine but their sex scenes come across as cold selfish lustful and sometimes downright hateful...not warm loving giving nor even truly passionate. If either of these two feels any emotion for the other it is a totally selfish one and definitely NOT love as I define the word.Almasy's return to the Cave of the Swimmers to retrieve the body of his beloved comes across as contrived rather than moving. Katharine must have expired only moments earlier as she shows excellent colour and barely appears dozing not at all corpse like. Of course this is all for dramatic effect as the romantics watching this tale normally I'd be one of them would not appreciate a decaying putrid corpse. In order to retrieve his adulterous lover's body he has betrayed his comrades  the Allies by giving his maps to the Nazis the English being cast as the villains of the piece. Regardless of whether or not he's keeping his final promise to Katharine his traitorous act is not something I admire much. Kip seems a pleasant fellow and Hana generally likable but their romance is not in the least engaging merely a brief wartime fling with the parties indicating little trauma upon parting. Moving back and forth between the two settings past Sahara Desert and present Italy proved distracting and unpleasant but really both stories were dull as dishwater. The only spark of interest in the whole picture was Kip's tense mine disarming scene.Not being totally heartless I did have some sympathy for the current Almasy's severely burned and dying state. However perhaps my major complaint with this film is the euthanasia at the end when Hana obliges her patient by giving him a morphine overdose. We are supposed to feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because she obviously has affection for Almasy cries while she is preparing the deadly syringe and reads aloud from his allegedly passionate Herodotus book to console him as he's dying. The amazing director David Lean's masterpieces should not be insulted by comparison with this pathetic immoral tale. Yes Lawrence of Arabia also has a desert but in Lean films Doctor Zhivago Brief Encounter those engaging in affairs are sympathetic characters exhibiting admirable restraint guilt and some regard for the betrayed spouse as opposed to the total self absorption of this pair. In Ryan's Daughter the cuckold husband displays touching loyalty and forgiveness. This movie is a supposedly intellectual enormously over rated bit of boring and disgusting drivel that unfortunately passes itself off as a great love story. Its Best Picture Oscar does not speak well for the Academy. For those who wonder why people are so hard on this movie the answer is simple. It's awful.".

	schema:headline " Balderdash";
	schema:reviewBody "I am not surprised to find user comments for this film full of gushy nonsense such as that this film proves that when it is predestined love will find a way.  I begin in this way not to criticize a specific reviewer but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film even before it hit the theaters. Even the best of films do not prove anything nor are they intended to. The best films entertain and move the viewer and The English Patient fails on both criteria.I remember the studio's promotion of The English Patient very clearly From the producers of 'Amadeus' and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' it grandly announced.  An ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word producers in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of The English Patient so very inappropriately with the truly great director Milos Forman.  Such a comparison is offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman.While the novel by Michael Ondaatje upon which the film was based is a good one it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever.  Aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar the film bears little resemblance to the novel.Despite misgivings which began when I heard that shamelessly misleading promotion I went to see this film in the theater.  As it began to unfold I realized that the rendering of the novel's peculiar magic had failed that the actors knew their words but not their characters and that their characters were flat dull and unengaging.  The film was a complete travesty of Ondaatje's novel and a completely stillborn cinematic artifact of the worst description.Those who gush over this film are very apt to speak with adjectives like sweeping and grand and hypnotic.  Well it is none of those.  In fact not even Ondaatje's fine novel could be described as sweeping or grand.  It could be described as magical and hypnotic  yet these are precisely the qualities that the film so utterly failed to deliver.  It is almost as if Minghella had as a reader entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale skeletal version a version that not only missed the spirit of the story but that focused on the wrong characters.  He produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for story's metaphors but no apparent cognizance of them as well.Minghella took the central focus away from Hana and Kip and put it on the Patient and Katherine Clifton thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the essence of it.Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas put in unengaging uninspiring uninvolving unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great driving passionate loveaffair to the viewer but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable perfunctory liaison between two flat shallow uninteresting adulterers.  Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by Minghella's grandiose and overblown presentation.The grand sweeping DavidLeanlike qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there. The comparison to David Lean Dr. Zhivago is positively insulting to yet another great director.  Take for example the Patient's sandstorm scene which is no doubt one wherein these grand sweeping qualities are believed to have resided or should have resided the sandstorm is not grand  it is not even convincing.  The subsequent burying of the characters in the automobile and their emergence after the storm which no doubt was supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally completely lacked either drama or emotion in fact because it was so patently weak it had an air of comedy about it where comedy was clearly out of place.This film failed.  It failed as a rendering of the novel and it failed as a film.  It seems to have been the anointed Oscar vehicle of the year joining such overtrumpeted filmic slosh as Kramer vs. Kramer or Terms of Endearment.  One can only thank God that even the hypedriven Acadamyhad the good sense to present the Best Actress award to Frances McDormand for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film Fargo. There was not a single performance in the execrable English Patient that was not either embarrassingly horrid overacting Willem Dafoe or truly forgettable mediocre acting Fiennes and Scott Thomas.Why this nonentity of a film retains a coven of fanatical and clearly tasteless devotees will remain a mystery.  Fortunately the sands of time will bury this mediocrity of a film permanently and it will not thankfully have the strength ever to dig itself out.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am not surprised to find user comments for this film full of gushy nonsense such as that this film proves that when it is predestined love will find a way.  I begin in this way not to criticize a specific reviewer but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film even before it hit the theaters. Even the best of films do not prove anything nor are they intended to. The best films entertain and move the viewer and The English Patient fails on both criteria.I remember the studio's promotion of The English Patient very clearly From the producers of 'Amadeus' and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' it grandly announced.  An ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word producers in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of The English Patient so very inappropriately with the truly great director Milos Forman.  Such a comparison is offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman.While the novel by Michael Ondaatje upon which the film was based is a good one it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever.  Aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar the film bears little resemblance to the novel.Despite misgivings which began when I heard that shamelessly misleading promotion I went to see this film in the theater.  As it began to unfold I realized that the rendering of the novel's peculiar magic had failed that the actors knew their words but not their characters and that their characters were flat dull and unengaging.  The film was a complete travesty of Ondaatje's novel and a completely stillborn cinematic artifact of the worst description.Those who gush over this film are very apt to speak with adjectives like sweeping and grand and hypnotic.  Well it is none of those.  In fact not even Ondaatje's fine novel could be described as sweeping or grand.  It could be described as magical and hypnotic  yet these are precisely the qualities that the film so utterly failed to deliver.  It is almost as if Minghella had as a reader entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale skeletal version a version that not only missed the spirit of the story but that focused on the wrong characters.

He plays so well the man that falls in love slowly but so deeply with Katherine Cliftonopens up his heart and dives into this prohibited affair.The most heartbreaking scene for me will always be the one where hurt Katherine is carried by Almasy towards the Cave of Swimmers and she wears the thimble that he bought her.She says 'I always wore it.I always loved you' and at that moment he starts crying with such pain flowing from inside him.Juliette Binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the Oscar she won.Overall this is a film that anybody who proclaims himself a cinema lover should watch in their lives.".

It shouldn't be hard to guess. Right now it has an average 7.1 in it's scale. That's much closer to 6 than it is to 8. If this movie is so good then why does it have such a rank and why is it isolated from the other Best Pictures? Simple. It is a mediocre movie lavished by critics and audience alike because of the love story. Not all love stories are good which is unarguable yet the only reason people say they love this movie is because it was a beautiful love story. Beautiful it was not. The characters were cold calculated and the love story in it is  an affair between two amoral people. The woman is cheating on her husband and her lover is a German allied spy during WWII. But that's not all. He turns an entire town over to Nazis. When people ask what's to hate about this movie the film really speaks for itself. Either that or the people who rave about this movie are just liking it based on the good reviews. This is a Hollywood movie covered in a false glaze that gives it the apperance of an art house film. If you're going to like this movie at least give a good reason. In my opinion this movie was boring scornful with only two saving graces which is Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews' very touching performances. But that's as far as I'll go.A lobotomy without painkillers is preferrable compared to watching this trash.".

	schema:headline " Not a bad film at all";
	schema:reviewBody "I got to see this film because my friend wanted to see Dawson Creek stoned. She got what she wanted the dude was in the movie for about two scenes  he was high as a kite.  But the movie isn't about that and it's not a stoner comedy as the ads make it out to be.  This actually turned out to be the best movie that friend rented in  a while though that's not saying much. It's a drama about small town farmers who decide to grow marijuana to survive in troubled times.  The best part of the film was the storylines involving the farmers themselves and the local Sherriff and DEA agent. Those storylines are realistic and provide interesting motivations and insights about marijuana production and the role of law enforcement.  These farmers are not bad people and while they may be a little naive they  are simply trying to survive when they're only other option would be losing their farms.  While the DEA agent offers by the books interpretation of what they do the Sherriff is conflicted because he knows why they are doing it and he wonders if a big pot bust would be bad for the small town's psyche.The film bogs down with the story of the farmer's son an innocent and earnest Will Horneff.  This isn't a prolegalization film if anything the Horneff character is the moral voice of the film.  His character is angry about his parents growing weed not because he's afraid of their wellbeing with the DEA sniffing around but because he believes it's simply a bad thing to do even though he hangs around kids who smoke it all the time. His intolerance grows as it get's closer to home.  Even though much of the film tries and succeeds to be evenhanded about the issue in the end it has a pretty clear antiweed stance.  All the characters who do smoke weed are jerks.  The dealers are jerks even the sexist brother of the cute candystriper.  The only characters involved with it with any redeeming value in the film are the farmers and of course they are just doing it to survive.  This is somewhat disappointing whether or not it was a case of the filmmakers not havingenough guts to remain neutral or it was the filmmakers asserting their point of view.  The film is strongest when it is neutral but the fact that in the end the film isn't neutral doesn't kill it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I got to see this film because my friend wanted to see Dawson Creek stoned. She got what she wanted the dude was in the movie for about two scenes  he was high as a kite.  But the movie isn't about that and it's not a stoner comedy as the ads make it out to be.  This actually turned out to be the best movie that friend rented in  a while though that's not saying much. It's a drama about small town farmers who decide to grow marijuana to survive in troubled times.  The best part of the film was the storylines involving the farmers themselves and the local Sherriff and DEA agent. Those storylines are realistic and provide interesting motivations and insights about marijuana production and the role of law enforcement.

Doing what she can to keep the injured youngster comfortable Joanna goes to call for help at a local service station. Before she can give her name Joanna hangs up the phone in order to get back to the girl and see if she's all right it's then and there when the nightmare begins for Joanna. Heartwrenching drama that can effect any one of us when you try to do the right thing but are influenced by the words and feelings of those around you. Getting back to the accident site Joanna sees it's cordoned off by the highway police. Before she can tell them what happened and her involvement in it Joanna starts to have second thought about turning herself in. What would at first have been a tragic accident turns out to be a hitandrun with Joanna facing time behind bars if caught. Even far worse she has to live with herself in what she did seeing almost every day the family of the little girl she ran down Kelly Corey Dallas Deremer who goes to the same school as her two daughters Mindy  Holly Gretchen Esau  Kira Posey. Joanna's life starts to come apart as she tries to keep the truth from her friends and family not to mention the Eaton Police of what she was involved with in little Kelly's accident. You can easily see how the words of her friends and neighbors as well as her husband Doug Drew Phillbury about the hit and run effected Joanna. It was those words that had Joanna unable to bring herself to admit what she did not just for her own concern but her two daughters and her husband as well. Feeling that they'll be shunned by the people that they knew as friends as well as neighbors for years. Joanna on the verge of losing her mind tries to implicate her friend Nancy Grayson Sherry Hursey in Kelly's hitandrun accident by trying to plant her earing that she lost in Joanna house at the accident site. It's then that she realizes what she's doing and suddenly stopskeeping her from making an already bad situation even worse not wanting to have Kelly's accident but also innocent Nancy's freedom and reputation on her conscience as well. Margraet Colin gives a stunning performance as the guilt ridden Joanna Kendall and you can really feel for her seeing how she's being eaten up inside and not knowing just what to do. Wanting at first to turn herself in to the police a series of miscalculations causes Joanna to become a fugitive from the law. When she eventually did Joanna became the most hated and despised person in Eaton. Not being herself when still at large Joanna's husband starts to feel that she's either back to smoking or even having an affair. Never in a million years would Doug have thought that Joanna was the person who ran down little Kelly and left her to die on that rain soaked road! The look on his face with his mouth quivering when he found out the truth said it all.The last few minutes of the movie took a lot out of you knowing what Joanna was going through not to downplay the suffering of the injured Kelly Corey and her parents and how she now has to face the music for what she did and have to live with it for the rest of her life.".

After accidentally running over a young child she goes to call for help only to return to the crime scene amidst a group of very angry onlookers. Understanda bly this is too much for her to handle and she flees the scene. Luckily the child didn't die but is seriously injured and in a coma. So starts the biggest struggle in Joanna's life should she keep quiet or speak up? At first she doesn't but eventually she realises that it's torture living with such a horrible secret.At one point she even joins a search party to help find the culprit. And gradually a detective starts to question this woman's behavior. She wants to tell the truth and she never meant to run away from the crime scene but is it worth telling and having the whole town hate you for it?The thing about this movie is that you don't choose sides. Joanna is very much a good role model even though she's made some wrong choices. You feel for her even though you know what she did was wrong. Her journey is a good representation of what any human being would go through if something like this were to happen to them.Margaret Colin is an absolutely brilliant actress. She was amazing in the TV series Now and Again and great in films like Independence Day and The Devil's Own. Her performance here is so realistic and unforced that she carries us singlehandedly through the entire film. In the end I wanted to see more of her. Lisa Vidal also provided some good supporting work as the gentle resourceful detective.To wrap it up if you wanna see a movie that will make you think long afterwards one that will say This is reality then you won't want to miss this one.My rating 910".

Frankly I never thought Margaret Colin's character really got adequate punishment for her crime of hit and run lying to police covering up etc. Could you imagine how the ending would have had to change if she had ended up killing the hit and run victim instead of her ending up coming out of her coma okay? Just something to think about.By the way I play a police detective you can see for a split second and my husband plays another detective you can see quite often we've counted four times. Margaret Colin was great to work with and very down to earth although Lisa Vidal now a Lifetime regular was aloof.Overall the movie turned out to be about a 710 but like another poster commented is still a real tearjerker and makes a great Saturday afternoon cable flick.".

Margaret Colin was great to work with and very down to earth although Lisa Vidal now a Lifetime regular was aloof.Overall the movie turned out to be about a 710 but like another poster commented is still a real tearjerker and makes a great Saturday afternoon cable flick.";

This was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn't be a story.Colin's guilt and anguish are palpable and cause her to act so strangely that a detective gets onto her right away.

Meanwhile the investigating police officer is hurrying to catch the mystery hit  run suspect since she is trying desperately to get pregnant and can't believe someone would hit a little girl and leave her in the road.There were as in every Lifetime movie corny and sappy moments that just make you want to run outside and barf in an old lady's purse they're so bad. But the soundtrack is haunting perfect for the situation the acting was great especially for a TV movie and the plot was thoughtprovoking. We may not have ever done something as drastic as squash a child in the road but everyone has at one point or another lied to cover something up and I'm sure most of us have regretted it. What Joanna suffers isn't so much what other people know but more the mental turmoil of having to know that she's the one all the moms in town are out to find that she's the one who hit that little girl.All in all it's pretty good for a Lifetime movie if you want something new to pass the time this is one of the better ones.".

Then again this is a movie and Joanna was not rational. In my mind cigarette smokers are hardcore drug addicts. But their actions will always harm others due to that vile secondhand smoke. As long as someone doesn't drive after drinking or drink to excess it's not going to hurt anyone. Same with pot. Can't feel sorry for someone who abuses his or her body by smoking then is so addicted to nicotine that he or she cannot concentrate while driving on a narrow winding road especially in bad weather.".

Then again this is a movie and Joanna was not rational. In my mind cigarette smokers are hardcore drug addicts. But their actions will always harm others due to that vile secondhand smoke. As long as someone doesn't drive after drinking or drink to excess it's not going to hurt anyone. Same with pot. Can't feel sorry for someone who abuses his or her body by smoking then is so addicted to nicotine that he or she cannot concentrate while driving on a narrow winding road especially in bad weather.";

I almost lost my child well no thanks to you Joanna should have told the witch.She's the one who belongs in jail along with her husband. Even still a pretty good movie unlike the cheesy crap they usually play.I would recommend this movie to everyone. Also you can't really blame her she did call 911. I may have done the same. At the end of the movie getting off like she did is unrealistic but still a good movie. So be sure to watch this one and keep an open mind. I would probably have given a little higher review but the stupidity of the parents made it impossible.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was playing on Lifetime Movie Network last month and I decided to check it out. I watched for the first 20 minutes and then shut it off bc I am sorry but plot holes that are integral to a movie's plot make the movie nothing but garbage.The movie is about a woman who accidentally runs a child on a bicycle off the road leaves to get help returns only to find out that it's being called a hit and run and there's a hunt for the 'monster' that hurt in the end killed her.This is a movie about a female in an affluent neighborhood who has 2 small grade school children and who is an active sociable woman and yet in order for this movie to work it needs to be believable that she does not own a CELL PHONE. Sorry but that's complete BS especially when everyone else seems to have one  they used theirs to call 911 when they found the girl lying on the side of the road  when our lead female left the scene of the crime to go phone 911 at some payphone. When the lead female comes back the ambulance is already at the girl's side and there is chatter about how horrible the person is who hit and left her.Just DUMB. Sorry but I am not willing buy that this woman doesn't own a cell phone which is needed for the movie to work. Please don't insult my intelligence movie thanks. Maybe if this took place in 1970 or 1960 I'd buy it but it's clearly a present day 1999 at the time movie. ..but wait if she had a cell phone there would be no movie. Pfft.The woman clearly knows about technology since she had computers in her house ones the kids played games on so all the movie had to do was make her cell phone dead in the car making her resort to another way to call the cops.. leaving out a cell phone altogether just created a ridiculous plot.".

She is a mammoth creature given to BIG eye makeup BIG orange hair and BIG expressionsshe is the Charleton Heston of drag and whether she is almost running down a jogger pausing to use the bathroom on some one's front lawn or startling reallife shoppers by taking a stroll along a Baltimore sidewalk she is both unspeakable and unspeakably funny.

She's in competition with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles Mink Stole David Lochary to be named the filthiest person alive. The film shows their attempts to outdo each other.This film is very much NOT for everyone. It's a in your face no holds barred assault in bad taste. Crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches the Marbles pick up female hitchhikers impregnate them keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples Divine and family have a party which includes cannibalism etc etc. It's disgusting but in a way not unwatchable. It's SO over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating. As director John Waters might say it's bad taste done well. Also it's kind of amusing to watchthe acting is so wretched especially by Massey that you just watch it in disbelief. A friend laughed out loud at how bad Massey was she improved in later pictures.This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Even though it's over 30 years old it's STILL shocking. However if you have an open mind and can take a lot of extreme behaviour this is a mustsee. The only part that really was too much is what Divine does at the very end.".

Crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches the Marbles pick up female hitchhikers impregnate them keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples Divine and family have a party which includes cannibalism etc etc. It's disgusting but in a way not unwatchable. It's SO over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating. As director John Waters might say it's bad taste done well. Also it's kind of amusing to watchthe acting is so wretched especially by Massey that you just watch it in disbelief. A friend laughed out loud at how bad Massey was she improved in later pictures.This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Even though it's over 30 years old it's STILL shocking. However if you have an open mind and can take a lot of extreme behaviour this is a mustsee. The only part that really was too much is what Divine does at the very end.";

I read and hear reviews of this movie that express disgust and horror and I picture John Waters chuckling. This was the intent it was meant to upset the status quo and in politically correct times that we live in isn't it a small surprise to see this film come to the forefront again? This is a movie that will freak out the uptight for as long as it exists in any media. It was meant to. As much as Clockwork Orange talked about ultraviolence this movie is all about ultrabad taste. We can numb ourselves to sex and violence but Pink Flamingos is a movie you just will never get used to. There will be something in this movie that will get to you. As a last resort to make sure everyone is offended before you leave the theatre John includes the always discussed poodle scene. No reason for this scene except to make sure he gets you and also to make sure you leave talking about it. Obviously filmed on a budget and using Water's stock cast this is a movie simply about a contest to see who are the filthiest people alive. All the characters are bizarre in one way or another. This movie reminds me of Rocky Horror Picture Show in that everyone in the film has something odd about them and both movies joyfully celebrate these uniquenesses. Not a movie to buy for Mom on Mother's Day... but worth seeing just to say you did.".

In Pink Flamingos his directorial debut he portrays two families locked in combat to see who can be the filthiest person alive. What Divine famously does at the end pretty much answers the question. But even aside from that the movie is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone would usually imagine. You had better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie.

John Waters' intention is certainly to shock the audiences and is certainly very well succeeded. The bizarre characters present some of the most scatological and gross scenes I have ever seen like Divine chewing excrement of dog or Crackers singing with his anus and there is no limit for the sick mind of John Waters. The viewer has to have empty stomach to see the whole movie. In the Extras of the DVD John Waters presents deleted scenes inclusive with the fate of Cookie. The trailer used to promote the film in 1972 is hilarious since it does not show any scene but people being interviewed about the movie. My vote is five.Title Brazil Pink Flamingos".

	schema:reviewBody "What's there to say about Pink Flamingos? It is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really aspire to be like any other movie you've seen. You will either get it or you won't laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust or both. John Waters is an odd filmmaker putting that mildly mixing both innocent childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments intended to...well who knows what his intentions were. It is like a form of assault albeit a funny one.The thing that makes Waters's humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer like the petty rivalries that form the plot of Pink Flamingos. Surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of The Filthiest Person Alive. What makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that Waters creates giddy selfcontained environments and doesn't let you in on the joke right away. The people in his films are completely in tune with one another. For instance when Cotton tells Babs that she doesn't want to accompany her into town because Crackers is bringing his lady friend out to the trailer Babs reacts with a knowing smirk and says to her in a conspiratorial aside That little shed's just PERFECT... At this point we do not know yet that Crackers plans to take his lady friend out to the shed to thrust live chickens at her naked body while Cotton watches orgasmically through a window but this weirdness is totally commonplace and understood by the characters in the fictitiously degenerate world that Waters creates.Another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and Channing the Marbles' deviant butler. The first time we see them Waters cuts jarringly from a scene in Connie's cozy office to Channing descending into the basement where we see that there are two women down there one dead and one very much alive and ped off. Susan is not a cowering victim but is enraged and abusive to Channing leaping up to launch a fullscale verbal attack on her jailer. They both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation and she is not so much intimidated by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and righteously furious. She does not let up for one second while Channing is in her sight and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film. Later in the film when Divine and Crackers break into the Marbles's home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement it represents the total lack of support that Divine and her family have for the brand of depravity that the Marbles are panderinghere is something Divine is unfamiliar with a corruption devised by her newfound rivals and she despises it. Furthermore while kidnapping does not seem like something Divine would think twice about she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free relishing the revenge that they take on Channing.At the other end of the filth spectrum Waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the real world. The first time we see Connie she is belittling a minor character named Sandy Sandstone who has never heard of Divine. Cookie on the other hand reacts with a hilariously matteroffact evaluation of Divine's title as the filthiest person alive revealing that she inhabits this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as well.Something also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles especially Divine who doesn't miss a note. Not once does he falter in the ridiculous garb and character he's been given and it takes Pink Flamingos to a new level or weirdness. People actually believed Divine was like this in real life and it's easy to understand why because while watching the movie you're not really thinking about the movie you're thinking about these people who made it. Since they're really doing the outrageous things in the script you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary.But even more so Pink Flamingos is not so much a movie as it is an event or something that happens to you. Even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now I say mostly because the ahole scene and the chicken scene still make me wince I still find this film to be hilarious and habitforming.".

Some disgusting highlights include Crackers having a date that includes sex acts with chickens a man with a 'singing' anus Divine performing oral sex on her film son and Divine eating actual dogcrap for real!. This truly isn't for the easily offended and even I an avid fan of controversial cinema find it hard to look at at times.

I first saw the film several years ago and in spite of knowing about its reputation I wasn't prepared for it to be such a magnificent exercise in epitomizing bad taste. I have since seen it several times showing it to other people who were usually about as surprised as I was when first seeing it.Pink Flamingos is a film that is absolutely gross and should probably be avoided by squeamish easily offended pansies. However it is also an incredibly hilarious gem that must not be missed by anybody interested in crude black humor and cultcinema. This film truly is one of its kind and simply has to be seen to be believed. I cannot even imagine what controversy it must have caused in 1972 when it still stands proudly as the ultimate highlight of grossness and filthy hilarity. See it!".

Divine and her brewd compete with another family to see who is the filthiest person alive. Have a guess at who'll win that one!?John Waters' early camp films are not for the average viewer. You must appreciate this man's form of art but it definitely IS art! Later films like Hairspray Cry Baby are geared at a main stream audience for which the filmmaker had to tone it down considerably. For the College Camp Scene though there is no substitute for the original 70's camp mastrpieces.For anyone who is a John Waters virgin and would like a recommendation for the next project I suggest Female Trouble . There's so much more to John Waters' vision realized through his muse Divine. The visually stunning grotesquely overweight transvestite is quite credible as Dawn Davenport the high schooler who burned her smalltown bridges when she didn't get her chacha heels for Christmas in Female Trouble. There are many scenes that are definitely not for the squeamish highlighted by the moment where Dawn gives birth alone and bites the ambilical cord like primates would do then without losing a beat gets up to confront the newborn's father via a pay phone.If Pink Flamingos entertained you without giving your stomach a turnover then you can handle anything delivered by the creative genius John Waters. As all directors Waters has had a few duds even if they were box office successes. Avoid the madeupastheygo Pecker a total waste of time. The musically sparcling Cry Baby was trashed by critics but the sound track makes up plenty for a lousy script. The one to beat is the 1988 Hairspray Divine's swan song. Pink Flamingos is the ONE that started it all and put Waters on the cultcity map of the world! Just to be safe have the movie first  then the dinner!".

Divine and her brewd compete with another family to see who is the filthiest person alive. Have a guess at who'll win that one!?John Waters' early camp films are not for the average viewer. You must appreciate this man's form of art but it definitely IS art! Later films like Hairspray Cry Baby are geared at a main stream audience for which the filmmaker had to tone it down considerably.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1971 a legend was born. An outrageous blasphemous freak of nature which shocked disgusted and oddly reflected the times. In 1971 John Waters would perfect his Bmovie making skills with his colorful flamboyant meanspirited epic that would ultimately ensure Divine as THE cult icon of the 70's and push the boundaries of bad taste as far as they would go. This is your worst nightmare made into the greatest cult comedy of all time. This is Pink Flamingos the undisputed filthiest piece of filth in the history of film.I bought this atrocity of a film years ago. Even as an obsessive fan of Bcinema I was completely oblivious to it's reputation I mean I seriously had no idea what I was about to watch. I'll never forget those first words uttered  It's 1030 Babs Babs why isn't the egg man here? At that moment I hadn't the vaguest idea as to what was next. All I knew was that the possibilities were endless. There was no telling how the next hour and 40 minutes could have gone. I just stared in awe with jaw firmly on floor and witnessed an epic battle. A battle of filth vs. evil.Through the ages certain questions have plagued humankind. Questions like where do we come from? What the hell's the deal with the Bermuda Triangle? And Who's filthier Divine and her entourage or Connie and Raymond Marble? Actually no one has ever asked that. Everyone already knows the answer.A random and might I add a rather unrealistic story where a lot of things go shamelessly unexplained. Things such as why would the Marbles assume they are filthier than Divine just because they kidnap girls and have them impregnated by the butler and sell the babies to lesbians? That's not that filthy... it's just plain mean.Of course there's much more to it than that. Soon the Marbles set they're sights on Divine and her entourage. Once they get under Divine's skin we are forced to sit through castrations public exposure incest cannibalism shrimping unhealthy obsessions bestiality. The list goes on and on... and on.Not exactly an organized contest mind you but rather a not so wellthoughtout yet devious plot by 2 jealous perverts to dethrone a Queen. This time Waters holds nothing back and Divine is the very definition of outlandish. There is truly something to offend even the crudest of individuals. I love this movie.Once or twice every decade a Bmovie director comes along and creates something either so bad so hilarious or in this case so disgusting that it transcends Bentertainment all together. Pink Flamingos is just not what you would expect. An understatement? Of course but true nonetheless. A look into the mind of a demented manchild with a rebellious streak a sick yet unique sense of humor and some seriously odd friends. Pink Flamingos is more than just the Waters masterpiece. Pink Flamingos is John Waters which is kind of an intimidating thought. I don't care if you thought Combat Shock was funny or that Peter Jackson's DeadAlive could've used more blood. If you haven't seen Pink Flamingos... then you just haven't seen Pink Flamingos. Nothing could have prepared you for this one. Some years later John Waters would write a script for a sequel entitled Flamingos Forever. A movie which was to be distributed by Troma and would see the return of Divine Cotton Crackers and Miss Edie. The unfortunate death of Edith Massey among other problems would forever prevent this dream come true from happening. In 1971 Waters was king and trash was in but in a perfect world Flamingos would have definitely lasted forever. 1010".

Again thank god for the internet. Nowadays anyone with a cell phone and a computer can be a filmmaker as good as this film and they frequently are.";

The ending was hilarious even though I have found many who disagree with me on that one.The film was though very discreetly portraying contemporary Australian ethnic stereotypes in particular the collision or culture clash if you will between the traditional Anglo Australian and Italo Australian stereotypes and how they found a sort of unity though adversity very nice.I found Vince Colosimo's performance as Tony Stilano an ItaloAustralian Fish 'n Chip shop owner in his thirties to be firstclass his acting was very genuine and convincing through his performance he managed to really bring to the surface the essence or I should say the soul of the Italian Australian stereotype which in reality is not too Italian but not too Australian either Colosimo found that balance breathed into its lungs and gave it life.The Cinematography could have been better more shots of the local area would've been nice from what I can see it was in Melbourne but where in Melbourne? to me it looks like somewhere between Ivanhoe to Bullen though I am not 100 sure on that one.I don't know why so many people are comparing this film to The Castle though they have similar themes running through them Take Away stands in a league of its own.I think the film was Excellent with a capital E it has everything it's funny the jokes are great it deals with contemporary issues facing Australian society the story holds well I loved it!

I've even met one of the screen writers Dave O'neil so I feel kind of a traitor giving this movie a bad review but...  The plot is fairly thin I won't bother relating it... read the synopsis which I can forgive there are plenty of movies that can cover that up with a few decent jokes.  Unfortunately Take Away's jokes cover its plot up like a 2 prostitute's skirt.  Probably the only laughs that came from the 6 other people in the cinema was at the poor acting and dialogue.  Take Away goes down like a week old Dim sim ... You might understand that joke if you see the film but the joke's not worth it.".

The film recounts the sexual and other experiences of a Manhattan man about to be married through selfnarrated flashbacks.

The result is a disjointed rambling story about a boy growing up which fails to  engender empathy and leaves the viewer disconnected unsatisfied and with a bad after taste which taints the mechanical feelgood ending.

I was coasting along comfortably on a sort of Kevin Smith meets Killer Films wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail... with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge.  Far from being taken out of the experience I was brought further in.  This is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal... so I do understand some of the more negative reactions to it.  But I bought in... and enjoyed it immensely.  The flash back type movement in the chronology was effective the characters were wellrealized and the issues raised were human accessible to my experience anyway and interesting.  I was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language dynamics and situations.  This movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the wittyclever romantic genre.  A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect.  Take 2 hours out of your busy schedule and jump into Wirey's world... or you could go rent You've Got Mail 'cause if that appeals to you you won't like this anyway!

There's also many hilarious moments from Wirey's middleschool days that are crude without being potty humor.  It's sad that this movie is so lowrated.  The fact that there are so many 1's makes me think the numbers are cooked I can't see how anyone could see the movie as that abysmal.  Sure this is by no means a typical romantic comedy but it is a very unique viewpoint of a very unique life of a man whose very appeal comes from his detachment a detachment he must overcome before it destroys him.  Give this flick a chance.  It came out of nowhere for me and I feel the richer for it.".

I can still say the same after episode three last night.The show has the feel and look of a firstclass feature film. In fact this type of cable series should make feature film producers start looking over their shoulders. With shows like this and others like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under HBO and Showtime have given the industry something to be very worried about  and deservedly so. I go to the movies about once a week and all I can say is Hollywood better get its act together.The cast is superb notably Michael Ealy and Oded Fehr. Ealy portrays his character an undercover FBI agent with just the right amount of passion conflict and boiling rage. Fehr is evil incarnate although you can say that Dylan's line Sympathy for the Devil is right on the nose here  more on that in a second. What a coup and how ironic to have an Israeli actor play an Arab terrorist. In an interview this gifted actor expressed his revulsion and loathing for what Farik his character represents. It made the part the most challenging thing he's done so far. Knowing that as you watch him execute his nefarious plans makes him even more compelling. Casting nonArabs to play the other terrorists was a stroke of genius on the part of the creators of the show Cyrus Voris and Ethan Reiff. These people are like us and live among usa disturbing thought and a very real possibility that cranks the fear factor way up.The interesting thing about the way that these Islamic extremists are presented to us is that you can't help feeling sympathy for them. They are likable and in their own warped way virtuous. That's another aspect of the show that pulls at the heartstrings and adds to the biting conflict that is the mark of a brilliant drama.You can bet that I'll be watching the rest of the series being broadcast back to back there is a God! for the next two weeks. They are replaying most of the episodes throughout this week so if you missed the first ones you'll have the opportunity to catch up. I suggest you start with Ep. 1 if you can although each one stands very well on its own.".

It wasn't just the reality of it though that was unsettling especially for someone who lives in the LA area and knows a lot of those locations.But it was the way I was relating to the characters especially the members of the cell besides Farik. I would find myself agreeing with some of the things they said or empathizing with them in some other way  really just seeing them as human. The show would start taking me down that path and then utterly ruthlessly snap me back when those same characters did something to remind me of what they are and what they've become. Each time  as much as I should have expected it  it came as a shock.This is a great series but overall watching it was a pretty unsettling experience. It forced me to ask a lot of questions I simply don't have the answers for. And I don't think anyone else does either. The best comparisons to other material would be to the films Traffic and Syriana but because of the length 10 hours as compared to 2.5 and the focus on just a few characters the emotional investment in this story was a lot greater.In terms of what to expect this is not an easy to digest fastpaced show  I think the analogies to 24 are offbase in that respect. Yeah it has to do with terrorism  so do Victory at Entebbe and Executive Decision  but really it doesn't have much in common with movies and TV shows in that genre. The spiritual roots of this series are in material like Wiseguy to which there's a nice tip of the hat in episode 5 or Donnie Brasco about the experience of an undercover agent. If you are expecting lots of things going boom  well this might not be what you're looking for.The performances are topnotch especially Michael Ealy and Oded Fehr. The entire series has a sense of realism throughout that keeps the tension strong throughout. Just excellent work all around and Showtime deserves serious kudos for upping the quality of its original offerings with a series like this.".

Icey cold on the outside but still a good human being underneath trying his best to keep his head afloat in a highly emotional rollercoaster ride that FBI has had him embark on. Oder Fehr on the other hand comes off a guy that pretty much could fit into any social scenario. Big and strong but yet able to disappear into the gray mass if so needed. Highly authoritative and extremely cunning. The way the two communicate on screen is nothing short of spectacular.The way the story develops and the level of detail that the script offers makes the whole story extremely believable and also very true to life I would imagine. It is of such magnitude that you're left with the feeling of being insecure not knowing what might happen next in real life.

It's a sure winner in my eyes and I have no problems stating that this series is on my list of all time best.";

Its the story of an American Muslim working for the FBI going undercover and joining a Muslim terrorist organization that is hell bent on bringing chaos and terror to America.What makes a drama tick is making the viewers involved with the characters. One must feel for the people in the story or else it just becomes a bunch of people on TV. The show gives adequate information about the main character Darwyn AlHakim and his reason for going undercover. Oded who plays the leader of the cell gives a very chilling icedownthespine performance. the rest of the team members are all nonArabs and they have a reason to be here or at least one of them have. They make you feel for these people at the same time make you feel bad that you are actually feeling sorry for the bad guys. THats what is called drama.I'll have to now soon get this on DVD for my collection because i feel that this is going to be one of those really good TV series that are too short but worth it like Band of Brothers.".

So much so that it is difficult to watch because of the feelings mostly of fear that it generates. Michael Ealy as Darwyn is performing fabulously. You can see and feel the conflict and stress his character faces as an undercover agent with the sole responsibility to uncover and prevent a major terrorist event.And Oden Fehr as the cell leader is downright frightening. He's extremely good looking charming and very easily fits into 'Anywhere' America. His cold blooded anything for the cause attitude is so scary.What's the most frightening is that this cell isn't comprised of 'obvious' enemies. Probably very much like real life. We can only hope there are really a few Darwyn's out there as well.I'm hooked!".

Michael Ealy held his own well though in some scenes I wondered why he wasn't shot on the spot because of the scowl he wore on his face.The pros of the series are the two leads Fehr and Ealy the well written charactersall of which were believable and tragic and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story. Having been married to a Muslim myself the atmosphere created was quite realistic. The cons for me personally were that the female TA was overkillmost seemed gratuitous as well as some of the sex scenes. Despite that it is a raw gripping series that will make you think. Somebody give Fehr more juicy roles like this one and let him run with it. He's got incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating off him.".

It saddens me because this show had the potential to be extremely good. The strangest thing about Sleeper Cell is if you only see one episode you will have a completely warped perspective on what political message the show is trying to send. let me give an example the first episode made the al queda sleeper cell to appear extremely non descript 2 fluent naturally English speaking Arabic men 3 Caucasian men and 1 African American Muslim. The goal of the show at first seemed to be lets scare the Sht out of the American public by making them even more paranoid about terrorists than they already are. The terrorist cell acted like the Joe pesci deniro and Ray liotta in Goodfellas. In the first episode they confront a fellow member by burying him up to his head in sand and stoning him to death for bragging to his friends about their planned attack. To me it was even more charactered than a Mafia movie. So my thoughts were after the first episode were Wow this is definitely some sort of anti Muslim scare American propaganda show but i was extremely surprised that in a following episode the political message seemed to completely 180. A young Muslim boy from Afghanistan comes to America hoping to be recruited to the sleeper cell. Through out the episode we learn that he was wrongly accused of being a terrorist by the American when he was actually a farmer in Afghanistan. His rival neighbor had sold him and his family out to the American army for a large cash reward. You then follow his story to the Abu Garib prison where he was tortured over and over again until he admitted he was an Al queda member. Upon his release by this time he had harbored so much hatred against America that now he actually wanted to commit terrorism The episode almost tried to make you sympathize with this character for the Americans turning him into a terrorist.very strange show indeed although sometimes very campy and hard to take seriously this show still makes me paranoid question the war on terror and realize that a terrorist attack either real or hoaxed can happen at any time.".

In talking with Showtime Executives they formally addressed a miniseries to captivate a general audience in the US. Since this was accomplished and since the show was nominated by the board for the Golden Globe Awards it seems in some slight way Sleeper Cell is spreading again one more final season. Showtime Executives told me that the show was once and for all completed and was looking to spread the cell farther into the suburbs with a DVD MiniSeries. So what if the DVD sales jump are we seeing a trend of miniseries turning season series. For Sleeper Cell this is everyone's question. Are we going to see some of the characters one more time? Showtime said NO. This is the final season Sleeper Cell is no more. We discussed in an open forum about the last episode and how it was telling the story of a local jihad's group quest for glory. Much of the episode's goal was to show the audiences Farikh's rise and fall and more importantly leave the mystery within. But like with all mysteries they can be solved. Heres what I gathered from the writers and actors of Sleeper Cell.Darwyn and the FBI wanted to get Farikh out and even dead. But as for the other members Darwyn wanted them alive to keep the alert on other sleeper cells around the US. This is why it was hard for Darwyn to kill Christian in one of the scenes. It was clear that Christian's duties was selfsuicide after slaughter. Darwyn was still captured in his innocence and decided to street fight him than kill him without knowing if he would take the right side. Well we know what he chose.Ilija's was the second man in the plan he was instructed to cause the fire alarm in the stadium. But his real mission after wards was a mystery. It turns out that Ilija was to stay at the stadium and fuel the chaos. But as he found out the plan of attack did go through as he saw the MAN get shot in the stadium he ran out. The writers wanted to show a reaction but if they did there would not be any mystery of Ilija's plan.Crazy Boy I like to call him decided to stop in the middle of traffic and take his vengeance of his life to the innocent people. He did not tell Darwyn his plan due to the fact Darwyn was a devoted Muslim  he simply did not want him to interfere.The denouncement the writers wanted to show was the change in IIija's self esteem to becoming more of an American. In a shot they wanted to create IIija was to turn his belief in music to reality.As for Darwyn he finds nothing but an ordinary life.".

Little does Farik know that Darwyn also has a secret identity an undercover FBI agent trying to bring down Farik's terrorist sleeper cell.The idea that terrorist sleeper cells are lying wait in America posing as our friend and neighbors is one too baffling and frightening for most people to comprehend. Every once in a while 24 will embrace the post911 view of terrorism but nothing on TV touches the subject like Sleeper Cell. Hopefully this will change but to date nothing matches the intelligence thoughtfulness and nuanced realism of Sleeper Cell. Created by Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris the show digs deep into every angle of every highly debatable issue surrounding Islam terrorism and American policy in a post 911 world. Cell takes all this and turns it into an immensely entertaining cinemaquality thrillride. You most likely won't end up more educated about terrorism or global politics and many may object to such a cavalier Hollywood approach to such a serious subject but for what it is worth the balance is flawless.Inside the action Sleeper Cell depicts the war on terror as between Muslim vs. Muslim with peaceful Darwyn coming up against a group of zealots who have perverted his religion to justify murder and mayhem. While reading a description like that you might as well be listening to a presidential rallying speech but the way Cell brings it to life is eyeopening. Armed with a versed knowledge of the religion's history and quoted passages from the Qu'ran the show has written every angle  the proforce right the conspiracy theorist left and the terrorist dogma  with the same versatile rationality of a person who believes each of these views. Often shows get praised for espousing an opinion. My problem with many of them such as Dick Wolf and David E. Kelley's stuff is that every character espouses a single opinion and the other side is broadly depicted or only there to be ridiculed when the real world is more like Sleeper Cell honest cases are made for each side  even the villain's without sympathizing with terrorism.The performances are spot on. Fehr is the picture of frightening charm as a leader should be. Elay says pages of dialog across his face tortured by what he has to do to maintain his cover particularly when those around him start to die. With all the talk about the culture clash between the west and the middle east let's not underplay how riveting exciting and purely entertaining in a rare way this show is. We watch with twisted fascination as the terrorists put their plans together and then cheer for them to be ripped apart at the same time. Season 1's strength is the way it takes us through this process  from the financing to the training to the choice of date and target. All the while actually making us want to see how far the cell will get with their plans.Having sewed up the story pretty tight at the end of season 1 or the first miniseries I'm not sure Season 2 or the sequel miniseries American Terror does a bit of a contortion to bring them back. Like any good sequel it succeeds by building off the characters. The show occasionally wanders off into the personal lives of cell members and looses focus but when it ultimately gets down to business the entire season smartly builds toward a grand wildweststyle confrontation between Farek and Darwyn the result is as intense and satisfying as anything you'll see outside of a Jack Bauer interrogation.Sleeper Cell is one of the most criminally underwatched and underrated shows on TV and a possible headliner for Showtime. I definitely want more but the selfcontained first season and its livewire sequel are enough to keep me content for now. TV is not a medium where a nuanced and intelligent piece of pulp entertainment is often rewarded. Don't pass up this chance. One of the very best dramas on TV.     4".

With all the talk about the culture clash between the west and the middle east let's not underplay how riveting exciting and purely entertaining in a rare way this show is. We watch with twisted fascination as the terrorists put their plans together and then cheer for them to be ripped apart at the same time. Season 1's strength is the way it takes us through this process  from the financing to the training to the choice of date and target. All the while actually making us want to see how far the cell will get with their plans.Having sewed up the story pretty tight at the end of season 1 or the first miniseries I'm not sure Season 2 or the sequel miniseries American Terror does a bit of a contortion to bring them back. Like any good sequel it succeeds by building off the characters. The show occasionally wanders off into the personal lives of cell members and looses focus but when it ultimately gets down to business the entire season smartly builds toward a grand wildweststyle confrontation between Farek and Darwyn the result is as intense and satisfying as anything you'll see outside of a Jack Bauer interrogation.Sleeper Cell is one of the most criminally underwatched and underrated shows on TV and a possible headliner for Showtime. I definitely want more but the selfcontained first season and its livewire sequel are enough to keep me content for now. TV is not a medium where a nuanced and intelligent piece of pulp entertainment is often rewarded. Don't pass up this chance. One of the very best dramas on TV.     4";

	schema:reviewBody "The other reviews for The Stranger were all very negative. Well for some reason I didn't hate this one and enjoyed watching it. Am I saying it was great? Nah...but it's worth seeing.The story is a bit like the movie Journey to the Far Side of the Sun combined with 1984 and was intended as a pilot for a potential series. Back during the run of the ABC Movie of the Week it wasn't uncommon for the network to show pilotseither to see if the public liked them or to recoup their losses when they knew they weren't going to do the series. This one ultimately was not bought by the networkwhich was usually the case for these films. One exception that comes off the top of my head was the Nightstalker series...and I am sure a few more were first shown here and then became TV shows. Considering others didn't seem to like it I guess the network did well by not approving the series!An astronaut Glenn Corbett is in space one moment and the next he wakes up in a hospital. This was pretty sloppy and showed that the budget wasn't very high for this project. Anyway the hospital folks are trying to act like everything is normal but they are actually watching him closely as they know he's an alien and comes from a planet called 'Earth'. These Terrans look like humans and act much like them but they also live in a parallel world that isn't quite the same. The biggest difference is that the government is very repressive and their way of dealing with problems is violent and nasty...and after he escapes ? they pull out all the stops to kill him. Can the astronaut manage to survive and even get help from these Terrans?Okay...there were a few plot problems I mentioned above. Additionally Corbett didn't have the best screen presence I've ever seen. But the story is interesting and kept me watching. In fact I might have enjoyed a TV series like this one.".

However the whole thing sank without a trace and TV is probably better off for it.Everyone here is perfectly adequate in a 'made for TV' way. Cameron Mitchell turns in his usual solid performance. So does Glenn Corbett who seems to be a kind of poor man's John Saxon who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the 'World Order' on counter Earth.But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this SciFi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad.I'll give one example in the original template for this pilot Doppleganger the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again. Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers.In Stranded in Space the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound things start shaking and the camera blurs into a blackout and as a friend pointed out it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats the director wasn't even shaking the camera or the set. I've seen episodes of The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this madeforTV mediocrity.And that in essence is what's wrong with Stranded In Space. No budget no time no imagination...just making the token gestures and hoping the scifi Fan Boys' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. Sorry guys it didn't work. I'm sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away and never thought of it again except as a listing on their C.V. And that's what you the viewer will do.

That film benefited from incredible FX work from Derek Meddings a great score from Barry Gray and a good cast and had a haunting ending.The Stranger doesn't have any of that. The plotan astronaut Glenn Corbettblown up in spacefinds himself on a parallel earth we learn it is called Terraone assumes the play on the word terror as well as Terra meaning Earth with three moons. He wakes upa prisoner in what turns out is a mental hospitalto a very paranoid and notgivingmuchinfo hospital staff. Managing to escape he finds out he's on this creepy alternate version of earth but ruled by a totalitarian government called The Perfect Order and is pursued by Cameron Mitchell a ruthless agent of the secret police for this government. The agents drive around in ominous looking Plymouthsthat do not sound like Earth cars and wear these strange knit jackets with wide lapels and they've cautioned everyone that a dangerous mental patient has escaped and that he must be found. Our astronaut manages to evade capture by dressing like the inhabitantswho dress unfashionably drab sort of like old 60's Communist Russia. When he starts asking questionssuch as a scene in a bookstore when he asks What came before the Perfect Order? suspicion is aroused and up pops Mitchell and his thugs who threaten the already paranoid citizens with Ward E a sinister mental asylum. They'll do anything to cooperate and earn citizen points rather than face the ominous Ward E so Corbett is off again in The Fugitivestyle escapes. The evils of Ward E are illustrated when another administrator Tim O' Connor confides to Mitchell that he wonders if this visitor has something to say and maybe this Perfect Order is wrong. Later we see him sitting in the middle of a weird surrealistic room in hospital clothing completely docile and vegetative and Mitchell warns him over his shoulder how he has paid the price for doubting. Meanwhile our astronaut befriends a young doctorSharon Acker who not only believes his story of coming fromand wanting to go back toanother earthbut seems to have feelings for him. Eventually she is captured and hooks up with him later saying she escaped. He wants to use this society's slightly better space technology which is hinted at by Perfect Order elders that they'll eventually use to invade Earth to escape this madness. When they get to the launch facility she implores him not to gohe's already put on a space suit and in the struggle she reveals she was in fact taken for treatments at Ward E and has been brainwashed to lead him back to the authorities. He sets off an alarm which incapacitates Ackerrevealing the nature of the Ward E treatmentswho crumbles grasping her head and he attempts to get aboard the spaceship. She's recaptured and the last we see is Mitchell telling her she's failed and it's back to Ward Eforeveras she screams. The launch fails and he winds up staring wistfully at the three moons all set up for a TV series that never happened.The biggest thing this film had working against it was lack of a budget. The FX are nonexistent space stuff is all stock and a shot of the Terra launch facility simply looks like Cape KennedyVandenberg AFB footage at night. The three moons are nothing more than three balls just hung on string in front of a star fieldvery cheesy. It has the claustrophobicshotinanoldoffice building feel that many of those MadeforTV'ers suffered from. Also everything seems very convenient. He appears to have escaped into a regular New Englandlooking back lot townthat seems very near the space facility. It has a creepy moment when he takes the scarf off Sharon Acker's head to see her temple areas disfigured horribly from shock treatments though I saw this coming a mile away the fact she shows up inexplicably and with a head scarf on.It was a film very much of it's time that Gerry Anderson did much better earlier but downplayed the political angle of it.".

	schema:headline " It is not a timeless classic but it was made in a certain moment";
	schema:reviewBody "I suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is.I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973 when it was The Stranger and I loved it. Such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality when shows like Search UFO and 6M Man were showing a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future. Adventure and technology.You got to see shows only once and that was when the network aired them. The only way people could slash your shows was by making their own parody of it they didn't get to take your show and add in their own comments over it.I did not know what this concept of a pilot was. I saw the movie and was hoping thru out that Stryker would get home did not know that there was a possibility of it continuing beyond two hours.Back then would I understood what so many people hate about the movie now? I doubt it because I don't remember it as such. Do I understand now? Not really for to understand the story one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the movie.If one is watching as an American it might be humorous about the lack of security in a police state.....but if one is a subject in that state then compliance could be expected and security can be less. When things are suppose to be perfect perfect to an extreme degree perfect that one is not suppose to doubt then one is not likely to question as quickly when things are out of order.The subplots of the movie are interesting such as the old man who remembers the time before but watches his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere. Or that the police state values knowledge to some extent for they are careful about how they control or harm their brain power.These days one is likely to know exactly what the movie is about before they see it so much of the suspense surprise is lost. But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR. One gets quite a distance into the movie before it becomes apparent that such a possibility is the least of his concerns.This is the primary difference between The Stranger and Doppelganger. The latter can be considered timeless since any comments it has about the USSR are comparatively minor and lost early on in the movie. In the former those links are through out the movie supposedly directly in the beginning and then as a theme variation after wards.All that said despite my fond memory for the movie it is rather easy to see that it would not have made it as a series. Each week Stryker would make friends Benedict would chase Stryker would get away. Eventually Benedict's society would get rid of him. Someone else would pick up the chase. A rut would develop. There might be a jab at something new such as perhaps another crew member from Stryker's mission showing up but it probably would not be enough to keep the show going.If one goes in with the knives that others have used to slash the movie odds are they will slash it as well. But if one remembers that this was made during the Cold War and what fears and estimations of the other side were during that time of what the popular environment contained for the viewer then they may find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is.I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973 when it was The Stranger and I loved it. Such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality when shows like Search UFO and 6M Man were showing a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future. Adventure and technology.You got to see shows only once and that was when the network aired them. The only way people could slash your shows was by making their own parody of it they didn't get to take your show and add in their own comments over it.I did not know what this concept of a pilot was. I saw the movie and was hoping thru out that Stryker would get home did not know that there was a possibility of it continuing beyond two hours.Back then would I understood what so many people hate about the movie now? I doubt it because I don't remember it as such. Do I understand now? Not really for to understand the story one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the movie.If one is watching as an American it might be humorous about the lack of security in a police state.....but if one is a subject in that state then compliance could be expected and security can be less. When things are suppose to be perfect perfect to an extreme degree perfect that one is not suppose to doubt then one is not likely to question as quickly when things are out of order.The subplots of the movie are interesting such as the old man who remembers the time before but watches his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere.

In this case it's easy to see why it didn't make it. First off there's nothing new about the show's setup. It was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by The Fugitive or The Incredible Hulk or Planet of the Apes. You know a stranger constantly on the move going from one town to the next taking whatever odd job he can all the while being pursued by a government agency or newspaper reporter. It's a formula that's been done to death. The second strike against Stranded in Space is its lead Glenn Corbett. Could this guy come across any less likable? I was rooting for him to get caught. Without sympathy for the main character this kind of show would never work. Finally this is supposed to be science fiction. Just because everyone is lefthanded and someone has hung three fake looking moons on the horizon I'm supposed to jump to the conclusion that this is some distant planet? So it's a mere coincidence that they all speak English dress just like people on Earth and drive Plymouth Furies? Yeah right.The lone highlight for me was the inclusion of Cameron Mitchell in the cast. Sure it's difficult to watch him in something this dreadful but you know the old saying  any Cameron is better than no Cameron yeah I've never heard it either.As with a lot of these 70s madeforTV movies I watched Stranded in Space courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I wouldn't call it a great episode by any stretch of the imagination but there are a few good jokes along the way. So in the end while I rate the movie a 210 it gets a 35 on my MST3K rating scale.".

	schema:headline " It started off interestingly enough but never really takes off";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this pilot movie for a television show that never came to be on the riff show Mystery Science Theater 3000. Apparently it too received the same treatment as such other MST3K classic episodes Pod People and Cave Dwellers where we get a title sequence that comes from an entirely different film all together before being treated to the actual film. It is a rather misleading tactic and one has to wonder why they do it. In Pod People the film they show actually looks like it might be better and more horrific than the one we get. In Cave Dwellers the film they show looks more serious and older than the one we get. Here we get a super science fiction looking show and what we get starts out somewhat promising and then kind of falters by really going nowhere all that special. From this film it looks like the show was going to be a take on an earlier show The Fugitive with a few science fiction elements but not all that many considering it takes place on another planet. Basically nearly everything thing is the same on this planet our hero finds himself on right down to the cars! The story has three astronauts experiencing some trouble in space. One of them ends up in a hospital where there is something not quite right. Turns out that he is not on Earth but another planet where some sort of oppressive government which at first is trying to get information from the astronaut but then switches to wanting to kill him because he may pose a threat to their 'perfect' society. He goes on the run and gets the aid of a nurse and a man who happens to help with the space program but has disdain for the order so he and the astronaut devise a plan that may get him off the planet.This made for an interesting episode of MST3K. Honestly during the first section of film I was actually more interested in what was happening in the movie than their riffs as it played out rather good...at first. Then it never goes anywhere and just becomes The Fugitive only with the very light science fiction elements. Thankfully their riffs were good when the story was going stale so it made for an entertaining episode of the show. I liked how they kept trying to get up and leave when the movie looked as if it were going off due to commercial.So it was not a totally bad film but it just needed more. It was interesting up to a point and then it just became kind of a mess. It becomes guy on run and bad guys closing in and then guy finds a way to slip passed them. Pretty sure this one would not have lasted for too many seasons because there is only so much you can do with the premise. The government pretty much had a lot of people under its influence so it would have started becoming unbelievable say he had kept running into people who just happen to hate the order. So probably for the best it was just a one episode wonder the main bad thing about it though is no closure.".

Every Terran spaceport would be alert to him after this. Also being on their toes the Perfect Order would have been steadily improving their chances of catching Neil by imprinting his face in every mind. Now that said it could have been interesting if Neil discovered a totally different thing going on the steady erosion and breakdown of the Perfect Order  a growing dissidence that the Order cannot deal with. The suspense would be what happens first? Neil is caught Ward E'd and killed or the dissidence becomes organized and he's in the dilemma of staying out of it or helping it.The movie would have been helped if there were clues that the history of the planet was identical to Earth up to the time of WW2 explaining the similar technology and if most of the cars seen were less popular and more unusual models seen so often that they seem to be the preferred models. The three moons should have had some texture some cratering and maria and shifted position from night to night so that at the end of the movie one is missing and the other two are further apart. Also there should have been at least a few northpaws  in a society that views righthandedness as being as sinister as our society used to regard lefthandedness. Maybe in Ward E they fix people who are righthanded. Now what if Bettina was righthanded but they let her pass then they fixed her while doing the other conditioning and Dylan wondered about it when she reappeared.I noticed that all the guards  the rank and file  seemed to be old guys  in their mid to late 40s or early 50s  and thus old enough to remember prePerfect Order conditions. They look older than Benedict and Dr. Revere so it looks like they cast guys happy for the work not because they looked like young welleducated supporters of the system.But I liked the touch of authoritarianism and the perverse fact that it had solved poverty crime and disease but was ruthless against thoughtcrime a 1984 term that could cause such problems.".

Featuring several actors from an amazing array of bmovies and madefortv flics this turkey might appeal to the diehard fan of velveeta cheese spam andor atari 2600 but not to the masses except perhaps those watching a uhf channel at 3 in the morning after a binge at the local pub.  Seemingly a failed pilot for a predoomed series the only thing going for this movie is the sheer ability to crack jokes about the plot.  Come on...An astronaut adrift in space wakes up to find himself in a hospital bed surrounded by slightlyparanoid medical staff.  Later he finds out through the silliest of methods that he's actually on a twin planet to earth on the other side of the sun where we can never see.  He wanders off actually it's supposed to be an escape but my grandmother's escape from the nursing home would be more exciting to watch not to mention more challenging and the government wants him back of course to pry from him certain details I won't spoil it.  Later we find out that their space technology is slightly better than ours as he manages to steal a shuttle for the trip back home anyone doped up on sleeping pills could have been more sneaky and why would they have to pry in the first place.  Didn't they get his ship too?.  And to top it all off he crashes into the ocean only to find himself....sorry not allowed to spoil it.  Too bad because the truly pathetictwist climax whatever you'd prefer to call it proves just how much of a groaner this film is. the end.And thank heaven they didn't make the series!   Great flick for drunkenbouts cheesefests and latenight viewing but nothing I'd want to suffer through again.I can't even believe I went on about this turkey for more than a few sentences.Watch it on one of those mondo make it funny shows late at night but please don't watch it alone.

	schema:reviewBody "There was a time back before USA became the home of Emmyaward winning programming when you could turn on the TV on a Saturday night and be treated to such highbrow programming as Slugs Shock Waves and the pervasively atmospheric creepfest Tourist Trap. Out of all the horror films I remember from my childhood TT arguably left the most visible mark. As my family would gather around the TV and behold the spooky wonder of a house full of mannequins my father was a fan of Chuck Connors as The Rifleman I would go to my room and cower under the bed when things got too scary. For as much as this film and others frightened me I was simultaneously drawn to the discomfort they produced. Scenes of a woman's face being turned into a plaster mask a man impaled by a flying pipe and a knife to the back of the skull left haunting marks on my neuroses that periodically popped up in the years that followed during which unfortunately TT was near impossible to find on VHS.Having 'grown up' considerably since that time and recently revisiting the 'ol Trap on DVD I must say it has lost only a smidgen of its ability to shock. As a child I didn't pay as much attention to pacing especially with commercial breaks inserted every 10 minutes or acting quality because the horrific events were amplified tenfold in my eyes and mind.Now a lot of the acting seems overthetop and amateurish Connors however maintains a professional veneer throughout and some scenes drag to the point where the subtitle Just killing time should be superimposed at the bottom of the screen. Granted these are just minor quibbles from a fancritic who has seen much worse instances of both these traits.Though TT still maintains a sense of terror that builds as the film progresses my downgraded impression of it has come from being exposed to Carrie Halloween The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Psycho and others that TT writerdirector David Schmoeller liberally borrows from. However he incorporates the killerwithpsychicpowers angle with great skill careful not to overextend his homage to the point of parody creating something genuinely offbeat as a result.

	onyx:emotionText "There was a time back before USA became the home of Emmyaward winning programming when you could turn on the TV on a Saturday night and be treated to such highbrow programming as Slugs Shock Waves and the pervasively atmospheric creepfest Tourist Trap. Out of all the horror films I remember from my childhood TT arguably left the most visible mark. As my family would gather around the TV and behold the spooky wonder of a house full of mannequins my father was a fan of Chuck Connors as The Rifleman I would go to my room and cower under the bed when things got too scary. For as much as this film and others frightened me I was simultaneously drawn to the discomfort they produced. Scenes of a woman's face being turned into a plaster mask a man impaled by a flying pipe and a knife to the back of the skull left haunting marks on my neuroses that periodically popped up in the years that followed during which unfortunately TT was near impossible to find on VHS.Having 'grown up' considerably since that time and recently revisiting the 'ol Trap on DVD I must say it has lost only a smidgen of its ability to shock. As a child I didn't pay as much attention to pacing especially with commercial breaks inserted every 10 minutes or acting quality because the horrific events were amplified tenfold in my eyes and mind.Now a lot of the acting seems overthetop and amateurish Connors however maintains a professional veneer throughout and some scenes drag to the point where the subtitle Just killing time should be superimposed at the bottom of the screen. Granted these are just minor quibbles from a fancritic who has seen much worse instances of both these traits.Though TT still maintains a sense of terror that builds as the film progresses my downgraded impression of it has come from being exposed to Carrie Halloween The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Psycho and others that TT writerdirector David Schmoeller liberally borrows from. However he incorporates the killerwithpsychicpowers angle with great skill careful not to overextend his homage to the point of parody creating something genuinely offbeat as a result. As is properly cited on the DVD the film branches off into different levels of insanity to the point where kindly Mr. Slausen's Connors mannequins begin to resemble real live people...Not a masterpiece but far from a waste of time Tourist Trap is a montage of elaborate facemasks creepy vocal distortion atmospheric nights and desperate panicked emotion.

	schema:reviewBody "The slasher subgenre has been pretty much exhausted  in fact even by 1979 just one year after the supposed 'first slasher' Halloween which was released seven years after Bay of Blood was released the subgenre wasn't far from being exhausted but Tourist Trap represents one of the more original outings. The film follows the same basic formula as most slashers  i.e. madman murders a load of kids but draws its originality from the fact that madman is shown from the beginning as opposed to an unseen assailant or a man in a mask and we actually get some insight into his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities including being able to control the wax dummies that fill his house adds to the originality. We kick off with a great opening sequence which sees a young man fall foul of having a flat tire after finding himself in a gas station of terror. The scene is amazingly creepy as the wax dummies taunt him and things fly from the shelves  and it gives the audience a great insight into what is to come namely a very creepy horror film! The acting credibility is as nonexistent as you would expect from a seventies slasher but to be honest it's not all that bad. The girls look hot the boys don't really matter and Chuck Connors is more than adequately creepy in the role of the psycho. He's not exactly Anthony Perkins but still good enough. It's not the acting that's the star of the show however and as you might expect  the creepy atmosphere takes that prize. Wax models as proved by the likes of House of Wax Vincent Price version... are very creepy and the film makes best use of that fact. There are very few things in cinema that can be frightening by simply being there  but wax statues are definitely one of those things. The killer's special ability could easy have gotten in the way of the atmosphere but the film makes best use of this fact even by having various things fly off shelves and it goes well with the rest of the movie. On the whole this is a very good film. While Tourist Trap might not be absolutely essential viewing it's well worth seeing and I can recommend it.".

Then you see Tourist Trap and you think 'how did I miss this film?' which could easily be discussed in the same breath with Halloween Nightmare on Elm St. and Creepshow.This is a great fun scary movie. It helps that mannequins are naturally a bit creepy being so lifelike. I recall that excellent Twilight Zone episode with Anne Francis with the mannequins moving in the department store. Tourist Trap has a big scare scene very early on which could have been too much too soon but it really worked and set the unnerving tone that the rest of the film continues. It made me realize how long it's been since I 'jumped' because of an unexpected scene in a scary movie.Tanya Roberts was very good in this  much better than she was as Sheena a few years later. The gore is not excessive for the sake of titillation and the tension is unrelenting. The ghastly images of the mannequin mouths dropping so far open and the screams coming out will stay burned in my mind for a long time to come.".

	schema:headline " Highly Memorable '70s Horror.";
	schema:reviewBody "Tourist Trap is a bizarre great horror film from the '70s. The film is about a group of young adults Becky Jerry and Molly who are traveling in a jeep through a desert area. Their two other friends Eileen and her boyfriend Woody are in a separate car. When a wheel goes flat Woody takes it to a nearby gas station  and meets a grisly fate to some bizarre telekinetic mayhem and some creepy mannequins. The friends get tired of waiting for Woody and go to a local tourist trap mannequinwax museum. In front of the entrance the car randomly breaks down and the girls find an oasis area to go swimming in where they are approached by Mr. Slausen who runs the roadside attraction that is now closed down. He takes them up to the old western wax museum and the girls stay behind while he and Jerry go to fix their car. Eileen the curious of the two wanders to an old house nearby where she also falls to the hands of a mysterious masked killer and a bunch of life like mannequins. After awaiting for Eileen Becky and Molly go to look for her. That's when the real horror begins and the telekinetic can move objects with his mind masked brother of Mr. Slausen begins to kill off the teens one by one while controlling his large amount of humanturned mannequins.Sound similar to the 2005 House of Wax remake? Well it is. I'd heard of this movie but never seen it when I saw House of Wax but now I can see the striking similarities the two movie share  Tourist Trap was obviously a big contributor to the House of Wax remake. The mannequins in this movie are scary to begin with some with moving eyeballs some with no eyes at all and some with dropping mouths that sing too. The singing was extremely creepy if you ask me and the mannequins were eerily designed. Mannequins are creepy to begin with they're so lifelike yet they really aren't. The movie tightly blends elements from Texas Chainsaw Massacre the masks the killer uses are similar to those of Leatherface with a little bit of the original House of Wax and the telekinetic powers that are displayed in Carrie. The result is quite satisfying. The telekinesis was a nice touch to the movie it made the killer all the more menacing and inescapable. The masks were terrifying and the plastering scene was really disturbing.The score for the film was really well done if not a little overused during some scenes. The acting may not be particularly on key but it really wasn't that bad. Chuck Connors was really good as the shadowy Mr. Slauston giving the character a shady but friendly feel. A young Tanya Roberts is also in the film she's most known for her role on Charlie's Angels and more recently the sitcom That '70s Show playing Donna's mother. Robert A. Burns serves as the art director he did a phenomenal job on the original Texas Chainsaw and does a good job here as well creating a cluttered musty atmosphere to both the rundown museum and the old house filled with mannequins. I found it a little odd that the original rating for the film was PG it seems a little too scary to have such a tame rating but the film really isn't too violent.Overall Tourist Trap is an eerily unique fast paced extremely underappreciated horror classic. Full Moon gave it a decent 20th anniversary DVD release the commentary was interesting and the picture was clear and crisp for the most part better than the video versions. If you enjoy older '70s slasherhorror films Tourist Trap is an underrated retro gem. 810.".

The singing was extremely creepy if you ask me and the mannequins were eerily designed. Mannequins are creepy to begin with they're so lifelike yet they really aren't. The movie tightly blends elements from Texas Chainsaw Massacre the masks the killer uses are similar to those of Leatherface with a little bit of the original House of Wax and the telekinetic powers that are displayed in Carrie. The result is quite satisfying. The telekinesis was a nice touch to the movie it made the killer all the more menacing and inescapable. The masks were terrifying and the plastering scene was really disturbing.The score for the film was really well done if not a little overused during some scenes. The acting may not be particularly on key but it really wasn't that bad. Chuck Connors was really good as the shadowy Mr. Slauston giving the character a shady but friendly feel. A young Tanya Roberts is also in the film she's most known for her role on Charlie's Angels and more recently the sitcom That '70s Show playing Donna's mother. Robert A. Burns serves as the art director he did a phenomenal job on the original Texas Chainsaw and does a good job here as well creating a cluttered musty atmosphere to both the rundown museum and the old house filled with mannequins. I found it a little odd that the original rating for the film was PG it seems a little too scary to have such a tame rating but the film really isn't too violent.Overall Tourist Trap is an eerily unique fast paced extremely underappreciated horror classic. Full Moon gave it a decent 20th anniversary DVD release the commentary was interesting and the picture was clear and crisp for the most part better than the video versions. If you enjoy older '70s slasherhorror films Tourist Trap is an underrated retro gem. 810.";

Following in the footsteps and twisting them around of the great classic wax films House of Wax Mystery of the Wax Museum Tourist Trap takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its bizarre story and style. As far as character development action dialogue flow etc. it seems to be just a basic slasher flick. But it goes far beyond that as the director takes control of the plot and moves it to the supernatural thriller it is. The acting ranges from acceptable from the main cast to very good from backwoodsshowman Mr. Slausen played by Westernlegend Chuck Connors. The writing moves well and the dialogue is well structured but there are some flaws in logic as the film moves deeper into the story. Also some scenes are a bit silly like the moaningmannequin attack on Becky. It's nothing however that would detract from the effect of the film. As one would expect from a film about wax dummies it is full of the endless creepiness supplied by the mannequins. It's strange that a mostly inanimate object can just sit still and somehow be so unsettling. . . perhaps it's the human likeness or the blank stare or the fact that you know it's about to spring an attack. . . whatever it is the dolls are extremely spooky and that effect is used very well throughout the entirety of the film.

To my surprise Tourist Trap lives up to its hype and then some. One can see why it never became a huge mainstream success like say Jaws or Halloween but it has all the makings of a cult classic.The set up is nothing spectacular. In fact it owes a lot of its plot to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Psycho and House of Wax even more surprising the 2005 remake of that film is more of a remake of Tourist Trap than the '53 film. What makes this one stand out from the then growing slasher genre is a sense of the surreal the dreamlike and the nightmarish. Attractive teens aren't just killed one by one by some creep in a mask. There's a lot more at play here than your average stalk 'n slash flick. By the last 20 minutes of the film everything seems like a bizarre fever dream and hope is a thing of the past.A lot should be said for Jocelyn Jones' wonderful performance  going from kind wallflower to woman in the process of a nervous breakdown. Chuck Connors is also terrific as Mr. Slausen the owner of the titular Tourist Trap whose motives seem to always be up in the air. And yes that's future Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts as one of the other victims.For those looking for something creepy and different Tourist Trap delivers in spades. Perfect for a Halloween party or even for a kid's first horror film it is rated PG after all.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the oddest most strikingly eerie and creepy horror films to come out of the 70's Tourist Trap even by the loose freewheeling conventiondefying anything goes standards of its time rates as a real weirdie. Yet it's the picture's very strangeness  a masterfully mounted uncanny atmosphere of pervasively offkilter supernatural dread which from the getgo registers as powerfully spooky and becomes more increasingly opaque and frightening as the film progresses offering up ample shocks amid a few scattered moments of surreally lovely dreamlike elegance and ending on a bitterly ironic crushingly nihilistic note with a haunting final image that's hard to shake  which makes it such a unique and singularly unnerving experience.Five teenagers traveling through the desolate California desert by car get hopelessly lost. They stumble across Slausen's Lost Oasis a seedy rundown roadside dive that's one part gas station three parts crummy wax museum and all parts ratty and foreboding. The joint's lonely seemingly friendless and harmless owner Slausen juicily overplayed with infectiously hammy brio by Chuck Conners turns out to be a deranged psychic killer with lethal telekinetic powers. Slausen brings his freaky assortment of uncomfortably humanlike mannequins to life and picks off the kids one by one so he can add them to his evergrowing collection of victims.Director David Puppermaster The Arrival Schmoeller adeptly wrings every last ounce of tension he can squeeze from the pleasingly ambiguous and openended script he cowrote with J. Larry Carroll. Said script's stubborn refusal to provide some rational excuse for all the bizarre stuff which transpires throughout the movie often wrongly criticized as one of the film's principal weaknesses is actually the movie's key strength giving the picture the scary anythingandeverythingcanhappen commonlogicbedamned quality of a true nightmare come horrifically to life which never would have been achieved if there was some kind of credible explanation offered for what's happening. Pino Donaggio's beautifully chilling understated score Nicholas von Sternberg's shadowy cinematography and Robert A. Burns' grubby cramped production design add immensely to the film's profoundly unsettling mood. Excellent performances are another significant plus with the pretty perky Jocelyn Jones EllieJo Turner in The Great Texas Dynamite Chase particularly fine and personable as the most resilient and sympathetic of the endangered teens. Even Tanya Roberts fares well as a luckless lass who has a knife levitated into her head. Offbeat and unusual Tourist Trap is well worth visiting.".

Yet it's the picture's very strangeness  a masterfully mounted uncanny atmosphere of pervasively offkilter supernatural dread which from the getgo registers as powerfully spooky and becomes more increasingly opaque and frightening as the film progresses offering up ample shocks amid a few scattered moments of surreally lovely dreamlike elegance and ending on a bitterly ironic crushingly nihilistic note with a haunting final image that's hard to shake  which makes it such a unique and singularly unnerving experience.Five teenagers traveling through the desolate California desert by car get hopelessly lost. They stumble across Slausen's Lost Oasis a seedy rundown roadside dive that's one part gas station three parts crummy wax museum and all parts ratty and foreboding. The joint's lonely seemingly friendless and harmless owner Slausen juicily overplayed with infectiously hammy brio by Chuck Conners turns out to be a deranged psychic killer with lethal telekinetic powers. Slausen brings his freaky assortment of uncomfortably humanlike mannequins to life and picks off the kids one by one so he can add them to his evergrowing collection of victims.Director David Puppermaster The Arrival Schmoeller adeptly wrings every last ounce of tension he can squeeze from the pleasingly ambiguous and openended script he cowrote with J. Larry Carroll. Said script's stubborn refusal to provide some rational excuse for all the bizarre stuff which transpires throughout the movie often wrongly criticized as one of the film's principal weaknesses is actually the movie's key strength giving the picture the scary anythingandeverythingcanhappen commonlogicbedamned quality of a true nightmare come horrifically to life which never would have been achieved if there was some kind of credible explanation offered for what's happening. Pino Donaggio's beautifully chilling understated score Nicholas von Sternberg's shadowy cinematography and Robert A. Burns' grubby cramped production design add immensely to the film's profoundly unsettling mood. Excellent performances are another significant plus with the pretty perky Jocelyn Jones EllieJo Turner in The Great Texas Dynamite Chase particularly fine and personable as the most resilient and sympathetic of the endangered teens. Even Tanya Roberts fares well as a luckless lass who has a knife levitated into her head. Offbeat and unusual Tourist Trap is well worth visiting.";

The creation of backwoods atmosphere is impressive and at the centre of things is a marvelously demented performance by good ol' Chuck Connors as our merry antagonist.Chuck plays Mr. Slausen proprietor of an out of the way museum who encounters some young adults who have had car trouble. Since the girls have a tendency to be stupid and go wandering off on their own they're fair game. Unfortunately Slausen has a younger brother Davey who's prowling around the premises and soon these city slickers will find out just how much trouble they're in.Some nifty and sinister touches and twists make a difference in this directing credit for David Schmoeller who also cowrote the screenplay with J. Larry Carroll. Another heavy asset is the sometimes comical but often genuinely spooky music score by the always reliable Pino Donaggio. Other talents behind the camera include cinematographer Nicholas Josef von Sternberg art director Robert A. Burns and editor Ted Nicolaou the latter two of course had actually worked on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.The victims may be daft but the actors at least do a decent job. Jocelyn Jones The Great Texas Dynamite Chase daughter of the great character actor Henry Jones is appealing as Molly while Robin Sherwood Death Wish II and Tanya Roberts 'Charlie's Angels' offer some sass as Eileen and Becky. But Chuck is the glue that holds all of this together he's a wonderful psycho and is even touching at times.Worth it just for a particular death scene which is really quite disturbing.Future Tremors and City Slickers director Ron Underwood was the first assistant director here.Seven out of 10.".

Other reviewers have called this a madeforcable movie. If it is I'm curious which channel produced it. It definitely has the feel of something that might have been produced for USA or TBS. It's not really scary but it has a very professional veneer and solid performances. This film however falls apart at the end the same way so many other horror movies do by showing too much of the monsters. The Huldre seem fierce and mysterious when seen in short glimpses but when they are overexposed you start to think you could take care of them all with a baseball bat.".

This is where she talks to her fairy friends and her parents mother believe she's just getting used to the move. Soon small but dangerous accidents start occurring and Gina claims it's the fairies. To that response they seek the aid of a doctor who specialises in these cases but is she telling the truth?Two things were on my mind when I decided to give the film a view. That I'd be watching a haunted house flick and a real stinker too. The director Kelly Sandefur brought us the laughably dumb and irritable family horror TV movie Fangs 2001. So I was in store for a childish themed movie. So there was another fact that wouldn't budge from my mind. Anyhow I don't shoot me. I guess going in with extremely LOW expectations rubbed off nicely.There's something about this ho hum fairytale family yes familyfriendly horror film that kept me more than occupied and rather surprised. I liked the concept behind it although in the long run it's mechanical and there's a familiar pattern that developments. It seems to take its thunder from the likes of the third short story The General in the omnibus flick Cat's Eye 1985 and Don't be Afraid of the Dark 1973. The enchantingly silly material has some imagination amongst its shallowness. It can get little rushed and overstated in certain details. The mystery around are they're real or not isn't much as we know how it's going to eventuate in first place.Sandefur's direction is generic and lacks atmosphere but workable with a certain professionalism and slickness coming off the cheap production. The quick flashes and ragged editing worked out when they showed glimpses of the nasty little critters. But when the main focus was on them the visual effects was a different story. The creative designs of the artful trolls are well crafted and so is the odd looking playhouse. In these TV movies the violence is lacking and that's the scenario here. Most of it happens off screen and is very watered down. The scares are ineffective and you see them miles before they hit. What cues it up is an outofsorts score that doesn't translate well with the action and feel. The performances were shockingly above average with the likes of Patty McCormack and a manipulative toned down Malcolm McDowell leading the way. Megan Gallagher makes a potently strong heroine as the worried mother figure.Yep it's predictable. Throw in cheesy. Definitely risible. And how about a truckload of clichs. Oh what a nice onslaught I can see you thinking. Despite that it's hard not to be simply amused by it all.I found it hard to recommend as I thought it got me on a good night and I don't think I'm its target audience. It isn't aiming for anything big but for an enjoyably relaxing viewing on the couch. I found it to be bemusedly watchable PG bgrade horror.".

The EFX would have been rather pedestrian but the Production team employs the Old Joel Peter Witkin technique ALA JACOB'S LADDER and speeds up the evil fairies' movements enough that the stepprinting effect makes them look like they are treading the border between two worlds. It works!This is your basic Familyinperil flick where a likable and fairly believably cast bunch of Surburban cliches face a supernatural menace. Typcially one parent refuses to believe that it could be a supernatural evil.Warning.... Very mild spoiler ahead.. doesn't reveal ending but does reveal some of the twists for parents who might want to know what is coming before letting kids watch..........Do not read further unless you want to know details in order to decide if your kids should watch.   The redherring of the house having been the site of a gruesome murder 50 years prior adds a little spice before the Family closes ranks and takes the Nasty Little Folk on for a fight to the death. However that element might upset very little kids. While there is a death and another serious Fairy Attack...there isn't any truly gross violence and even the predicatable heavy metal music at the end is justified by the presence of a male teen in the family whose screams cannot be heard over his loud stereo.... at least for a moment.Overall not bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thanks to silly horror movies like Troll and the indescribably atrocious cultfavorite Troll 2 it has become practically impossible to take movies with kobolds gnomes and various other types of little green hobgoblins seriously these days. Only just recently I watched the 70's madeforTV movie Don't Be Afraid of the Dark which is basically a quite terrifying and serioustoned film about domestic little goblin monsters and yet I still couldn't help thinking back about the laughinducing potato headed critters dressed in garbage bags that were running amok in Troll 2. Same thing happened to me now. As much as I tried going into Inhabited with a clear mindset unconsciously I kept comparing the supposedly creepy and menacing garden fairies with the badly sculptured goblins of Nilbog! Still even without all the prejudices Inhabited is a remotely entertaining albeit unmemorable straighttovideo horror flick. It's a cheesy soft and politically correct pastiche of family drama and Northern Europe mythology. The annoying and murderous little creatures in this movie aren't your plain average goblins they are The Huldre wicked little Norwegian demons that live underground and attempt to chase happy families out of their houses through influencing the youngest children. This overcomes the Russell family as they move into their ramshackle dream house in a remote little town. The cherubic blond daughter of MILFactress Megan Gallagher starts to behave strangely whenever she hangs out in the cute play house in the back of the garden. She claims her friends are fairies and even though the sinister handyman also warns for strange occurrences in the past Gina's parents simply think the girl has troubles adjusting to her new neighborhood. When she keeps rattling about fairies they arrange an appointment with the acclaimed psychologist Dr. Werner whilst The Huldre are slowly coming out of their botanical shelter. Not much special to mention here. The pace is acceptable and the attempts to build up suspense are pretty cute. You understand this is a familyfriendly horror movie so no bloody murder sequences are graphically being shown here. Heck even the cadaver of the family's pet cat is kept offscreen. This is the umpteenth nonsensical horror movie in which Malcolm McDowell pops up and he practically always depicts an unreliable greedy and selfcentered authority figure.".

	schema:headline " A Family Friendly Horror";
	schema:reviewBody "This isn't a wellexecuted horror film but given its limited blood lack of guts and gore and no harsh language that I can recall it is a pleasant diversion from all that disgusting garbage passed off as horror nowadays. This is a frightfest that kids lest the troll images should scare them can watch.The film focuses on a family of four with the emphasis on the mother Gallagher and daughter. The sixyearold girl claims to see fairies in her new playhouse in the backyard. Since the family has just moved to this new house mother imagines the concept of fairies is her little girls outlet for creativity. But when her daughter's teacher expresses concern about the girl's inability to fit in she suggests that Gallagher take her to a shrink. Meg is reluctant at first but when the fairy tales get out of hand she seems to have no other choice but to take the girl to visit nefarious doctor Malcolm McDowell.The film has some flimsy messages taking stabs at psychology as well as those acceptable lies we all tell are children Santa Clause the Easter Bunny and so forth. Meg never loses faith in her little girl and she begins to believe her even when all signs don't point to fairies. But when mysterious things continue to occur and Tyler Greg Cipes gets attacked by an unseen creature Meg and her husband Lutes begin to believe their daughter might not be off her rocker.STORY  The story was fine at first but the end result reeks of a rushed denouement. When we hit the climax of the story things become too rushed and overly clichd and it seems like the director lost all control on set. There is a scene near the close of the film where Gallagher and Lutes are seated on the sofa discussing the likelihood of their daughter's fairies. I got the impression given the halfhearted way they delivered their lines that Meg and Eric both voiced their concern with the insipid dialogue just before they shot the scene but the director shrugged them off and said Just shoot that darn thing.ACTING  The focus throughout the film rests predominately on Megan Gallagher. She gives a very strong performance as a caring mother even though the end of the film was rushed and thus so was her acting. But take away the rushed final fifteen minutes and you won't find anything wrong with her performance. She does an exceptional job. Malcolm McDowell is effective as the shrink masking his nefarious ways under the guise of compassion. Eric Lutes has little to do as the father other than offer support to Gallagher. Looney gives a good performance as the mysterious handyman Megan hires to fix up the house who might know more than he lets on.SEXUALITY  Nothing doing here. This is essentially a familyfriendly horror film if such a thing exists. The only inkling of sexuality in the film comes when Megan invites Dr. McDowell to her home to commune with her little girl. Her forthecompany dress is a bit on the lowcut side displaying some cleavage but that's all you'll get out of this decent timewaster.".

Goblin like dwellers living in a house and looking all scary like the premise seemed like it could have been creepy.  But it was handled in every wrong way possible.They focused more on dialog between characters we do not care about.  It follows every cliche in the booktwo cat jump out scenes in the first 15 minutes and even then it does horribly.  Traditionally if you are going to use the old sneak up behind someone routine and cue the scary jump music you do so in a way where the person sneaks up behind them.  In this they cue the scary music and the woman jumps but the guy doing the sneaking is slowly walking into the scene it was downright hilarious.And they do the thing that really bugs me a lot..the characters act as if they know it is a horror movie.  In the very beginning the mother stumbles across a doll with her head off so after finding out the son didn't do it she starts panicking like something horridly is the matter.  Doesn't make much sense.  And the fairies themselves just aren't done creepily at all. Just a bunch of evil dead style camera running quick flashes of their faces and a lot of skipped frames.  The whole movie has a definite made for tv feel although not nearly as scary as a made for tv movie.  Rather than trying to make the movie creepy they went the route of the film being nothing but a slow unravel as to what the things are and people involved in the past..but we don't care.".

In this they cue the scary music and the woman jumps but the guy doing the sneaking is slowly walking into the scene it was downright hilarious.And they do the thing that really bugs me a lot..the characters act as if they know it is a horror movie.  In the very beginning the mother stumbles across a doll with her head off so after finding out the son didn't do it she starts panicking like something horridly is the matter.  Doesn't make much sense.  And the fairies themselves just aren't done creepily at all. Just a bunch of evil dead style camera running quick flashes of their faces and a lot of skipped frames.  The whole movie has a definite made for tv feel although not nearly as scary as a made for tv movie.  Rather than trying to make the movie creepy they went the route of the film being nothing but a slow unravel as to what the things are and people involved in the past..but we don't care.";

Liu's work with Wallace brings him conflict with tradition and his father's authority complicated by his falling in love with Ling daughter of Lord Tan star of Beijing's traditional opera. Liu sees movies as his chance to become wealthy and worthy of Ling. When the Shadow Magic pair are invited to show the films to the Empress Dowager things look good. But is disaster in the script? And can movies preserve tradition even as they bring change?";

	schema:headline " A Movie Working On Multiple Plans";
	schema:reviewBody "This Shadow Magic is a very ambitious endeavor working on multiple plans.On one plan it is a tribute to the pioneers of Chinese movie industry. It was the way this tribute was conceived that made some reviewers to declare Shadow Magic a light movie unpretentious not to be ranged within the masterworks of today's China film.Well like any tribute of this kind it is a warm story the fathers of Chinese cinema are followed with genuine sympathy like any pioneers in any domain they simply were not aware of their future role in history the fathers didn't know that some day they would be THE fathers. They were seeing themselves just as common guys and were behaving as such sometimes with mistakes sometimes with naivety sometimes like fools sometimes in love sometimes bad tempered.It is also another criticism brought to Shadow Magic that it suffers from lack of originality copying themes and moods from Cinema Paradiso. It is true that the wheel cannot be reinvented each time one makes a movie about the beginnings of cinema. However I would note that Cinema Paradiso is built differently on a play of memory and nostalgia while in Shadow Magic there is no place for nostalgia it is not about a vanished world of movie theaters by the contrary it shows the beginnings of what is today one of the most important schools of cinema worldwide.Shadow Magic called in my mind rather another film Diarios de Motocicleta where the main character a sympathetic medical student nicknamed Che is also totally unaware that one day he will become a famous or infamous matter of perspective revolutionary leader.There is also another plan that was also in Ann Hu's previous Dream and Memory the Englishman comes with his projector and suddenly East meets West in 1902's Beijing. This contact seems to be of great interest for director Ann Hu. What happens when the two universes come into contact? What happens there on the border? Do they explode do they remain separate looking at each other across the trenches or is a new universe emerging on the surface of contact? In Dream and Memory the border is in the mind of Hong the Chinese who like director Ann Hu moved long time ago to the US. For him one universe looks like a dream unclear and remote while the present universe needs the mechanisms of memory to reenact the lost dream. It's East coming to the West and West trying to recuperate East China is far away and long ago America is here and now China needs to be appropriated.Here in Shadow Magic it is West that comes to the the East. England is far away China is here and now. And the border is in the heart of Liu the Chinese passionate to go beyond the limits of his known world while torn out by the force of his loyalties. It's a popout and a pushback bringing the border now and then on the brink of explosion while little by little a coalescing universe begins to take shape. Maybe this was also the case in the Big Bang model? Just kidding.Shadow Magic is also a tribute paid to the charm of old Beijing with its incredible mix of people and carts and camels on the streets that incredible mix of present with its seemingly chaotic agitation and past with its quiet force all these found in Ann Hu an exquisite artist painter. Here all reviewers are unanimous in recognizing her talent in rending the images her sensibility for each nuance of color for each detail of the street. Her mastership of the visual language is amazing and also her science of controlling the movement of each actor on the scene. The movie has the synchronization of a ballet any movement comes in its exact place no earlier no later no slower no faster no shorter no longer.And I think nowhere in the movie it's the cinematic genius of Ann Hu as overwhelming as in the scenes at the Great Wall. When it came there I was afraid I would see kind of a tourist commercial the risk any moviemaker is running when shooting in a famous place. Well it was far from that. The Great Wall was playing together with the two actors the Englishman and the young Chinese witnessing their enthusiasm to be there their feeling that they got the best life could give because being there! It was the way the Great Wall was shot that made it an active part of the action! I saw only one other movie that gave me the same impression Springtime in a Small Town of Tian ZhuangZhuang cinematographed by Li PingBin a remake after another Chinese masterpiece. It was there in the movie of Tian that I had this feeling that the setting was an active actor in the drama!".

At the same time it is embraced by a chinese named Liu Jinglun who has the curiosity for new things.  Together they eventually persuade the people embrace the medium.It is a light film with the Liu facing the dilemma of respecting his culture and tradition or embracing the new medium that is so frightening to his people.  There is also the side plot of his desire to marry Lord Tan's daughter but he would have to be rich.  His path to richness would also make Lord Tan lose respect for him since Lord Tan is a performer in the old medium of stage theater and his moving pictures would push that into oblivion.  Of course we end up with a happy ending because the new medium becomes a tool to supplement everything around it instead of taking it over. Which is basically the point of the story.  Don't fear it embrace and integrate it into your environment.This film does not tackle the subjects it encounters very hard it uses light mellowdrama and resolve all the issues amicably.All in all this film is easy to enjoy but it will not be mistaken for the fifth generation films that came out of china a decade or so ago.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cave Dwellers is actually a sequel and its original title was something along the lines of Ator The Blade Master. However this film was done by the same people who did various other films back in the day so they changed the title changed the credits and added footage from another film in the credits! They have to be the same people who did Pod People too and what else do this and Pod People have in common? They were both riffed mercilessly on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Not sure why they added the footage from another film as it kind of confuses things it certainly did with Pod People as the alien in the credit sequence looked nothing like the creature in the film. Here you have a completely looking film all together! The title is rather stupid too. Not the Ator one but rather the Cave Dweller one as there are Cave Dwellers in the film but they make up such an insignificant plot point that one wonders what the people at this company were thinking. Heck the flashback sequence detailing the first film was almost as long as the cave dweller portion of this film! So this company just may have been run by people who liked to edit stuff as a hobby maybe? The story a bad guy goes to a castle to get some sort of new weapon or something from some old man who prattles on and on. The old man's daughter must go to the ends of the earth and there she will find Ator and his mute sidekick Thong. Ator is a man of legend who has killed a spider puppet already and he has also mastered the sword and getting buff and greasy! He joins up with the daughter as they set off on a quest to save her father but for some reason the way back to the castle is much longer than the way to Ator's place. They must fight invisible soldiers cavemen wicker wearing warriors a snake puppet and finally make their way to the final confrontation where the old man will implore Ator not to kill the evil doer so he can be tried...um Ator has been killing left and right why stop him now? This made for a great episode of MST3K as it is one of my favorite Joel episodes. I prefer Mike but here Joel is on fire as he was in Pod People too. This company may edit a film to the point of lunacy but the end result is a film worthy of some riffing. Not a film though that I would want to track down and see unedited from said company and Joel and the bots as I just do not see it vastly improving at all. The only way I'd want to see it is if the female lead got topless or something and I do not get that vibe from this one.So a bad film indeed. There is better action in the flashbacks than in most of the film and too often there is just way to much lead up until something actually does happen. Case in point the whole snake sacrifice scene. We get to watch the bad guys send multiple damsels into a hole while the hero's sidekick takes his sweet time making his way to the hero. By the end of the sequence all the damsels were dead! Not very heroic and it took way to long! Suffice to say Conan the Barbarian would kill Ator in a fight. Heck this guy is not even as good as Yor The Hunter from the Future. Now that guy was bad to the bone he didn't make no hang glider he flipping used a pterodactyl! That is hardcore Ator! You are not!".

It made such an awful impression on me that i never forgot it.  I've been an MST3K fan for a long time so when Cavedwellers came out on tape I bought it.  I was horrified to realize that it was a sequel to the wretched Ator movie that i'd seen so long ago! Ator's costume has somehow gotten ever skimpier than the last time i saw him.  How can he wear that tiny little bikini?  Doesn't he care that it shows off the fact that he has no...errr...package?  And poor Thong...he gets no lines and no girl and has to follow that frizzy haired girly doofus Ator around all the time.  Has anyone else noticed that Miles O'Keefe walks like a woman? No wonder he's not interested in the pretty if somewhat lackluster Meela.  The evil but prancy bad guy Zor is more to his taste I'm sure.  I loved Zor's cardboard spray painted swan helmet and the way he spent all his time trying to touch some part of Ator.  The fight scenes are so badly choreographed that its a wonder that the swords ever manage to connect.  The dull old guy spends all of his time standing around looking depressed.  Ator drinks from a cup given to him by a guy who hates him and then looks surprised that they drugged him. He must be pretty smart thoughhe invented a hang glider in the space pf five minutes then flew it into a rift in the spacetime continuum so that he travelled briefly into 17th century Bulgaria.  That was after he stabbed the giant snake puppet of course and saved the post coital Meela while she sat around doing absolutely nothing. The real hero of the movie was Thong who saved Ator several times from his boundless stupiditiy and killed the evil Zor in the bargain. Kudos to Thong the only competent person in the whole film.".

The plot is ludicrous the script is terrible the acting is hammy throughout the special effects....well let's not even go there!  all in all this movie is a veritable delight! Highlights of the film include Ator and Thong his mute companion not his undergarments being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave certainly saved on the fx budget there! Ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid and of course the infamous hangliding scene! There's one question I have though......at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator supposedly destroys the Geometric Nucleus as the narrator tells us......how in the hell did Ator destroy it and manage get out alive?! Did he fashion some form of primitive timerdetonator or something? Oh well such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm  they just don't make them like this anymore!".

	onyx:emotionText "Miles O'Keeffe once again assumes the role of the mighty Ator in this the first sequel to the original film.What can I say?  This pretty much represents BMovie Nirvana! The plot is ludicrous the script is terrible the acting is hammy throughout the special effects....well let's not even go there!  all in all this movie is a veritable delight! Highlights of the film include Ator and Thong his mute companion not his undergarments being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave certainly saved on the fx budget there! Ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid and of course the infamous hangliding scene! There's one question I have though......at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator supposedly destroys the Geometric Nucleus as the narrator tells us......how in the hell did Ator destroy it and manage get out alive?! Did he fashion some form of primitive timerdetonator or something? Oh well such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm  they just don't make them like this anymore!";

This movie stunk like yesterday's gym socks at least it wasn't bad as 'Manos'.  The only things that were good about it were the hunky Conan dude Ator and the riffings from Joel and the bots.  What I can't understand is how the shots of the white guy and the black guy in the beginning and the end of the film have anything to do with the movie?

However this movie is not the worst movie ever. Most if not all including this review of these reviews are written by fans of MSTK3.  Therefore many of these reviews are pretty much summaries of the MSTK3 episode of Cave Dwellers.In the episode Joel Tom Servo and Crow remark to the Mad Scientists that this is the worst movie ever sent to them.  Of course loyal fans have taken this quote and ran with it.  I have found this movie endearingnot in a way that one finds Forrest Gump endearingbut in the effort put into this movie by some the cast.  Also this movie is laughable without its MSTK3 treatment.  That is because Cave Dwellers does not take itself seriously and it is not trying to import into its viewers some sort of righteous theme.  For all of the monster puppets medieval hang gliding and continuity lapsesthis movie does not advertise to be any more that what it is a shallow depiction of a rather shallow genre.Likewise I can't bring myself to hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster.

Miles O'Keeffe sp? is in this using his chiseled physique to score another payment on the mortgage on his condominium. He's stiff wooden and unconvincing but he still comes across as a cool likable guy and at least he's photogenic. That's the only decent I can find to say about the movie so I thought I would get it out of the way right up front. The fact that he is in the movie adds another point to the score and saves it from being a 1 out of 10. In no particular order examples of how badly put together this film is1OK the Tanya Roberts clone Mila quests to 'the ends of the earth' to find Ator which takes 3 minutes of screen time including the time she spends stumbling around dying from a poisoned arrow in her shoulder which I assume would have slowed her down quite a bit. So Ator heals her up and takes his trusty aid Thong and sets out to go back to the her castle...and proceeds to take the next 50 minutes of the movie recovering the ground that Mila traversed in 3 minutes. How does that work??? I know that the intrepid crew is being harassed by magical forces and enemies etc. on the way back but still...!2Apparently the writerdirector felt the need to add 'depth' to the film by adding a running debateSocratic dialoggame of 20 questions between Zor the mean John Saxon wannabe and the wise man Akronas the Richard Harris wannabe. But Joe Damoto apparently got his philosophical training from Hallmark cards TShirts and bumper stickers and he doesn't understand tempo pacing or timing...and neither do the actors. Crow's remark during one of these exchanges is the tag line for my entry. The scenes with these two drag on and on bringing the movie to a screeching halt and killing any momentum or excitement generated by the swordfighting and questing of the heroic trio.3 Once Ator arrives at the castle and is captured things go even farther downhill. Zor decides to feed a bunch of women victims along with Ator and Mila to the Serpent God he keeps in his basement. This scene had some potential for excitement so the director immediately kills this potential by instilling the scene with all the drama of people waiting in line at the DMV to pay their traffic fines. Ator proceeds to have a big battle with the Serpent that is barely more convincing than Bela Lugosi's battle with the rubber octopus puppet in Bride Of The Monster. 4 The climactic scene in which Ator invents the hang glider out of twigs and animal skins is so patently silly that it completely blows the viewer out of the movie and makes you roll on the floor laughing until your sides hurt. 5 Oh yes and the filmmakers decided to include stock footage of an atomic explosion at the end with the moral that Ator decided to destroy the 'atomic nucleus' McGuffin that drives the movie because mankind was 'not ready'. Zzzzip! MESSAGE COMING IN!!! Just like Bride Of the Monster again come to think of it. All it needed was a bystander to observe They tampered in God's domain.6 For some reason the version of the movie I saw features introductory and closing homoerotic credit sequences that have absolutely NOTHING to do with anyone or anything else in the movie. I have no idea where this footage came from but it is actually WORSE than the actual movie it bookends. Watch this only if you are a big fan of Miles or if you enjoy the way MST3K skewers material like this.".

	schema:headline " Makes Conan Look Like a Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "The Blade Master alternatively titled Cave Dwellers is a pathetic Conan the Barbarian ripoff that was made in Italy and dubbed into English. It was made on a very low budget by people who knew virtually nothing about acting or directing but that still doesn't explain how things went so horribly wrong. I suspect the writers may have been smoking something.The titular hero is the beefy Ator who we first see in the opening credits sneaking through some caves alongside a black man who is never seen in the actual movie. It's hard to tell what is actually going on because there's no sound the footage is extremely choppy and the lower half of the screen is blacked out so we can read the credits. Our first proper introduction comes in an extended flashback in which some philosophermonkking tells his daughter Leila Ator's life story so far which I suspect occupied an entire previous film. No sooner is this fatherdaughter story time finished then the castle is attacked by a horde of barbarian horsemen and Leila flees to call Ator for help. She finds him of course along with his sidekick the unfortunately named Thong. Then it's up to the three of them to save Leila's father and the kingdom from the bad guy.This movie's biggest problem aside from the lack of any money or talent is that it never quite gets its act together. It never establishes the time and place. I can't tell whether all this is happening in prehistory or in the middle ages. I'm also not sure if this is supposed to be Earth or if it's some mythical realm. I don't think they ever refer to the kingdom by name.Nor is there much sense of scale or space. For instance Leila's father tells her that Ator's home is 'at the ends of the Earth.' Yet after escaping the castle she arrives at Ator's cave in the very next scene with the arrow she was shot with during her escape still embedded in her chest! This would lead one to believe that the ends of the Earth weren't so far after all. But then they spend the rest of the movie returning to the castle. I don't know how that works and I suspect that neither do the writers.Anyway while the heroes are having their adventures the bad guy is holding Leila's father prisoner. He doesn't kill the old man because he wants to discover the secrets of a powerful weapon known as  I'm not making this up the geometric nucleus. But his method of interrogating the old man is rather strange. Rather than torturing the knowledge out of him the evil warlord engages him in long boring conversations. I very much doubt that any real people have ever spoken the way these two do. The bad guy sounds like a Republic serial villain and Leila's father sounds at various times like a fortune cookie a teenage socialist and an educational video on the importance of the modern justice system.Not that the other characters have dialogue that's much better. Ator is established early on as having been the old guy's most brilliant student a master of magic science and natural philosophy. Yet when he opens his mouth he talks like a first year Englishasasecondlanguage student which he may actually be. At one point he gives a less than rousing speech laying out the blindingly obvious strategy for an upcoming battle and then the battle never takes place! Did they mean to film the battle and then run out of money or was the speech intended as a red herring? I don't know and I'm not sure it really matters.Now I've put this off as long as I can but there are two scenes in this movie that leave me asking What the hell were they thinking? The first comes when the heroes storm the castle. Ator tells Leila and Thong to take a secret passage into the fortress while he prepares a distraction. He's up to something remarks Leila.

	onyx:emotionText "The Blade Master alternatively titled Cave Dwellers is a pathetic Conan the Barbarian ripoff that was made in Italy and dubbed into English. It was made on a very low budget by people who knew virtually nothing about acting or directing but that still doesn't explain how things went so horribly wrong. I suspect the writers may have been smoking something.The titular hero is the beefy Ator who we first see in the opening credits sneaking through some caves alongside a black man who is never seen in the actual movie. It's hard to tell what is actually going on because there's no sound the footage is extremely choppy and the lower half of the screen is blacked out so we can read the credits. Our first proper introduction comes in an extended flashback in which some philosophermonkking tells his daughter Leila Ator's life story so far which I suspect occupied an entire previous film. No sooner is this fatherdaughter story time finished then the castle is attacked by a horde of barbarian horsemen and Leila flees to call Ator for help. She finds him of course along with his sidekick the unfortunately named Thong. Then it's up to the three of them to save Leila's father and the kingdom from the bad guy.This movie's biggest problem aside from the lack of any money or talent is that it never quite gets its act together. It never establishes the time and place. I can't tell whether all this is happening in prehistory or in the middle ages. I'm also not sure if this is supposed to be Earth or if it's some mythical realm. I don't think they ever refer to the kingdom by name.Nor is there much sense of scale or space. For instance Leila's father tells her that Ator's home is 'at the ends of the Earth.' Yet after escaping the castle she arrives at Ator's cave in the very next scene with the arrow she was shot with during her escape still embedded in her chest! This would lead one to believe that the ends of the Earth weren't so far after all. But then they spend the rest of the movie returning to the castle. I don't know how that works and I suspect that neither do the writers.Anyway while the heroes are having their adventures the bad guy is holding Leila's father prisoner. He doesn't kill the old man because he wants to discover the secrets of a powerful weapon known as  I'm not making this up the geometric nucleus. But his method of interrogating the old man is rather strange. Rather than torturing the knowledge out of him the evil warlord engages him in long boring conversations. I very much doubt that any real people have ever spoken the way these two do. The bad guy sounds like a Republic serial villain and Leila's father sounds at various times like a fortune cookie a teenage socialist and an educational video on the importance of the modern justice system.Not that the other characters have dialogue that's much better. Ator is established early on as having been the old guy's most brilliant student a master of magic science and natural philosophy. Yet when he opens his mouth he talks like a first year Englishasasecondlanguage student which he may actually be. At one point he gives a less than rousing speech laying out the blindingly obvious strategy for an upcoming battle and then the battle never takes place! Did they mean to film the battle and then run out of money or was the speech intended as a red herring? I don't know and I'm not sure it really matters.Now I've put this off as long as I can but there are two scenes in this movie that leave me asking What the hell were they thinking? The first comes when the heroes storm the castle. Ator tells Leila and Thong to take a secret passage into the fortress while he prepares a distraction. He's up to something remarks Leila. Boy is he ever. Cut to Ator jumping from a cliff aboard a hang glider made from ropes and skins. WTF!?! He actually flies and drops bombs!  from a hang glider. At this point they might as well bring in the Great Gazoo atop his flying saucer.But as unbelievable as the hanggliding scene is this next one takes the cake.

However that seems to be something that the studio chose to ignore assuming the name recognition of the title would draw the crowds. The film did okay but it's a cornball exercise from start to finish. The main story was dated in '27 and is certainly no fresher in '52.Danny Thomas just didn't have the strength of personality to make it on the big screen. Watching him it becomes apparent why he made it on TV and not cinema. He has a nice likable demeanor the sort that worked so well for Perry Como and Dinah Shore when they likewise abandoned the big screen for the small but he doesn't dominate his scenes the way a leading man has to. He does sing well although not nearly well enough to be the rage of New York he's supposed to be.That master of all genres Michael Curtiz moves the movie along well enough but it's too schmaltzy for him to be able to make it really memorable.Putting all that aside the best reason to catch the film is the presence of Peggy Lee in the cast. This was her acting debut and while she doesn't have the instantly easy relaxed acting style of Doris Day the role doesn't put big demands on her she did much better a few years on in Pete Kelly's Blues. It doesn't matter though when she sings which fortunately is often. When she does that all the hokeyness melts away and the viewer is treated to a legend doing what she does best sing. An extra bonus is that she performs one of her biggest hits Lover in an elegant club setting giving you an idea of what it was actually like to see her in person.Worth catching for Miss Lee but the story is sappy.".

Other than Crossfire1947 and Gentleman's Agreement1947 which dealt with antisemitism they usually had a musicaltheatre background. These films included The Jolson Story1946 Jolson Sings Again1949 The Eddy Duchin Story1951 The Eddie Cantor Story1953The Benny Goodman Story1956 and Margorie Morningstar1958. The leading actors in these Jewish films were always played by nonJews. For example Larry Parks a nonJew played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably done to make the Jewish theme palpable to a mainly nonJewish audience. The Jazz Singer1952 is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish although she plays a nonpracticing Jewess in the film. The clue to her background is when she attends the Golding's family meal before entering she says I haven't been to a sader passover service since I left home.The film is about a cantor's son who has just left the service after seeing action in Korea. His dilemma is whether to become a cantor a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theatre. His choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his father.However there is much more to this film than this. This film was made after the Rosenberg trial during the McCarthy whitchhunts and the Hollywood blacklist. Therefore in this film the Jews are shown as good loyal citizens andare quintessentialy American. The synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. The cantors friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a Major League umpire. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and George Washington is said to have visited. Therefore Jews are presented as part and parcel of American society. Nobody in this film has a Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films. In this film you get to see her sing Lover and Just One of Those Things wonderful. Danny Thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very well. The comedic routines could have been left out. Yes the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing. I enjoyed it very much.".

Her voice is exquisite and more importantly she and director Michael Curtiz make each musical number feel like it belongs exactly where it appears in the script. Unfortunately Lee's role has been revised to match the religion of Thomas' character. This weakens the story's central conflict between Thomas and Franz. It looks spectacular in Technicolor but we wonder why Thomas' parents live in a luxurious palace where modestlyattired mother Dunnock stands out by refusing a fur coat and dressing like the help.

The songs are good too. Thomas plays the Cantors son who wants to be a popular singer. Thomas does a lot of stand up comedy in this movie.Thomas is quite touching doing a special song for his mother late in the film. It is kind of strange that the same night he is called to his dying father's bedside. Why is mom at the show while dad is home ill? That is a little different for this era the film was made. The film is pretty good overall. Thomas fans will not want to miss this one either.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film back when it opened in the very early 50's at  I thinkThe Brooklyn Museum with my aunt and cousin. I must have been 67 years old at the time and to this day I have never forgotten the film. I particularly remember Danny Thomas singing wonderfully in the film and was very taken with not only his performance of Jerry Golding but also of Eduard Franz who played his father. Wonderful remake of Jolson's original version which opened almost 20 years before I was born. I have always been a huge Jolson fan since I was a small boy and I wonder if this film did not reinforce that. Sorry it is rarely shown on any Cable network. I have the original soundtrack and listen to it all the time. Great songs great story great acting great film! By the way I did not like the 1980 version at all.The story of a Korean war veteran returning home to start a new life as an entertainer instead of taking over the reins of succeeding his father as a Cantor was I think very relevant for that time and I think was depicted beautifully. Glad the plot had Mr. Franz recovering from his illness to enjoy his son's success at the end of the film. Nice touch!".

	schema:reviewBody "Jazz Singer The 1952  out of 4 Remake of the legendary 1927 Al Jolson picture has Danny Thomas playing Jerry Golding a young Jewish man who returns home from the war and his father David Eduard Franz is expecting him to become the next Cantor. The Golding family males have been the Cantor for the past six generations but Jerry explains that he wants to try his hand at show business and this causes his father to turn his back on him. The 1927 version is best remembered for being the first talkie even though it's mostly silent and without that I think the movie is poor enough to where it would have been forgotten by today. I was really shocked by this remake because it's actually a very wellmade little film with director Michael Curtiz really pouring his soul into it. I was surprised because it did seem like it was going to be a cheap watered down musical but instead the direction was so good and the performances so strong that one really can't help getting caught up in the story. One major thing that works so well here is the relationship between the father and son. Their relationship really is expanded here and I think the lovehate thing works for some terrific drama. It also doesn't hurt that the performances are so strong. Thomas is wonderful in the leading role because he contains a certain kind of sensitive nature that you really care for him. He also has a terrific voice that makes you really understand why he wants to break into the business. Peggy Lee plays his love interest and is strong as well. Franz nearly steals the film as the strong father who expects his son to carry on the family tradition. Alex Gerry is also very good as the caring uncle. The soundtrack includes some very good numbers including Jerry Seelan's What Are New Yorkers Made Of Cole Porter's Just One of Those Things The Birth of the Blues and Peggy Lee's own This Is a Very Special Day. What really brings all of this together is the great direction by Curtiz. I was very surprised to see how loving and tender the actual story was and you can tell that there was something in the story that really stuck with the director because he goes all out in each scene to bring it some life. This version of THE JAZZ SINGER isn't that well known which is a real shame.".

That's why this movie works in such a great way we love Crawl he's a breath of fresh air but we can also sympathise with the Warners.

Crawl being a big city boy must adjust to the farm life if he is to fall in love with Becca. But Crawl isn't the only one who is learning new things.

This film has good clean family humor. Pauly Shore is brilliant! With no plans for the thanksgiving holiday Crawl Shore is invited to spend the holiday with a conservative coed Becca. Crawl being a big city boy must adjust to the farm life if he is to fall in love with Becca. But Crawl isn't the only one who is learning new things. Crawl teaches Becca and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accepting others. This is fun for viewers of all ages.";

He helps her break out of her small town mold. In a Thanksgiving visit to her parents' home he pretends to be her fiancee to save her embarassment of a sort with an old boyfriend.I loved two things about this movie. Pauly Shore and the comedic situations are the first. The second is the message. How generations of men had perpetrated the same offenses against each other and Crawl helps them see a better way to treat each other. He gets Becka's mom also to feel alive again and rekindles romance between the parents. The whole movie is a fresh approach to comedy is a joy to watch. I rate it a strong 7 of 10.".

Looking like what would result if Richard Simmons and Weird Al Yankovic had a child together he is the unlikeliest of movie stars.  Yet somehow for a time at least he managed to carve out a career for himself as a comic leading man.  This film is often cited as one of his least annoying but even here he is sometimes hard to take.  He plays a wayout overaged college student who winds up coming home for the Thanksgiving holiday with a pretty freshman from the country.  Once there he offends then predictably wins over her family and friends......most of them anyway.  The film is undeniably predictable and familiar and the material is very slight.  Yet somehow in spite of its hurdles it manages to entertain to a certain point and actually contains a few laughs.  Shore as agonizing as he is does occasionally score a thoughtful moment or two among all the slapstick and crude language.  Gugino is lovely.  Her presence adds immeasurably to the overall geniality of the film.  The actors portraying her family do a very nice job as well.  Smith as the father is suitably outraged by Shore.  Pickett adds dimension to a pretty standard role.  The best are Renna and Adams.  Renna plays the obnoxious younger brother role to the hilt.  It would be hard to come up with a brattier persona but he puts a fun spin on it.  Adams get a late career gem of a part as the cantankerous grandfather and steals many of the scenes he is in.  To the director's credit none of these characters get shorted in their opportunity to present themselves.  In other words Shore isn't the ENTIRE show here.  The supporting cast gets to shine as well. Also present are hunky Gauthier as Gugino's former boyfriend often looking like Tom Cruise in All the Right Moves and sexy Thiessen as the local easy mark.  The movie is already dated in terms of its clothing and other aspects.  Shore gives Pickett a makeover and it's hard to see why anyone thinks she looks better than before!  Fortunately the thing doesn't drag on for too long.  It's just a short sometimes funny sometimes sweet sometimes stupid movie that is blessed with a few enjoyable performers and a refreshing lack of undue sex and drugs.".

Freddy Got Fingered is in the same category of bad.So the story in this one goes that the daughter Gugino goes to California to go to school and comes back with Crawl Shore and he tries to learn to be a farmer. Then the boyfriend tries to set Shore up so that the girl will leave Crawl and go back to him. It ends and what's left of the audience can leave.The main purpose of this movie is for Pauly Shore to mug for the camera and try to be funny but I'd say about 100 of the time he fails at that. Their horrible inaccurate and out of date view of farms and farming is offensive and there's nothing in this movie worth seeing. If you think of seeing it don't.

I do remember watching just a couple of episodes when it first was broadcast over a year ago. I found it extremely tacky looking. Why was Jasper involved in this. He is the best comedian ever by far and yet even he cannot save this drivvel. The first series I'm sorry to say definately does deserve to be panned good and proper. I suppose the real reason why I am writing this review is because there is a new series of ALL ABOUT ME starting this Friday which doesn't look too bad on the reviews so I'll give it another chance.

I had the fortune of not seeing the first series and if it was ten times better than the second series it still wouldnt have deserved a second series . This is awful with punchlines you can see coming a mile a way . Ill give you an example . Young daughter dressed up in bandages says to her father at Halloween   Would you like to become a mummy ?  and her father replies  Answer at the bottom of the review .But its not only the flat jokes that caused me to hate this  Its the flat jokes combined with a politically correct agenda . The plot revolves around a mixed race step family and one of the children suffers from cerebral palsy. If this was a politically incorrect show it might possibly be sick but it might also possibly be funny in a sick way  but being PC theres no chance of offence and no chance of a smile either as most of the running time seems to be taken up with issues like handicapped relationships and Hindu festivals  and the cynic in me believes that the BBC will counteract anyone criticising this flop comedy with cries of  racist  or worse . Im not racist but I do have a sense of humour  You need one if youre a working class Scot called Theodore  and this sentenious garbage is just not funny    Jasper Carrott is a comedian I can take or leave but like any other comedian hes at his best when hes at his most politically incorrect . He had me in stiches with a sketch spoofing  CORONATION STREET from 20 years ago  Oh weve just received a wedding card  Whats it say ?   All the best and thumbs up   Thats nice . Who sent it ?   The Faircloughs  Youll get the joke if you can remember a certain court case from 20 years back .  And the punch line is  No thank you its bad enough being a daddy  . Bet you didnt see that coming".

Respect!However As this particular sit com developes I am becoming very interested in the writer for one reason.  The characters portrayed are beginning to eclipse my own family with the exception that we are not a divorced couple with children and neither are we of different cultural backgrounds.  The uncanny similarities lay primarily with the disabilities portrayed.Our eldest son had a rare metabolic illness which meant he had no coordinated movement or speech but was intellegent and communicated like Rhaj through facial expression. My youngest son has yes you have guessed it Aspergers Autism.  I watched this evenings episode and the script unveiled explaining to my Builder' husband that I suspected that the youngest boy had autism.  At that point my daughter rang me to ask if I was watching the programme and if I had been instrumental in providing the plot. As she is a script writer she was mortified to think I had given away a potential story line which she could have used.So my question to the writer is this.  Out of pure curiosity who did you base the script on and what research did you undertake?.  Is this coincidence or it there some divine explanation for the similarities.

Titta ignore everyone and probably he has no emotions at all. Basically there is no story.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman Titta Di Girolamo a physically nondescript middleaged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy. When we're introduced to him at the start of the film he's been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italianspeaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo's cash tell him that 10000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth. Having eventually done this  bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love  is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's troubles. This initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of 50 a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his nonlife Titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous. The first half of the film may be described as slow by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo  the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would  is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out. Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist and in a far more explicit way the Al Pacino film Insomnia Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious it's almost impossible to pinpoint its cause if indeed there is one. The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia played by Olivia Magnani granddaughter of the legendary Anna and the memory of Titta's best friend a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again. Though it's never explicitly spelt out the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecitt during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postinolike fare more La Vita  Bellastyle films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore L'Imbalsamatore and others.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very visual film. By that I mean that the dialog is sparse almost to the point of being a silent movie for some very long takes beginning with the opening shot.The silences however are broken by a stunning sound track that ranges from discordant staccato beats to a haunting mix of violins and interspersed with vocals that sound like dreams. It's a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes one of the early visuals being a man walking along a street so preoccupied with his interest in a shapely woman that he walks into a lamppost one of the consequences of love and a metaphor for what lies in store...A long time ago another movie  Love Story 1970  said that love is never having to say you're sorry. This narrative turns that idea on its head in a number of ways beginning with the main character Titta Toni Sevillo a seemingly innocuous longterm resident in a plush hotel somewhere in Switzerland. Everyday week in week out he sits at the same coffee table enjoying the passing world his cigarettes his coffee his solitude  and he's been doing it for ten years. He sits he observes and once a week he engages in three very surprising activities that you'll find out about when you see this little masterpiece...Love is explored in another way in a direct counterpoint to Titta's solitude and reserved nature two older residents of the hotel are still much in love but the man wants to die in a spectacular manner when his time comes while his long suffering wife berates him for cheating at cards with the other guests one of whom is Titta. Now Titta knows about their squabbles their love the man's cheating his apologies to his wife and his whining. How? In a surprising and blackcomedic manner...one of those surprise activities I mentioned.But this is no comedy in reality although it does touch upon the idea of the human comedy in a Balzacian sense the irony of life and what to do with it. That decision had been made for Titta ten years earlier when he left his wife and began to live in the hotel. He keeps in touch occasionally and it is clear that he still loves his children now grown up and the sorrow in his voice speaks volumes. But there's something more than just sorrow...Such a life as Titta's would obviously seem to be utterly boring and it actually is from many perspectives. It is only when we learn what lies beneath his almost deathlike countenance however that the horror of his situation hits the viewer between the eyes. But not before we know that the female bartender Sofia Olivia Magnani is very interested in Titta and goes out of her way to pique Titta's interest in her.And that's when things start to unravel for Titta he eventually succumbs to her femininity and in doing so discovers once again the consequences of love. Ironically in doing so he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life and in a most spectacular fashion.I know that all of the above is somewhat cryptic but to say more would spoil the film and story for you. If you like Italian cinema  I love it!  I urge you to see this one. The acting is superb the sound track chills the spine the camera work is truly innovative the direction shows the maturity of a true artist.I know I'll see this movie again and again...".

Although it talks about Mafia it is watched in another way and often it seems just a secondary theme. I went to watch that movie for case because the otherone's theatre was full and I was satisfied at the end. It surprised me because of its black irony or cynicism and there are more and more interesting items to analyze. It doesn't follow the classical ways of movies it is just different and I think not to be the only one to like that. I am very happy also because it is Italian and I was afraid that Italian directors and producers were not enough brave to change themes. In this movie you can watch new Italian style as well but is not blocked into clichs. I hope to be understandable enough I know it is difficult I hope also that this movie can be exported out of our frontiers it is a good product to export. I want to point out also the music very good soundtrack the movie needs it because of its long silent pause and they are covered perfectly by that music. Many compliments to the director and thank you cinema needs these movies.".

From the first shot you know the movie is going to be something special. The beautiful cinematography left me in awe of what can be done with a camera. The music is also on par with the visuals complementing the colorful and stylish architecturelike images.Toni Servillo plays the main character in the film Titta. He's a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel. Every week he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and the story plays around this.He is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone Looks calculated and welldressed. He has a habit of ignoring people who are of no significance to him. For example Sofia played very nicely by Olivia Magnani who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives. Although she's been working in the hotel for two years he never greets her even if she does greet him. On one day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits at the bar instead of his usual spot at a window. From here the story really begins and will unfold in a strong tale of love sacrifice and the mafia.I won't spoil the rest of the film. See this film if you love stylish movies like ones from David Lynch The Godfather etc. Don't see this if you're an actionbuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening shot is hypnotic drawing you in. Into a world of strangeness and solemnity. A deep Italian baritonevoiced narrator making the invite ever more enticing. ThenA middleaged gentleman just sits in the hotel lounge looking intelligent and distant distinguished but also downright arrogant and rude. He never speaks to staff or other guests even despite having been in residence for ten years.He does something without fail every Wednesday  and a couple more things the same day once a year.The sort of gentleman one could chance upon in any hotel pretty well anywhere in the world. A pokerface of nothingness smoking his life away his concentration on his inner world only broken by the burned out cigarette stub. The excellent acting of Toni Servillo coupled with the sublime direction of Paolo Sorrentino employing a Kubrick style of slosteadicam with an ever sense of steady dread. Always compelling rather than propelling the story unfolds with Servillo's character Titta as he leads this strictly regimented life until confronted by the stunning Sofia the barmaid. She looks at him straight in his eye and states that she's made his bed served him this and that had always been polite and courteous for the three years she's worked there. And he's never had the decency to utter a single word to her. Instead of being nice back or even saying anything at all we're aware that a flicker of something human has sparked within him. But as the very title states this lowering of his guard could very well be his downfall. What does however inflame this film and raises it even higher are the occasional flurries of activity. Titta hardly does anything more than almost nothing driving one block or looking around  not buying though  a shopping mall is accompanied by very loud punk rock music. This is unsettling  is this a dream he's having? Does he yearn for the fast life? Are the people he meets from a past productive life? Do the characters he encounters then have any relevance to him  and to his situation now? The scenes look very real the mood and ambiance are definitely not.Moving on into the realms of more conventional crime drama but still with a cool unease and an almost Memento meditative pace the whole reveals lives and opportunities lost. Of redemptive longing and knowing one's own fate. This is an intelligent film that refuses to retread a potentially familiar path.If in the U.K BBC4 shows it again wrap yourself inside it be enveloped by it. You'll want to watch all of it not that you know why but you'll be glad that you did. It's only 90mins. I've seen The Consequences... four times now and I never tire of it. The ending will have you quietly shocked and amazed too.".

One mans love for a younger woman a younger mans love for his older brother the mafias love of money at all costs these are just some that intertwine in a story that has you guessing or rather not knowing where and how it will end. The cast are all superb from Sophia the teasing barmaid to the straight facedness of titta the films central character. With simple yet affective camera work bounced off an everchanging soundtrack that mixes lowfi trip hop with lush orchestral pieces. The style of the film changes beautifully using several styles without ever getting cluttered.

The best thing on it is a great great actor. You know if your name were Al Pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance. But it's only a great theater Italian actor called Toni Servillo.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this interesting film back to back with the ChineseFrench film 2046 at the recent Dubai Film festival. Both were intelligent works made the same year 20042005. Both had the main characters living in a hotel. In both films the hotel is more a metaphor of exile than a location. Both dealt with love between a man and a woman. Both had wonderful music and riveting performances. What a coincidence and yet how the two films differ in treatment of the subject! Somewhere at the beginning of the film a man walking on a pavement turns to look at a woman and in doing so hits a lamp post. The audience erupts into a volcano of laughter innocently. But isn't that brief shot the synopsis of the film that entertains you for 2 hours? While the film is a wonderful blend of black comedy e.g. using a stethoscope to listen to a neighbor's conversation in the adjoining hotel room the film builds on what Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati had introduced to cinema earlierstoic faces that leads to comedy quite in contrast to the equally intelligent world of Robin Williams or the heartwarming Danny Kaye. A sudden frenzy of activity transforms an otherwise stoic character while moving money from the hotel to the bank is reminiscent of Tati's works.But the film is not mere comedy. The antiautomation statement cash counting and the reaction of the bank staff to the statements relating to it the dummy that acts as an ineffectual warning to the speeding lady the reference to Moulimix as the fictitious company he works for etc. are several cues that the director is offering a loaded comedy to the viewer. Laugh yes but reflect on it and enjoy further..The movie's strength lies in is brief staccato script by director Paul Sorrentino that offers comedy that is mixed with philosophy Truth is boring Dad is dead but nobody told him Bad luck does not existit is the invention of the losers and the poor. Then the director goes on to provide you with a fascinating lecture from the main character on insomniacs. You will not sleep through this lecture.Sorrentino provides entertainment pegged to the subject the Italians know bestthe Mafia. It is an existential mafia film.There is a loaded philosophical sequence where a young girl sitting opposite the lead character Titta Di Girolamo reads aloud a passage from a book Whatever he wants can happen. What a fine mess. That is the advantage of using memories to excite oneself. You can own memories you can buy even more beautiful ones. But life is more complicated human life especially so a frightening desperate adventure. Compared to this life of formal perfectionism cocaine is nothing but a stationmaster's pastime. Let us return to Sophie.. We become poetic as we admire her being beautiful and reckless the rhythm of her life flowed from different springs than ours. Ours can only creep along envious. This force of happiness both exciting and sweet that animated her disturbed us. It unsettled us in an enchanting way but it unsettled us nevertheless. That's the word. The reaction of Titta to the passage is interesting. Titta is himself a cocaine addict. Titta looks at the barmaid of the hotelhis own formal perfectionism. The following sequence is of Titta calling his own wife and daughter on the phonea conversation filled more with silence than words. They too are Titta's memories. The final sequence of the film is of Tittas' best friend Dino Guiffre working alone repairing a fault on an electricity pylon in biting wind in a snowy landscaperecalling his own best friend Titta. This is a film about friendship that transcends the mafia.Since Truth is boring the director provides a dessert as part of the fine meal of superb acting Toni Servillo good music clever camerawork Luca Bigazzi a beautiful enigmatic actress Magnani granddaughter of the great immortal beauty Anna Magnani and powerful script. The dessert is for the viewer to figure out the truthful feelings of Titta towards his family members towards his hotel guests towards the bar girl towards the mafia towards the bankers towards the hotel owner and towards his best friend Dino. Assuming that the viewer accepts the eventuality of how Titta recovered his suitcase from the goons how does he get inside his car and get it covered with its synthetic cover while he is still inside it? Perhaps it is Sorrentino's admitted love for the literary works of Louis Ferdinand Cline that has sculpted the character of Titta. The film's end will remain an enigmatic one for a reflective viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Consequences of Love begins with some very stylish introductory sequences acquainting us with the ritualised life of the protagonist. Most of the movie essentially consists of a series of 'clues' thrown to us by the director through which we gradually form an understanding about Titta Di Girolamo's circumstances and tragic existence. At some point the movie abruptly shifts gear in order to show how this fragile world is demolished as a consequence of the thawing of Titta's human emotions. Regrettably this is where the movie fails in this viewer's opinion. The reason is the very weak nonbelievable and unmotivated twists in the plot. Titta's character performs a massive swing from never exchanging as much as eye contact with anyone to performing mindless acts of dangerous folly to get Sofia's attention. This extreme tension within him has been so carefully hidden from the audience that when the swing happens we are all left wondering. On a minor but related point we are never really sure as to where Sofia's interest in Titta comes from. In general one might say that the movie succeeds in engaging the audience only in a 'solvethemystery' or 'whoisthisman' kind of way but never manages to really make us care for any of the characters.To the movie's positive elements must be attributed the superb acting of Toni Servillo the inspired camera work as well as very good use of musical ambiance. However the truly exquisite style of the cinematography at times seems like the movie's own enemy as there are scenes shouting with the 'stylishness' of fashion or car commercials detracting from the movie's aims. In all it is worth seeing and should be given credit as a promising effort by a new director but sadly not much more.".

Why a gorgeous hotel receptionist an exception to the dullness of the film would be the slightest bit interested in a moody chainsmoking silent loner who speaks in 'deep' aphorisms baffles me. Very difficult to feel any sympathy with the main character. One feels like shaking him by the throat and telling him to 'snap out of it!'. His brother is a much more human character. The ending is inconclusive and puzzling. Everyone in the cinema when I saw the film went out muttering about how they nearly fell asleep. Of course it shouldn't have to be a Hollywood Bruce Willisstyle 'shhotemup' and 'crashbang' fiesta but a little bit of energy and action would have made it a lot more thrilling.

Are we meant to care more because that he is also one of the meanest unfriendly people you could ever meet? And he smokes...so he must have deep personal issues. Pop psychology at it's best. In the final moments I almost cheered as he gets buried in the cement. Best place for him. And I thought that was about the only good scene. Or maybe that was because it was so close the final credits.3. The entirely tired and unbelievable interest in the main character from the beautiful girl. She was there simply because beautiful girls always have odd sexual relationships with old old men with a deep and meaningful personality as demonstrated by smoking. Happens all the time.

Other than this weekly trip he is free to do as he likes and what he likes to do is smoke play cards with a man who cheats and a wife who reminds the husband how far they have fallen socially and ignore the friendly overtures of Olivia Magnani who has spent two years trying to get a smile andor a 'good evening' out of him.

The final inconsistency occurs when Magnani tells him she will pick him up the following day at 4 pm in her car and they will drive into the mountains to celebrate his birthday. We've established that she lives locally so why she is then seen driving from somewhere miles away ignoring a police roadblock to drive off the road and overturn the car is anyone's guess.

	schema:headline " It takes courage to die an extraordinary death";
	schema:reviewBody "A stylish storytelling. Dramatic like Malna but with the eroticism toned down. Dialogues are focused because director Paolo Sorrentino is hellbent to make spoken words as limited as possible.Introvert Titta di Girolamo from Southern Italy lives alone at a hotel in Switzerland confined by the mafia. Everyone is curious about his profession. He is shown as the one of those uptight people who hardly utters a word and lacks in imagination. Everything is fine and smooth with his life until he falls in love with a barmaid. Since the movie is Italian and mentions little of Mafiosi I expected guns and tragic scenes. And the fun is that the filmmaker managed to twist around everything we know of clichs about Mafioso. Does the barmaid reciprocate and fill his life with something exciting? Girolamo wrestles with insomnia and hopes to find courage to get out of the prison kind of life.An irony of a scene comes up somewhere in the beginning. Girolamo shares a quiet dinner with a couple who is his neighbour. The narration shows that bitterness corroded the husband's life as he exclaims to his wife I was immoral and wicked and I ruined your life. You know what frightens me most? Dying of old age I want to die an extraordinary death. And right at that moment his wife hands him a pill and says You've got to take this now Carlo.There's another scene of the old couple. The husband tells her woman they should holiday to Cambodia and so she asks where would they get the money. He replies that he will sell off the painting gifted by her mother. She retorts that the painting is the last sign of her mother. To this he gets angry Your materialism revolts me. You're just a petit bourgeios. All this time Girolamo had been listening to them with a stethoscope held to an adjoining door between them.I just love verses being read out.

	onyx:emotionText "A stylish storytelling. Dramatic like Malna but with the eroticism toned down. Dialogues are focused because director Paolo Sorrentino is hellbent to make spoken words as limited as possible.Introvert Titta di Girolamo from Southern Italy lives alone at a hotel in Switzerland confined by the mafia. Everyone is curious about his profession. He is shown as the one of those uptight people who hardly utters a word and lacks in imagination. Everything is fine and smooth with his life until he falls in love with a barmaid. Since the movie is Italian and mentions little of Mafiosi I expected guns and tragic scenes. And the fun is that the filmmaker managed to twist around everything we know of clichs about Mafioso. Does the barmaid reciprocate and fill his life with something exciting? Girolamo wrestles with insomnia and hopes to find courage to get out of the prison kind of life.An irony of a scene comes up somewhere in the beginning. Girolamo shares a quiet dinner with a couple who is his neighbour. The narration shows that bitterness corroded the husband's life as he exclaims to his wife I was immoral and wicked and I ruined your life. You know what frightens me most? Dying of old age I want to die an extraordinary death. And right at that moment his wife hands him a pill and says You've got to take this now Carlo.There's another scene of the old couple. The husband tells her woman they should holiday to Cambodia and so she asks where would they get the money. He replies that he will sell off the painting gifted by her mother. She retorts that the painting is the last sign of her mother. To this he gets angry Your materialism revolts me. You're just a petit bourgeios. All this time Girolamo had been listening to them with a stethoscope held to an adjoining door between them.I just love verses being read out. Here in the movie a young woman who happened to occupy Girolamo's favourite seat reads out a beautiful verse about love to her friend. With the barmaid behind him it seems like the situation is telling him to do something but he just stands there.The soundtrack of the movie suits exactly.

The concrete grave the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming maleness are laid bare and exposed for what they are. Just brutality and business and no more.

Our hero is indeed a hero in that he gives up his life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape his decorative prison. The consequences of love are indeed beautiful and brutal at the same time. See it!!".

The demon did remind me a bit of the demon in Within The Woods or even Evil Dead but than with very simple effects I guess it was made from papiermch. Secondly a book is the reason why the demons come alive just like Evil Dead. As I said the acting was really wooden and exaggerated the only one who could convince me was Ashleigh Holeman Eva.

It's easily on the bottom ten anyway.When it comes to horror movies I have very low standards. I'll overlook all sorts of shoddy filmmaking for a good scare. But this movie is embarrassingly bad. It looks someone bought a video camera at Sears and decided to make a movie with his buddies. The fact that every single crew member's name appears in the cast list proves this theory I think. This movie has lower production standards than your average high school play. It's actually a little shocking to see a movie that looks this bad released on DVD. The special effects are somewhat effective at times but are still amateurish at best. The best thing that can be said about the actors is that at least they remember no to look into the camera most of the time. I can't say for certain if they struggling to remember their lines or making them up as they went along. Any and all attempts at humor are lame. This movie is such a colossal waste of time.".

Well this must have been what went through the minds of the young Campbell brothers back in 2003 presumably right after watching Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead or a similar independent horror classic.

I've seen quite a lot lousy Bmovies in my years as a horror fanatic but this honestly ranks as one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made. And it's quite sad to be this openhearted because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions. There's pretty much no script at all. A duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a bum and whilst reading some passages of it one of them mutates into a hideous demon that starts killing off members of all the different teenagergroups dorks hot Catholic girls stoners and troublemakers. That's about it except of course for all the obligatory clichs like the hot girl falling for the biggest dork etc etc... The performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry! They just stand there motionless until the script says it's their turn to interact. I hate that! Some of makeup effects are remotely decent but still not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most awful punksongs ever. This film should never have been released... I can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be a part of the production but it's utterly imbecile and doesn't feature the slightest redeeming element. Not even a bit of amateurnudity damned!".

I liked the jogger stepping in a puddle of blood. One powerful shot had a woman backing off from her date after he was hurting her somehow and he swung out his arm breaking a light and plunging the room into darkness.

	schema:headline " One of D.W. Griffith's first first attempts at comedy...";
	schema:reviewBody "After many failed attempts to become a writer for the rising American film industry 34 years old playwright D.W. Griffith ended up being hired only as an actor as nobody really had faith in his work as a writer. However in 1908 Griffith was offered a position as a director at the American Mutoscope  Biograph company an opportunity he took without hesitation as his entrance to the industry's area that really interested him. At Biograph Griffith was slated to direct dozens of short films where he began to develop the many techniques that years later would be considered as cinema's true language. Since his first movie The Adventures of Dollie Griffith began to experiment with editing cinematography and other narrative devices that would result in his 1915 epic The Birth of a Nation. But while those early films weren't exactly on par with other filmmakers' movies in terms of quality they always showed Griffith's inventive spirit.A Calamitous Elopement Griffith's seventh film or eight depending to sources is just another example of this a movie that while not exactly successful shows Griffith's innovative mind at work and forecasts elements from his future works. A short comedy A Calamitous Elopement is the story of a thief named Bill George Gebhart and how he became comically involved in a couple's elopement. Frank Harry Solter and Jennie Linda Arvidson are a young couple in love but Jennie's Father Charles Inslee hates Frank and disapproves their union so the couple plans to run away and get married. Exactly at the same moment when Jennie plans to escape Bill the thief plans to get inside her family's house and discovering what the couple is trying to do Bill plans to use the situation to his advantage. However Bill is not exactly a skillful thief and everything is set up to end in hilarious calamity.Working at Biograph Griffith not only had the chance to become a director he also finally made his dream of writing movies a reality. A Calamitous Elopement was one of the first movies where he had full control doing the writing of the story as well as the directing of the film.The short film consists of several fun situations where Bill gets in trouble because of the couple's elopement escape making his robbery a lot more difficult than he expected. The jokes work nicely most of the times but the story is written in a very convoluted way with a lot happening too fast and without many explanations. It is clear that Griffith was still learning about the possibilities of cinema as it seems like he wanted to put as much as he could in 12 minutes making the film look a bit too complex for its own sake.As usual it's in his directing where Griffith shows his talent and even in this simple short he manages to put a lot of creativity in the making of this movie. Playing with editing he makes a highly dynamic film for its time keeping up with the frantic pace the story has and making great use of the inherent slapstick of silent cinema. Obviously the film is not a masterpiece and nowadays it may not produce more than a chuckle however Griffith makes some of the jokes work very well despite its narrative flaws. A lot of this depends in his handling of the cast and even when this time he moves away from his realistic style and opts for overthetop performances Griffith makes it work within the film's context creating fun scenes of slapstick that look really good given the budget thanks to his care at editing.The cast is mostly effective considering the limitations of the story. As Bill the thief George Gebhardt showcases a natural talent and astounding comedic presence. As the film's protagonist he manages to convey a sympathetic character despite the fact that he is a thief and one wonders if his performance here had any influence in posterior similar performances by other comedians. The rest of the cast is less important in the film although everyone gave at least competent performances. While Harry Solter doesn't give a good performance Griffith's wife Linda Arvidson makes her character pretty believable and helps both actors to deliver a nice job. Finally Charles Inslee's overthetop performance as Jennie's father is effective although a bit too typical. Still it's good for the limited screen time he had.A Calamitous Elopement isn't really a great film but it serves to show Griffith's developing his talents with creativity and an eagerness to learn that would take him to discover and develop some of cinema's techniques that are still used today. A Calamitous Elopement is definitely not one of Griffith's best as even for its time it was kind of outdated however it's interesting to see Griffith making a comedy as most of his early short masterpieces would be either powerful melodramas or thrilling adventure films. It's highly possible that this little movie will be of interest only to those interested in D.W. Griffith's life and times as other than being a significant chapter in the development of his skills there isn't a lot to see in this little short. 510".

It starts with a young couple deciding to elope while an opportunistic thief looks to take advantage of the situation. Almost the whole plot is contrived and implausible  in any movie you can accept one or two instances of this but when almost every scene contains unlikely coincidences bizarre decisions by the characters improbable developments and the like it's just too much to overlook.As a result this is just not very good. It has a number of humorous moments but it's not always clear whether all of them were intentionally funny or not. A more careful comedic touch could have smoothed out some of the apparent gags that don't quite come off. There is some skill in the way that the film was edited together but nothing outstanding enough to make up for the rather weak nature of the material itself.".

In true romantic fashion our hero played by Harry Solter meets his beloved beneath the balcony to her bedroom to spirit her away but unknown to them both a wily thief George Gebhardt has got wind of their plan and sees a way to profit from their planned elopement.The film isn't bad for its era but it certainly isn't vintage Griffith. He was still at the beginning of his directorial career when he made this and it shows in the rather pedestrian use of the camera. For a comedy it isn't particularly funny and although Griffith gets a writer's credit it's clear that many of the scenes are largely improvised. Of interest to Griffith buffs only I think.".

	schema:reviewBody "If The Little Hut had been done as originally written by Andre Roussin had been done this might have been a far better film. In the original version the Ava Gardner character actually does have sex with all concerned on the island she's stranded on. But Hollywood is still in 1957 a prisoner of the Code so that kind of infidelity could never be shown on the big screen. If there is a French language version of The Little Hut I'll bet it's far better.The French characters are changed to British here and even stranded on a tropical island they all behave quite civilized even in adultery. Stewart Granger and Ava Gardner are married and are on a yachting tour with a party of friends including Granger's best friend David Niven. The ship goes down and the three of them are stranded on the island where they build two huts a big one for the married couple and The Little Hut for Niven. But with not a whole lot to do on the island they engage in a lot of frank dialog and Niven opens up that he's been Gardner's lover for about six years. Granger who does kind of take things for granted with Gardner is affronted but as captain of the former ship decides that if his powers include marriage they also include divorce. He divorces Gardner and Granger and Niven exchange huts. Later on a really hunky looking native that Gardner looks lasciviously on enters the picture and things really get complicated.That lascivious look was not acting on Ava's part because she was involved with Italian actor Walter Chiari at that time. If the script had called for them to do the deed she would have no doubt been even better.The Little Hut with all the sex taken out plays like a combination of The Admirable Crichton Three's Company and Gilligan's Island. I'm sure Sherwood Schwartz who produced Gilligan's Island saw how the cast lived on that island how they showed such ingenuity in creating some creature comforts that he probably incorporated much of it in his show. It's the best part of The Little Hut.The play on which this was based was a big hit on the West End of London but when it came to Broadway in 1953 it flopped terribly with only 29 performances. Playing the Granger Niven and Gardner roles on Broadway were Roland Culver Colin Gordon and Anne Vernon.If the film were done 20 years later as originally conceived by Andre Roussin the results would have been better. But the stars especially Niven are three of the most charming folks around and they put it over as best they could.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ava Gardner Stewart Granger and David Nivens headline this atrocious film from the 1950's. They are three unfortunate souls washed ashore a deserted island after a terrible shipwreck. Much like 'GILLIGAN'S ISLAND' and 'SWISS FAMILY ROBISON' these three survivors have no trouble in adapting to the 'jungle' life while finding just about anything to eat without poisoning themselves or getting terribly sick.But this also makes room for the three survivors one woman and two men to get tied up in a nasty love triangle. Never before have I seen such a tawdry and weak script that was terribly acted out by three screen veterans who were forced to star in this schlock. The only other laughable plot I could compare to this atrocity to would be the love triangle acted out in 1978's 'THE SWARM' where Olivia De Havilland found herself caught between Ben Johnson and Fred MacMurray whilst being attacked by a swarm of bees.For these three people you would think taking survival on a day by day basis until the possibility of rescue would be their top priority. Instead the first things that come to their minds is who will get to have sex with who first. The film tries to deliver this situation with a dusting of light comedy and charm but you can't for a second take this seriously. It's almost as if the three actors just gave up halfway through the film and said To HELL with the acting let's just hurry up and get this done so we can go home!The island itself is basic 50'sstyle. Potted plants and silk screens painted with volcanos are the backdrop while the cawing of Australian kookaburras and the chirring of crickets sing in the background. Most likely this was filmed in some small Californian MGM studio backlot.There really isn't much else to say about the plot. The predictable happens and everyone goes home a happy camper. For Ava Gardner this was only the beginning of a string of duds she released in the 50's including 'THE SUN ALSO RISES' and 'THE NAKED MAJA' but she would undoubtedly clean up her act in the 60's by starring in lavish productions such as '55 DAYS AT PEKING' and 'THE NIGHT OF THE IGUANA'.This movie was quite a disappointment. Fans of Granger should stick with classics such as 'SCARAMOUCHE' and 'BLANCHE FURY' and fans of Niven won't find him in anything suitable after this film until the 1961 release of the war classic 'THE GUNS OF NAVARONE'.Renowned channels such as Turner Classic Movies and American Movie Classics should be ashamed to show this movie which is a complete mockery of the three actors involved. Anyone who hadn't seen any of the three actors in anything else before seeing this film would most likely get a prejudiced impression of their acting abilities. Fans of Granger Niven and Gardner should stay away.My Grade 110".

	schema:headline " Probably the Weakest Episode of Season One";
	schema:reviewBody "If I was going to skip one episode of Supernatural this season this would probably be it. It doesn't fit in with the story arc or add anything to the season's mythology. It does show Dean as someone capable of deep feelings. He thought that he loved Cassie and when Dean loves people he doesn't lie to them. He sleeps around with a lot of women but he's capable of more. When he does open up to someone like Cassie he stays committed to them even years later. He drops everything to go and help her which I think is sweet. It also shows the difference between Sam and Dean. Sam was willing to marry Jessica without ever telling her the truth about the family. Dean as soon as he felt something real for a woman told her everything up front. Dean's usually more willing to break the rules for the people he loves than Sam is. Really though if you're in a hurry to get through the season you can skip this episode and not miss anything.Route 666 revolves around a ghostly racist monster truck killing African American men. It runs them off the road then vanishes into the night. One of its victims happens to be the father of Cassie Dean's old girlfriend. She dumped Dean when he told her about his life of hunting but now she needs his help. Sam  Dean come to town and start investigating. It turns out that the truck belonged to an evil racist guy name Cyrus. Cyrus wanted to marry Cassie's mother and when she choose Cassie's father instead Cyrus went nuts. He firebombed a church and tried to kill Cassie's dad.Dean and Cassie get closer again. They wind up sleeping together. Meanwhile the truck picks off another victim this one white. Cassie's mother finally explains that Cassie's father killed Cyrus after Cyrus nearly beat him to death. Then Cassie's dad and his friends hid the body. Now Cyrus is back for revenge and his spirit is attached to the monster truck. Sam  Dean have to stop it by tricking the truck on to hollowed ground the church that Cyrus burned before Cyrus can kill Cassie. Then Cassie tells Dean that she really doesn't see a future for him given his life style as a Hunter and Sam  Dean leave town.There are some good parts to this episode. I like Sam teasing Dean about his relationship with Cassie. He's so happy about Dean actually caring for a girl that it's like he's mentally singing Dean and Cassie sitting in a tree... It makes me laugh. I think it's cute when Sammy acts like a pesky little brother. Also I like the way the brothers defeat the monster truck at the end. It's very cool with the truck sort of dissolving into nothing as it meets the Impala head on.On the downside just the fact that I feel bad about giving this episode a low rating shows that the social message takes over from the story in Route 666. My grandparents came from different cultures so I think that this could actually have been a good story to present on the show. It's important. But it's done way too heavy handedly here and it comes off a fake. It's not a story about racism. It's like a 45 minute public service announcement saying Racism is bad with nothing else to make the characters and their problems real. It cheapens the whole message because it doesn't connect with the audience. It's a hollow cardboard presentation of a real life problem. Plus Cassie herself is very VERY unlikable to me. Nothing against the actress I have no problems with her. But Cassie dumps Dean twice TWICE! in one episode. She only calls him because she need him after she broke up with him when she found out that he was a Hunter. Then she uses him and tosses him aside after he solves all her problems for her. He opened up to her and she broke his heart. I just can't like anyone who hurts Dean I don't care how relevant a social message they represent.My favorite part of the episode Sam's saying how much he misses college and conversations that don't start with 'So about this killer truck'. It makes me laugh every time.".

	onyx:emotionText "If I was going to skip one episode of Supernatural this season this would probably be it. It doesn't fit in with the story arc or add anything to the season's mythology. It does show Dean as someone capable of deep feelings. He thought that he loved Cassie and when Dean loves people he doesn't lie to them. He sleeps around with a lot of women but he's capable of more. When he does open up to someone like Cassie he stays committed to them even years later. He drops everything to go and help her which I think is sweet. It also shows the difference between Sam and Dean. Sam was willing to marry Jessica without ever telling her the truth about the family. Dean as soon as he felt something real for a woman told her everything up front. Dean's usually more willing to break the rules for the people he loves than Sam is. Really though if you're in a hurry to get through the season you can skip this episode and not miss anything.Route 666 revolves around a ghostly racist monster truck killing African American men. It runs them off the road then vanishes into the night. One of its victims happens to be the father of Cassie Dean's old girlfriend. She dumped Dean when he told her about his life of hunting but now she needs his help. Sam  Dean come to town and start investigating. It turns out that the truck belonged to an evil racist guy name Cyrus. Cyrus wanted to marry Cassie's mother and when she choose Cassie's father instead Cyrus went nuts.

My favorite two favorite parts when Dean arrived at the crime scene after being called by Sam and just before Dean went to Cassie's and the two of them were standing by the car talking and it is revealed that Dean actually loved Cassie. The episode itself was great.. interesting highlights and special effects but J2 just stood out to me for the reasons listed above. J2 are both awesome actors. My hats off to you both.".

The only problem I have with this episode is Cassie! As a number of people have noted she was attractive. That's where her contribution ends in my opinion. She was a terrible actress she was screechy and she overacted in every scene. Every line had such emphasis. Also she had no chemistry with Dean. He did  he's great at showing just the right balance of emotion and restraint and Dean clearly felt for her wanted her and their time together obviously meant a lot to him. She well she was just plain bad. I agree that I would have liked her character to return in future eps but played by a better actress. Lisa in later episodes was MUCH BETTER!".

	schema:reviewBody "Apart from being a clever and wellmarketed variation on the nowadays hugely popular horror genre and a splendid formula to attract potential new fans in general I always somewhat considered Supernatural as a massively giant homage towards the genre through the decades. Although not always noticeable to younger viewers andor people who only have an interest in more recent horror films each and every single episode contains a few obvious and subtler references towards classic and influential titles. From that point of view it was only a matter of time before the writers would pay tribute to the 'creepy vehicle without a driver' type of films and even more specifically the 70's milestones Duel Steven Spielberg's acclaimed debut and The Car. Being an avid fan of these two films I enjoyed Route 666 a lot even in spite of its flaws and shortcomings. The episode opens tense and atmospherically on a remote Missourian road where a black man is hunted down and eventually killed by a menacing monster truck with seemingly no driver behind the wheel. The victim's daughter Cassie happens to be Dean's exgirlfriend and she calls the Winchester Brothers in for help. The brothers can't prevent two more similar accidents before discovering the ghosttruck sudden presence relates all the way back to a racial dispute of the 60's involving both of Cassie's parents as well as several more prominent inhabitants of the little town. Some of my fellow reviewers around here tend to label Route 666 as one of the weaker entries in season one mainly because the script is too preachy regarding racial issues and shows a different and more emotional side of Dean's character. He's usually the strong silent type whereas here he's confronted with unfinished romantic affairs from the past here. To a certain level I agree with the racism debate but it didn't bother me that much really. The writers eventually had to give an explanation to the presence of the ghost truck and racial conflict is an acceptable one as far as I'm concerned. Concerning Dean's emotional vulnerability I can only state it's admirable to see how the writers continuously attempt to provide depth and detail to the main characters. Dean's behavior towards Cassie sheds a whole new light on him in fact. Besides what really counts in this episode is the wondrously sinister truck and its virulent attacks. It's an impressive and overpowering vehicle producing blinding lights and grisly engine noises. In case you worshiped the brilliant aforementioned Duel you will definitely find some amusement in the compelling chase sequences depicted in Route 666.".

However you won't miss much of the story arch if you miss it. MY vote is 7 out of 10.";

I can tell you there is no ocean or shrimp boats fresh crab or scallops anywhere near Missouri. Cape Girardeau is the only inland Cape it's on the Mississippi River. It looked like the license plates were from Mississippi which may explain why there was so much racial tension. Missouri and Mississippi are 2 completely different states that don't touch one another. There are many roads in and out of town and none of them are Route 6 or Route 666. This whole inaccuracy was very distracting. Also Cassie did not seem like someone who would want to hang around Dean if she was well educated. I did not buy them as a couple and didn't enjoy the lengthy love scene. Jo was more Dean's style.".

Looking at a herd of wild Mustangs he decides to drive them north with the help of Isom and Gideon Walker. Gideon hires Agostina Vega and Mexican cowboys to run the Mustangs. Call leaves the drive for Nebraska and runs into Cherokee Jack and a group of Indians which almost costs him his life. In Montana Newt and Jasper get into a shootout in the local bar and wind up in jail. The odds of them surviving the lynch mob are slim until Dunnegan has them freed. Newt had rescued his wife Ferris from a band of cattle rustlers and Dunnegan was thankful. However Newt and Jasper will have to work for Dunnegan to keep their freedom. Newt has mixed emotions about working for Dunnegan who helps him in any way because he also has respect for Call who may or may not be his true father. Dunnegan has big plans for his cattle and the future. Those plans do not include those who do not throw in ...";

I have put off watching this sequel for the better part of 10 years due to the bad reviews I'd heard about it. If Tommy Lee Jones wasn't playing Capt. Call I didn't see the point. If Larry McMurtry wasn't involved why should I care? How wrong I was.This is in so many ways a worthy sequel to Lonesome Dove maybe even more so than the dark mood of Streets Of Laredo. The story acting production cinematography are all topnotch. Of course the script isn't as colorful as Lonesome Dove but it has it's moments. And much to my surprise there are bits of Lonesome Done in this series the relationship between July and Clara completely dismissed in the prequel is brought up here almost identical to the book a most welcome surprise. The story isn't all roses it has it's surprises too. By far the biggest surprise is Jon Voight's interpretation of Capt. Call. While not a direct copy of Tommy Lee Jones' his is both faithful and unique to Voight's credit. The cast is fantastic all across the board and I don't think Rick Schroeder has done a better job of acting than in this series. Oliver Reed practically steals the show here he is superb in a role that makes you care for his character as equally as you hate him.It is worth it to watch this if you haven't due to bad criticisms especially that the DVD is so affordable I got the 2disc set for 10.99 you can probably find it cheaper. It is in no way the disappointment that Dead Man's Walk turned out well it was for me. And MCMurtry was involved with that one!".

Lou Gossett Jr. playing Isom Pickett is not somebody I'd mess with he is a bad ass with perspective. William Peterson does a great job as well. Rick Schroder is back as Newt with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his stint on NYPD Blue. My only problem with this film and it's really picking nits is that I had the impression that Call wanted to be the first man to graze cattle in Montana and it's obvious that Dunnigan had already been there a while. A little inconsistent but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the fantastic tale. I especially love the apparent character growth of Jasper Fant and July Johnson.

The language is more subdued. There is plenty of violence and one particular scene with Cherokee Jack is particularly gruesome. However overall a great movie. The acting is superb. William Peterson is fantastic. Such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic timing. Jon Voight aptly fills Tommy Lee Jones' shoes as Captain Call. Ricky Shroder gives a great heartfilled performance as the young boy who grew up with no family to claim him. Highly recommended.".

This production was top notch with the original music score and the actors put their hearts into ityou can tell. If you want to watch lonesome d. with Robert Duvall and tommy L.

There is no comparison between Lonesome Dove and any Western film at least not since the legendary collaborations of John Ford and John Wayne. It was with real reservations that I sat down to watch this new miniseries what with McMurtry's nonparticipation and the missing original cast members. After watching the first episode it was clear that this is no Lonesome Dove. In almost every measurable way this sequel falls short of the original. But so what? I wasn't expecting it to measure up. Taken as an effort of it's own this film is engaging entertaining and of a very good quality. If it were done as a new story not as a sequel to Lonesome Dove there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings. Jon Voight did a creditable job as Call Barbara Hershey was a terrific Clara and the new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well rendered and believable. Louis Gossett jr. deserves special mention as the horse wrangler Isom Pickett. The film made me care about the characters and I don't ask any more than that from an actor. it is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of it's predecessor it is worth viewing in it's own right.".

That's a tall order for any story.But amazingly Return to Lonesome Dove is up to that challenge. That is if you look past all the controversy and the fact that its not written by McMurtry if you do you will see a very rich and entertaining mini series. It stays true to McMurtry's characters Captain Call Clara Allen and Pea Eye are all the same. Newt's growth as a character evolves nicely and believably for a young man growing up on his own. The new characters are compelling and believable and they interact seamlessly with the familiar ones from Lonesome Dove. The storyline itself is believable and riveting as well. Its not Lonesome Dove but its well worth watching and a worthy successor.Its a great pity that McMurtry denounced this movie as being non canon for in my humble opinion it is superior to his own sequel offering of Streets of Laredo a book that was depressing almost to the point of being unreadable. Don't get me wrong I'll always be grateful to McMurtry for Lonesome Dove and have the utmost respect for him great author but he does the fans of his story something of a disservice by denouncing the sequel mini series. I suggest overlooking him just this once. You will miss out on another great story if you don't.".

Return To Lonesome Dove has in my opinion at least a weak first act as it struggles and fails to capture some of Lonesome Dove's magic however the writing improves and maintains a higher standard from act 2. Ultimately it's a worthy mini series in its own right not on the same level as Lonesome Dove or Streets Of Laredo but enjoyable none the less.

	schema:headline " OK as it's own Western but a tremendous letdown being called a sequel to the finest Western of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "Lonesome Dove which originally debuted on television in 1989 although a television miniseries remains the finest Western to ever hit the medium in my opinion. Despite a really long running time of six hours the miniseries had fantastic acting great writing beautiful cinematography and scenery and some of the most likable characters you could imagine in a Western film. It was deservedly a huge success with audiences and critics and many miniseries which followed tried to imitate its success and all of them failed. Due to it's popularity a sequel was almost obvious but this sequel seems like it was a very rushed production and seems to forget about everything that made the original so exceptional especially the exclusion of Larry McMurtry and Tommy Lee Jones. That's right Jones does not return as Call here. He instead decided to star in The Fugitive the same year a smart decision as that film won him an Oscar and he is replaced by John Voight this time around. Voight was also offered Jones role in The Fugitive but when he found out Jones declined to reprise his role here he quickly accepted turning the other part down the actors basically switched roles. The story picks up where the original ended and after that it's a basic and basically boring retread of the original. If you want to see a few familiar faces from the original miniseries rest assured a few do return. Ricky Schroder is back as Newt though his character here is more irritating and uninteresting whereas he was likable with Gus and Woodrow in the original. Chris Cooper returns as July and his role should have really been an uncredited cameo as he is given very little to do over a sixhour period. William Sanderson and Barry Tubb also reprise their roles from the original. Replacements or substitutes for the original's characters are Barbara Hershey replacing Anjelica Huston as Clara. Though she does give it her best Huston nailed the part to perfection the first time around and the chemistry between her and the original cast could not be beat. Hershey and Voight are OK together but she seems more like she is doing a poor imitation of Huston rather than putting a fresh new spin on the character and it just doesn't work. Oscarwinner Lou Gossett Jr. goes along for the ride I guess as a substitute for Danny Glover's Deets in the original. Gossett never seemed to find anything worthy of his talent after winning the Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman and that is also evident here. It's a sad waste of his fine talent and even though he tries he cannot compare with Glover from the original. Voight does OK as Woodrow but Tommy Lee perfected the role giving a miraculous performance. Voight pales in comparison despite good effort. Reese Witherspoon also gives one of her earliest performances here and her character is so bland an underdeveloped she is essentially wasted. The cinematography and scenery is OK here but nowhere near as good as the first which is what made it I think the finest Western of our time. The story lags and never really gains any momentum whereas the original in spite of being sixhours never made me wonder when it was going to end because I loved every single minute of it. This is really an unofficial sequel because at the time Larry McMurtry was writing a novel sequel to the original entitled Streets of Laredo which would also be adapted as a miniseries two years later. By not having his involvement this sequel suffers tremendously and totally contradicts the entire Lonesome Dove series in general as according to McMurtry none of these events ever really happened in accordance to the timeline of his book series. Overall despite good efforts from the cast some fine cinematography and scenery this miniseries is way too slow and suffers in comparison with its fine predecessor. Of course I am sure they knew it would be nowhere near as good as the first when they made it but the end result could have been much better than this.".

I can even begin how how pitiful they made Woodroe. I understand he would be old by that time but everyone knows that he would NEVER let that pull him down. The first movie was the best and the only one that I'll ever watch. I hope to God that no more directors plan on continuing or remaking the wonderful classic without Tommy or Duval.

When watching this film I was reminded of how timid and mundane most bigbudget Hollywood films really have become.Especially notable is an exceptionally strong performance by the film's lead  Jorge Cordova.  As an villainous thug on his way to the top of the crime heap Cordova plays a conniving brutal conceited devious and sleazy S.O.B. but he is so likable that he keeps you entertained the whole time.

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Ritchie's The Couch Trip is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It is so subtle and wicked that you start to realize what a stinging satire it really is. It is also Dan Akyroyd's best movie made in a particularly great film year 1988for him. First The Great Outdoors and now this.Akyroyd stars as John Burns a career crook who fakes insanity to escape prison. Now a dumb comedy would just be about this. But The Couch Trip uses this as a springboard for everything else. Beverly Hills psychiatrist George Maitlin Charles Grodin subtly hilarious herehas a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected Lawrence Baird who happens to be Akyroyd's psychiatrist! You can pretty much guess what's going to happen but the great thing about The Couch Trip is not what happens but how it is done. The Couch Trip gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he has ever had. His John Burns is one of the truly original comic creations in movie  history. Wicked one liners and physical humor are a part of it but what makes it special is that Akyroyd makes Burns a lovable character. We root for him and grow to like him a whole lot during the 98 minute running time.But Akyroyd isn't alone here. He gets strong support from other great comic actors. Walter Matthau joins the hilarity as a con artist minister who catches on to Burns' secret and commits genteel blackmail. Charles Grodin slow burns his way to another great comic role as the burned out psychiatrist. Grodin has been one of the most underappreciated actors in Hollywood. It's criminal they haven't used him more often. Richard Romanus plays Grodin's slimeball lawyer to perfection.The Couch Trip is one of many films made by the nowdefunct Orion Pictures Corporation that are currently unseen. MGM spent a fortune buying the Orion library but have yet to truly cash in on their acquisition. The Couch Trip joins Dressed to Kill Blow Out and countless others in gathering dust rotting in the vault. Shame on MGM for their inaction. Hopefully with new management The Couch Trip will find the audience and respect it deserves. out of 4 stars".

The only person that knows he's an imposter is the drunken priest Walter Matthau who comes along to be pampered by Ackroyd's new found wealth having blakmailed him.

He heads to L.A. with his assumed name to sub for an unstable radio shrink Grodin and his candid approach garners him citywide attention.  He fast talks his way into a big contract and seems on his way.  He gets distracted though by knockout Dixon his reallife wife how lucky who is some kind of shrinkproducer and also by Matthau's perceptive homeless schemer.  He's onto Aykroyd and says he'll keep quiet if Dan splits the cash with him.  That's just a little of what's going on in this busy little conman adventure as at the same time Grodin is getting wise with the real doctor Aykroyd is impersonating. And Grodin's wife is also involved with his lawyer who is seeing dollar signs in Aykroyd as well is a kissbutt producer and annoyingly assisting Grodin is Clennon the real doctor who is supposed to be replacing him.  There are a lot of great jabs at the psychiatry profession and the entertainment business the best being the short but very memorable scene where Aykroyd takes calls on the radio one of the funniest scenes I've ever watched. Unfortunately the film ends abruptly and could've used a better knock out blow.  But from beginning to near end this provides a lot of solid laughs and it's too bad that the kind of plot it has doesn't permit another trip to the couch.".

When he intercepts a call for Dr Baird to replace LA shrink Dr Maitlin in his practice and his radio show.  Baird had been selected because he was inept enough not to put Maitlin in the shade.  Burns escapes from the hospital travels to LA and assumes Baird's identity to get the job.  Issues are complicated when drifter Becker recognises Burns as a conman and tries to get in on the act.This is an earlier version of Dolly Parton's Straight Talk'  a straight talker gets mistaken for a radio host gives mad advise but the public love it.  This is complicated by Matthau's conman getting involved and other little subplots.  The plot doesn't always convince or hold the interest but it is quite amusing at points.  The ending is pure laziness as it attempts to milk a happy ending out of unlikely circumstances.Aykroyd is well suited to his character and provides all the jokes here. Grodin and Matthau are both good but Matthau is certainly greatly underused. Really it's Aykroyd's show and everything slows down when he's not onscreen or when he's having to move the story on.Overall this is a very standard film.  It's only amusing when Aykroyd is allowed free reign for the rest of the film it's dull at times aimless and meandering at others.  Of the famous cast this is nobody's finest hour.".

Issues are complicated when drifter Becker recognises Burns as a conman and tries to get in on the act.This is an earlier version of Dolly Parton's Straight Talk'  a straight talker gets mistaken for a radio host gives mad advise but the public love it.  This is complicated by Matthau's conman getting involved and other little subplots.  The plot doesn't always convince or hold the interest but it is quite amusing at points.  The ending is pure laziness as it attempts to milk a happy ending out of unlikely circumstances.Aykroyd is well suited to his character and provides all the jokes here. Grodin and Matthau are both good but Matthau is certainly greatly underused. Really it's Aykroyd's show and everything slows down when he's not onscreen or when he's having to move the story on.Overall this is a very standard film.  It's only amusing when Aykroyd is allowed free reign for the rest of the film it's dull at times aimless and meandering at others.  Of the famous cast this is nobody's finest hour.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Couch Trip bears all the hallmarks of a failed vehicle to inflate the principal actors' fame at the expense of longterm product saleability. Just watching it you catch moments that would appear in a trailer  oneliners mostly  yet the overall plot is farfetched and ridiculous. Some may say that the movie is supposed to reflect the insanity of its protagonist Becker Dan Aykroyd but I disagree. The acting is wooden more times than not and the plot's clunkiness is too noticeable to overlook.Aykroyd delivers his character and dialogue with Aykroydesque aplomb but never really breaks through an invisible barrier of being... Dan Aykroyd playing an obviously Dan Aykroyd role. Matthau delivers perhaps one truly funny line see the scene where he literally sucks all the jelly out of the donuts using straws If anybody wants a donut without the jelly they're ready. but the rest of the time he treads out a tired role in a way that clearly indicates how unhappy he was making this film. Grodin is just more of the same... a pentup angstridden bag of nervous energy on the verge of a complete mental collapse  a parody of his repertoire  and delivers a prosaic role.The humour is overtly physical though much too inferior for successful slapstick. The scripting problems come down to the fact that it was written to the actors' needs rather than the audience's benefit. It accommodates them in all their clichd glory. No scene illustrates this better than when Aykroyd is in a limousine with the TV on in the background. A semiwitty condom commercial starring Chevy Chase plays  an obvious reference to their onscreen partnership in Spies Like Us  and even here Chase succeeds in being a sendup of himself.Most of the Saturday Night Live crew were involved in many of memorable family of comedies in the 1980s of which Aykroyd and Grodin are members. The Couch Trip comes across as a quickly throwntogether industriallyproduced colourbynumbers replica of National Lampoons promising funny actors never delivering.It's a lazy piece of filmmaking that was intended to give Aykroyd more airtime forgive the unintentional word use and barely makes use of Matthau except as a parody of himself.Truly unforgettable.".

I had no idea what it was about  I thought it was going to be a journey into the realm of sexuality when I heard Chevy Chase played a condom man and the movie's title involves the word couch trip wink wink. Then I figured out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping. My expectations dropped even lower.I was literally expecting a grin movie  the type where you grin once and walk out feeling a bit cheated. And in a way this is cheap comedy  it doesn't have the greatest gags the plot is ludicrous but you know what? I had a big dumb smile on my face the entire time I was watching it.Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns a patient at a mental hospital who may or may not actually be mental. He gives the psychiatrist Lawrence Baird David Clennon plenty of grief and misery which leads us to believe he is a sane person after all.Following a little bit of a riot in the mental institute's cafeteria Burns is awaiting a tonguelashing from Baird in his office when the phone rings. Burns picks it up pretends to be Baird and finds out the caller on the other line Harvey Michaels Richard Romanus wants the real Dr. Baird to come fill in for a radio shrink named George Maitlin Charles Grodin who is taking a vacation with his wife Vera Mary Gross. Michaels wants Baird so bad he has even booked him a ticket on an airplane.Burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist and drives to O'Hare. He gets Dr. Baird's ticket gets on the plane and eventually poses on the air as Dr. Baird. His show is a phenomenal success. People love him! one man says and the other man replies It's because he actually cares about them.Donald Becker the late great Walter Matthau is an exmental patient who recognizes Burns' clothes to be confinementissued pants and shirts. To keep him quiet Burns promises Becker a percentage of his income. The secret is kept closed.Meanwhile Maitlin and his wife get in an argument. He flies home to end his vacation short and realizes that the man on his talk show is not in fact Dr. Baird after all but no one believes him. He gets the real Dr. Baird but unfortunately he has lost his ID so the police take them as nutcases and don't listen to their story.Let me name just a few of the plot holes I noticed while watching this film Burns poses as Dr. Baird but is never asked for his ID even when claiming his plane ticket he was robbed he says but they would still make sure he is Baird. If Burns becomes so very famous how come the real Dr. Baird in Chicago never heard people talking about him? Word travels. And finally why would the police ever arrest Maitlin and Baird the real Baird that is without following up on their stories?To be frankly honest I couldn't care less. I went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me  I really liked it. It entertained me. Its ideas are essentially ludicrous and not at all realistic but Dan Aykroyd gives a truly spirited performance as a halfaloon that makes The Couch Trip a trip worth taking. 3.55 stars John Ulmer".

And at least in that part of the film things just happened so easily...and almost totally illogically. Things improved once he took up his role as a fake psychiatrist radio personality.Second if you're watching this film because of Walter Matthau you're probably going to be disappointed. He's very clearly the second or third banana here and that's quite a stepdown from his star status of less than a decade earlier. Yes his role is critical to the story but just about anyone could have played the park.Charles Grodin always worked out pretty well when a part suited him. This is not one of those times.I don't even know what to write about this movie. It's just okay has a few funny moments. But it's just disappointing. Maybe watch it once.

There's an identity mix up and Burns is mistaken for Baird leading to him being the host of the show.

He soon becomes the most listened to talk show in the U.S. and he definitely has the numbers to prove it. But eventually the real Baird finds out about the mix up and attempts to track down Burns. What follows is a nice little cat and mouse game of a movie with some pretty decent acting on Dan Ayrkoyd's part. Walter Matthau also gives a good performance as Burns' cross country tag along.The tone of the film is incredibly well balanced and the jokes are mostly hits. In fact there's nothing too terribly wrong with this film. It's surprising it's gained a reputation as a terrible film. It has a lot of heart in the story and it's very well cast. Dan Aykroyd is perfect as conman John Burns. His performance is reminiscent of Bill Murray in Stripes which is an interesting turn for Aykroyd considering by this time he had been type cast as the techno babbling sideman.

	schema:headline " Fun movie that unfortunately gets worse toward the end.";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a good and enjoyable 'silly' comedy that is filled with a whole bunch of crazy fun characters. A typical great '80's comedy with also some great '80's comedy stars in it.The movie is truly uplifted by its cast. Dan Aykroyd is really great. It's funny but I don't I've ever seen him play the main character before in a comedy. I already always liked him as the sidekick but with this movie he proofs that he can also handle a comedy in which he plays the main character. The movie also further more features Charles Grodin and Walter Matthau among others. Esepcially Charles Grodin is also great as the stressed out psychiatrist. Walter Matthau seems a bit out of place since his character doesn't serve a significant enough purpose in the movie comicalwise.The concept and the story show great comedy potential. An escaped 'menthal' patient takes the place of a psychiatrist. He and his radio show become an huge success. But of course soon things are starting to go crazy again when people start to see through his scam and the real psychiatrists shows up. It provides the movie with some great silly moments and some real great laughs. The movie made me laugh out loud at times due to how silly it all became at times.But things start to get really crazy toward the ending of the movie in a not so positive way. The movie tries to put way too much in the ending both comically and dramaticmorally. The movie gets very crazy and unbelievable and things get rushed way too hard. Even the characters start to not work out as good anymore. The movie tries too hard but it simply fails. The ending just doesn't feel right and satisfying enough. A shame otherwise I would had surely rated this movie higher.A movie definitely worth watching for a couple of good laughs but it just isn't the best 'silly' '80's comedy around.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "This was a good and enjoyable 'silly' comedy that is filled with a whole bunch of crazy fun characters. A typical great '80's comedy with also some great '80's comedy stars in it.The movie is truly uplifted by its cast. Dan Aykroyd is really great. It's funny but I don't I've ever seen him play the main character before in a comedy. I already always liked him as the sidekick but with this movie he proofs that he can also handle a comedy in which he plays the main character. The movie also further more features Charles Grodin and Walter Matthau among others. Esepcially Charles Grodin is also great as the stressed out psychiatrist.

The nutcase replacement becomes a hit with all of his listeners except for a homeless man Walter Matthau who knows the truth about him. Considering the cast you can't help but view THE COUCH TRIP as a major disappointment. I'm not sure of the history behind this film but it really does seem as if the three leads signed on to do the picture and then the script was written. Then the screenwriters already knowing they had these comic geniuses signed on decided to just come up with the weakest idea and try to pass it off as a story. The entire story is basically your typical mistaken identity thing but it just doesn't work in terms of laughs. You pretty much know a story is in trouble when the cast has to work so obviously hard to try and come up with some laughs. This can be seen as early as the first scene when a man is about to commit suicide and the Aykroyd character walks out onto the ledge to try and talk to him. Just watch how hard and overthetop Aykroyd is having to act and it's because the material is so weak. All three of the actors give it their all but there's just nothing here for them to work with. Aykroyd goes overthetop playing this madman but no laughs ever follow. Matthau plays crazy better than anyone else but it just makes you smile and never does it get a laugh. Grodin plays the same type of smug character that he's done throughout his career but it just doesn't work here. The entire film is just one bland joke after another and if it wasn't for the actors giving it their all then you would have hit the eject button after about thirtyminutes.".

Burns runs amok at this place getting it on with the secretary Victoria Jackson and making life miserable for his stuffy hostile psychiatrist David Clennon. One day he intercepts a phone call to Clennon who's been selected to temporarily fill in for a hot shot L.A. pop psychiatrist Charles Grodin who's suffering from lots of stress. He pretends to be Clennon and the hilarity ensues as he keeps up the charade in front of Grodins' associates played by the likes of Richard Romanus Donna Dixon the lovely real life Mrs. Aykroyd and Arye Gross.You know you can't go completely wrong with a cast such as this. Everybody plays their role to the hilt whether it's Clennon as a guy we'll love to hate the perfectly chosen Grodin in peak grumpy form Arye Gross as a pathological ass kisser or Mary Gross as Grodin's wife. Aykroyd is amiable and charming and as good at ever at getting lots of dialogue out quickly. Good character actors add to the enjoyment Mickey Jones J.E. Freeman David Wohl Michael Ensign Charles Levin Scott Thomson Don Stark and others. But you have to pay close attention to catch a cameo by Chevy Chase who'd acted for director Michael Ritchie in one of his most successful vehicles Fletch. It's also a joy to see veteran Walter Matthau in one of his more carefree roles as a self styled oddball who realizes Aykroyd's secret and attempts to blackmail him.The plotting is kind of standard as we see the highly unorthodox and tactless Aykroyd actually become a real hit on the air while filling in for Grodin. This however leads to one of the better gags in the picture as Aykroyd thinks he's found the solution to following through on his promise of free therapy to Grodin's patients. The R rating does allow for some well timed but not excessive use of profanity  that actually made it into the trailer!Six out of 10.".

One thing that you might want to do if you are going to see this movie is to go into it not knowing anything about it. I had not known anything when I went to the screening other than it was called Camile. It really is worth seeing.";

I don't know why she was even interested in a loser like James Franco but married him anyway. I like him as an actor and also thought he did a terrific job. He has nothing to be ashamed of. There have been movies with with similar setups e.g. Ghost. I simply love Sienna Miller and went along with the situation as written in the script. I feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated and hope it becomes more recognized by the public. I thought all of the actors played their parts very well and hope more people get to see the movie. I highly recommend it.

I thought it was hilarious and a typical Hollywood piece of crap.... until I watched it later on from the beginning.I won't spoil the ending for you but if I told you what happens in the end you too would probably think this movie was horrible and ridiculous. Camille is quite farfetched and strays from the normal love story except for it's another movie where a female character believes she can change her man. What surprised me about this movie is how deep of a character Camille really is. Her emotions and free spirit kept me interested. I always considered Sienna Miller to be overrated until the movie Camille came along. She is from England yet her southern drawl is quite convincing. Her character is wellwritten. She's is the stereotypical foolish southern girl who is foolishly in love with a petty thief who is just interested in escaping to Canada to get away from the authorities. While I didn't find James Franco to be very convincing not that I ever have he did do an adequate job of playing the inconsiderate badboy. Sienna Miller however draws you into the story. You can feel her heart break when she finally realizes that Silas truly doesn't love her. For the rest of the movie you can't help but feel terrible for this innocent woman who only seems to be full of love. The supporting cast is also complete. David Carradine Cowboy Bob and Scott Glenn another underrated actor compliment Sienna Miller and the story perfectly. There is some great cohesiveness going on between the actors in this feature. I would definitely recommend this movie for people who can suspend disbelief for the corny parts of the movie but who love heartwrenching films. It's a true gem for romanceseekers out there!".

But then Camille dies. And becomes undead! Yes that is where the film becomes ridiculous with Miller walking around undead but actually in the process of dying she starts to physically decay. I'm confused too. Franco falls in love with Miller amidst thefts blue horses and a crosscountry chase for Franco who is mistakenly thought to have murdered his wife. But somehow amidst all the crazy inane happenings Camille becomes moving and memorable. Miller's love is so strong that it can't be stopped even in death and it's really just a different kind of love story. Franco hates the movie he blasted it in an interview but he's pretty good in it as is Miller who consistently does excellent work but never gets noticed for it see her wonderful work in The Edge of Love for instance. And they have some nice chemistry together. Not a good film by any means but kind of sweet in it's own odd way.".

It feels like more could have been done with the story but it is definitely safe to say that Camille is original and charming. For some people that may be enough. This is the story of the most contrived and surreal honeymoon trip to Niagra Falls. A young thief Silias is on parole so he can marry Camille the sheriff's niece. He doesn't love her and she is kind of self centred but if he doesn't go ahead with this he goes back in the hole. They depart for the falls in a lousy little bike and side car and they barely get a mile before they have an accident which becomes a chain reaction for a weird and wonderful remainder of the journey and perhaps a chance for Silias feelings to grow.There are two things that Camille would've needed to be on par with the great realist fantasies such as Groundhog Day. It feels a bit shallow for one thing and its beauty is only skin deep. For another it is obvious that the story doesn't take itself seriously and some bits are played for laughs but not enough to make it work as a comedy. It could have been a tad funnier.Sienna Miller's career is still young but each time I see her I realize that she is capable of variety. She has been to the Venitian Baroque era Casanova To Edwardian England The Edge of Love A killer super villain in black leather G.I. Joe although she wasn't all that great there. Here she plays a really big narcissist but one with a cute touch. She totally upstages James Franco who has never really done much for me.I don't think Camille will disappoint. It could use a few touches here and there but it is likable.".

Someone else said it was 'Pavlovian'. I don't really get that but then again I didn't particular understand the movie. Was it Pavlovian because she still thought she was alive and therefore she was? And she's so in love with Silas too that she held on? It's pretty odd. There was no real explanation it was kind of just like 'we're going to throw that key event part in there and roll along with the story now'. So is she a zombie is she a ghost? The last 15 minutes in particular are ludicrous.However it's definitely an intriguing film and reasonably enjoyable to watch if you can manage not to let all the silliness and strangeness distract you. I think the overall result would have been hugely improved by a lot more work on the script  there just wasn't enough framework in place to carry off the storyline with any finesse or credibility.".

	schema:reviewBody "The less you know about the plot the better. The best way to enjoy this movie is to just expect a fairytale. Be ready for a crazy surreal comedic  romantic story and don't try to rationalize any of the wacky things that happen.I picked up this DVD for 2 at my local Blockbuster and if you hurry down to yours there may be a few left in the bargain bin. You'll get your money's worth and then some! Packaged as a romantic comedy about a good girl  a bad boy the description hardly begins to scratch the surface. But I have to commend the DVD distributors for not giving away the story. The fun is when it hits you and you realize what an original cute  slightly creepy story this is. And the humour follows brilliantly. I advise you not to even watch the trailer which gives away the story somewhat.Still you're probably wondering what the heck this movie is about. I won't say but you can probably compare it to such surreal modern fantasies as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Stranger than Fiction Being John Malkovich and an obscure gem called Grand Theft Parsons. All these excellent films share the common approach of dealing with heavy soulsearching themes in lighthearted ways. They make you think about your life  your philosophy of living or... you could just enjoy some laughs  silly times. There's something in it for everyone.Camille is rated PG13 and even that is a bit stern. There's no nudity no gratuitous sex or violence and hardly any profanity that I can remember. Compared to other modern romcoms it may seem watered down to some but to me it was even more refreshing. Like a fairytale there's something about it that makes you feel like a kid again even though the story can get pretty weird.The acting  casting is perfect. Sienna pulls off the lead role of being a hopelessly cheerful girl without being sappy or annoying. Her beau is the perfect counterpart a cynical rogue but with a boyish innocence and cute crooked smile that makes you instantly like him even when he's being a total butt. And David Carradine as the wise yetkooky cowboy... wow what can I say but he has a great comedy career ahead of him if he chooses to go that way.So don't hesitate to go see this film. It's a romcom a road movie an emotional drama a fantasy  above all else a fairytale. If more movies were like this I'd probably start going to the theater again.".

Only to be disappointed to find erm no there's no explanation at all and the twist at the end makes it even more confusing. At the end of the movie you'll probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing in a Que paying for you groceries and the merchant told you that'll be 11.95 please and proceeded to elbow you in the balls for no apparent reason. There are so many factors in this movie that go unexplained and I think it leaves it to the imagination of the viewer in an entirely bizarre way. Don't get me wrong I like weird movies 'The Cell' could easily be described as weird and twisted but in my eyes it's a brilliant movie despite casting JLo who I dislike to the maximum even that didn't manage to sway my opinion. This isn't one of those movies and I think you should take in to consideration the characters of those who praise this movie. I can tell you they are probably the sort of people that would go to an art exhibition see a splat of pigeon excrement on a white board and say Oooooh what a masterpiece the artist has truly found a unique way to portray eternity when in actual fact all it is is bird excrement on a board.Keep that last bit in mind when watching this movie Thanks for reading!".

Don't wanna give it away cuz the movie isn't released yet but its totally cool and you would never expect the stuff that happens. I kinda thought I would hate it cuz its a romance but its also kinda twisted and stuff which I like a lot. The acting is really good and Sienna Miller is totally smokin' and plays this really sweet girl. I think she should do more roles like this. James plays a jerk but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is really good. David Carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. I gave this movie a 10 because I came out of the movie really liking it and wanting to see it again which I didn't expect and my girlfriend really liked it and cried. good date flick".

From a spotless weddinggown to withering away as we age with love that only grows stronger and more true. This is definitely a loveit or hateit movie though everyone seems to agree that the acting was superb. It's the size and softness of your heart that will determine if you love it some people just don't get romance. I have seen it now several times on video and I still can't help but cry when it rains rice and when Silas and Camille dance in the rain to the Ways of Way Back When. And I'm a grown man go figure. Beautiful stunning movie a fairy tale for those who have lived long enough to understand true love whether they've found it or not.".

And the acting writing directing is all excellent.With a budget of around 6 million Camille definitely flew under the radar. I'd never heard of Camille before seeing it listed in on the guide.

And the acting writing directing is all excellent.With a budget of around 6 million Camille definitely flew under the radar. I'd never heard of Camille before seeing it listed in on the guide. That's a shame. I'm sure that it would have been a success at the box office if they'd advertised it a bit.Camille 2007 is a must see. You'll really enjoy it!";

I'm not a sap and am a hardcore fan of action thriller and scifi but i almost got a little emotional during this movie. James Franco is the ultimate guy's guy and a complete ass most of the time  which makes everything so much more believable and the feelings you feel at the end seem natural as well. I'm not familiar with the actress but her performance was amazing. And because the slow scenes give lots of make out opportunities it's definitely a datenight movie.".

I guess you could say that this was a decent madeforTV movie for 1980 but it is superpredictable and the acting except for Robert Conrad is generally subpar. The football scenes are nothing special and seem to mainly act as filler for the movie. The movie is very dated now but a decent remake could probably make this into a good movie. However is that really necessary? I mean how many underdog sports team works together for the big game with the undefeated guys movies do we really need? This is probably a good movie for your younger kids if you find it in the bargain bin but a sports movie buff will find it lacking.".

Seemingly harmless Mr. Rabby takes matters into his own hands when it seems the police are neutered by lack of evidence to convict loathsome parents of their terrible abuse towards their children. The children are emotionless and zombielike..due to the amount of abuse inflicted upon them the parents loud inconceivably harsh contemptible and belligerent. The mothers in particular are so obscene you'll root for their execution. They are essentially miserable people taking out their frustrations on the kids. Our detectives are a tired lot frustrated with the whole judicial process how police procedure is often unable to prosecute those who beat their kids into submission. While the crimes themselves are heinous the film doesn't explicitly elaborate the grisly activity on screen. I'd say the reason to see this is for Tom Basham's performance as the unbalanced manchild who slips into psychosis. There's quite a weird dinner table sequence between Basham's Mr. Rabbey and his guardian shortly after he murdered the parents responsible for the death of their child regarding how he lives in a fantasy and how what he had just done has left an indelible mark..notice the changes in behavior pretty impressive work going from innocent to creepy. Peter Renaday is Lt. Hayes the detective in charge of the homicides cases expressing on his face the strain that is taking it's toll on him. There's an early performance by John Ashton as detective Matthews always raising the ire of Hayes because of his inability to follow directions not to mention how opinionated he is regarding the parents abusing their kids. Awkward laidback bluesy score that seems improper for a film such as this. Controversial conclusion establishing that even kids can only tolerate so much. A bit too slow moving for my tastes but there's an effective use I felt of Basham's eyes before he takes care of business waiting patiently as he prepares to strike.".

In terms of acting there are some who do put effort into their roles but also others who look as though they are just reading lines. The real problems though were with the characters story and especially the script. The characters are stereotypical with not much development going on. The story is not exactly dull but it is never exactly exciting either and holds few surprises too. The script is the worst offender often cheesy and stilted than not.

	schema:reviewBody "This is about some soldiers Delta force of course who are sent into Chechnya to retrieve an American mad scientist who has decided to sell his services to the highest bidder. In this case the Chechen rebels. He's made some killer bats for them. There are also some Russian soldiers Spetsnaz of course wandering around providing fodder for the bats. I don't think the Russians were too highly trained they pile out of their truck and are ordered to secure the area yet they stand around like a bunch of high school kids waiting for band practice to start. Anyhow the Americans capture the mad scientist but then the Chechen rebels show up and try to get him back. We get plenty of bat attacks a lot of bats flying around ominously and unnoticed and the requisite number of explosions.The acting is actually pretty descent and the special effects looked alright. You can tell all the helicopters are CGI but it doesn't jump out at you like a laughable special effect unlike most of these SciFi Originals. The bats looked pretty good though I find it a bit hard to believe that a bat has enough mass and velocity to actually sever someone's arm but oh well...it's scifi. The story is a bit of a mess especially near the end when one of the Americans is captured by the Russians and is about to be taken away on a helicopter. But then the helicopter pilot flips up her visor and it turns out to be the American CIA operative. So she infiltrated the Russian base took out the pilot hid his body someplace changed into his clothes and can even pilot a helicopter? I guess those Russian's really are poorly trained. You know they just had to have that flipping up the visor scene because it was sooooo cool the money shot lol.If you're the type of person who watches these SciFi Channel Originals this one is a cut above the majority of them. I'd recommend a few beers to dull your senses to some of its flaws but it's a fairly enjoyable film overall. The characters are basically likable the action moves along okay and stuff blows up. The scene where the mad scientist meets his fate is quite cool and actually was a really interesting twist on the whole camouflaging yourself from the enemy thing.".

One of the best elements about this one is that the films beginnings as an Action film work incredibly well in placing rather impressive action scenes in the film. the first ambush in the forest is one of these great scenes with a lot going on to take control of the bats as they're valiantly fighting the creatures swarming all over the area making for an impressive sequence. Likewise the takeover of the bunker and the later ambush in the woods help keep the action going with the firefights explosions and creature attacks to work in a rather impressive amount of action. Aside from the fine action pieces there's some rather good times here with the film making the most of the bats as the central villains as the swarm here is just big enough to do some real damage as this is gory enough to matter and the special effects used for them are actually very well done with the CGI swarms getting good definition by letting each creature be spotted and the closeups for the individuals being kept to a minimum so that the focus remains on the group in action. There are a few flaws here mainly in the rather flimsy story about the purpose behind the mission to get the scientist. It's all quite haphazard as it was done in just a few brief segments that don't make a lot of sense. Otherwise the bat attacks comprise so few moments of screen time that it's bound to be somewhat disappointing with that factor keeping the creatures to a few select scenes but this isn't enough of a flaw to really hold back the rather important factors here.Rated R Graphic Violence and Language.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released to TV in 2007 Bats Human Harvest chronicles events after info is uncovered in an Alqueda camp in Iraq on the location of an important weapons specialist American Dr. Walsh Tomas Arana. It turns out the doctor has found an alternative funding source and sets up a new research facility deep in the mysterious Belzan forest in Chechnya Russia where he is developing weapons and selling them to Chechnyan rebels. A Delta team is sent on a covert mission to retrieve the doctor and his technology before the Russians find him and his lab. What the team soon discovers is that the doctor's latest weapon is a flock of large carnivorous bats that have been genetically altered to desire human flesh. The Delta team includes characters played by David Chokachi Michael Jace and Melissa De Sousa with help by a Russian biyatch played by Pollyanna McIntosh.This is a sequelinnameonly to 1999's Bats which was a conventional naturerunsamok flick about governmentfunded mutated bats that escape and harass the citizens of a West Texas town. You have to give credit to Bats Human Harvest for trying something different. Practically the entire movie takes place in or near the supposedly cursed Russian forest with the various militaristic groups fighting each other and the mutated bats. So there's a lot of action albeit in a comic booky manner a la Rambo First Blood Part II. Speaking of the bats they're more menacing here and there are some closeups but they're still a relatively weak monster. Thankfully the movie is well made for what it is a madeforTV creature feature and there are plenty of stunning visuals in the forest the bats etc. And the soundtrack rocks. Unfortunately the babe factor is almost zero. Don't get me wrong De Sousa is an exotic curvy beauty but she's clothed in military fatigues the entire flick. As for McIntosh she's definitely an interesting character but she lacks sex appeal for me anyway. Lastly whereas there's a lot of action and cool visuals the story generally fails to pull the viewer into the events. That said I DID care when a certain character buys the farm. The film runs 87 minutes and was shot in Sofia Bulgaria.GRADE C".

There is an attempt or two at stylization in this and they are reasonable. The action isn't terrible. Cinematography and editing are fine. The music is cool enough.

	schema:reviewBody "After watching many horror films over the years the idea of bats being the central feature of a film never really crossed my mind. Bats sometimes are in the background but not the stars of the show. These little mammals are obviously small and maybe a little creepy but unless you get very close I just don't find them very scary.That said in 1999 came the movie Bats which received negative reviews and has been long forgotten. Bats was only for die hard horror fans. Then close to ten years later in 2007 and really out of nowhere came this sequel on the SyFy channel Bats Human Harvest.The setting is supposed to be Afghanistan but unfortunately it looks nothing like Afghanistan. Here there is a Delta Force groups of soldiers trying to track down a terrorist who is a rogue American weapons researcher but along the way they are attacked by geneticallyaltered killer bats. Looking at this the main reason this film fails is because of the bats. There are no close ups of the bats and they are very generic and boring. They just don't work as a villain or a source of danger. Being a SyFy film there are many unknown actors who are shallow and really struggle at times. All in all the horror aspects as well as the CGI here is just of very low quality.One thing I was wondering is just what does this film want to be? It has horror aspects to it but it also contains a war story that is itself pretty shallow and wouldn't work on it's own as a war film. Frankly I do not think war stories mesh well with horror ideas so this puzzle doesn't really fit even though it is original no doubt.Bats Human Harvest is frankly very low quality junk horror that is very hard to sit through and I couldn't wait until it was over. Frankly this series is useless and unnecessary.".

He is this loose cannon who clearly endangers his and the teammates lives to get the job done. Now I am no soldier but I can say this kind of behavior could get you jail time not a slap on the wrist like what he gets. Anyway the team is dropped in a jungle full of Russian spetsnaz chechen militia and of course giant mutated flesh eating bats because why not. The main enemy is the doctor who modified the bats and was using them as a bioweapon. Long story short we get lots of scenes of bad cgi flocking on people plush bats being thrown at characters and some bad Russian accents. It is 90 minute bore and no memorable scenes to even make fun of. Pass this on watch Troll 2 or something.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the modern take on the Cosby Show. While this isn't as successful it is funny. The thing with the Cosby show was that it was quite realistic. This show has some realism but is generally exaggerated and overplayed for more overt humour. It has more daring portrayals and deeper situations too with the Kyle's young son taking drugs and also impregnating his girlfriend throughout the series of the show.The key thing that works here is the cast much in the same way they did in Cosby. This is predominantly a far more modern family younger parents and wilder children. Damon Wayon's is the father Michael and he is hilarious. Damon is all about his delivery and is also a great physical comedian. I love Tisha Campbell as Jay the mother of the household. She looks way to young to have two adult children but you soon forget that. She is vivacious and infectious. Then there is George O Gore as Junior the idiot son. The part is very over the top but funny with Gore playing the dullard superbly. Jennifer Freeman is very good as the eldest daughter too and not to mention sexy. The stars for me though are the child cast. Firstly Parker Mackenna Posey as Kady the cutest sitcom creation since Rudy and the other little kid in the Cosby show. She's a great little actress and some of the lines she has a classic. I laugh almost every time she's on screen and she says something. Kids in these shows can often not have much charisma or can deliver lines well but she does it excellently. The one that really makes me laugh though is the young genius and future husband of Kady Franklin played by Noah GrayCabey. Every line he is given is superb because generally he is given lines to say that you would never hear from someone that young. He's also the maestro pianist who serenades his girl with concerto pieces. The trademark line Anyhoo!' is a gift for the audience that Franklin must utter at least once an episode. It's all funny stuff and lots of running jokes such as the ever more imaginative deliveries of the words yes' and no' with dances and palpitations resulting in an answer to a request from the kids. I have found myself doing the same on one occasion taking a whole 2 minutes to tell my brother that I wouldn't buy him a takeaway.This is a very good comedy show and something I regularly watch. It's been done before but not like this.".

The part is very over the top but funny with Gore playing the dullard superbly. Jennifer Freeman is very good as the eldest daughter too and not to mention sexy. The stars for me though are the child cast. Firstly Parker Mackenna Posey as Kady the cutest sitcom creation since Rudy and the other little kid in the Cosby show. She's a great little actress and some of the lines she has a classic. I laugh almost every time she's on screen and she says something. Kids in these shows can often not have much charisma or can deliver lines well but she does it excellently. The one that really makes me laugh though is the young genius and future husband of Kady Franklin played by Noah GrayCabey. Every line he is given is superb because generally he is given lines to say that you would never hear from someone that young. He's also the maestro pianist who serenades his girl with concerto pieces. The trademark line Anyhoo!' is a gift for the audience that Franklin must utter at least once an episode. It's all funny stuff and lots of running jokes such as the ever more imaginative deliveries of the words yes' and no' with dances and palpitations resulting in an answer to a request from the kids. I have found myself doing the same on one occasion taking a whole 2 minutes to tell my brother that I wouldn't buy him a takeaway.This is a very good comedy show and something I regularly watch. It's been done before but not like this.";

Michael can only hope his parental advice mixed with witty humor will steer his children to act responsibly. Through it all Jr. Claire and Kady know they can turn to their father when they need his guidance. This show has very silly and witty humor that can break your funny bone! This show premiered March 2001 on ABC and was canceled May 2005. But why did ABC cancel this show?

The first actress that played the daughter didn't fit the role the writing was hit or miss and Damon Wayans CLEARLY wasn't comfortable doing such a cornball family friendly show. The chemistry between himself and Tisha Cambell they're long time friends as are all of the Wayans clan with Tisha's husband and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett DID work so they retooled the show. Once it returned they recast the daughter made the son much dumber a la Eric from Boy Meets Worldand made the youngest daughter into a genius...later they gave her a little genius boyfriend to do comedic guest appearances. The show while if often rollercoasters from over the top buffoonery to being corny walks the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see Damon Wayans be comfortable in his own skin on the set especially since the main writers directors and consultants were ALL members of the Wayans family AND in his character. Once everyone had been on the show for a while they worked to everyone in the casts strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show on the air.However there is TOO MUCH buffoonery too many over the top antics and oftentimes too much chaos happening in the life of the Kyle family. They made Junior TOO STUPID they also made the eldest daughter an attractive clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter wasn't even spared by the writers. I feel they jumped the shark and signed the shows death warrant when Junior got his girlfriend pregnant she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced Junior's wife's father's character makes me WINCE just thinking about him. The show remained funny...but it was a UPN show on ABC if that makes any sense to the reader.The reruns are funny enough but I'm relieved it's over...there was nowhere left to go with it. When it's bad it's REALLY BAD. It tends to be cornball at times but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom make it to syndication on a major network..Who can say that for themselves now? Given the CW merger and the brownout on TV networks lately that is. One.".

An ABC midseason replacement Kids felt like a refreshing and real family sitcom without the obnoxious strains to be edgy or a slavish following of the manchild husband nagging wife cute kids formula that runs most CBS comedies. It was an unlikely starvehicle turn for In Living Color alumni Damon Wayans.Wayans constructs the show as a living homage to The Cosby Show a happy affluent AfricanAmerican family with a father who spends most of his time at home a strict but game wife a dimbulb son and adorable little daughter. Tisha CambellMartin Janet plays Michael Wayans Kyle's wife as a partner in his adventures instead of a constant adversary. The new Theo is George O. Gordon as Junior the butt of constant jokes about the size of his head from dad the new Rudy is the a quintessentially scenestealing Parker McKenna Posey. The Cosby Show is highly regarded for a positive portrayal of its characters in the 80s when TV was seen as going down the moral tubes. Kids benefits from a similar swing of the pendulum and got some deserved praise for its ability to resist being smarmy in a sea of garbage.But as the show wore on Wayans' scatological impulses begin to overtake him. It starts with season 2's Table for Too Many a onehour juggernaut where Wayans faces off with Larry Miller at a Benihanatype restaurant and the pee pee jokes begin to fly. A few seasons later Wife makes a spectacular and unexpected leap off the ramp and over the shark when Junior actually impregnates a girl and we're supposed to believe that a character played to us as nearly mentally retarded is becoming husband and father material.From season 2 forward the show gets lazier and lazier. The show is charming and pleasant enough  and would have been a perfect fit for all the conservative crusaders who want all TV to be about nice happy people who nothing happens too but the show begins to stock itself more routinely with sex jokes that are less clever and less implicit. As when applied to any family sitcom it's a little creepy.I like that the show doesn't try to gross us out it doesn't try to be edgy or contemporary though there is a memorably clever A Beautiful Mind homage recasting Junior in the John Nash role. Not to mention the show has the benefit of truly wretched ABC family comedies like Full House and Family Matters still in our memories to make it look better. Wayans does everything he can with what he has and within the limits of the genre as well as his own selfimposed constraints and gets a few good laughs along the way but he alone can't keep the show afloat. The Cosby Show comparisons are a distant memory now as My Wife and Kids fell into the network family sitcom rut.   4".

Damon Wayans is annoying in this I loved him on In Living Color but the whole show is just so campy! In the episode where the son gets some girl pregnant Damon's character wakes the boy up at 5 AM crying like a baby and talking in a baby voice explaining to him that that's what babies do and the audience laugh track? cued. I didn't find that funny I thought it was obnoxious... Then in the two parter when they went to Hawaii...first sitcom clich Hawaii! Why do all sitcom families have to go to Hawaii on vacation or Disney World? Anyways when they were in the airport getting their luggage the little girl and Damon Wayan's character were riding the converbelt...with nobody telling them to stop no security guards no other people around there. That was unrealistic and just plain stupid.Then another sitcom clich later in the episode Damon's character is annoyed with the older daughter so what does he do? Give her the credit card and tells her not to go crazy with it. What does she do? Goes crazy with it wow I didn't see that coming... I really don't see why people compare this to The Cosby Show that was flawless this show is crap in my opinion. If you're looking for something like The Cosby Show then don't watch this.....".

Damon Wayans is annoying in this I loved him on In Living Color but the whole show is just so campy! In the episode where the son gets some girl pregnant Damon's character wakes the boy up at 5 AM crying like a baby and talking in a baby voice explaining to him that that's what babies do and the audience laugh track? cued.

It's as if they went out of their way to make it boring and unimaginative. The kids are nondescript the laughs are sparse and undernourished the plots are instantly forgettable. Now they've even added their own version of Urkel though this kid is much more selfaware than Urkel. Because of the talent involved the show is always watchable but it's a lot like spending 20 bucks to get a frozen pizza you might eat it and even enjoy itbut you sure do feel gypped.".

In this show there are no redundant episodes in which the characters just tease each for no good on the contrary every single episode is enjoyable. There is the terribly funny and 'protactive' father of the family an organizing and a bit passionate mother a slow son a typical teenage superficial girl and a cute baby daughter. But gotta say the father 'Micheal' is the real engine of the show its just hard not to laugh at this guy.The comedy is there but the issues of a modern family is also there which are a bit exaggerated of course in a funny way. There are times when Micheal tricks his daughter into believing that there is a Justin T. concert he doesn't allow her to go concerts alone and busts her on the fake concert location where he takes pictures of her and her friends and adds them to the 'wall of shame' on the refrigerator. This is the most enjoyable sitcom I am watching lately and I d recommend to you to do so too".

Though the series lasted for 5 seasons in March of 2001 My Wife  Kids seems to be a down to home show that has a lot of humor especially with an episode of which Michael takes home a slot machine to deal with how much money you have to budget. Another episode is when Jr. beats Michael in Basketball and tries to overpower his plans to have power and authority of his dad. But My Wife  Kids was a great show that deserves to be on the air more often than just 5 seasons. So I'm giving this show a total of 1010 Super show that hopefully they can make the new episodes to bridge up for that cliffhanger last season.".

The Hole takes place in a crumbling apartment building which is especially well created kudos to the set designer!. Its two protagonists live right above and below each other. The woman is on the lower floor and the pipes above her apartment are leaking fiercely threatening to destroy her food supply not to mention her sanity. She calls a plumber to go check it out and he accidentally pokes a hole through the floor of the man's apartment. The two have never met before and they come into contact through the hole.The script is quite brilliant. Few films are simultaneously this funny while remaining completely human deeply exploring the human condition especially feelings of loneliness and despair. Tsai's direction is simply beautiful. Like a lot of other Taiwanese directors he uses a lot of long takes. But unlike say Hou HsiaoHsien Tsai doesn't overuse them. In fact I don't know if I've ever seen them used better. They're always effective and never tedious. It would be wrong to review this film without mentioning the musical numbers. Yes The Hole is also a musical and a great one at that. In the film's best scenes  which is saying something considering how good all the other scenes are  the man imagines that the woman is a singer almost a cabaret singer. These numbers are fully choreographed often with backup dancers and singers. In a stroke of genius Tsai has these elaborately produced numbers take place in the crumbling building the signs of apocalypse and decay unhidden. This provides both a sense of pathos and absurdity.The Hole is a film that begs to be seen. It ought to be a cult classic if nothing else. Before I went to see this I was told that it was a decent film but probably Tsai Mingliang's least good one. Well if that is true I just cannot wait to see another one! 1010.".

A plumber attempts to locate the source of the problem then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor. Already isolated and desperate both characters are among the few residents of a housing project who haven't fled in advance of a mysterious nearapocalyptic epidemic. The hole linking the two apartments functions first as yet another in a long line of indignities but soon begins to take on a significance of nearmythic proportions.Tsai's sense of humor and sense of cinematic history is displayed with a bit more overtness than usual  as the woman's occasional daydreams revolving around her upstairs neighbor are visualized as musical numbers set to the music of Grace Chang which explode from the screen in brief bits of sensualistic surreal romance and humor  quite reminiscent of the bigscreen PENNIES FROM HEAVEN. And for all of the ennui and alienation on display here Tsai's skewering of late 90s premillennial tensions is funny absurd and gives this film a very appealing strageness. The final scene is extraordinary.Meanwhile Tsai  in typical fashion  subverts most of the usual expectations or preconceptions Westerners bring to Asian cinema with a nonchalant casuallyrevealed directness focusing on both the absurdist tendencies of the human mind and the most absolute of mundanities. There's an utter nonchalant demystification of almost everything about his characters sidestepping backstory or most cultural signifiers which does amplify the isolation of the characters making THE HOLE  and his other films  rather disorienting but also always fascinating and insightful.".

The final scene is extraordinary.Meanwhile Tsai  in typical fashion  subverts most of the usual expectations or preconceptions Westerners bring to Asian cinema with a nonchalant casuallyrevealed directness focusing on both the absurdist tendencies of the human mind and the most absolute of mundanities. There's an utter nonchalant demystification of almost everything about his characters sidestepping backstory or most cultural signifiers which does amplify the isolation of the characters making THE HOLE  and his other films  rather disorienting but also always fascinating and insightful.";

In other words I am objective to the extent that I can admit when an apparent arthouse film sucks. The Hole is one of these sucky films.Tsai Mingliang directs this film about a small hole between two apartments. Unfortunately the film tediously shows the guy in the above apartment doing everyday things very slowly while the woman in the place below constantly cleans her waterlogged residence. This encapsulates their entire existence and summarizes quite thoroughly the uninspired actions of both participants.This monotony is broken up by inexplicable random musical numbers that are neither catchy nor entertaining. Any romantic sentiments expressed through these songs are entirely superficial and seemingly come from nowhere.Which brings us to the very heart of the film  the hole itself. This is an interesting concept to use in a movie with a plethora of options available to the filmmakers. Unfortunately very little interaction occurs between the characters via the hole and what little does is only juvenile e.g. vomit bug spray etc.. The situational state of affairs is what enticed me to see this film in the first place so the fact that Tsai Mingliang failed miserably in his execution here is quite disappointing. I keep hearing all sorts of great things about Tsai but after the totally forgettable Rebels of the Neon God and this debacle he has a long way to go before impressing me.Not recommended. Arthouse directors need to learn that making a film artsy  in and of itself  does not make a good or entertaining film and should consider adding a few interesting eventsconcepts along the way.".

The words take on an irony when we see that in this apocalyptic world rain never stops falling and the apartments' residents struggle to keep leaks from destroying their remaining possessions.There's not much to be said about plot here  a plumber visits a man because the woman below is complaining about leaks and leaves a hole in the floor behind. The man above and the woman below take turns blocking up the hole and tearing away the other person's efforts to do the same  both of them seem loath to give up this one human connection.It IS their only human connection. The woman below lives in utter seclusion mopping up the floor and stopping up leaks in a pale imitation of a life. For all intents and purposes she's a cockroach already hiding in a dark dank hole. The man above goes to his store every day although his only customers are a starving cat and a confused old man whose favourite brands no longer exist. They go about their lives as though nothing were amiss living quite apart. The rest of the apartment seems inhabited but nobody stirs. Doubtless they're all also sitting in their little holes and trying to live their little lives. Here Tsai is brutally satirizing the increasing lack of communication between human beings even in the face of the end of the world people remain isolated in their own little bubbles. This message was clearly prophetic because the 2000s have come and people are living more apart than ever before The Hole aims to unveil the absurdity of daytoday life.It's also worth noting that there are four musical numbers that begin at unexpected moments. A woman dances and sings in gaudy clothes and with loud instrumentals playing in the background. In one such scene she and the man she pursues dance around and around as the traces of a fumigation rise up from the stairs and envelop them. These moments alone in the film do not resemble human behaviour ironically they're the only ones that make sense. The roaches' compulsion to hide too makes sense. It's human nature that's the absurdity.".

I've been living in Korea for 6 months and this film could just as easily summarize the strange ennui and frustration of any Asian metropolis as it takes on Taiwin here. It uses the myth of Hong Kong musicals the same way Godard or Hartley use Western musicals but takes it to an extreme it's gritty world and occasionally Kafkaesquire logic make it all the better. I really feel like The Hole's closest comparison is Hal Hartley's Surviving Desire but have a kinda bleak edge to what are ultimately hopefully and strangely metaphorical films. Anyway this is what I wrote to Esther. Hope you like The Hole too.Heywatching a move called the hole. Taiwanese I think seems a bit to weird for china unless it's hong Kong. it's worth seeing so far. it's about a guy and a girl in an apartment complex. the guy's ceiling caves in and the girl starts to get annoyed and well it's kinda a weird metaphor for the simultaneous pleasure degregation and pain of a rather intense crush. there's also a kinda zombievirussubplot too and a lot of weird little scenes where the girl acts out her desires through rather innocent and kinda fun 50's doowop sequences. worth a look.".

The musical interludes inspired by Grace Chang are perplexing but welcome milemarkers that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man upstairs and the woman downstairs.  It's not necessarily an easy film to watch although it's not heavyhanded by any means so I'd warn any casual viewers who are looking for some indie entertainment like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie.

Okay so compared to the animation and acting of today it can't compare but it was made in '78 what do you expect?  Animation and film have come a long way since then it's not going to be like the films of today. All I have to say is that it's a good family movie that I will always enjoy.

	schema:reviewBody "Water Babies is a Victorian tale about a very young chimney sweep named Thomas Tommy Pender who becomes a fugitive from justice after being falsely accused of stealing the silver. Fearing the gallows the punishment in those days for thievery he jumps into a river drowns becomes a water baby and embarks on a series of adventures. For many people this film was very childish farcical and generally not good. Admittedly it is not a great film by any means. Director Lionel Jeffries did far better with The Runaway Children but this film has its charms.To begin with Lionel Jeffries depicts life in Victorian England far more effectively than Franco Zefferelli ever did in Jane Eyre. It is one thing to dress actors in Victorian costumes create sumptuous looking sets and have everyone speak in aristocratic accents but quite another to bring the spirit of the Victorian age to the screen. Lionel Jeffries has a gift for doing that whether it is with the scene in the pub where Tom is subjected to physical abuse and then given hard liquor by Mr. Grimes James Mason and Mr. Masterman Bernard Cribbins or in Hartover Hall where we see the supreme pomposity and confidence exhibited by Sir John Hartover played very well by David Tomlinson. The surreal touches are also very interesting.Now the bulk of the film is animation. Many reviewers have criticized the animated part for its poor graphics. No doubt they are right. But this is my point  who cares? Maybe I am old fashioned but I did not care when they improved the graphics for the Nintendo games or when they combined computer animation with the older animation for the movie Alladin. That apparently matters to some people  usually the kind of people who complain about the texture of food. But for me as long as I can see the pictures on the screen I am content. The bigger problem was with the songs which children will find enchanting but which I and probably many adults found childish and a waste of time.But with that said this film has enough charming good natured and funny characters to delight even adults. Characters like the lobster the sea horse the sword fish the Krakon whose bark is worse than his bite the walrus the polar bear and even some of the water babies when they are not singing. Elly Samantha Gates the niece of Sir John is also a delightful sweetheart.".

Yes it masquerades as a kids' film but even now I find it really dark in places particularly the haunting music that is played each time the guardian angel woman is on the screen and her rather hypnotic eyes and voice. The actual baddies of the film ie the sharks Mr Grimes etc didn't scare me at all I just always found the whole film rather creepy and dark. This is obviously something I can appreciate now that I'm 21 years old but speaking from experience there is no way I would show it to my kids!".

Thankfully I have learned to prescreen things because this movie was absolutely terrible.Human misery death and suffering are not my idea of a children's story. This movie basically starts with a homeless woman begging for money for her newborn baby so they won't starve. We are then shown people stealing beating each other cheating and human excrement being poured over foodall before we meet the men who are abusing our hero Tom.All of this meanwhile is liveaction. You have to sit through about twenty minutes of this awful display of inhumanity before you finally get to the cartoons you thought you were getting when you started and then there's another 20 minutes of live action at the end making for half the movie. I don't know about your kids but when my kids want a cartoon they want a cartoon. Not a bunch of folks wandering around London getting typhoid.The liveaction plot then drags on and on with more of the cruelty. Finally Tom jumps in a lake and isfor no reason ever explained in the movietransformed into an animated water baby. I suppose that's a bit nicer than saying Hey kids he committed suicide and drowned. He makes some friends sings some songs encounters some random enemies and finally finds the other water babies. This is the good part of the movie. But then the other water babies are randomly kidnapped and Tom must go on a quest to save them.Tom then returns to the human world where he is again abused and you wonder why he doesn't just kick someone in the groin already and run off. Finally he does stand up for himself the bad guys are arrested and he achieves a Dickensian happy ending which honestly I never did quite manage to understand did rich people just adopt random street urchins? and we learn that several creepy ladies who've been appearing randomly throughout the film are actually the same person which doesn't actually add anything to the plot or make any sense.As a parent I have seen plenty of bad children's shows. Heck I've endured Barney the Purple Dinosaur. But this movie takes the cake. Yes Victorian England was a terrible place in which children were abused and death might seem like a reasonable escape. This does not make it 'entertaining' for me or my children.".

Did he need the money? I would like to think that beyond directing the film he didn't play much of a part in the production.

James Mason Billie Whitelaw Bernard Cribbins and the voices that you never get to see are pretty much a Who's Who of British acting talent of the time. Quite extraordinary.Anyway to the film. I really didn't like the child actor in the lead role. He's an ugly little brat with too much hair and a nasty voice. And he's in every scene for the whole 105 minutes and believe me it seems a lot longer. And much as I admire James Mason and Bernard Cribbins neither of them are going to be pointing at this as a piece of work that they are proud of. The animation is poor and the less said about the quality of the musical score the better for everybody.All in all it's pretty damn poor and a blot on the CV of the great Lionel Jeffries.".

It really is two films in one which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole. The animation by Tony Cuthbert Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is wonderful as is the photography by Ted Scaife and the music by Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has a great roughdiamond quality as the literal fish out of water  I love the moment when he's on top of the mansion sees all the chimneys and shouts Blimey !! at the top of his voice. Mason and Cribbins are the filthiest nastiest bullies you could hope to see in a costume drama if you want to see real Victorian values don't watch Sense And Sensibility watch this and Whitelaw Pertwee who does umpteen voices and Percival are all excellent. This is how a good children's movie should be  good old singalong fun but also just a little bit thoughtful sad and frightening. High Cockallorum !!".

The first half of the film is live action and brings to life the Victorian era in an able and enjoyable way with a wealth of actorly talent  including Bernard Cribbins James Mason and David Tomlinson  around to add to the fun.

	schema:headline " Good on the most part but the film itself looks dated!";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1978 adaptation had all the ingredients of a potentially wonderful film. It is based on an absolutely charming book by Charles Kingsley. It has a truly talented cast from the likes of James Mason Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson not to mention the vocal talents of David Jason and Jon Pertwee. There is also Lionel Jeffries the director of wonderful classics such as The Railway Children and the Amazing Mr Blunden and while the film is good on the most part it was also a little disappointing. I had no problem with the performances particularly those of Mason and Tomblinson as Grimes and Sir John Harriet respectively and Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are believable as Tom and Ellie. Billie Whitelaw is also intriguing in numerous roles even if one or two of them are quite bizarre. The voice cast is also commendable especially Jon Pertwee voicing charming characters in their own right. I also liked the incidental music it is so haunting and beautiful and the script was fairly faithful and in general wellwritten particularly at the beginning. The characters especially the Water Babies are very charming and the villains are sinister and funny at the same time I loved the part when Tom and his friends help the Water Babies escape seeing the shark chasing the electric eel with an axe was very funny. However I will say the film does look dated especially the animation sequences the live action parts weren't so bad if you forgive the rather dark camerawork. The character animation was rather flat and the backgrounds sometimes were a little dull though there were some nice moments like the scene with the Krakon and of course the first meeting with the Water Babies. I also had mixed feelings about the songs the Water Babies's song was beautiful but I found the first song forgettable when Tom ends up underwater. HiCockallorum is an example of a song that is like marmite you either love it or hate it. I personally don't know what to make of this song it was fun to listen to at first but once it's in your head it is perhaps annoying. As much as I like Lionel Jeffries and his films his direction just lacked the wonder and the magic it usually does. All in all certainly not a terrible film but could have been better artistically. 710 Bethany Cox.".

But he's real enough as the gang boss on one of the docks who intimidates the other workers by being handy with his fists and the bailing hook and he gets the rest to kickback part of their hard earned money. And it's all hard earned money in that job.One guy Warden can't intimidate is Sidney Poitier another gang boss and when he tries to intimidate newcomer John Cassavetes Poitier takes him under his wing. The two develop quite the friendship and Poitier and his wife Ruby Dee even fix Cassavetes up with Kathleen Maguire.Warden is truly one loathsome creature and it's sad how by sheer force of personality and physical prowess he cows almost everyone else into submission. In that sense he's tougher than Lee J. Cobb who did have to rely on an impression collection of goons to enforce his will in On The Waterfront.Edge Of The City marked the big screen directorial debut of Martin Ritt who did a great job with a good cast of New York based players and spot on location cinematography. The film's low budget does show but you're so impressed with the ensemble cast you don't really care.Cassavetes as the loner with a past and the hip and tough Poitier are both fine but my personal favorite in this film is Ruby Dee. She should have gotten some award for her performance her final scene with Cassavetes is outstanding.Catch this one if ever possible. I wish it were out on DVD or VHS.".

One wonders how shocked initial 1957 moviegoers were at such a bold presentation of whiteblack relations if some of the bigoted didn't leave the theater early they must of left dumbfounded if not offended. The last reel of the film will still surprise audiences as it refuses to sink into expected clichs including those that tainted Waterfront. While both films climax with a fight in front of stunned workers director Ritt avoids the tiddy simplicity of Kazan's ratonalizied ending. Only the most jaded viewers will not realize Edge remains such a radical and entertaining film.What's most disturbing about this lost classic how it sadly stayed unavailable on any format for reasons that remain quite cloudy until it surfaced in a Sidney Poitier compilation in late 2008. This film should be required viewing in high school or college history classes across the country yet one can only find it on obscure latenight TV if ever at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "1957's Edge of the City directed by Martin Ritt stars John Cassavetes Sidney Poitier Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. It's the story of a troubled man Axel who has a mysterious past that gradually comes out during the film. He has a connection that gets him a job on a loading dock working for Charlie Jack Warden a real meanie who takes kickbacks from his workers and rides them hard. Charlie has an intense dislike for a black man T.T. Poitier who holds the same position. T.T. invites Axel to work on his team Axel defies Charlie and does so. Axel finds a place to live and socializes with T.T. his his wife Dee and their son's white schoolteacher Kathleen McGuire. When tragedy strikes none of the men on the loading dock will talk to the police and Axel has to come to grips with his values what he stands for and the meaning of friendship.This is a really excellent black and white film that curiously isn't really about being black or white! It's really about the limits one puts on oneself and knowing who you are. Charlie is a bigot and hates that a black man has a good position on the dock. T.T. teases Charlie and gives as good as he gets. There's no discussion of T.T. and Axel spending time together or of T.T.'s son having a white teacher with whom the family also socializes. What Axel a loner finds difficult is accepting any friendship or confiding in anyone  these things he learns through T.T.Poitier absolutely shines in Edge of the City  he's warm energetic loving and smart a man with a real enthusiasm for life afraid of nothing. Cassavetes is excellent and plays a character totally opposite  hiding in the shadows chronically depressed and always nervous.The film leaves open what happens to Axel. Whatever does he's a different man now.Strangely underrated and unknown film possibly in the shadow of a lot of the angry young men films that came out in that era.".

When tragedy strikes none of the men on the loading dock will talk to the police and Axel has to come to grips with his values what he stands for and the meaning of friendship.This is a really excellent black and white film that curiously isn't really about being black or white! It's really about the limits one puts on oneself and knowing who you are. Charlie is a bigot and hates that a black man has a good position on the dock. T.T. teases Charlie and gives as good as he gets. There's no discussion of T.T. and Axel spending time together or of T.T.'s son having a white teacher with whom the family also socializes. What Axel a loner finds difficult is accepting any friendship or confiding in anyone  these things he learns through T.T.Poitier absolutely shines in Edge of the City  he's warm energetic loving and smart a man with a real enthusiasm for life afraid of nothing. Cassavetes is excellent and plays a character totally opposite  hiding in the shadows chronically depressed and always nervous.The film leaves open what happens to Axel. Whatever does he's a different man now.Strangely underrated and unknown film possibly in the shadow of a lot of the angry young men films that came out in that era.";

From it's NYC locations to its score to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in you can somehow right your wrongs.Edge also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism.  In my opinion that is where the movie does not succeed like Waterfront.  At 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable.Possible SpoilersThe relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. I don't believe that these two characters from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly. I think that the whole love subplot with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways that they could have shown this.  I would have also liked to see some scenes of Axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is.The acting is excellent. Poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multilayered and especially for 1957 a man who is confident respected and intelligent. Cassavettes as Axel North while very good does not seem quite right for the part. Warden is terrific as the boss who knows Axel's secret although his fight scene with Cassavettes at the end is staged horribly. Too many breakaway boxes.  I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful in role of Poitier's wife.On the whole Edge of the City is a smart movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture without taking the time to let the drama build.7 out of 10".

He's failed many times in the past and expects to keep failing when he comes looking for a job as a longshoreman. At first he's taken under the wings of a cruel jerk Jack Wardenwho exploits him and is a bully. But a particularly kind man at the job Sidney Poitier takes him on in his work crewand the two become fast friends. But there still is the bully to deal withas well as Cassavetes' dark secret. See this film.I really liked the relationship between Poitier and Cassavetes because it was NOT played as an interracial relationship but just as two friends. There was no obvious or overt message about racial brotherhoodbut simply by the casting it made a great point. Well done all around though I was a bit disappointed by the exciting ending as if you think about it it doesn't make a lot of sense Cassavetes could have just gone to the policeand that would have been a lot more logical. Still it's got a heck of a punch.".

In short order he becomes friends with Tommy Tyler Sidney Poitier a foreman on the dock. Tommy is happily married to Lucy Ruby Dee and they have a cute young boy. Into this mix is put Charles Malik Jack Warden a corrupt and vindictive foreman who has a contentious relationship with both Tommy and Axel.I liked the black and white photography but I found the characterizations to be too black and white. For a foreman having to deal with the frictions at the dock Tommy has an unrealistically sunny and cheerful disposition  life just couldn't be better for him. Sidney Poitier turns in a fine performance but Tommy's character was just too irreproachably good for me. I found Cassavetes to be wooden in his portrayal of the confused Axel who has a problem with authority stemming from his relationship with his father. Warden is fine as the consistently meanspirited Malik and Dee shines in her few appearances.I was bothered by many inconsistencies. In a phone conversation with his parents at the beginning of the movie Axel's father is so irritated with his son that he doesn't even want to talk with him and encourages his wife not to take the call. Then toward the end his father falls all over himself begging his son to come home telling him that he is all that he and his wife have. Tommy's wife tells Axel that she is so happy that he and Tommy are friends since Tommy didn't have any friends. But if Tommy as portrayed was such an outgoing friendly guy it is hard to imagine that he did not have any friends. The whole racism issue central to the plot comes out of nowhere toward the end. In his relationship with his love interest Ellen Axel behaves like an awkward teenager  could he really be that naive? The scenes between him and Ellen are embarrassing. For the life of me I could not figure out what it was about Axel that Tommy and Ellen felt so immediately drawn to? The fight scene between Tommy and Malik was intense and riveting but then the final fight scene I found to be staged and difficult to believe.The music is overly dramatic.One cannot see this movie without comparing it with On the Waterfront and judging it to be a derivative work. Credit must be given to Edge of the City for taking on the issue of racism in an era when that was being swept under the rug and it does not shy from an ending that probably would not have played well with focus groups had such existed then. But Waterfront deals with corruption in more detail and is all round a vastly superior movie in my opinion.".

So when I found it was available on DVD from Netflix I made an order. I just watched it with my mom who hadn't seen it before and we both were enthralled by the drama about John Cassavetes a loner with a troubled past who gets a job on the docks. He meets a couple of coworkers there Jack Warden who doesn't seem to like him and Sidney Poitier who does. Warden also doesn't seem to like Poitier and it doesn't take long figure out why but it's a while before things come to a head. Anyway this was quite a compelling drama as directed by Martin Ritt with fine supporting turns by Kathleen Maguire Estelle Hemsley and Ruby Dee as Poitier's wife especially when she confronts Cassavetes near the end. So on that note I highly recommend Edge of the City.".

His brief 1959 TV series Johnny Staccato is also a joy to watch.Sidney Poitier and later in the film Ruby Dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles. But it is Jack Warden's superb acting as the vicious brutal shift boss that grabbed my attention. To get an idea of Warden's versatility watch this film then check out a 1962 episode of the TV series Naked City entitled Specter of the Rose Street Gang available on video. If you are a fan of film noir this is a must see. Enjoy!".

	schema:headline " Great acting by Sidney Poitier and John Cassavetes";
	schema:reviewBody "This is clearly a dramatic film representative of the stylistic period films being made in the 1950's. This was director Martin Ritt's first attempt at delivering a feature film for Hollywood after first tinkering with a few television episodes for various TV series such as Somerset Maugham TV Theatre and Starlight Theatre. Obviously director Martin Ritt was fortunate that his feature film debut starred two 2 great lead actors such as John Cassavetes and Sidney Poitier. Subsequent to the mainstream success of this film shot in Harlem New York Martin Ritt went on to a four 4 decade career directing many other acclaimed films starring a long list of Academy Award winner actors and actresses. I enjoy a good black and white film and I truly wish other producers would consider this style format. If you recall it worked well back in 2011 for Academy Award Best Picture The Artist. Edge of the City was filmed in Harlem New York and evolves around the new found friendship between the happy go lucky African American Tommy Tyler played by Sidney Poitier whose friends simply called him TT or T. Tommy is a crew leader on the docks where he is in a constant battle with another racist dock crew leader named Charlie Malick played by Jack Warden. When the desperate newcomer Axel Nordmann played by John Cassavettes naively joins the con man Charlie Malick's crew Axel realizes rather quickly how racist and selfish his crew leader is as well as being the biggest bully on the docks.The film evolves into the push and pull friendship between Tommy and Axel as Tommy continues to push Axel into sharing Axel's obvious fears and deepest secrets with Tommy. Axel pushes Tommy away as he feels the only one he could ever trust was his deceased older brother who Axel feels responsible for his brothers unexpected death. The demons that Axel eventually shares with his new best friend Tommy are issues that many other men and women can relate to as they revolve around Axel's estranged relationship with his parents and how his current circumstances and potential future prosecution relate to Axel attempting to make his father proud.The films ending is not as heroic nor as vindicating and uplifting as lets say the 1976 Academy Award winning Rocky films ending was but Edge of the City is filled with superior acting by the film stars John Cassavetes and Sidney Poitier as well as supporting performances by Jack Warden Kathleen Maguire and a young Ruby Dee.I enjoyed this dramatic 1957 film and I felt both the acting and directing were superb and why this film is so relevant for the time and yet still timeless messages for today's youth.I give the film a 710 rating".

Cassavetes was skeptical of Lee Strasberg's Method by 1957 and he plays it fast and loose as Axel an Army deserter who cannot find his place in the world. Edge spends a considerable amount of time showing these two characters at work in a warehouse and the incidents of harassment and horseplay ring equally true to anyone who has done time in the world of unskilled bluecollar labor. This is the first feature film directed by Martin Ritt and the themes of male bonding Hud and workplace injustice Norma Rae are ones he would revisit during his illustrious career.

	schema:reviewBody "In the book 'Cassavetes on Cassavetes' or as close to an autobiography we have of him which is an interview with film professor Ray Carney Cassavetes mentions that before Faces the only two films he had anything to do with that he was proud of were Shadows which naturally was his first feature and one of the few cinematic examples of something like jazz true improv and this film Edge of the City.Maybe it was due to the subject matter being about something simple two guys from different backgrounds working as longshoreman who become friends just based on getting along and mutual trust and respect with the more 'topical' stuff racism class being secondary. Or it was because it's a film much like On the Waterfront that gives its characters room to have realism unlike melodramas of the past? Or it's just cause he's that damn good in the film and knew it while making it.A scene early on with Axel North real name Axel Nordman who seems adrift in the night in New York City and calls up his parents who are in Indiana though we don't know what at the time seems to indicate what Cassavetes might have found in the project so worthwhile. Here he gets to behave moreso than traditionally act which is like being himself.In this scene with the phone call he covers the phone receiver and speaks but no one on the other end can hear him and it's a very sad and tense exchange of words as the son can hear but the parents cannot. It's a scene like this that shows Cassavetes in a sensitive moment vulnerable which helps a great deal once he's set against the man he works for the brutish and unsubtle racist Charles Jack Warden. Luckily at the job he meets an upstanding guy Tommy played by Sidney Poitier and the two become close friends almost by chance Tommy trying to get closer and closer to the sorta sky Axel.Seeing these two actors together and how well they're able to work with the natural dialog by Robert Alan Arthur that allows them to speak more like regular people from the period than like movie characters is what really makes this movie. Some of the story gets a little farfetched in the third act how simply a key character is laid to waste in a fight but director Martin Ritt never loses sight of how Poitier and Cassavetes behave around each other.One is more reserved and for good reason being a war deserter and with a bad secret from his past with his younger brother the only person I ever loved and one more outgoing in his friendliness Tommy being a guy who likes to hang out talk romance with the ladies. And for the time period it set an example that other films needed to try and steer towards not being overtly antiracism though the film has some of that but just showing clearly how people can get along as people. Poitier would a year later try a little more for this in The Defiant Ones.Watching Cassavetes is also a key to the film's success when he tells Poitier the story about his brother suddenly the film slows down from the pace it has when Tommy is in charge of the conversation as a warmhearted if sometimes pushy kind of guy. It's a story that allows Cassavetes room as an actor the kind which would probably influence him with his own actors. Also another scene that displays how generous he could be and how spoton or just effortless his timing was is when he talks with the girl Tommy tries to set Axel up with played by Kathleen Maguire. He seems so out of the loop of it but as a genuine and nice guy he's able to connect with her. As an actor he also lets us know how messed up Axel really is sometimes without having to say anything  just a look would do though Tommy sometimes asks for more. And in the last act it gets to a point that has some of the finest work Cassavetes ever did.Ritt understands how this world works how people can either get along together or not as the case with Jack Warden. He seems to be such a SOB kind of like Lee J. Cobb in Waterfront only less of a higherup kind of guy. Even he as a cartoonish villain comes off genuine in how he reacts to things. It says a lot when a director can get a one 12 dimensional character to seem convincing. Edge of the City has that as a kind of characterdriven noir film.".

He telephones his parents at the start of the film but as his mother Ruth White begs her son to speak to her or tell her where he is he puts his hand over the receiver and gives her silence. It's a very heartbreaking scene because he does talk to her but she isn't able to hear him through the muted mouthpiece. He gets a job on the docks but his boss Jack Warden is mean and unfair. All the fellow workers have learned to look the other way even when he racebaits Sidney Poitier the only man who befriends John.Sidney Poitier is extremely nice tolerant and forgiving of his new friend and he and his wife Ruby Dee go out of their way to help John fit in. They even set him up with their classy friend Kathleen Maguire who is clearly out of his league. As I watched the first half of the film I felt a little frustrated. John Cassavetes wasn't nearly as likable as Sidney Poitier yet he was the protagonist. Why wasn't the entire movie about Sidney? I didn't care what happened to John at all! Then I realized that Robert Alan Arthur had written his script that way on purpose and I watched the second half of the film in full enjoyment.Arthur wrote and directed a very powerful film one that evokes a range of emotion from its viewers. Once you realize and accept that John isn't likable and Sidney is you'll get swept away in the plot and growth of the characters. Even though you don't really care about John since Sidney cares so much about him he convinces you to slowly start rooting for him. The shift is slight and steady but it's a very rare and fantastic quality. Usually when watching a film you're aware of the beginning middle and end but in Edge of the City the beginning drags the middle is immersive and the end comes too soon. Depending on how drained you feel you might want to watch it again but there are some heavy and emotional elements to the story.Kiddy Warning Obviously you have control over your own children. However due to some violence I wouldn't let my kids watch it.".

By his midtwenties Knute saves enough to attend obscure Notre Dame University where he excels in football and chemistry. He and a teammate develop the forward pass as an offensive weapon while working as life guards on summer break and use it to upset heavily favored Army in a historic game. After graduation Rockne becomes a teacher while coaching parttime but ultimately abandons academics to devote all his energies to football. During his tenure as head coach at the school he develops such outstanding players as George Gipp who dies prematurely from a strep infection and the Four Horseman while introducing many innovative tactics including the backfield shift.

	schema:reviewBody "When Warner Brothers decided to produce the biography of Notre Dame's legendary football coach Knute pronounced KaNewt Rockne there were major hurdles that had to be faced. Rockne had only passed away nine years earlier at 43 and his image and distinctive speaking style were wellknown to football fans nationwide through newsreels and radio as was his Cinderellalike story born in Voss Norway he and his family had emigrated to Chicago Illinois when he was five he worked to pay tuition to attend Notre Dame then went on to revolutionize football as both a player and coach. Any film about Rockne had to secure the permission of his widow Bonnie Skiles Rockne and the cooperation of Notre Dame and both wanted final approval of both the script and the actor to play 'Rock'.While the script focusing on Rockne's devotion to 'his boys' making football more exciting and his unshakable faith in the importance of athletics and education to America's youth would win Mrs. Rockne and Notre Dame's support casting the coach would prove a challenge. When stocky darkly handsome 41year old Irish American actor Pat O'Brien best known as James Cagney's frequent costar was announced to play the craggy Norwegian American Rockne there was some concern raised whether he was 'right' for the role. But in full makeup O'Brien was quite convincing and he could mimic the coach's staccato speaking style perfectly. Knute Rockne would become O'Brien's 'definitive' role as well as his personal favorite in a career that spanned over sixty years.From his introduction to football as a boy played by Johnny 'Tarzan's Boy' Sheffield as he admonishes his father veteran character actor John Qualen to speak American Papa...We're in America now through his years working at a Post Office earning tuition money to his courtship of Bonnie Skiles Gale Page and onfield partnership with 'Gus' Dorais Owen Davis Jr. who would toss Rockne the forward pass against Army that would revolutionize the game the story is both entertaining and informative Rock it is revealed could have made a first class chemist.Then Ronald Reagan appears as flippant yet private George Gipp and the film achieves it's legendary status. Coach Rockne and player Gipp as portrayed by O'Brien and Reagan have a 'fatherson'like bond that is irresistible and in less than ten minutes of screen time Reagan establishes himself as no longer a 'B' actor but a star to be reckoned with. The Win One for the Gipper speech has become one of the bestloved in movie and sports history and while it has been parodied frequently through the years particularly while Reagan was President of the United States it is still quite moving.While Gipp's untimely death casts a momentary pall on the film his place is soon taken by the legendary Four Horsemen as Rockne introduces 'the backfield shift' to football. The coach becomes the spokesperson of College Football defending both himself and such legends as Alonzo Stagg 'Pop' Warner Howard Jones and Bill Spaulding playing themselves against charges of gambling and football's place in an academic environment.Through it all Bonnie Rockne offers loving support to her often preoccupied but devoted husband and their large family. The bond they share is so intimate that she 'feels' the airplane crash that takes his life in the film's tragic finale.Punctuated by Notre Dame's classic fight song KNUTE ROCKNE ALL AMERICAN is certainly not a 'perfect' film watch how frequently jersey numbers appear disappear and change as vintage newsreel footage is used during big games but the overall result is both rousing and sentimental. It's easy to see why Rudy Ruettiger would be inspired by it and would want to add his own chapter to Notre Dame's illustrious history.The film certainly deserves it's 'classic' status!".

	schema:reviewBody "You don't have to be a Notre Dame football fan to enjoy this because I am not....but as a football fan in general this was fun to watch. It almost makes me a Fighting Irish devotee. If you can't get caught up in the emotion in this film gridiron fan or not you better check your pulse because this is an emotional film with some very touching scenes.As a sports fan I loved watching the classic footage of early college games. They had some pretty wild plays back then with a lot of laterals. They interspersed that footage with Pat O'Brien shown as head coach Knute Rockne on the sidelines and some of the players such as George Gipp Ronald Reagan. Reagan gets pretty good billing in this film but his part really isn't that large. O'Brien is the only actor with a large role in here. The rest  all playing nice characters  include Gale Page as Rockne's wife Bonnie Donald Crisp as the Notre Dame's Father John Callahan Albert Bassermann as chemistry professor Father Nieuwland and Reagan as Gipp perhaps Notre Dame's most talented and famous player ever.What this film does nicely is balance the personal story with the football. Neither angle is overdone. The characters in here all people you can root for as there are no villains. On my last look it was interesting to discover Johnny Sheffield  Tarzan's son  playing Rockne at the age of seven and to see George Reeves TV's Superman as one of the players. There have been very few football movies made in Hollywood for some reason and precious few good ones. This is one of them.".

Albert Basserman is adequate but his Jewish accent in the portrayal of a priest is awkward at best.

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to imagine in this day and age how popular and how much of an impact a Norwegian immigrant and would be chemist had on the American public and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was viewed. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary individual who both revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small obscure Catholic college on the map.I've heard clips of Rockne's famous pep talks and it is uncanny how Pat O'Brien got the voice and the inflection perfectly. In what turned out to be his career role Pat O'Brien captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was Rockne. Rockne is assisted by well by Gale Page as Bonnie Stiles Rockne who complained about her home being a training camp for Notre Dame but never threw anyone out of her house.Rockne's first impact on football was as a player with Notre Dame not a coach. One fine day in the second half of a losing football game against heavily favored Army Rockne and team mate Gus Dorais played by Owen Davis used the forward pass as an offensive weapon. Before that football was simply a game where you just got bigger guys for your side and ran through the defense. Rockne didn't invent the forward pass but he popularized and football became a game of strategy as well as brawn after that. Rockne knew how to work the media also. Those well publicized pep talks of his were not just to inspire his players. They were well publicized and it was in a lot due to him that college football became a major sport in that Golden Age of Sports in the Roaring Twenties. Playing a small but key role is Ronald Reagan. As George Gipp the first player Rockne coached to achieve greatness Reagan not only got a good performance but forever after a name that was handy in his subsequent political career. That deathbed scene which Rockne swore was accurate became a Republican battle cry as many a GOP underdog went out to win one for the Gipper.I still remember a widely distributed photograph in 1981 that was one of the first of recovering President Ronald Reagan at Notre Dame's graduation with his old friend Pat O'Brien. Reagan always credited O'Brien and Dick Powell of all the Warner Brothers stars of the period as the ones who were the kindest and most encouraging to a young player on the lot trying to make good.Notre Dame itself owes its prestige to Rockne. It's quite possible that Notre Dame would be an obscure small Catholic College without the reputation that football brought to it.Though George Gipp and the later famous backfield of the Four Horsemen certainly had their place in the sun it was Rockne who had the reputation. It's no accident that Warner Brothers was able to get Amos Alonzo Stagg Glenn 'Pop' Warner Howard Jones and William Spaulding Rockne's contemporaries and coaches with great reputations in their own right to appear in Knute Rockne All American. It was there way of honoring the guy who was number one in their profession.I think more than football fans will enjoy Knute Rockne All American. Though you might become one after seeing the film.".

Yeah love 'em or hate 'em but you sure don't ignore em.The roots of this unique position of this Indepent College Football Powerhouse are found in the life and career of one grownup little Immigrant Norweigen boy from Chicago named Knute Rockne.As a biopic the production of KNUTE ROCKNE ALLAmerican1940 came out relatively close to the death of Coach Rockne in a 1930 plane crash. It was about 10 years after that the film was released. That would mean that preliminary work on the project started about 8 years after our Nation's great loss of Mr. Rockne.His likeness and voice were well known from Newspapers Radio and Motion Picture News Reels. Both Knute's WidowBonnie Skiles Rockne and the University of Notre Dame had approval rights in choosing the Actor to play the Lead and okaying the script. We think that they could not have done the job any better. Pat O'Brien truly looks the part and was himself a footballer in college. Ronald Reagan is cast in the pivotal role of George Gipp a free spirited student going to Notre Dame on a Baseball scholarship! He was a walkon football player.The cast runs full of talented players. We have Griffith VeteranDonald Crisp as Fr. Callaghan C.S.C. Notre Dame President. Albert Basserman is Fr. Newland the Chemistry Prof and Rockne mentor.

Owen DavisJr. is Rockne cohort Gus Doraisthe passer in that historic ND vs. ARMY Game at West Point.The cast is rounded out by Kane Richmond Nick Lukats William Marshall and William Byrne as the Four Horsemen. Real life Big Time College Coaches Howard Jones 'Pop' Warner Bill Spaulding and Amos Alonzo Stagg appear as themselves in scenes of Congressional Probe into College Sports and add an authentic touch. As for biopicKNUTE ROCKNE ALLAmerican!all one can only say that it hits the ground running and did not slow down from beginning to end. There is no wasted time either. All the screen time is used to move the story along. Use of Notre Dame Choir the Campus itself and all that Brass Band rahrah march music all ad to the feeling of really being there. To this dayeven though their Basketball Team and other sports teams compete in the Big East Conference Notre Dame remains an Independent in NCAA Football. What this means that in effect The Fighting Irish play a national schedule. There was no such agreement with the Family of George Gipp. There was a lawsuit some years ago over the scene portraying young Mr. Gipp giving the famous Win Onr For The Gipper Speech. Television prints of this KNUTE ROCKNE ALLAMEICAN were minus the speech in the death bed scene. Other Notre Dame themed Films were made over the years. THE SPIRIT OF NOTRE DAME Universal 1931featured J. Farrell McDonald as a Rockne lookalike coach. It also featured Lew Ayers Andy Devine Nat Pendleton as well as the members of the real Notre Dame Championship Teams featuring the real Four Horsemen.

There was also talk of an unauthorized film critical of Notre Dame called GOLDEN GLORY but nothing has materialized has it?Let me know Dear Reader THANX!! Warner Brothers always had great music in their both in opening themes and in incidental music. In this Rockne Movie they have incorporated THE NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG in the score.

	schema:reviewBody "What an inspiring movie this biography is! Some reviewers make think that it is out of date or corny or contrived but it is better than those implications. For this entertaining film is all about the heritage of mind and body  to build the character of man. This movie sincerely focuses on one who is on a mission of honest success. Knute Rockne warmly played by the flawless Pat O'Brien may have just been a football coach but what an iconic motivator he was! And although not perfect what a great man he was! He was Vince Lombardi before Lombardi. An 1890's immigrant to the USA Rockne 18881931 had to work in a Chicago post office to earn enough money to enter Notre Dame University at an age when most young folks graduate age 22 in 1910. He played football and helped innovate the forward pass 1913. After graduation 1914 Rockne became a Chemistry pharmacy laboratory assistant and parttime football coach. Before long his career became totally devoted to football coaching. With the talented George Gipp at halfback Rockne won his first national championship 1919. With the Four Horsemen in the backfield Rockne won his second national crown 1924. The coach fought hard to keep the college game clean of gamblers and scandal and thought it unthinkable that any school should fix it for an athlete to get by in class. Rockne wanted his players to go to class and learn to make something of themselves. During a congressional hearing in the 1920s Rockne stated that sports built character. Americans took out their aggression in sports unlike the Europeans who had been racked with wars and revolutions for centuries and this was before World War II!. Sports insisted Rockne are the antidote and the safer outlet.So many wonderful scenes abound besides those inspirational lockerroom speeches that still resonate. There are the exciting football plays both vintage and those created for the movie. Coach Rockne takes his football players to a Rockettetype of show from which he devises  scratches out  new football plays on a sheet of paper. The new style The Backfield Shift merely wins the Fighting Irish another national title. At age 42 Coach had phlebitis and so had to manage the field game from a cart under blankets or from a wheelchair. Famous contemporary coaches like Pop Warner and Amos Alonzo Stagg have brief onscreen appearances. Rockne's mentor the faithful and humanitarian Catholic priest Father Callahan is splendidly played by Donald Crisp.Feel the sense of impending doom when the fateful airplane takes off from Kansas City bound for California on 31 March 1931. Rockne's wife Bonnie feels a sudden cold chill as she enjoys the warm sun on a Florida beach. Tragedy strikes as the plane sadly crashes down in a Kansas pasture. Afterward what can be more moving or fitting than the Latin funeral rite for the fallen hero? For years this eastern writer has watched this entire movie just to confirm whether the longexcised George Gipp scenes wellplayed by Ronald Reagan had been restored Win one for the Gipper.. A while back the dream was realized. And the result is that the movie has added another star from 8 to 9. By the way Rockne's winning percentage was an astounding .881! His teams lost only 12 games in his entire 13year college coaching career 19181930. He lost eight of his games between 1925 and 1928. Putting it another way Rockne lost just four games between 1918 and 1924 seven years and never lost after 1928! There are no asterisks no arguments or victorious games removed for dubious reasons.In sum it does not matter if you root for Penn State Alabama Florida State Michigan Oklahoma Texas or Southern Cal. It does not matter what your religion or heritage is. Just see this movie more than once and enjoy it! And if you are a fan of Notre Dame be stirred by the School Fight Song Cheer cheer for old Notre Dame !".

Yet Reagan's time on the screen he plays George Gipp a World War I era Notre Dame University football player of fame who sadly died in his senior year at Notre Dame is relatively brief. Reagan's actor performance is underplayed and quiet to the point of being undramatic. His more hysterical performance as Drake McHugh in King's Row 1942 Warner Brothers two years later is rightly counted his best and most skilled movie actor performance by movie historians he plays a character in King's Row who has his legs amputated and is spectacular in the scene where he discovers in a hospital recovery room what has happened to him. This movie is part of the USA Federal Government Library Of Congress National Film Registry List and placed among 475 movies as of 2010 ranked as important and notable due to aesthetic cultural and or historical importance.Knute Rockne All American 1940 Warner Bros starring Pat O'Brien and Ronald Reagan is important in all three areas a sweetheart of a movie worth screening often truly a cinematic masterpiece not ranked usually among the great movies but worthy and excellent in every way.

At 66 Michigan State would have been more competitive than the smokeandmirrors team led by Te'o and his imaginary friends. FDR was already failing in 1940 when he won an illegal 3rd term. If Pat O'Brien was elected instead maybe he could have used the tricks he learned in this movie by becoming Knute to fake the Nazis out of their jockstraps and end WWII with no loss of American life.

	schema:reviewBody "Knute Rockne All American 1940 out of 4Fun winning story from Warner about the life and career of Knute Rockne Pat O'Brien the man who will forever be remembered as changing the way football was played while coaching at Notre Dame. If you're looking for a 100 accurate biography on Rockne then you might not want to start here but there's no question that the producers and studio had their hearts in the right place and they've at least delivered a very entertaining look at several highlights in the career of Rockne. I thought the film was highly entertaining from the start as we see Rockne's family coming to America and all the way up until the final day in the life of the legend. The film covers his days of attending college his work as a chemist his marriage to Bonnie Skiles Gale Page and of course his relationship to George Gipp Ronald Reagan. The film certainly makes you care about Rockne and especially his fasttalking style which someone like O'Brien can do with ease. The actor certainly turns in a very good and energetic performance as he has no problems making you believe he knows football and his speeches are flawless. Page is also good in her supporting role as is Donald Crisp and John Litel. Reagan appeared in countless films in his career but it's easy to see why his fourorso minutes here are his most remembered. The football scenes are all directed extremely well although there are still moments where stock footage is used. I think the film works best whenever we see Rockne on the field coaching up his boys and working new plays to change the way the game was played. KNUTE ROCKNE ALL American is very American in the way he shows football as a patriotic thing and this too is something that helps carry the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Knute Rockne led an extraordinary life and his story is told rather well in Knute Rockne All American. We follow Rockne's incredible journey from young Norwegian boy to iconic American football legend. Produced in 1940 the film may at times seem a touch dated and at times downright hokey. And the filmmakers do lay it on a bit thick at times as Rockne is glowingly and lovingly portrayed. You may come away thinking Rockne should have been nominated for sainthood when in fact he was after all just a football coach. But it is undeniable that he had a great impact on the game of football as well as having a tremendous impact on the lives of so many of the young men he coached. This film shows the great impact he had and gives you an insight into why he is so revered to this day.Playing Rockne Pat O'Brien gives an impressive performance. It's unquestionably O'Brien's movie to carry and he makes the film and the character his own. The reallife Rockne was renowned as a great inspirational figure and O'Brien's performance will make you understand why. The only quibble comes early in the film when O'Brien in his early forties is playing the college student Rockne in his early twenties. All the makeup in the world wasn't going to make that believable and the effect is rather jarring. But as the Rockne character ages and begins his legendary coaching career O'Brien fits the part perfectly.As for the rest of the cast one name jumps out and that is of course Ronald Reagan playing the young charismatic but ultimately doomed football star George Gipp. In the grand scheme of the film it's not really a large part with Reagan appearing for no more than 1015 minutes. But the performance has become legendary thanks to Reagan's famous Win one for the Gipper deathbed speech. It's a brilliantlyplayed scene chockfull of emotion. Reagan may not have been on the screen for very long in this film but he certainly made a tremendously positive impact in a winning performance.The rest of the film strikes a balance between football and life in general with Rockne having great lessons for his young men in both areas. For football fans and history buffs there is a rare treat as actual archival footage from Notre Dame games of the Rockne era is interspersed throughout the film. It's a rare opportunity to see just how much the game has evolved in the last sixplus decades and an opportunity to see Rockne's legendary strategic innovations put into practice. If you're a Notre Dame fan you'll probably enjoy the fact that the Notre Dame Victory March provides a seemingly constant soundtrack for the film. If you're a Notre Dame hater...well then you're probably not watching this movie anyway. Knute Rockne All American is an inspiring uplifting emotional film. Perhaps a tad overly sentimental but that's not such a bad thing. It's a very enjoyable film one well worth taking the time to see.".

He invented a new move called the shift while watching some girlie dancers in Chicago according to this story. He invented the forward pass  or revitalized it I forget. He coached some of the most famous football players of all time at Notre Dame and turned the team into The Fighting Irish. Note Knute Rockne named after a Viking Prince of Denmark of Danish and Polish descent led the fighting Irish to victory. Pat O'Brien gives it all he's got. He delivers his lines with such celerity that it struck me with awe. I tried to duplicate the tempo of his utterances but it was physically impossible even after three or four tries at the same line of dialog. His tone is that of a stern but fair Drill Instructor. When he is called before a board or a commission of some sort  it's not clear why  he has to describe his philosophy about football. He thinks it's essential to the human spirit. In effect he restates William James' idea that it's the moral equivalent of war. Since human nature itself is so combative  and I can't disagree with him there  why not let them take it out on the football field? Notre Dame is also interested though in shifting its emphasis away from a violent sport like football to something more refined like hockey. PSHAW retorts Rockne. He claims that he's opposed to it because I never trust a sport that puts a club in the hands of an Irishman. But the fact is judging from his other comments that he thinks any team sport other than football is for fairies.Ronald Reagan is George Gipp one of Rockne's early stars of the gridiron. Reagan comes displays a shy talent for playing the game and quickly disappears because of one of those nameless diseases. O'Brien himself grows older and suffers from phlebitis but nothing is going to keep this man down. He has himself wheeled out to games against doctor's orders and if he sees a Medico approaching he scurries away.The clichs are lined up and shot down sequentially like the ducks in a very slowmoving shooting gallery. There's a certain reassuring quality in knowing precisely what's going to happen from one moment to the next in a movie you've never seen before. It's like going to a ritual service  a mass in church or a funeral rite  in which everything is properly laid out and organized. Comforting you know. It's appropriate that the setting for this movie should be a famous Catholic university even if it's not a Jesuit school.It's satisfying too to know that today and forever Knute Rockne is up there coaching that Big Team upstairs.".

Simon has given up trying to convince John to allow he and Susan to take care of the children and have resorted to using private detectives to catch him in either unbecoming behavior or unemployed and therefore unable to care for the children properly. Susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to Greenwich Village herself posing as an actress to try to gain information andor persuade him to see reason. What she discovers however is that she not only likes the free and artistic lifestyle John and his friends are living and that the girls are being brought up well but that she is quickly falling in love with John. Inevitably her true identity is discovered and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong with whom.I really enjoyed this film and found that its very short running time 70 minutes was the perfect length to spin this simple but endearing story. Miriam Hopkins one of the great 1930's1940's actresses is delightful in this film. Her energy style and wholesome beauty really lend themselves to creating an endearing character even though you know that she's pulling a fast one on the people she quickly befriends. This is the earliest film I've seen Ray Milland in and he was actually young and nonpatrician looking. And apparently three years younger than his costar His energy and carefree manner in Wise Girl were a refreshing change to the demeanor he affects in his usual darker films. Honestly though I am usually not remotely a fan of child actors I really enjoyed the two young girls who played Susan's nieces. They were endearingly precocious and were really the jewels of the film. Unfortunately I can't dig up any other films that either of them were subsequently in after this one which is a shame since both exhibited a large amount of natural talent.Wise Girl was a film that was made three years after the Hollywood Code was instated and to some extent this was abundantly clear by the quick happy ending and the pie in the sky loftiness and ease with which the characters lived. The alleged Bohemian coop was in fact a gorgeous culdesac where the artists lived for free or for trade and everything is tied up very nicely throughout. Fortunately this was a light enough film and the characters were charming enough to make allowances for its fluffiness and shortcomings and I was able to just take Wise Girl for what it was a good oldfashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was endearing. Unfortunately films of the romantic comedydrama genre today are considerably less intelligent and entertaining or I wouldn't find myself continuously returning to the classics. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Miriam Hopkins shines as Susan Susie Fletcher the everresourceful vivacious leading lady to whom this title alludes and Leigh Jason directs this delightful Allan Scott  Charles Norman penned Comedy from RKORadio Pictures which features Marianna Strelby and Betty Philson each in her only screen appearance as the children quickly becoming embroidered in a bitter custody batter between their wealthy maternal grandfather Mr. Simon Fletcher Henry Stephenson and their freespirited impoverished Bohemian paternal uncle John O'Halloran Ray Milland.By morning light Susan Fletcher returns in brilliant evening gown to her wealthy father's estate in Fletcherville New York several miles north of Manhattan from whence her Russian Prince trio of escorts Prince Michael Ivan Lebedeff Prince Ivan Rafael Storm and Prince Leopold Gregory Gaye transport her to discover 1st Detective Richard Lane and 2nd Detective's Tom Kennedy meeting Simon Fletcher to announce that they've discovered his granddaughters abiding in Greenwich Village after returning from Europe with their guardian uncle John O'Halloran who works three jobs to support them.But when Simon tells Susan that he cannot legally take custody of his late daughter's children because her late husband has entrusted their care to his brother for as long as John can provide for them Susan realizes an idea without a workable plan to move into Greenwich Village under the guise of a poor but friendly stranger to see what she can do to help her nieces.It may seem uncanny that the brotherinlaw wouldn't know the sisterinlaw nor the nieces their aunt nor grandfather but Miriam Hopkins and company make this plot to work very well because who would know what to do next in a situation as difficult as this and still maintain lighthearted manners? Anyway Susan packs an overnight bag and conceals nearly 100 in cash but making believe that she's broke and malnourished upon arriving in Manhattan and into the pawn shoppe of Dermot O'Neil Alec Craig at which John O'Halloran bargains with Flute Seller D'Arcy Corrigan whom Susan champions to no avail. When Susan requests of Dermot free accommodations she finally meets nieces Katie O'Halloran Marianna Strelby and Joan O'Halloran Betty Philson who suggest that she stay in the laundry room offering a doughnut before John's disapproval of her smart attire and carefree attitude.John's friends Karl Stevens Walter Abel a drunken artist once married to an heiress whom Susan knows and Mike Malloy Guinn Big Boy Williams a fledgling boxer befriend Susie after George Jean De Briac returns and freely enters her quarters while she bathes. Not taking lightly to this lack of privacy Susan confronts John from within the laundry tubs as he plasters the ceiling above her entranceway. But when John later discovers the money in Susie's purse John suspects Susie of impersonating a poor person but Susie finds out about it after hearing Katie and Joan's gossiping in French a language which Susan understands and clears the mistrust among them.In addition to his position at Dermot O'Neil's John paints signs for a department store and seconds Mike Malloy as boxing manager. Dermot tells Susie that he cannot fire John from the pawn shoppe because John owes him too much back rent so she inadvertently gets him fired from the department store where she takes a job as an actress in the store window as Actor in Department Store Window Jack Rice makes a play for her and John sticks up in her defense causing Jake Kelly Department Store Bouncer Frank Moran to end his employ.At her Italian restaurant Mama Guido Mathilde Comont hires John to paint a wall mural and Susie to add atmosphere but when the three Russian Princes arrive Susan must quickly think of a plan to send them off before they recognize her once again costing John his commission.In the boxing ring Mike's Fight Opponent Frank Hagney begins to get the better of Mike Malloy and the Fight Referee Eddie Gribbon names the winner of the match but this neither helps John O'Halloran and his financial situation.Now losing jobs left and right Susie suggests that John enter a painting contest because of his talent for fine arts but John tosses a knife at the want ads to select a situation as a doortodoor vacuum cleaner salesman during which time he demonstrates for Fat Mother with Baby Wilbur Grace Hayle until Baby Wilbur ends up missing somewhere in the apartment.By now Mr. Simon Fletcher has John O'Halloran right where he wants him and arranges for a custody hearing to claim Katie and Joan. Susan beginning to change her tune about Katie and Joan's situation pleads with Simon to give Susan a little more time to work things through but the ball is set into motion for John Katie and Joan to discover Susie's true identity.Mrs. BellRivington Margaret Dumont testifies before Chief Judge at Custody Hearing George Irving of the improper conditions which John O'Halloran provides for the children with Simon Fletcher and company on one side and John O'Halloran and friends on the other. When Joan is asked to testify Dr. Barry Court Psychiatrist Maurice Cass claims that the children remain healthy in John's unconventional environment. So it is up to Susan Fletcher to turn the tables one way or the other once she decides how the better interests of each party involved ought to be served.But when her plan to inspire John to paint for the magazine art contest seems to backfire Susan enlists the assistance of Motorcycle Cop 1 Edgar Dearing and Motorcycle Cop 2 Eddie Dunn to do a little murder to frame someone to serve jail time.Russell Hicks has a role as David Larrimore the magazine editor who may be able to provide a helpful solution to the situation at hand with a little edging from that Wise Girl herself Susan Fletcher.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes it's hard to define what separates a successful delightful comedy from one that falls flat. In this case the contrived plot about a spoiled rich girl who schemes to take her nieces away from the Greenwich Village 'bohemian' who is raising them only to fall for him herself is not promising. And nothing in director Leigh Jason's filmography suggests that he was an overlooked major talent. And yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded on film.He also had the good sense to cast this movie properly. The one small flaw is Miriam Hopkins in a part that Ginger Rogers would have been perfect for. Hopkins is efficient but brittle lacking the warmth and sexiness Rogers would have had. She is further hampered by a pair of bizarrely long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction. But a very young and very handsome Ray Milland couldn't be better in an exuberant uninhibited comic performance of great charm.And better than that particularly for New York City residents is the Hollywood depiction of Greenwich Village in 1937. Though completely synthetic and idealized it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer. Art director Van Nest Polglase created an amiable jumble of mews apartments and ramshackle shared backyards that is the perfect backdrop for this picture's collection of artists strivers smartalecks and wannabes. Best in the supporting cast is Guinn Williams bringing sweetness and light to his role as a prizefightersculptordressmaker suggesting the selfinvention and fluidity sexual and otherwise of life in the Village. Even more refreshing are Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby playing the little girls. Plain intelligent and full of humor these girls seem like real human beings and are nothing like the professional child actors of the time.Of special interest are a couple of memorable comic setpieces Ray Milland's vacuum cleaner demonstration to a woman with a howling baby is played with more spontaneity than one expects the baby and his contortions are marvelous 'found' moments and a phony domestic 'play' in a department store window that degenerates into a freeforall is also fun. The movie slides slowly downhill with a straightfaced custody trial and then never quite gets back on track when the action moves to Long Island but this movie is still worth a look.".

And we meet a whole lot of colorful characters there and not just through a telescope. Milland's closest friends are prizefighter Guinn Williams and aspiring actor Walter Abel who has a bit of a thirst problem. Marianna Strelby and Kim Philson play the two young girls and Margaret Dumont has a great small part as the snooty woman running the Child Welfare League.Wise Girl may not show Miriam Hopkins at her wisest but it's a great comedy in the screwball tradition of the Thirties. Best scene is the chaos she causes at one of Guinn Williams' prizefights. Milland has his moments as well especially trying to unsuccessfully sell vacuum cleaners door to door.

	schema:reviewBody "The screwball comedy had been around for quite a while in one form or another when My Man Godfrey and Libeled Lady exploded on the screen in 1936 to push the genre forward. Comic scandals concerning the rich and infamous dominated the plots of these movies where zany society got slapped down a bit. Carole Lombard and Jean Harlow quickly became the prototype heroine for the offkilter usually blonde bombshells who got taken down a peg or two as they dealt with a nononsense handsome hero who was funny in spite of their alleged serious natures. In this case the blonde heroine is that early 1930's drama queen Miriam Hopkins playing a snooty socialite aghast that her late sisters' children are being raised by a seemingly donothing Greenwich Village artist Ray Milland. To discredit him she moves into the same building and finds out all sorts of ammunition in order to help her father Henry Stephenson win custody of them.Hopkins proves herself to be an able comic especially when she finds her small apartment being invaded as she tries to take a bath. More and more people begin to barge into the one room apartment and before you can say A Night at the Opera she finds herself surrounded. This is a Greenwich Village which sadly no longer exists except perhaps in revivals of Wonderful Town and Auntie Mame and where else but mid 30's downtown would you find young children who knew how to take care of a drunk without any supervision? Everything is fine up to this point and it appears that Hopkins is lightening up her feelings towards Milland even pretending to be trashy when old society friends recognize her in an Italian restaurant while slumming. But when the kids all of a sudden are taken away thanks to Hopkins' phone conversation with her father she all of a sudden switches gears claiming in court that Milland is totally unfit. This is done jarringly and without any clues as to why and for the remainder of the film she seems determined to be out to teach him a lesson yet make up to him for her betrayal.Still entertaining in spite of this sudden jerky change Wise Girl isn't up there with the classics of the screwball genre and Hopkins seems determined without total success to emulate the classy screwball sophistication of Lombard Jean Arthur and especially Constance Bennett whom she often reminded me of. She does seem to work well here with the cast and it is a far cry of her attempts to outshine Bette Davis in their two later films together making her performance a lot more relaxed and less forced. Milland is a great sparring partner and Walter Abel and Henry Stephenson also offer good support. The kids get some good Groucho lickings in at Margaret Dumont in the court scene where she asks them some truly stupid questions in order to test their intelligence. The wise girls may not be the screwball heroine but the two nieces who were lucky enough to be taken away from the stuffy Stephenson.".

Two brothers reallife ones one of them being Marc Recha himself reenact a fictional version of a reallife journey they had made through the spectacular Catalan countryside and history is evoked pans of bulletholed walls artillery booms on the soundtrack but not shown. There is very little dialog and most of it is incidental the story is told in a thirdperson voiceover the voice being that of an actress impersonating the reallife sister of the reallife brothers. The images have little to do with what story line there is which isn't much. Many are stunning brooding pans across stark semiarid mountains and rivers think Terrence Malick or Gus Van Sant  there's not a little of both Gerry and Last Days here interspersed with some stunning still images and motionless frames. These are best enjoyed within the film's superb natural sound environment and without the ultimately tedious narration or even the occasional background music some quite good some rather odd but all gratuitous. The best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences with their occasional commentless inclusion of power stations and dams.The relationship between the brothers is left sketchy and generic a major character is a manbiting catfish never shown. The more the Catalanonationalist anarchowhateverist commitments of the director are suggested the more the film's richer unspoken message is subverted and the more irritatingly narcissistic the experience becomes. Though the director said at the NYFF screening that the film was conceived from the beginning with its thirdperson narrative I'd like to see a version of it without the narrative or the music and with only the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialog  the result might be more moving and would in any case not be that much less baffling.Meantime this is most likely the only film you will see this year in which a guy strides into the frame with a cloth object the bathing suit he had been wearing? dangling from his penis. This is one of the few moments in the whole movie in which your interest is sorry pricked by something that's actually happening on screen what is that? why's it hanging there? but as usual no answers are provided. Very Warholian very sixties and a not a little tiresome.".

The beautiful sometimes largescale richly atmospheric 35 mm. landscape images nice soundtrack and Catalanlanguage narration are enchanting as a mood piece if one is content with a trajectory that hasn't much momentum and doesn't lead anywhere in particular. Filmmaker Marc Recha and his nonidentical twin David are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister. Marc had been researching the life of Ramon Barnils 19402001 a socialist editor who had been a family friend. He felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break. The break turned into making this film which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with Barnils' associates thoughts about the Spanish Civil War the drought season they were experiencing the rugged landscape the Recha brothers' affection for each other swims and suntanned nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they camped out of their van. This leads to pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. In the end David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc has to return to his project and there it ends. I found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the Catalan language with its blend of Spanish and Frenchsounding words perhaps linked with Provenal?. This isn't a major film but it commands attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and blending autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thoughtprovoking way.An official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.".

Unless mentioning Barnils' name a few times constitutes an homage this pretense is an utter fraud. You will learn virtually nothing about Barnils in this film nor about the Spanish Civil War 19361939 nor about the special role of Catalunya in that war. You also will not learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic Catalan people for years afterward by the victorious and vindictive Franco.The footage of the Catalan countryside is very beautiful of course but Dies d'agost does not have an extensive and varied enough collection of such scenes to qualify as a travelogue. The large number of stills shown  not very illuminating images of the forest floor for example  is the clearest indication of the paucity of ideas here. The aimless drift of brothers Marc and David during their camping trip does not produce compelling cinema. On the contrary one's strongest impression is of a film made by and for spacedout middleaged hippies. Don't waste your time. Read a good book about the Spanish Civil War instead. I recommend Felix Morrow's scathing Revolution and CounterRevolution in Spain which includes a gripping account of the 1937 Stalinistled purge of the revolutionary left in Barcelona.Barry Freed".

The play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received polite well enunciated English. I am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in Leicester unknowingly asked me age 14 to read a piece of Walter Scott which was written in the tone of the Border. I come from the Border and when I read it as it should be read it made all the difference.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have said elsewhere that only people who really know what they are doing should attempt to do Shakespeare. This also goes for the reviewers only those who really know Shakespeare should attempt to review a Shakespeare production. Otherwise ignorance will make you say things that reflect as poorly on you as a poor Shakespeare production reflects on its creators.Why are many people saying bad things about the Jason Connery Macbeth? Well one reason is that the technical side of things is not in order. The available versions do not have a crisp picture or sound quality and the movie is kept in a torchlight mood which under these conditions tend to smudge the colors and the light somewhat. Which is a shame because if the technical things were in order this would be a very good movie. The direction is good the acting is impressive and the overall style is effectively atmospheric. It is not as good as it might have been but it is almost as good as the Polanski version and has its own characteristic style. It is colorful rather than dark but an effect similar to darkness is achieved by the production being dominated by reds oranges and earthtone colors enhancing the torchlight mood. The milieu and costumes are realistic and convincing and the Scottish accents are great. Macbeth with the proper accents is the only appropriate way to experience this play!As I am a bit of an idealist who tends to see a film in its imagined ideal version I choose to look beyond the technical deficiencies of this movie and judge it as if I had access to a crisp and perfect version. It is a worthy Macbeth in any case all the more admirable for being a wellproduced movie rather than a filmed stage play. It's really too bad about the technical defects hopefully a more polished version will be available one day. But an enjoyable Macbeth in any case and one that merits a good rating.8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "MacBeth I've always thought is the most accessible of Shakespeare's 'Great Period' plays. Compact focused with heaps of violence it should have been the play most open to screen adaptations. I'm not aware of a really good rendering of the story however  the best effort being Orson Welles's vigorous shoestring version. To the list of MacBotches we must add the ConneryBaxendale effort.It seems it was not a 'film adaptation' at all but a TV version that was given a theatrical release post Luhrman's Romeo  Juliet and Branagh's Hamlet. That might explain some of its flaws but doesn't excuse them. It starts well with a feisty battle sequence with pleasingly grisly witches looking on. Poor old Gray Malkin and Paddock are cut from the opening scene but they aren't alone for long. In quick order they are joined by the bloodied Sargent and his account of the battle the treachery of the Thane of Cawdor the luckless master o' the Tiger even MacBeth's meeting with Duncan when he is invested as thane of Cawdor. All of these had virtues that plead like angels trumpet tongued against the dark damnation of their sending off but sent off they are. These aren't the only cuts either. This is MacBeth in a hurry.From the opening battle we are pitched directly into MacBeth's encounter with the witches which is well done. Brian Blessed curiously directed the witchy sequences and he has great fun with the special effects as MacBeth and Banquo are told of their fates. Jason Connery as MacBeth is awkward obviously unsure what to make of the verse. Graham MacTavish as Banquo on the other hand is capable making his lines natural and easy. Within a few minutes of Connery's mumbling the viewer is struck the urge to see the roles reversed and MacTavish in the title role. No wonder MacBeth felt he needed to kill him.These first few minutes marks the high point of the film. From there we move to Helen Baxendale receiving word of her husband. She's as lost as Connery and denied the beard that he gets to hide behind. Her Unsex me here invocation of evil is embarrassing not unsettling. There are some reasonably clever touches  MacBeth's We will speak further is not a sign of his hesitancy in the face of his wife's wicked ambition but his attempt to silence her prattling as he throws her onto the bed.The acting of the leads is the biggest let down. Connery's method consists of staring glazedly about the screen while he mumbles his monologues via voiceover. Baxendale looks pinched and neurotic. An attempt to do something interesting with Is this a dagger  the fantastical dagger is a shadow cast by a cross on an altar  falls flat due to Connery's poor delivery and sloppy direction which mars the production throughout. We accompany Lady MacBeth back into the murder chamber where she gets to stab the reviving Duncan but the effect is comic not dramatic.Big scenes are botched  the appearance of Banquo at the feast is made incomprehensible through attempts to mix subjective rendering of MacBeth's delusion with what those around him see or don't see. The second meeting with the witches is even less coherent and the prophetic visions are confusing. Timing seems to be an issue here  Banquo's banquet is the centrepoint of the play but the film moves rapidly towards conclusion after it giving it an unbalanced feel and no scope for the intricacies of the riddles MacBeth is caught in to be appreciated or for his descent into madness to be convincing. Another crucial cut is the scene where Malcolm tests MacDuff and MacDuff learns of the murder of his family. This robs his revenge of most of its emotional force  and the character of a lot of the screen time. He's a virtual stranger when he turns up to kill MacBeth.A point for trying. MacTavish's Banquo earns another. The first few minutes garners another. But that's all. From then on it's sound and fury blah blah blah.".

In fact Jason Connery is being cut out of his father's will. Seeing as how his father is Sean Connery that's a big chunk of change Jason will be losing out on. The reasoning behind the decision is apparently Sean's strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself.

Probably far enough to rate this movie above a 110 as some people miraculously did.The movie attempts to be a parody of many other movies and series most notably Cast Away Lost and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately it fails miserably at any level. The acting does not save the absolutely horrible story the filming has the quality of a toooften played video tape the special effects were better executed in Be Kind Rewind for those who do not now this movie with aluminum foil... All this would be funny if the movie managed to be well funny. Unfortunately it is not. It hurts to watch this.And then there is Michael Jacksons appearance in this garbage. He appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message and manages to come across as mobile as Jabba the Hutt and as serious as a 4year old. Just when I thought who is the terrible person that lured this poor man into participating in this movie and yet again making a total fool of himself I finally reached the ending credits and discovered that the movie was actually partially shot at Jackson's Neverland ranch. In other words He. Likes. It.This movie and Jackson's involvement in it is truly disturbing. Do not watch it even for the haha a movie in the IMDb Bottom 100 effect. Or be warned.".

I also would say that although the film is totally awful it....no wait...there's nothing more to say...the film is just terrible. Now considering the cast of mostly nonames and fourthrate stars and faded stars this is no huge surprise. With the likes of Eric Roberts who used to be famous this isn't a surprisenor is it a surprise with guest spots by the like of Stuart Pankin Pat Morita Jerry Lewis and Bernie Kopell and interestingly Michael Jackson.So why did I watch this banal film? Well I have a confession to make. I occasionally like a terrible film. Considering I have reviewed hundreds or perhaps thousands of art films foreign films and documentaries sometimes I just need a good laughand a bad movie can be funny. No the jokes aren't funnybut laughing at how incredibly bad a film can be is good for a laugh. This film not surprisingly is on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list I HAD to see it! So if you WANT to see a terrible film give this one a watchit's funny in a brainless way and is great for a group of friends to watch and laugh at some minor exstars selfdestruct.

In other words there should be reasons to parody such work and they should definitely be clever. I didn't see any of those in the film. I did see some awful 10 seconds jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery. Bryan Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said hey I was drunk last night watching Survivors and had this brain fart for a straight to DVD release. I want you on board without reading the script...because I plan to direct this film without one! And herein lies the second mystery Eric Robert's career. I use to think Eric Roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky. Now I realize it's because he is stupid and therefore deserves the career that he had. After watching this movie it is apparent that he would have been better off had he gone into mainstream adult films which has higher budgets more...intense...scenes and roles better acting and direction more elaborate and compelling plot lines and a much wider audience than this Bmovie reject Cmovie?.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Bryan Michael Stoller apparently wrote the reference book Movie Making for Dummies. This film is not a good advert for his book and doesn't do his credibility as a director much good at all. I had to look long and hard for a DVD copy of this film before finding a German region 2 copy available under the alternate title of 'Silly Movie 2' Thankfully there is no 'Silly Movie 1'. It is riding high in the IMDb database of the 100 worst movies of all time and upon viewing it I can say it is placed that highly for a very good reason. Bryan Michael Stoller's direction and script is so incompetent that he actually makes his nearest contemporaries Jason Friedberg  Aaron Seltzer look like genuine Oscar contenders. Compared to this 'Meet the Spartans' and 'Epic Movie' are like the 'Citizen Kane' of spoof movies. The only two real questions that arise from watching this movie is to wonder how far Julia's brother Eric Roberts had to sink to headline this film and how on earth the director talked Michael Jackson into performing what is nothing more than a three minute cameo. This was filmed in 2004 and proved to be Jackson's last work as an actor he died five years later in 2009. The special effects are nothing short of woeful the acting uniformly dreadful. Even lots of beautiful girls in bikinis can't save this one. As a spoof it's not even funny. See it if you dare but don't say I didn't warn you what a pile of rubbish it is. Some films are so bad they are actually almost good. This film is just bad.".

He's angry because Dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed! While it clearly explained to Stevens that Dennis' character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at. The Hoppercharacter was the boy with the finger in the dike and now Stevens is blaming him for 'picking and choosing'??? And if that isn't enough he wants to stop everybody from entering this hideout because it isn't fair!? AND.... he's responsible for the death of the one guy who is humanity's saviour! OH MY GOD how stupid can you get?What's also maddening that IMDb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap. I mean TWO MILLION in budget what could have been done with that? Think Clerks Blair Witch and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100.000 dollars and were still better. AAAAARGH! I count myself lucky that I didn't pay one penny to see this crap and to sit through the end of this utter bercrap is one the most heroic things I've done this year.

He's angry because Dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed! While it clearly explained to Stevens that Dennis' character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at. The Hoppercharacter was the boy with the finger in the dike and now Stevens is blaming him for 'picking and choosing'??? And if that isn't enough he wants to stop everybody from entering this hideout because it isn't fair!? AND.... he's responsible for the death of the one guy who is humanity's saviour! OH MY GOD how stupid can you get?What's also maddening that IMDb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap. I mean TWO MILLION in budget what could have been done with that? Think Clerks Blair Witch and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100.000 dollars and were still better. AAAAARGH! I count myself lucky that I didn't pay one penny to see this crap and to sit through the end of this utter bercrap is one the most heroic things I've done this year. It's no wonder that the writers of this pile of dung had jobs as camera operator and title designer before ...";

For a start The exterior jet is a Cessna Citation and aircraft I am quite familiar with having piloted one myself and yet when the main charecters enter the cockpit they are standing....not only are they standing they are standing sidebyside in the doorsway. Standing in a citition is like standing in a VW beetle....simply no friggin' way. Does this director think audiences are simply stupid? or was this a cast and crew simply desparate for a paycheque?...either way they didn't deserve one. The story about an asteriodcomet about to impact the moon isn't so far fetched...the fact that they bounce back and forth from it 'impacting the moon' in one scene to 'aproaching Earth's atmosphere' in the next clearly shows the desparation of the crew to simply have their name on the credits...obviously a first for most of the cast and crew. The biggest joke of the whole film??.....STEALING SCENESFILM FOOTAGE FROM AIR AMERICA What?...The director didn't think anyone would notice the 'flying boxcar' crash scenes...do the makers of Air America know you used these shots?.. I can only sum it up this way I simply had to watch this one right through although my kids fell asleep after ten minutes just to see how BAD this could get and trust me on this the whole cast and crew should sue to have their names taken off the credits.".

The acting simply HAS to be the worst I have EVER seen in my life The effects can be done better on a home PC using 3DsMax software and the writing stinks so bad I thought the film was a comedy...I'm assuming it wasn't. For a start The exterior jet is a Cessna Citation and aircraft I am quite familiar with having piloted one myself and yet when the main charecters enter the cockpit they are standing....not only are they standing they are standing sidebyside in the doorsway. Standing in a citition is like standing in a VW beetle....simply no friggin' way. Does this director think audiences are simply stupid? or was this a cast and crew simply desparate for a paycheque?...either way they didn't deserve one. The story about an asteriodcomet about to impact the moon isn't so far fetched...the fact that they bounce back and forth from it 'impacting the moon' in one scene to 'aproaching Earth's atmosphere' in the next clearly shows the desparation of the crew to simply have their name on the credits...obviously a first for most of the cast and crew. The biggest joke of the whole film??.....STEALING SCENESFILM FOOTAGE FROM AIR AMERICA What?...The director didn't think anyone would notice the 'flying boxcar' crash scenes...do the makers of Air America know you used these shots?.. I can only sum it up this way I simply had to watch this one right through although my kids fell asleep after ten minutes just to see how BAD this could get and trust me on this the whole cast and crew should sue to have their names taken off the credits.";

But there was no blowback from the engines which should have incinerated everybody.And the rocket engines were running the entire time from the Earth to the asteroid behind the moon.NASA would love to know how they did both.When the hero parachuted down to the area of the underground secret hideaway the pilot was flying at only a few hundred feet to avoid radar in a remote mountain range or so he said there was radar in the wilderness. So the hero parachuted. He should have bounced two or three times before the parachute opened.And when the hero was in another gunfight with just about everybody we knew he was out of ammo when he kept pulling the trigger on his automatic and we heard click click. Automatics don't go click click when they're out.When Hopper was asked how he was able to build a secret underground complex at a cost of several hundred million dollars and get a rocket with a nuclear warhead he simply said something along the lines that he avoided the government bureaucracy.Near the end when Dennis Hopper and the main characters and their families approached the entrance to the elevator shaft leading to the sanctuary there were around 40 extras who found the entrance and were waiting for something to happen. They all knew they were about to die.Hopper  company calmly approached the entrance. The extras did nothing but look. Maybe just one had a comment but that's it. Hopper pulled out his remote and keyed in the code to open the elevator doors. The extras did nothing. Hopper  company got aboard and said their final lines. Only when the elevator doors began to close did the extras ran amok and rushed the doors to save themselves. Oh get REAL! And at the end there's a distant future peaceful Earth with the storyteller telling the children how all this happened long ago with a space view of the earth now surrounded with fragments of the moon.Well without the moon there goes the tides which is how the oceans clean themselves. But that doesn't seem to matter to the plot line.And the list goes on.The storyline itself is just plain awful.

I mean he used to be so cute but now..with that lanky body and blotchy skin  EW. I think he should stick with singing and the directors of the movie could've found a much betterlooking guy who could lipsync. No offense though. I thought this teen movie was majorly lame  and this is coming from me being a teen myself. The 'mean girls' in there are ohso predictable the acting is so amateurish it makes you cringe at times especially from Aaron and overall I just didn't enjoy it. Although I give out points for the storyline  that was alright but not at all realistic. Anyway stay away from this movie by all means you can unless you happen to have wads of cash on hand and have absolutely nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time. It's not worth the 6.50!!P.S this review of mine may not be applicable to younger kids under the age of 13!".

	schema:reviewBody "My summary refers to the fact that this film has 1479 votesjust 21 short of making it eligible to be on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 listthe 100 lowest rated films on the website. With a paltry score of only 1.8 this would place the film at approximately between 38 and 46 on the listtalk about a very dubious achievement!! My score of 3 isn't that badbut it does bring the film that much closer to the dreaded list.As for the film it stars the oncecute Aaron Carteryet another prepackaged and forgettable pop star of the 1990s. When he first broke onto the scene he was a cute kid with some songs that appealed to preteens and tweeners on Radio Disney. His songs look and image were all scrupulously groomed and created by marketing folks and did the trickleading to some huge album sales. Unfortunately by 2005 sales were in decline and Carter had hit his awkward stage of lifesomething ALL kids his age have to deal with eventually. To put it bluntly he isn't cute any more in this film and is at a very tough stage of life. I assume now he's a gorgeous young man...but in Popstar he's no longer the heartthrob he once was. Here he is just very normal...a death sentence for a kid in his position as a pop sensation.Interestingly the film has some appearances by some other exteen heartthrobs from the last few decadesincluding a roles for David Cassidy and Leif Garretttwo guys who also know what it's like to disappear from the limelight. Cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for himself while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke. Hopefully Carter will take after Cassidy in the future and so far thankfully he's managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many expop idols. I was far from thrilled with the film but seriously wish him best in this department. It's not his fault he was plastered across the radio and television throughout the early to mid1990s.In this film Carter doesn't exactly need to stretch himselfhe plays a pop star. However despite making millions and being adored by girls he doesn't have it all. He's quite densemostly because he has little interest in learning. The problem is so bad that his mother decides to no longer home school himforcing him to go to public school. The problem though is that he is rather phobic about taking tests...and making the grade in school is difficult. So he gets the idea of finding a smart girl to dateone who would naturally be obliged to help him out in school. He picks the cute but bookish Jane Alana Austin and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme work.This plot by the way isn't bad and could work even though it seems a lot like an episode of a show like The Brady Bunch or a Nickelodeon sitcom. Sure it's predictable and you KNOW that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt AND he will eventually realize that he actually does care for her AND by the end of the film all will be forgiven and they'll be a real couple. But given good acting and competent direction this could be worth seeing for his teen fans as predictable isn't always bad. And as it turned out this ISN'T exactly where the plot went...but it was awfully close.There are a few good things I liked about the film. Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens playing Jane's grandparents was very nicetheir role was quite sweet and it was good seeing them again. Also 1970s made for TV movie star Andrew Stevens appeared in the filmit was nice to see him againthough part of me hated him as he looks so great after all these years and I look ever bit of my 45 years! He did a fine job and it was nice seeing him in the same film as his mother Stella.As for Carter with his many prior experiences on TV he was not surprisingly pretty good. While his relationship with Jane didn't seem very believable he and Ms. Austin gave it their best. The film wasn't great but they did try and I think most of the problems with the film were in the writingwith a better and less formulaic plot it could have worked much better. Plus the whole testophobia angle seemed pretty contrived...and rather insignificant. Who cares if a megamillionaire star gets anxious taking tests in school?! Overall not a rotten film as the current rating would imply though there isn't much here to attract a wide audience. People who grew up loving Carter probably will enjoy the film. Older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably haven't heard of him. For them there is no nostalgia value in the film.My favorite part of the film...Leif Garrett giving Aaron advice. I felt like screaming don't listen!! but didn't!".

I could have sworn that the tween craze was over with by 2000.Highlights of the film The awkwardness. A lot of scenes end by being completely awkward like when J.D. just randomly gives Jane a cell phone though he had just randomly arrived at her house hours prior. Why are there dolphins so close to the ocean? Why did the bow on the car look like vomit? Why was it Gogle instead of Google? A lot of questions have not been answered for me or my friends.Lief Garrets song at the end. It's priceless.I am sure that TAG Entertainment thought this movie was going to do great. I mean they rented one Porsche or is it Nick Carters? that is used by three different people throughout the whole movie. Lief Garret and David Cassidy both two prominent child stars are featured in the movie. The only thing they needed in this film was substance which is what a film needs or else is pointless. So in the end watching this movie is pointless. Unless you like torture and want to scare your friends.".

Aaron Carter is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic. This movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying. This movie is so bad it's actually good. I would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a good laugh.".

Like it or not Aaron has seen more success in his young life than most people could ever dream of having so it only seemed natural for him to do a movie. Lou Pearlman and company have been known for overexploiting their pop protges you remember Justin Timberlake's foray into TV movie Model Behavior? Granted this movie isn't big scale and impressive but it's not supposed to be. It's not trying to impress people or be an Emmy award winner it was released straight to DVD. It's just a cute little movie about an awkward teen who gets her dream of being with her favorite Popstar I know a lot of you out there have had that dream at some point or another about you favorite singer don't deny it. It's sweet and gentle and I applaud it for not stepping into the realm of sex violence and vulgar language that seem to be creeping into more and more of our movies today. Where's the decency? Where's the line? Teen dramas come in dozens these days because teens are a big market for companies at least this one is more tolerable to me than Bratz aka Slutz with all the fake little girls running around going Oh Mah Gawd! in tank tops and mini skirts and is fathoms better than those gore fest movies like Saw. I feel for the main character girl because I was nerdy outcast girl in High School who loved Aaron Carter and NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys and other pop music and still do and like Aaron's character would get crushing testophobia especially in Math. If you judge this movie solely based on the fact that you don't like or are jealous of Aaron Carter and his fame then of course you're going to hate it and trash talk it in reviews. The only reason Britney Spears' dribble Crossroads got a higher score is because she has boobs. Accept this movie for what it is not what you want it to be. I think this happy formulaic teen movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing.".

McQueen the pop star as well as many other girls but she's the lucky one that gets to spend the days with J.D. and forms a relationship with him that is more like a fantasy. J.D. has to go to a public school to keep his math grade up in order to do his summer tour. Problem is J.D. isn't good at math. He finds the smartest person in school Jane to tutor him. Jane tutors and falls in love with J.D. J.D. in return falls in love with as well but J.D. screws up and has to fix everything in order to win the girl and make the summer tour. The movie is definitely worth watching. Aaron will be a GREAT actor!!!";

The plot rarely made sense was completely unrealistic and characters were randomly introduced throughout the film for no apparent reason.

The acting was subpar to say the least. The female lead seemed to have a sort of speech impediment which was likely not caused by the obviously fake braces she wore as braces do not usually affect speech to the extent shown in the film. The music element of the film especially the concert at the end was so bad I had to skip through it.What I found hilarious is that the popstar character in this film was taking advice from a rather stoned looking cleaner. Look where these 'words of wisdom' got him a lowpaying job as school cleaner and an obvious drug problem.I have watched some awful movies but this is one of the worst I have ever seen. I would recommend this to anyone who likes torturewants to torture someone is deaf or is under the age of 8.".

The obligatory high school mean girls are not nearly cruel enough to be true antagonists in fact the mean girls of any other high school film would eat these two for breakfast. The nerdy girl is nowhere near nerdy enough to take on that role and the strict teacher is pretty lame. There is conflict in the film but it is insignificant the high school setting is done without any effort and the actors all seem tired and unmotivated.

So the next step was obvious turn him into a teen heartthrob via movies. Not a great plan as this is the only movie he ever headlined. It's about a popstar which you should have gotten from the title. He's going to go on tour this summer but he's failing math and his mother won't let him. In the real world I don't see this happening but they have to get him back to school somehow and so he must do better in math or else there's no summer tour for him.Of course nobody knows who he is because he's wearing glasses. If it works for Clark Kent it's definitely going to work for him right? I mean it's not like he's the biggest popstar on the face of the planet and girls all over the place have his poster in their rooms or anything. Nah glasses are fine.Well high school shenanigans ensue. He winds up with a cute girl who's also his math tutor she finds out who he really is they fall in love he passes math and the summer tour is a go.

	schema:reviewBody "A town in Japan is being taken over by a horribly brutal abstract shape the spiral.  It's becoming a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and twisting them mentally and literally.  This film shows it happening to several groups of people.  Some demonic possession is implied but nothing is entirely sure except that the best bet is to get the heck out of dodge.

It was not predictable how they would fight the evil or how it would end up.  Also it had this really new but probably typically Japanese color leached Pacific Northwest style cloudy day thing going which was a fresh visual effect for me.  The horrific moments were seriously creepy relying on a little gore but mainly just impossibly overdone facial expressions think The Ring and body manipulations.  This should be one of the greats up there with onceoriginal ideas like the first Nightmare on Elm Street or Night of the Living Dead.".

As the spirals consume the cursed island the amazing visuals rule the film bodies twisted into tight circles hair coiled into gravity defying spirals eyes spinning like whirlpools people transformed into snails. It's as though Lovecraft penned a slightly disgusting comedy and the film feels very much like the manga comic on which it was based  colorful exaggerated and silly but also sick and disturbing as well. This is a beautifully shot and well acted film with some stunning effects.

At first I thought it ended far too abruptly but about 20 seconds later I realised the meaning and liked the end. However because of the lack of seriousness in the story combined with over the top scenes such as the news report at the school ment that I did not care for the characters much in the end. The final scene which was perhaps supposed to be a little poignent while in reality I couldn't really care for the girl or her boyfriend.

The premise is unusual and it is presented in the quiet understated style so prevalent in Japanese films ha!.  The special effects are a little 70s camp but it adds to the comic book feel of the film.  I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone but if you are familiar with and enjoyed other Japanese horror films like Evil Dead's Trap this film will appeal to you.".

I read Uzumaki last year and then saw a number of good reviews so I expected a little more from the film. Still was managing my expectations that it would be a solid adaptation of the manga based off others. For that matter I always try to separate adaptations and judge a product on it's own merits however this film falls very short.The film looks cheap  tacky spiral effects in the background and fast cuts bordering on spastic at some points do not do the film any favors. Also the editing is something like a school video project using all kinds of odd fades and screen wipes that really seem dated to a modern audience. The film never takes itself too seriously and it is styled almost like a comedy yet the tone is inconsistent. They toss in cheap jump scares that are out of nowhere. There are a few scenes that establish a creepy atmosphere but that gets tossed out the window with a bad edit or goofy scene every time the potential gets squandered.The acting is pretty stale in a lot of parts and I think some of blame falls on the director's camera techniques. Often I felt he was highlighting a weaker performance with his shots zooming in on actor's faces like a soap opera. If he had instead spent more effort focusing on atmosphere or building tension I think the story really could have benefited. The story is somewhat vague and had I not read the source material I wonder if I would have been able to follow it at all. To me that is the biggest problem by picking and choosing bits from the manga and changing too many other things to condense it into a film it is a halfbaked product to the core. Fans of the manga will be disappointed while newcomers may not be sure what is going on. Alright I've gotta be that guy.... If you choose to watch this film and think it has some good ideas check out the manga. It is much richer and more rewarding. Everything is better connected and well explained the vibe is much creepier. I can pretty much guarantee you'll dig it. If you read the manga a while ago and want to turn your brain off for 90 minutes it does have some cool moments but really lacks any payoff. It is totally skippable otherwise. I only finished it out of inertia  I was ready to tap out around halfway through but decided to finish it off when I saw it a short feature. If the movie worked on it's own I would say check it out but don't waste your time.210".

This film reminds me of eerie indiana. The ending differs to the manga which I was expecting. Kirie looks like her manga counterpart and her male friend suits the whole very well. Very creepy I have to admit this film feels like a feverish nightmare the kind you have when you were a kid. Not really scary at all but freaky if you get my drift?

	schema:reviewBody "First of all  don't expect horror movie. I did and I was quite disappointed  not even by the lack of actual horror  much more by poor CG and lack of any sensible explanations. I could live with that but what really bothers me  it looks like creators of Uzumaki themselves had no idea how to explain events or at least develop a story. The movie IS twisted like  well  home of a snail. Some people compare it to creations of David Lynch. There is one resemblance  Lynch also often has no idea how to clarify his story. Strange  or rather weird  things happen all the time but often without any particular reason. After the movie ended I felt like after watching Twilight Zone mixed with a pinch of Tales from the Crypt and all that shoot in Ringu style. Such blend sounds promising but Uzumaki doesn't keep its promise  it's simply too uneven. In addition all actual action concentrates on scenes with CG effects which are often so poor that they will make you laugh. Everything between them while quite stylish may bore you to death  especially if you're not a Ringu fan. A pity. But there are two things that I actually won by watching this movie. The first one is end credits song fortunately credited not with Japanese Kana but Latin characters  Raven by Do As Infinity. I've found the video for it  and it basically contains all the action and special effects of the movie. If you will watch it before the movie  chances are that it will spare you the disappointment. And the song is really great!Second great thing about Uzumaki is its origin  the comic book. After finding out it's based on a comic I understood why it recalls Tales from the Crypt so noticeably... But Uzumaki comic is simply great! The story is very well developed and everything makes much more sense than in the movie  and that's quite strange because the movie is quite heavily based on the comic! Unfortunately all threads are mixed and twisted pun intended and the final effect is much worse than its origin.My final grade for Uzumaki is 510  it doesn't mean that the movie is average. It's simple an average of what I want and would like to give it i.e. 310  710.".

I really recommend this film for Japanese Horror movie fans and weird movie fans like Eraserhead and stuff that plays with your mind the movie is a little slow and has no start nor ending to the story actually the ending is kind of stupid but the whole thing works. Check it out.Ill give it a good 9 out of 10 on Scare factor on JHorror movies.".

At first the overall cinematography threw me off but as you get used to the overall appearance you start to see the beauty in this twisted film.

Throughout my viewing I felt like I was watching a cartoon. There are funny segues between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. Later I found out the film is an adaptation of a manga comic so this makes sense. However just when you think you are watching something that could be a kid's movie you are bombarded with nasty and gory visuals!

I'm a bit of a fan of Japanese dramas and there are often actors from dramas in movies.. Matsushima Nanako for example the lead in Ringu is a major jdrama star. But it looks like this is the first film for Kirie and Shuichi's portrayers. I must say if they really are debuting here they do a pretty good job.Kirie was a very sympathetic character I thought she was easy to relate with. She was kind and goodhearted perhaps not the most popular girl but nicer than some of the other attentionseeking girls. She was also pretty in a classic kind of way. I hope she does more films but it's been a couple years so maybe she has no such plans.The ending was odd. I'm not going to give anything away but the rest of the movie's bizarreness was kind of put to shame.Very bizarre but very imaginative and unique movie. I'd recommend it for Japanese horror fans though I'll warn you it's a lot more bizarre than Ringu.Nonetheless I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 for originality imagination good characterization above average acting and just being plain intriguing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I'd seen this movie I've heard a lot of praise about it and quite many exclamations about how horrific it was. Not to take any credit away from this movie I think it wasn't all that horrible or even shocking. It's just a movie about people living in the darker side of the town. And a good one at portraying the point.There's some great acting here and a wellthought of manuscript. Paavo Westerberg is a renowned writer in the Finnish movie scene and he's the best in what comes to describing the contemporary Finnish culture albeit he's not the only one writer for this movie but I dare say he's the mainwriter anyway. Correct me if I'm wrong.The casting is excellent except for Jasper Pkknen the pseudomain character who in my opinion should have stayed in the soap opera scene and the sets the cuts and sounds are very well done as well and give great atmosphere to this movie.This movie is a story about loosely interconnected sad destinies that according to a famous Finnish band's very well known song Eppu Normaali's Tuhansien Murheellisten Laulujen Maa which VERY roughly translated to Paha Maa throughout the whole Finnish society lead to a sad dark end accompanied with booze lonesomeness and the bad choices. And it's the side of everyday Finnish life about 80 of the population have no awareness of unless movies like this are made.".

It doesn't for me have enough that I would knock it up a notch to the excellent category but I did talk to some viewers who felt that it was an excellent film. Louhimies said that back in Finland people either loved this movie or hated it and said a lot of people in theaters walked out on it. I'm sure some objected to some of the violence swearing drug and alcohol abuse and sexual explicate scenes. It's a very clever story of how these different lives are woven together because of a trickle down effect. This film has very interesting and strong characters. I would rate it a 7.0 out of a possible 10 and would see it again and recommend it with caution.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a movie of which I kept on reading the reviews again and again and despite it being played at Film Museum and not at Pathe theatres  I decided to give this movie a try. The reasons were many  in the reviews it was compared with Pulp Fiction it had several parallel stories running in the movie and lastly it had already won 17 awards internationally in various categories. I was eager to see this movie and due to my off day at Greenpeace I decided to make myself happy by going and seeing this movie.It is a story based in Finland. I think it reflected the current life of people in general  drugs crime sex anger anguish fear and guilt. Every emotion was captured brilliantly in the movie. There are several characters and stories interwoven but a few characters come back in the latter half  making a link with the beginning sequences and that takes the story forward.The story is about two friends  one of whom is computer geek and the other is a drug addict  son of an abusive father. The drug addict boy trades a Euro 500 note  printed by his friend  to buy back his music system and in returns gets huge change of cash back to buy more drugs. The trading of Euro 500 note continues to bizarre events  from the shop trader to an auto mechanic cum robber  to a car dealer  to a vacuum cleaner salesman  to a prostitute  to a police officer  then to her family and children. How the beginning of a small thing  creates a chain reaction that lead even after 5 years of that first incident to a depressing last note  which I won't reveal here.The direction is excellent. The character development in the movie is first rate. The character that sticks on your mind even after you come out of the movie is of the vacuum cleaner sales person. All the departments of the movie are handled nicely. Here I would like to make a couple of critical comments. First during the sequence of one event leading to another I felt that the coincidences were too rapid and forced. But this screenplay writing error is pardon when one sees the whole canvas. Second the trail of one character leading to another somehow leads back to the first two characters and that again I found to be a forced decision by the screen play writer. There was no need to have the same characters showing up again when there are different causes leading to different effects in such a big city.But after saying that  it is an excellent movie! It is a dark movie with quite a few sex scenes. The characters are having the black white and gray shades and emotions that change from facing different situation which is brilliantly captured by the director.A top rate movie! It has all the ingredients of becoming a cult movie. I hope that only such movies should not become and achieve the status of cult movies and win lots of awards because without crime sex violence drugs etc. too one can make fantastic movies  Bicycle Thieves and Pather Panchali are its prime examples  only thing is that they were a long time back and times are changing and I think movies are reflecting the current times.".

I'm sure they watched some Kaurismki too to find out what it is about his films that people like misunderstood him completely and came up with a boring depressing story about people going through all kinds of st for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography. It's a crying shame they threw in Tolstoy here. It's just a sign of trying to be smart. And of not being.I think the worst fault however is the complete lack of vision and depth. The film is highly unoriginal. It is also frustrating to watch endless sulking and suffering without any real revelation brought to it. I can go through this kind of mindck if the film is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke or better yet something sublime like in e.g. von Trier's Breaking the Waves. There was none these in Paha maa. Actually though I did start laughing at some point because the turn of events was again just too predictable overthetop and incredible.Who does this crap?

All performances all the way round were just amazing.A nice sober way of presenting the narrative with lot's of style but never distracting. Everything centered on these beautifully written characters and their mainly painful situations. And painful it gets. Films like this are rare. Crash comes to mind and especially Short Cuts and maybe Magnolia but the heartache felt here and the wonderful complexity I have only before seen in one other movie. and that was Amores Perros which is my favorite film of all time.It's a hard watch and it's draining and I probably won't see it again for a couple of years but it is absolutely essential viewing that I can't recommend highly enough 1010".
