There are cringe worthy moments with the historical inaccuracies would there really have been female exchange students in the era in question?and following the interval the film loses some momentum. However whilst these flaws are present they are overshadowed by the stellar aspects of the film such as the impactful performances and melodious music.Salman Khan is PHENOMENAL in and as Veer. During the course of the film one cannot separate him from Veer and never has he delivered such a consistent serious performance. His role is strong powerful and intense which he meets all throughout the film to the extent that one is able to overlook the films ludicrous historical inaccuracies.Mithunda is another consistent and powerful performer in the film. He is a pleasure to watch and the audience will find themselves missing him in the portion of the film Veer is in England. All the other cast are strictly OK understandable by the sheer strength and presence in the performances mentioned before. As far as Zarine Khan is concerned her role is undemandinghowever her screen presence ought to be noted.The films music alongside the awesome performances is another of it's assets. All the songs are beautiful and well placed in the film. Surprisingly none of the songs stick out like a sore thumb and really enhance the film.What exactly happens postinterval is difficult to pinpoint the plot slackens and it hits the viewer as it was preceded by the such an engrossing and speedy first half. However the film does quicken toward the end and the ending coupled with Salman and Mithunda's intensity and chemistry can almost make the viewer forget the preceding shonkiness.Veer is not the greatest film ever made but it isn't the worst as one of its critics cited comparing it to Tashan!. It is a mega entertainer a great cinematic experience and perhaps one of Salman Khan's best performances.".

This is the second time Salman is doing something like getting a carbon copy.So anyways in one word this movie is average. Very average. For more than one reason. It's a good entertainer but all the superbollywoody factors make me hate it like flying means a LOOOOOOONG jump like breaking a sword with a bloody fist etc etc. Thank god for what happens in the end though.The direction is OK doesn't feel stretched but isn't that smooth either. The editing is flawed but I'd give the cinematography a solid 810. Scenes are beautifully captured no doubt. The 300type CGI makes one want to puke at times. The soundtrack... except the one song that I know people will like it sucks.And for the performances... Salman Khan's acting was... let's say... what it was supposed to be. Satisfying nothing great. For others it was fine. The newcomer Katrina Kaifish girl though didn't have too many dialogues was pretty OK.And for the movie... I just LIKED one thing which is the small twist in the end. As for the rest it was OK. It is after all a love story and nothing more. And when it comes to love India has invented so many stories and I've seen so many that honestly I'm bored. I mean come on what are they gonna do next make films on capturing a terrorist or a common cold? 610. Don't really go on my rating I'm too critical.

No doubt about that he has scripted the film but that is exactly what the film suffers from don't get me wrong it isn't half bad for a man whos career lies is in acting. But its quite obvious that Salman viewed the Hollywood Epic Troy beforehand most of the storyline is a rip off from it. 2 warring tribes? the heroine belonging to the enemy tribe? A fight between Veer and the heroines brother in which Veer wins? A tearful yet acceptable climax? All seems a bit too familiar to me.Salman is very good in the film but he is looking his age for the most part he does not have a six pack but more of a flab pack. Sohail Khan is ludicrous in the bad sense he tries hard to bring a sense of humour but fails miserably. Mithun pleasantly surprises the fight between him and Salman is the highlight of the film. Jackie Shroff is bearable as is his onscreen daughter the heroine and debutant Zarine Khan.However the film is in all honesty too long while being an adaptation of troy it also has its own stroyline but 2 and half hours is pushing it the story could have been told in 2 hours max given the brief interlude from the songs which are picturised very well.The love story is a runofthemill one hero and heroine falls in love then some melodrama and in this case fighting and action before a reunion then an expected twist.Action scenes war scenes etc etc are underdone the film is definitely an epic but more in the bollywood 44 crore budget sense Veer lacks the granduer but Salman more than makes up for it.Music is well used in the film depicts the more grand style of times back then but the party song the name of which i cant remember is brilliant on screen. Cinematography is all in all very good.Final Verdict See it for Salman but don't go expecting a huge bollywood epic you'll be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Salman lives his dream majestically but the film impresses only partially.";
	schema:reviewBody "There were mixed reactions about Veer before its release since it was a period drama dealing with the same old Rajput Kings Britishers and their revolts. The subject had its own limitations holding a restricted appeal for the viewers. But there was Salman Khan on Veer's side with a gigantic fan following who were all eager to see their favourite star in a new avatar of a revolutionary fighter.So the stage was all set for Salman to once again win over the box office with his majestic project which also had few melodious songs to its credit. But after watching more than 160 minutes of this fictional period epic sadly Salman Khan himself Mithun Da and the few well composed songs remain the only worth mentioning features of this costly affair called Veer. In few words the movie which successfully manages to impress the viewers with its powerful content in the first half fails miserably post intermission and becomes a great let down after its initial one hour. Revolving around a revolutionary tribe named Pandari's which existed in the period of 19th century it talks about the same old fatherson vengeance story which also involves the angle of The Ruling Britishers and their relationships with the Rajput Kings.Truly speaking Veer starts off quite well with an explosive  impactful opening sequence which right away forces every person in the theater to take it seriously. Justifying all the historical events happening on the screen with a voice over the movie makes a successful start and the powerful scenes of Mithun Da  Salman Khan together raise the bar further. Taali the first song of the movie also makes an impression. The song even reminded me of one similar dance sequence in the famous cult movie Fiddler on the Roof.In fact the first half of Veer has some excellent scenes both acted and directed brilliantly. Like the one against animal sacrifice in the name of Religion the shot with the graphical representation of London in the 19th century the University scene where Salman answers back to his racist professor and the punishment scene right after. But the real problem starts just before the intermission where Salman performs a lethal bloodshed killing several British soldiers along with the two Rajput brothers of the leading lady. Actually all the liberties taken by the script writers which have no logical explanations start right after the intermission when suddenly you see both Salman  Sohail returning to India just like that after mercilessly killing so many people right in the University Grounds in front of all the students. From here on the film takes a negative 'Uturn' and with every new scene progressing on the screen you start forgetting the excellent scenes witnessed in the first half. After the interval the narration slows down majorly as the love story takes the front seat. Moreover the final moments of the movie are also not capable of awakening the patriotic emotions in the viewers as usually seen in the movies made around the subject of India and its Freedom.Visually Veer is grand royal and well worked upon. Cinematography Visual Effects and Art Direction have a stunning impact and play as another character in the story on the screen. Musically it's undoubtedly among the top 3 musical scores of the duo SajidWajid and they have delivered some real soulful numbers such as Sureeli Akhiyon Waley  Salaam Aaya. Gulzar once again comes up with some logically unexplainable but great deep meaningful words. Only the person who had written Humne Dekhi Hai Un Ankhon Ki Mehakati Khushboo could have written Sureeli Akhiyon Waley. As expected Veer completely belongs to Salman Khan and his dominant screen presence. He realistically lives the character of Veer and delivers a fine performance but the period feel of the movie may disappoint lot of his young fans who love to see him dressed in cool denims and open shirts. After Salman its Mithun Da to watch out for with his piercing eyes and strong dialogue delivery. Zarine Khan no doubts resembles Katrina but she still looks pretty though a little overweight. She may be taken in for a specific purpose but manages to give an OK performance in the movie. Jackie Shroff has slightly done it over the top. Sohail Khan does the usual act similar to his previous flicks. Both Puru Raaj Kumar  Aryan Vaid don't get enough scope to make an impact but Neena Gupta shines in her few scenes. Interestingly there are no familiar faces in the actors playing the British Officers and they all do the usual stuff without making any great efforts. Veer also has its resemblances with Taras Bulba 1962 and Kranti 1981. Apart from a similar climax it even has a half arm person in the form of Jackie Shroff just as there was Prem Chopra in Kranti.Anil Sharma tries to revive the magic of Gadar with many similar kind of heroic sequences using the current Heman Salman following the legacy of Dharmendra  Sunny Deol. But in absence of a logical script and a tight edit he fails to connect with the audiences after few initial engrossing moments and thus could only deliver a half hearted project.In the end I would sincerely like to add that Veer could have been a much better movie with a more realistically directed and written second half. It is clearly the fault of the script writer and the director that the movie which reasonably impresses you in the first half works so negatively post intermission. As Salman has reportedly written the main story of the movie I doubt whether this was exactly the tale he wanted to bring on the wide screen. Anyway if you are a Salman Khan fan then you are surely going to like it especially before intermission. Otherwise the magnum epic satisfies the viewer only partially.".

	onyx:emotionText "There were mixed reactions about Veer before its release since it was a period drama dealing with the same old Rajput Kings Britishers and their revolts. The subject had its own limitations holding a restricted appeal for the viewers. But there was Salman Khan on Veer's side with a gigantic fan following who were all eager to see their favourite star in a new avatar of a revolutionary fighter.So the stage was all set for Salman to once again win over the box office with his majestic project which also had few melodious songs to its credit. But after watching more than 160 minutes of this fictional period epic sadly Salman Khan himself Mithun Da and the few well composed songs remain the only worth mentioning features of this costly affair called Veer. In few words the movie which successfully manages to impress the viewers with its powerful content in the first half fails miserably post intermission and becomes a great let down after its initial one hour. Revolving around a revolutionary tribe named Pandari's which existed in the period of 19th century it talks about the same old fatherson vengeance story which also involves the angle of The Ruling Britishers and their relationships with the Rajput Kings.Truly speaking Veer starts off quite well with an explosive  impactful opening sequence which right away forces every person in the theater to take it seriously. Justifying all the historical events happening on the screen with a voice over the movie makes a successful start and the powerful scenes of Mithun Da  Salman Khan together raise the bar further. Taali the first song of the movie also makes an impression. The song even reminded me of one similar dance sequence in the famous cult movie Fiddler on the Roof.In fact the first half of Veer has some excellent scenes both acted and directed brilliantly.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Veer";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the curious things about watching a Hindi film here is how you get to see the censor certificate before the show begins with signatories of approval as well as something which I like to spot  the physical length of the film measured in feet over X number of projected reels. For Veer this marks the first time I see the censors being quite upfront about the amount of snips down to the movie which amounted to some 10 ft worth of film. At least you'd come to expect that the film was cut and here it's for the gratuitous violence which unfortunately had the more gory bits left on the cutting room floor.Salman Khan follows up on the disappointment of last year's London Dreams with this effort directed by Anil Sharma responsible for what's arguably India's largest film Gadar Ek Prem Katha. Unfortunately for what Veer had promised to be one heck of an epic set in a time of tumultuous India with factions battling it out for land and the invasion of the British by virtue of alliances with Indian kings craving that upper hand in military logistics not knowing that they're being nothing but slowly colonized by their British masters.As the story goes Salman Khan plays Veer a Pindari general's child whose clansman were massacred through a betrayal by Madhavgarh King Gyanendra Jackie Shroff. Fearsome in battle and men of their word the warrior clan Pindaris are not taking this lying down and have scattered with a vow to one day exact their vengeance against King Gyanendra. The first child born during their exile Veer gets taught the ways of the warrior kind before being sent to London with his brother Punya Sohail Khan in order to learn the ways of the Britishers yeah and especially their cunning minds one small step toward their goal of overthrowing the Madhavgarh king through the exploiting of his backer's weaknesses and to circumvent their strategy of divide and conquer over India.Alas Veer has to fall in love in typical Bollywood fashion and what more in true Romeo and Juliet style. In fact most of the film adopts this epic love story which becomes centerstage for Veer's romance and plot against his father's and people's common enemy. Like the fabled line from Shakespeare's tragedy too early seen unknown and known too late he and Princess Yashod Zarine Khan a fleshier dead ringer for Katrina Kaif realize the enormous obstacles lying in front of them and have to choose whether to fulfill personal desires that of their father's in crushing the other side while shouldering the weight of their people's welfare as well whether to fight another bloody war or to kowtow to the British who are pompously throwing their weight around.While I didn't appreciate much of the token battle and action sequence in the first half and even Veer's attack of a train for treasure and the love at first sight encounter with Yashod the narrative was kept tight in the setting of the premise until you realize it's a love story after all with Veer being a rather smart Romeo in trying to kill multiple birds with a single stone. The scenes in London where both Veer and Punya enrol in a college and reconnect with Yashod again was something out of a high school romance with plenty of song and dance to go around so much that it actually gets boring no thanks to the repetitive romantic theme played until ad nausem  until two tragic turn of events set the stage for a cliffhanger just before the interval. It is in this section that Sohail Khan shines as Punya used mostly for comic relief and then fading away as an underdeveloped character despite some glimpses of a fearsome warrior in the making.The second half after the interval somehow imploded through its lost sense of direction and the muddled development of plotting for revenge fulfillment of promises and the battling for the hand of Yashod all seemed too scattered. For all the sweeping motion of battle horses and foot soldiers clashing in battle there was a distinct lack of big battle sequences which are obligatory for a sword and sandals film and in its place you got a hokey joust with a muscular Caucasian as well as an emotionally empty father versus son tirade. You cannot deny that Salman Khan tried hard but it came across as trying too hard yet again made worst by his display of only two emotions in the entire film  lovelorn and rage which for some inexplicable reason the latter facial display comes with complete with some cheesy lionroar effect to accentuate his angry mood.India has its fair share of contemporary epics set in its period days and two excellent films which I have watched come to mind in Lagaan and Jodhaa Akbar incidentally both directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. Unfortunately Veer doesn't even come close to matching the standards set by those two in terms of story action and songs even. You can see glimpses of what Veer had tried to do but it lacked focus and was poor in delivery and the final cheesy and needless scene just drove the final nail into the film's coffin. I'm also sad to say that of the 3 Khans of Bollywood Salman has yet to impress me with this choice of projects to star in.".

	schema:reviewBody "Veer suffers from formulaic overkill. There is just so much contrived jabberjabber you can take about defending your honour about duty versus love and about drinking the blood of the British.

The film then is watchable for Salman Khan's arresting screen presence his charming romantic overtures and a degree of involvement from him that you haven't seen before. Unfortunately what lets Veer down in the end is the fact that it overstays its welcome. At almost two hours and forty minutes it's way more than you can handle on an evening out. It doesn't help that key parts are filled by weak actors like Sohail Khan Puru Raaj Kumar and Aryan Vaid who rob the film of any shred of credibility it might have otherwise earned.Watch it if you're a diehard Salman fan. It's an epicsized period film with tacky special effects. Unacceptable in these times. From Cameron's Pandora to Anil Sharma's Pindhari we've come a long way. The film's action is visceral with several bloodsplattered slaughter scenes but often runs the risk of coming off as ridiculous. A Gladiatorstyle duel ends with Salman literally twisting a man's head 360 degrees around and there's another one in which he yanks out a rival's insides with his bare hands.The film also suffers on account of too many songs that don't take the narrative forward including one in which Neena Gupta jiggles and wiggles and heaves her bosom suggestively at the entire Pindhari clan including her grownup sons who dance along merrily.Much of the film's first half holds up because there's conviction even in the stupidity. You may find it hard to believe that one man can singlehandedly fight an armed gang but Salman and his director dive into the most preposterous scenes unblinkingly.".

Had my fingers crossed and hoped that Salman Khan might have finally delivered something laudable. But within 10 minutes into the movie I knew that I was going to be greatly disappointed once again.The story was simply absurd. Any story on the struggle for independence against British Raj should not be narrated with so much surrealism. The viewers must be somehow influenced to be sympathetic and respectful to the characters who fought long and hard to win our freedom. Instead the movie felt like a stupid joke at times and many people inside the theater started laughing. In the process of writing a period movie the writer seemed to have been lost in time a few times. Certain parts of the story in London felt too modern to be early twentieth century. If Mangal Pandey ought to be criticized for lacking sense of proportion then I am not even sure what to say about Veer.Salman Khan should consider some training in serious acting. His expressionless face became a burden to watch at times. He should realize that it is time for him to come on the screen as the character not as Salman Khan. The lead actress was equally inept in her role. Mithun Chakravarty was melodramatic as usual but he was bearable. The quality of the English actors was mostly poor.I must admire the technical aspects of the movie though. The sets costumes artifacts decorations computer graphics cinematography etc were one of the best I have seen in Indian movies. Editing could have been better. Some of the fight scenes and stunts seemed old school and felt flimsy in comparison to standard Hollywood action movies.Anyway I believe such astronomical production cost and efforts could have been much better utilized on a story from Ramayan or Mahabharat.".

Performance wiseSalman Khan is excellentamazingdynamic as Veer.Watch out for his entry sequence or at the end during the swayamvar scene.He rocks.Mithun Da is very good.Sohail Khan irritates.Jackie Shroff is bland.Zarine Khan is no Katrina Kaif.She is okay.Neena Gupta is wasted.On the whole Veer is sheer disappointment.";

	schema:reviewBody "Five things about Veer are actually good even very good Jackie Shroff Mithun Chakraborthy the music the visuals and the basic idea. And that's about where it ends. I won't even start listing those things that are bad...Apparently Veer was meant to become The Salman Khan Movie To End All Salman Khan Movies. Salman himself is responsible for the story which supposedly took him no less than twenty years. The result proves that whatever one may think about Sallu storywriting is definitely Not His Thing. It should be said the first 30 minutes of the movie are promising and evoke high expectations but all the rest is just one big and rather tasteless egotrip. To such a degree that you can't even say this movie is about Veer at all... no it is about Salman Salman dressed up as a Pindari Salman dressed up as an English gentleman Salman dressed up as a gladiator Salman dressed up as Highlander Salman dressed up as an Indian prince and of course Salman in his trademark outfit his naked muscled chest. The story appears to be completely subordinated to Salman his poses and his costumes.The role of princess Yashodhara was obviously meant to be played by Salman's fiance but because Katrina had other obligations he had to find replacement. And so he picked a dbutante as his heroine whose only asset appears to be a certain physical similarity to La Kaif. Mistake number 2 because Zatrina quite clearly lacks the talent the acting skills and the charisma to pull off this one. Her screen presence irritates from the first to the last scene even though the role wasn't a particularly challenging one anyway. In fact the film would have been a lot better off without the whole obligatory love story annoying even for Bollywood standards.Watching this movie I got the impression that Salman hoped to create his own Jodhaa Akbar or The Rising. But all he managed was creating his own Dharam Veer  without Dharam to that! Manmohan Desai's Dharam Veer is at least funny and absurd however Salman's Veer is not funny at all. If he would at least have added some humor the Veer character things might have turned out differently because Salman happens to a good comedian from time to time. But instead he left the comedy bits to his brother Sohail who although not a bad actor himself is notoriously bad at comedy. And thus the movie that was supposed to showcase all Salman's abilities as an actor turns out more successful at showcasing his limitations. The feeling that remains is that this movie deserved to become something much better than it actually became a major disappointment.".

The film's action sequences are so well directed but the British dialogue is so poorly performed and written very unnatural and awkward  why are they speaking so slowly? It's amazing that the film gets the action scenes right but is so carelessly done it can't get the little things right. And the ending? What was that all about?

So if you like to see a movie which highlights all angles of this icon then this is your movie.People like me who like to see a good developed character are curling their toes by witnessing this punishment. Salman is fully loaded with anabolics which block him even to try acting. Veer is king of looking dangerous with angry eyes however I can't call that acting. The background music score is also terrible throughout the whole movie you hear ho ho ho ho ho ho. The stunts are so infantile Mithun is getting wounded at the end by a small scratch and he yells like a woman giving birth to a baby. I think that this production is definitely not suitable for the westernized world and also not for Indians living in these sides of the world due to it's logic which irritates and hurts both eyes and ears. For me the enlightening part was just the appearance of the Dutch bodybuilder as a mad gladiator!Salman should continue doing movies like No Entry wherein he plays a naive guy who is been fooled.Till today in my opinion Asoka is still the mature historical epic from Bollywood produced in 2001.As for most Indian movies I state that it's better to release special editions for the world outside India. By cutting redundant songs and some movie parts which has no added value to the main storyline there will remain a better result to digest for the western viewers.".

This is in my books single handedly makes this movie great. No melodramatic sacrifices of love for country. No Father Son brawls over the son's love interests. In fact the only point where such conflicts and hence the self sacrificing trait emerge are for a cause which is downright stupid and a living example of how gullible can a Director expect his audience to get.Each scene is as far removed from it's preceding brother as Eskimoes are from the Arabs.Not once in the movie does the brain get bothered and when it does it is because of the empty popcorn bag which was devoured greedily by the man himself.The acting is equally nononerous . Leaving no space for critical comments to pour in. The dialogues represent the best of light hearted  brain dead revelry .The music is decent enough and varies from the loud Taali  to the soft Salaam Aaya.The girl who makes her debut does a fine job  given the script she had to content herself with.The cinematography was good I admit.

The plot is convoluted enough to be interesting without being overly political. Most of the costumes the Pindari in particular look great but the dresses of the British women always looked too flimsy and somehow inappropriate. The musical numbers were generally good one tune particularly haunting despite the fact that not all the songs or dances fit the time period. The action and fighting with one exception looked real and natural Chakraborty and Shroff were great in their supporting roles. Whether the fault of the actor or the script Sohail Khan's role was too full of slapstick comedy. Salman Khan played the hard warrior very well. Zareena Khan's role was minimal and somewhat two dimensional but she certainly was lovely. Overall it was an exciting and fun film and well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Salman Khan's lean phase was during this time of his career despite ending his flop streak with Wanted in 2009. He continued to give flops and a disaster until Dabangg which was the start of his blockbuster period. Salman Khan is one of the finest actors in Bollywood but this film was not the right kind of film for him. He does much better in Masala action films like Wanted and comedies like Partner. He even did much better films in the 90s but films like Veer brought his career down.Veer was an extremely hyped up movie people were excited because it was supposed to be the next Gadar2001. Sadly all that hype was for nothing and yes many people got disappointed. The film did average in single screens but it failed to show any growth at the multiplexes. Even at single screens the collections dropped and the film became a disaster. The story of the film is actually not a bad effort but the handling and the flow of the story is not up to mark. The start was good and Salman's entry was superb. However the forced comedy and the romance doesn't fit well with the story. The second half goes downhill its like they had an average first half and a horrible second half. The second half of the film focuses on revenge and how it is executed in a poor way. The ending is hilariously bad Salman Khan gets shot but dies after a long battle. It is so messed up and it doesn't make sense how Khan doesn't die. Plus the typical Father Vs Son nearing the ending where Mithun and Salman are forced to fight is straight out of 90s movies.Direction by Anil Sharma is poor he seems to be stuck in his Hukumat days. These kind of films would have worked if they released earlier but the film had to release now.Salman Khan is not at his best here he overacts badly in some scenes but acts well in the action scenes. Sohail Khan is horrible in this film he overacts in everything from comedy to sorrow. Zarine Khan is good looking but her acting is poor her expressions are not well timed. Mithun Chakraborty does a fantastic job he is the life of the film. Jackie Shroff is average he is the villain. The rest provide average support.On the whole Veer is an average film at its best. It wasn't an awful film but it wasn't anything great either.".

	schema:headline " Classic antihero";
	schema:reviewBody "Snake Plissken is the classic antihero ala Clint Eastwood's Manwithnoname.  Plissken is an exsoldier turned criminal recruitedblackmailed into rescuing a hostage president from the prison of New York City.  Plissken is a walking ball of anger and a survival machine. He fought for his country but had everything taken from him so he started taking back.  Now he has to rescue a man he doesn't care about if only to survive long enough to take his revenge on Hauk and the government.John Carpenter's film is a masterpiece of dark humor suspense and great characters.  The film channels the anger and distrust of the postVietnamWatergate era as well as the thencurrent Iranian Hostage crisis.  Plissken represents in a fashion the Vietnam vets who did their job even if they didn't agree with or understand their war but came back to nothing.  The film's novelization explores these themes better than the movie but it is hinted at in Hauk's briefing.  It also depicts a fascist police state one that some would say is not too far from reality.Kurt Russell is excellent in what was a breakout performance for him.  Up to this point Russell had been stuck in low budget comedies following the end of his Disney days.  This performance coupled with another collaboration with Carpenter Elvis led to bigger and better roles.  Russell channels Clint Eastwood to give Snake a menacing if laconic quality.  Much like a real serpent Snake watches and strikes when he is ready with speed and impact. Russell is able to say a lot with little dialogue through his body language and facial expressions.The supporting cast is wonderful.  Adrienne Barbeau is the beautiful but deadly Maggie.  She is partnered with the intelligent but slimy Brain. Their's is a symbiotic relationship each provides something the other needs.  Harry Dean Stanton a great character actor presents a Brain that is smart but ruthless and more than a bit cowardly. Isaac Hayes is The Duke ruler of the prison.  Hayes is a bit uneven as he wasn't an experienced actor he had at least one movie before this but he is a charismatic performer and ultracool.  Donald Pleasance is the consummate politician a big man in his controlled environment but lost in a world outside his one he had a hand in creating. Ernest Borgnine is tremendous as Cabby the answer man and link between Snake and the rest of the cast as well as to the past of New York.

The difference is Snake rebelled against the system that betrayed him Hauk joined it.  This was Van Cleef's last good role before he was saddled with mediocrity in his tv series the Master and became the butt of jokes on MST3K.The film moves at a brisk pace and the dark lighting carries the sense of mystery isolation and destruction.  Carpenter is able to convincingly hide the fact that he shot this film in St. Louis and LA and make you believe it is New York.  Although there are gaps in logic and missing information the pace doesn't let you dwell on it.  There is a constant feeling of the race against time.  If there is any complaint it's that the budget sometimes holds back some of the action but characterization makes up for it. Also the dark lighting is sometimes too dark and details are obscured.The new special edition dvd brings a treat to longtime fans  the deleted opening bank robbery and capture of Snake Plissken.  Since I had read the novelization before seeing the film I had long wondered what this sequence had looked like.  Although it does explain why Plissken is on his way to the prison when Hauk intercepts him it doesn't really work in context with the rest of the film.  The sequence worked well in the book because of Snake's inner monologue and memories of his mission in Leningrad and the loss of his parents to government action.  We understand Snake's hatred of the government and his nihilistic nature.  In the sequence as shot we don't really get a sense of who Plissken is just that he has apparently committed a crime and is on the run.  We don't really get a feel for his relationship with his partner which affects the emotional impact at the end of the sequence.  Ultimately the film works better without this footage.A note on the commentary track  Ox Baker was not seven feet tall.  He is probably closer to the 6'6 to 6'7 range although he was over 300 pounds. His bulk makes him appear larger than he really is especially in a wrestling ring.One used to wonder what this film would have looked like with a bigger budget.  Carpenter sort of answered that with the sequel Escape from LA. It was essentially the same film with better effects and a West Coast sensibility but it doesn't hold a candle to the original.  The lower budget caused the cast and crew to be more creative and they succeeded far better here.  It would be good to see Snake again but in a new environment with a different plot.  Russell's age could be an asset as Carpenter could examine an older Snake who must rely more on cunning than physical skills.".

	onyx:emotionText "Snake Plissken is the classic antihero ala Clint Eastwood's Manwithnoname.  Plissken is an exsoldier turned criminal recruitedblackmailed into rescuing a hostage president from the prison of New York City.  Plissken is a walking ball of anger and a survival machine. He fought for his country but had everything taken from him so he started taking back.  Now he has to rescue a man he doesn't care about if only to survive long enough to take his revenge on Hauk and the government.John Carpenter's film is a masterpiece of dark humor suspense and great characters.  The film channels the anger and distrust of the postVietnamWatergate era as well as the thencurrent Iranian Hostage crisis.  Plissken represents in a fashion the Vietnam vets who did their job even if they didn't agree with or understand their war but came back to nothing.  The film's novelization explores these themes better than the movie but it is hinted at in Hauk's briefing.  It also depicts a fascist police state one that some would say is not too far from reality.Kurt Russell is excellent in what was a breakout performance for him.  Up to this point Russell had been stuck in low budget comedies following the end of his Disney days.  This performance coupled with another collaboration with Carpenter Elvis led to bigger and better roles.  Russell channels Clint Eastwood to give Snake a menacing if laconic quality.  Much like a real serpent Snake watches and strikes when he is ready with speed and impact. Russell is able to say a lot with little dialogue through his body language and facial expressions.The supporting cast is wonderful.  Adrienne Barbeau is the beautiful but deadly Maggie.  She is partnered with the intelligent but slimy Brain. Their's is a symbiotic relationship each provides something the other needs.  Harry Dean Stanton a great character actor presents a Brain that is smart but ruthless and more than a bit cowardly. Isaac Hayes is The Duke ruler of the prison.  Hayes is a bit uneven as he wasn't an experienced actor he had at least one movie before this but he is a charismatic performer and ultracool.

	schema:reviewBody "Escape from New York is a 1981 American dystopian action film cowritten coscored and directed by John Carpenter.A classic film. Escape From New York 1981 Is also one of my personal favorite classic Action SciFi John Carpenter movies. It was also the first movie I ever saw from John Carpenter as a child and It I still the best movie in my opinion. I love this movie to death I own it on Bluray tough it doesn't have great video quality like it should have I still love it to death. Kurt Russell is Snake Plissken period! Also Lee Van Cleef Is also in it from a Few Dollars More and The Good The Bad and The Ugly I just love those Western movies to death. Adrienne Barbeau from The Fog is also in it and she is the beautiful but deadly Maggie.The plot is set more in the future American by the late 90's. In 1997 when the US President crashes into Manhattan now a giant maximum security prison a convicted bank robber is sent in for a rescue. In a world ravaged by crime the entire island of Manhattan has been converted into a prison which houses the world's most brutal inmates. And when the President of the United States crash lands inside only one man can bring him back Snake Plissken a notorious outlaw and former Special Forces war hero who in exchange for a full pardon descends into the decayed city and wages a blistering war against the captors. But time is short in 24 hours an explosive charge planted inside Snake's body will end the mission  and his life  unless he succeeds.You've got Kurt Russell wearing a freaking eye patch and toting a massive assault rifle squatting in the middle of a fire. You know just taking it easy popping a squat while the city burns around him. Nonplussed. Chillaxed. In the background Lady Liberty's decapitated head lies in the middle of the street her coppergreen eyes staring vacantly up into a crowded offkilter skyline. What the hell happened I wondered. I'd have to wait for Cloverfield to find out because as it turns out that nifty piece of poster artwhile summing up the film's nothing is sacred attitude and permanently establishing Kurt Russell as an icon of badass  has no relation to the film's plot. When I finally managed to see the movie I kept waiting for Lady Liberty's head to get blown off but it never happened. I was a little disappointed. And in a way that's still how I feel about Escape From New York. The premise is a nearperfect action movie setup and the world that John Carpenter creates has so much potential for edgeof yourseat storytelling but the end result doesn't fully deliver on its promise. But that's not to say that it doesn't have its moments of undiluted awesomeness. Long proclaimed as an action film cult classic there's surprisingly little action in Escape From New York at least not of the Michael Bay in your face two explosions per minute variety the kind to which today's Rockstarinfused audiences are acclimated. Watching the film now nearly thirty years after it hit theaters in 1981 EFNY seems curiously slowpaced. Snake limps through the city occasionally bopping a guy in the face occasionally busting a cap.The film is John Carpenter best work I have seen there are some other films I don't like Escape From New York 1981 is one of the best cult classic films from John carpenter and Kurt Russell. Kurt Russell's iconic character of all time Snake Plissken is his best roles of all time on the screen I have ever seen. I also love the sequel to death the same as I love this film. Snake Plissken is an exsoldier turned criminal recruitedblackmailed into rescuing a hostage president from the prison of New York City. Lee Van Cleef as Bob Hauk New York Police Commissioner did a great job portraying one of the most memorable characters. I wish he would return in the sequel but he couldn't because 8.later the actor died. Rest in peace Lee.I love main theme music from John Carpenter and Alan Howarth and I enjoy some action scenes performed from Kurt Russell in the film.I love this film to death and It is my favorite action science fiction flick of all time I love it. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "On his way to an important conference that will determine the fate of  America Air Force One is crashed into Manhattan island  leaving the  President and vital information trapped within the single largest  prison in the world. With very little time and no way to mount a full  on attack Chief Hauk forces the newly captured exwar hero Snake  Plisskin to launch a covert rescue mission  adding the extra incentive  of timed bombs implanted in his body. Snake with little other choice  accepts the mission to save his own neck literally.  If the remake had any value hopefully it's value was in bringing a new  audience to the original film and watching it for the first time. The  film opens with that very distinctive electronic theme music that gives  it such a cool feel from the very getgo. This is followed up by a great  rough energy as we are introduced to this future which is now the  past!. This story continues quite well but once all the main players  have been introduced the film falls back on the expected series of  'running away' and fighting. This is not to say that it still isn't  quite fun and cool because it is.  The effects music and even the use of tapes make this film feel very  old and dated but it actually goes hand in hand with the very rough  feel that Carpenter gave to several of his films at the time whether  deliberately or budget influenced I don't know. The plot is full of  silly moments and sheer gaps in logic but if you buy into the mood of  the film you can get by these and enjoy it  though I define you to  call this a 'great' film maybe good.  The casting of Kurt Russell is a major thing. He is iconicly cool and  his performance and his character are the two main things that have  kept this film well known down the years. He looks tough and talks  tough and is a great homage to the Clint Eastwood character from the  old westerns a fact made clearer in the sequel. Cleef is a good foil  for him as he is tough too but lacks screen time for the majority. It is  very clear what Barbeau brings to the party  and the costume selected  for her makes no secret of it! I am a man and I'm not proud of it but  she is very easy on the eye here  just a shame that that's all I  remember about her performance. Borgnine and Stanton are both good and  along with Hayes all serve to increase the cult appeal of the film to  this day.  Overall this is a cult film that looks cheap has dated effects and a  plot that starts to crumble after the first half. However it is cool  fun with some great tough dialogue. However beyond all this it is the  iconic character of Snake and the great performance from Russell that  will mean that this film continues to get cool points with new  audiences.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nearly 25 years and an endless amount of viewings later John Carpenter's Escape from NY still ranks high among the chosen few quintessential cult films of the 80's. This is simply put one of the coolest productions ever with legendary characters ingenious plot and pitchblack humor. Kurt Russell with eye patch and nihilistic 'youdon'tlikeitgotohell' attitude plays the role of his life as antihero Snake Plissken recruited by his authoritynemesis Bob Hauk to bring back the American president who crashed with his plane in New York. One problem though ever since crime rose with 400 in 1987 New York has become one giant and demarcated prison where criminals determine their own civilization. Offered no other choice Snake infiltrates NY for his mission and for a personal race against the clock. Especially the first sixty minutes of this movie are terrific since there constantly is the introduction of new and imaginative characters. ClassA actors play all these utterly cool characters which makes it even more memorable! Apart from Kurt Russell Escape from New York also stars icons like Lee Van Cleef The Good the Bad and the Ugly Isaac Hayes Truck Turner Donald Pleasance Halloween and Harry Dean Stanton Repo Man. Even the smaller supportive roles are well distributed with the underrated Tom Atkins as Van Cleef's sidekick and Adrienne Barbeau in a very sexy part. The downfall of America's number one city is atmospherically portrayed and Carpenter's own music score creates an excellent mood of despair. The action sequences are impressively photographed and John Capenter professionally camouflages that his film is in fact and independent production. My only slightly negative remark is that the story should have had a better more explosive climax. Particularly because the first hour is so great the ending seems quite tame. But what the hell this movie is a must for every film lover! In 1996 Carpenter also made Escape from L.A. and even though it's good entertainment it can't compete with NY.".

Offered no other choice Snake infiltrates NY for his mission and for a personal race against the clock. Especially the first sixty minutes of this movie are terrific since there constantly is the introduction of new and imaginative characters. ClassA actors play all these utterly cool characters which makes it even more memorable! Apart from Kurt Russell Escape from New York also stars icons like Lee Van Cleef The Good the Bad and the Ugly Isaac Hayes Truck Turner Donald Pleasance Halloween and Harry Dean Stanton Repo Man. Even the smaller supportive roles are well distributed with the underrated Tom Atkins as Van Cleef's sidekick and Adrienne Barbeau in a very sexy part. The downfall of America's number one city is atmospherically portrayed and Carpenter's own music score creates an excellent mood of despair. The action sequences are impressively photographed and John Capenter professionally camouflages that his film is in fact and independent production. My only slightly negative remark is that the story should have had a better more explosive climax. Particularly because the first hour is so great the ending seems quite tame. But what the hell this movie is a must for every film lover! In 1996 Carpenter also made Escape from L.A. and even though it's good entertainment it can't compete with NY.";

To insure the clever criminal does not take the opportunity to escape he is given a lethal injection which can only be removed by the commissioner's medical staff. Thus begins a timely drama which means life or death for the hero the president and ultimately the world. The success of this film owes much to the film's other characters like the talkative Cabbie Ernest Borgnine terrific acting Harold ' Brain' Helman Harry Dean Stanton his 'squeeze' Maggie Adrienne Barbeau and Isaac Hayes who plays the heavy The Duke of New York.

Kurt Russell became famous for his Snake Plissken and rightfully so although the character seems to be only a more gritty version of Napoeleon Wilson in Assault.  What makes this film the cult classic it is is Carpenter's very apocalyptic and brash story. This is a very dark film and it holds up especially well today when shown against the countless fluff films that Hollywood seems to be churning out.Carpenter made the most out of his meeger budget and created a very convincing New York City.  Not only is the set design fantastic but so are the typically strong performances.  Russell Hayes Barbeau Pleasence Stanton Atkins Cyphers and Borgnine are all cult legends and seeing them all work together makes Robert Altman's casts look feeble in comparison.What limits this film from greatness is surprisingly lax direction by Carpenter.  The film is not as tight as it should have been and really fails to generate any sort of suspense during the action.  Deaths just happen out of nowhere with little to no build up which is a shame.  This movie could have really been amazing.  The ending is perfect though and easily makes up for the film's faults.  See it for Kurt Russell and the great ending and you will come away a happy viewer.  Watch Escape From LA though to see what this movie should have been.".

For movie fans there are plenty of reasons to watch ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK as it's not all that bad. The first third of the film is rather good but the rest just lacks in momentum and comes across as limp and lifeless.Kurt Russell as the hero is extremely wooden even if he does look very tough with his eye patch and bulging muscles. It's a toss up between this and SOLDIER as to which was his most wooden role. The rest of the cast is exemplary what a wonderful cast wasted in a soso film. Mixing such oldname stars as Ernest Borgnine and Lee Van Cleef with more recent familiar faces like Harry Dean Stanton and Isaac Hayes the whole cast really is something to die for. But...while Van Cleef is good as the chief guard Borgnine is fairly annoying as a jovial taxi driver. Stanton is given little to do apart from walk around in a white coat and look moody while the sole purpose for Adrienne Barbeau to be in the film is to wear a lowcut dress. Isaac Hayes is a charismatic but notatall fearsome villain and Donald Pleasence is hopelessly miscast as the president although he gives a nicely layered performance sympathetic and unlikeable at the same time.The action sequences when they come are fairly exciting but not memorable. The best bit is in the opening where Russell is chased by a gang of mutants this brings to mind Carpenter's earlier ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 with the grubby locations and faceless rabble of murderers in this case cannibals. As a plus the film does offer some excellent set design with streets full of broken cars rubbish etc. This kind of barren wasteland inhabited by mutants was the basis for many later ripoffs and cashins especially by the Italians. The only sad thing is that while ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK could have been something brilliant it's average at best due to a lack of ideas and originality. Not one to go out of your way for.".

There are other scifi cult films from this period that translate well to modern day ie Road Warrior also from 81' this one does not IMO. Carpenter had a solid premise but it gets lost with a insufficient budget and bad acting. I cant understand why Snake became such a iconic character off this movie alone. I have not seen Escape from LA as of yet but it would have to really be great to make up for the lackluster EFNY.".

Why on earth he didn't opt for higher budgets is anyone's guess because Escape from New York squanders a brilliant premise on shortages of budget imagination and action. Kurt Russell impersonates Clint Eastwood as Snake Plissken a convicted criminal who is sent into New York in 1997 which is now America's one and only maximum security prison to rescue the President Pleasence whose plane has crashed. The film plays like a futuristic western with Lee Van Cleef overseeing the operation from the control room making the film's roots in Sergio Leone apparent. To be fair to Carpenter he manages a lot on the 6 million budget a great dark look to the film a panoramic cityscape good special effects impressive sets a couple of effective action sequences a script laced with black humour as well a great main theme. As a whole these elements make the film reasonably enjoyable. However it simply isn't enough. The film never fulfils its ingenious premise by not making use of Snake's time limit to complete the mission until the very end and as a result it spends a long time just not going anywhere. There's not enough action and the bad guys are a bunch of lacklustre convicts lead by Isaac Hayes. Carpenter fans may lap it up as Bmovie hokum but for the rest of us this should have been a serious slice of action cinema. 510".

Kurt Russell made himself into a macho movie star by putting a patch over his eye and playing Snake Plissken. His job is to get into New York City which in the distant year of 1997 was turned into a maximum security prison and rescue the President of the U.S. who had crashed there.The whole atmosphere of this is sleazy except for one character a cab driver played by Ernest Borgnine. Adrienne Barbeau is in here strictly to be eye candy. The grungy characters even included the President of the United States in a very unrealistic portrayal by Donald Pleasance.This was somewhat cool when it came out but the specialeffects are so bad the film is laughable right now. It almost looks a like a B scifi film from the '50s. The Manhattan skyline is a cardboard cutout! Oh well the story is still very interesting so if you can overlook things it's still an enjoyable 99 minutes.".

	schema:headline " One of the better action movies ever";
	schema:reviewBody "Normally I'm not too much a fan of action movies and John Carpenter has never been on my list of favorite directors. In my opinion he only made one good movie except for this one of course and that's Halloween. But as I already said before even though I'm normally not a fan of this kind of movies or of the man's work I must say that I'm glad to make an exception when it comes to this movie. Escape from New York may well be seen as one of the better action movies of all times and even after 25 years it still gives me a good time when watching it.Due to huge crime rates in 1997 the US government has changed New York into a maximum security prison where the toughest criminals are put away for life. All the bridges have been mined a huge wall has been built around the city and a large police force army is stationed near the statue of liberty. Inside this prison it's the survival of the fittest. There are no rules or regulations except for those made up by the prisoners themselves making this one of the most dangerous places to be in. When Air Force One with the President on board is taken over by a terrorist and crashed into a building the President is able to escape by ejecting in a pod. But he has landed in the middle of New York and someone needs to get him out of there soon. That's where Snake Plissken comes in. He's an exsoldier and a new prisoner who is asked to save the President and to find a tape with some important information. In return his sentence will be canceled and Plissken will be a free man again. He agrees but to make sure that he will return on time they inject him with a small but powerful explosive that will only be destroyed if his mission is successful. So now he does not only have to take care of the President and try to stay alive in between all those criminals he also has a lot of time pressure...I must say that this movie reminded me a lot of the Australian Mad Maxmovies especially the second one. In case you are wondering if that is a good or a bad thing I liked those movies and yes I like this one as well. Despite the fact that it was made in 1981 this movie still feels quite futuristic. OK we know that 1997 wasn't like this but that doesn't really matter this time. If they had set the date to 2097 this would still have been the same movie and then we wouldn't have know that this was impossible. And the fact that some details show the real age of the movie isn't a bad thing either. Take for instance the computers. They used a lot of flashing lights and stuff like that but those are only some small details which shouldn't spoil your fun. The acting in this movie is OK as well. This may well have been one of Kurt Russell's best performances and I really loved Ernest Borgnine as Cabbie. I even appreciated Lee Van Cleef in this movie despite the fact that I'm normally not a fan of the man. I guess I must say that all actors did a good job. As a conclusion I would like to say that a good and still futuristic looking story some good acting several interesting action scenes... make this movie more than just worth a watch. I really like it and that's why I give it a 710.".

It is amazing how this movie has not aged and even after watching it so many times I do not get tired of it. Kurt Russell has a fantastic shape and is perfect in the role of the tough Snake Plissken. The president dressed with blonde wig and with cosmetics and his rage in the end against The Duke seems to indicate that something else had happened to him besides losing his thumb. The movie has a dream cast and also a wonderful music score. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Fuga de Nova York Escape from New YorkNote On 01122017 I saw this film again.".

Russell's macho swagger and ruthless attitude defines Snake perfectly. Van Cleef clever and calm could have called his part in over a cell phone. Pleasence to me is an odd choice to play the leader of the free world.Visually watching the hero land a glider on top of the World Trade Center is now pretty awesome in the light of what has recently happenedSeptember 11 2001. Ernest Borgnine has a notable but small role as the energetic cab driver. Look out for Issac Hayes...The Duke of New York. Adrienne Barbeau and Season Hubley are little more than decoration.

The pace is fast the gags are constant and you will really understand why Mexican audiences flocked to see Cantnflas films for so many years when you see this movie.

As the only American inmate in the infamous El Pueblito Mexican prison which resembles more of a small village of convicts rather than a usual prison the driver quickly gets the nickname The Gringo and finds out first hand how rough it is to be a stranger in the perilous world of Javi the ruthless crime lord who runs the prison. Sooner or later the Gringo will form an alliance with a 10yearold kid whose peculiar immunity in this mad place will efficiently keep him alive only to realise that in this pit everyone knows about the 2 million.

	schema:reviewBody "It is no secret that the public has lost a lot of respect for Mel Gibson over the years. His hatefilled rants that once scattered the internet like littered candywrappers identifiable aging and modest releases over the years have proved that he may be wandering around a plain of confusion and uncertainty. It is a shame his new film Get the Gringo has gotten such a limited release playing exclusively on DirecTV before eventually getting a wider VOD and DVD release later this year.This is by no means a great film but it holds up a lot better than recent action films boasting a huge actor has the lead Taken is the prime example here and packs in half the amount of incredulity as those as well. The story is concise and wellmanaged centering around a nameless man in the credits he's referred to as Driver played by Mel Gibson. He is a career criminal with a vague history an extensive amount of sarcasm and a classic form of mystery plagues his character. After being nabbed by the Mexican authorities he is thrown in a rotten slimy prison corrupt and dilapidated as well as being run by shameless thugs and the occasional prostitute.At first Driver takes on the prison lifestyle with an iron fist. He becomes fearless setting a fire in a market so he can steal a drug dealer's money and even one of the best scenes in the film involves him knocking a man on a toilet unconscious before stealing his money and weaponry. He then learns that in order to move up on the prison ladder he can't always be committing thievery and pursing the life of a determined rebel. That's where a nine year old watchmen comes in Hernandez. As he assists Driver in teaching him the prison life it isn't long before both of them become mixed up in a whirlwind of the same corruption ruining the prison today.The cinematography and the overall environment deserves immediate commendable recognition. It makes a seamy place out to be seamy and doesn't take the route of The Hangover Part II where it transforms a place into something so glum and ugly that it can't be enjoyed. Get the Gringo exists in a dirty gritty world and it wants to show it all.Again Gibson carries the film much like he did in Jodie Foster's subpar The Beaver. Gibson resorts back to the sort of grittiness that he erected his odyssey of a career on a man with no history in a dirty filthy world where the only role you can play to have respect is the bad cop. He is wonderful here and manages to inspire a number of intriguing scenes that rarely become too comical or too unrealistic. There are many shootouts but they are sometimes fun to watch. Even the car chase in the beginning is a riot.It's a shame that Get the Gringo gets a sour run theatrically debuting only one night in Austin and a very secluded run on a Video on Demand service. This film is fun nonchallenging escapism that pleases because of its simplicity and action. After the mild success of Gibson's Edge of Darkness and the very underwhelming The Beaver studios believe Mel Gibson is poison to the system. Perhaps but let me remind you guys something he made The Passion of the Christ  one of the most controversial and daring religious pictures in history. I believe the guy deserves more respect.Starring Mel Gibson and Kevin Hernandez. Directed by Adrian Grunberg.".

I'd also like to congrats Mr. Gibson that he never did anything plastic not even Botox injections on his old face yet every wrinkle every line only makes him an even greater performer. what a treat! thank you Mr. Gibson stay cool.".

Mel Gibson does a really fine job in the lead role and is utterly believable as a tough clever crook who's hard heart is moved by the plight of a mother and child threatened by powerful foes. Really great too to see the female lead played by someone who looks like a normal person rather than some ridiculous supermodel. It helps the female viewer empathise with the character so much more. The film is quite violent though  be prepared. I spent part of the film with my hand over my eyes but my bloodthirsty partner loved it.Definitely worth paying to see this at the cinema  you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Gibson Raises Melhem in Mexico!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Mel Gibson is back in top form as a gimleteyed career criminal in freshman director Adrian Grunberg's Get the Gringo a gritty gory hardboiled crime thriller set inside a corrupt Mexican prison where anything goes. Good movies don't dawdle and rarely does this bulletriddled shoot'em up about life behind bars telegraph its next move. Any prison where an inmate's family can move in with him while he serves time is pretty unusual. The prison resembles something out of a bloodthirsty Robert Rodriguez actioneer. Men come and go with loaded weapons in plain sight. You can even shell out bucks for a shot of heroin administered by needle in a grungy shop. Everything in this replica of Tijuana's El Pueblito has a price. You can buy anything asserts one character except your way out. As an anonymous convict Gibson provides the kind of voiceover we usually hear in a loquacious Martin Scorsese film. Gibson's sarcastic commentary about the prison with its unusual routines and procedures highlights the surreal nature of the squalid setting.You never really know for certain where things are heading in this violent amoral tongueincheek 95minute melodrama. Get the Gringo opens with Driver Mel Gibson of Payback and his mortally wounded partner in clown costumes careening down a highway with the cops in close pursuit. Anybody who has seen Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs might find this opening rather familiar but the resemblance ends quickly. Desperately Driver plows his car through the border fence and Mexican police arrest him. The Texas police try to persuade the Mexicans to remand him into their custody. One glance at two duffel bags bulging with millions in cash prompts the Mexicans to keep Driver on their side of the line. Once Driver lands in the big house he gets chummy with a 10yearold kid Kevin Hernandez of The Sitter who is plotting to exact revenge on another criminal Javi Daniel Gimenez Cacho of Cronos who killed his father. The 10year old's mother and father were incarcerated for selling narcotics. Initially Driver uses cigarettes to bribe the youngster into silence. You see the urchin saw Driver rob a fat slimy heroin dealer after he set a fire to create a distraction.Before long Driver's nemesis Frank Peter Stormare of The Million Dollar Hotel dispatches professional killers to ferret out the millions that Driver stole. They track down the crooked cops who arrested Driver and start amputating toes to loosen tongues. Meantime Driver struggles inside the prison to gain Javi's confidence and engineer a deal so he can get out return to America and plug Frank. Driver has no respect for anybody but himself and he abhors Javi with a passion after he learns why the prison kingpin has singled out the 10year old for preferential treatment. As it turns out the youth has a liver compatible with Javi's blood type and Javi needs a fresh liver. Javi hires a surgeon Patrick Bauchau of A View to a Kill to harvest the youngster's liver and transplant it into his body. Interestingly Get the Gringo could be compared to the silent Charles Chaplin comedy The Kid because an adult sets out to help a less fortunate child. Indeed aside from the urchin who befriends him Gibson is as virtuous as Saint Peter compared with the murderous malcontents who populate the prison. The suspense mounts as Driver plans to kill Frank and get back to the prison in time to save the child.At one point three gunmen stroll into the prison and try to ice Driver. When the gunfire erupts they hit everybody but Driver. Bodies litter the premises. The Warden Fernando Becerril of Ravenous informs Javi that the government plans to shut them down as a consequence of the gunfight. Of course the whole point to any prison picture is how the hero manages to escape. Happily Gibson survives with everything intact while the treacherous villains bite the dust. Grunberg orchestrates several chaotic shootouts and Gibson is by no means a typical convict. When they fingerprint him Mexican authorities discover that he has burned off his fingerprints. Everybody is out to take advantage of Driver including some greedy Americans. Nevertheless agileminded Driver turns the tables on everybody.Blackout production designer Bernardo Trujillo has performed miracles with the closed down Veracruz prison where the film was lensed on location. Grunberg and he have managed to recreate a world teeming with the dredges of humanity a microcosm of Hell where men degenerate into brutish savages and display no qualms about killing each other. Basically what you've got is Darwin's survival of the fittest in the worst place on Earth. Nevertheless this miserable hell hole turns out to be a paradise ripe for the plucking for the cynical Driver. Although Gibson qualifies as the hero he is very antiheroic. He makes no apologies about being on the wrong side of the law. He admits that he tried to kill his worthless father and that put him in prison the first time.Initially Get the Gringo was entitled How I Spent My Summer Vacation. At least the latter title has some irony but Get the Gringo gets to the point quicker and summarizes the action. Director Adrian Grunberg gives a good account of himself. The prison setting looks thoroughly authentic and Grunberg relies on Mexican music to evoke the culture. Fans of Mel Gibson who haven't seen him in a gripping action thriller since his Lethal Weapon days won't feel like they have been shortchanged. Gibson has done nothing like Get the Gringo and no Hollywood epic has depicted life behind bars as Get the Gringo. Life below the border has never been presented so pungently unless you've seen something comparable like Luis Buuel's 1950 crime movie The Young and the Damned. Incidentally although this film showing in theaters in the rest of the world Get the Gringo is available in America only as a videoondemand through Direct TV.".

	schema:headline " A good piece of entertainment with Mel Gibson at his best";
	schema:reviewBody "Mel Gibson has had a bit of controversy in his career and went off the radar for a few years. Between 20032004 and 2010 he didn't make too much noise. In 2010 he return to cinema with Edge of Darkness and in 2011 starred in The Beaver. Now he's back with the 2012 release Get the Gringo. Hit or miss?First off this is Mel Gibson. A hardened Hollywood veteran who have given us many a great moment on the big screen. With Get the Gringo we not only get Gibson in a starring role he also is credited with the screenplay along with Adrian Grunberg and Stacy Perskie none of whom are new to the world of cinema. Adrian Grunberg also directs this movie and does a good job at it as well.The story is that Gibson a career criminal gets into a bit of a pickle. He finds himself thrown into a Mexican prison left to fend for himself. Not only does he need to keep himself alive on the inside the prison walls he also needs to protect himself from forces on the outside. He makes friends with a rather odd sidekick a ten year old boy who has a few tricks up his sleeve.This is not your runofthemill action movie. The dirtiness sweat grime filth and corruption is vividly shown. The environments are very believable at least to one who have never spent any time in a Mexican prison and the daily life inside the walls of this particular Tijuana establishment is shown for what is is  a harsh living for both inmates and their families. Still they portray it with a healthy dose of joie de vivre.You won't find any perfectly made up Hollywood starlets in Get the Gringo. You will however find a Mel Gibson in the same prime as when he played Martin Riggs in the Leathal Weaponmovies. His character whos name we never truly learn has the same type mischievous attitude and street smart  a style well becoming of Mel Gibson. Costars Kevin Hernandez the boy and Dolores Heredia the mother do a good job at wining the sympathy of the audience. Peter Stormare also has a role in the movie playing less of a whacky role than we are used to.Aside from good acting you'll find this is a movie with a few quite gruesome scenes. It's not a movie to be watched with your ten year old child it's rated R in the USA and minimum ages 1418 in many countries  and rightfully so. Thrown into the mixed bag of laughter and general action are scenes of torture and very graphic violence.The great selling points of Get the Gringo are as I see it two things. One is a Mel Gibson in great shape. He delivers a good performance and shows us that he still has what it takes. The other is the general feel of the movie. The camera work the way we get to experience the prison and the persons in it. All in all an hour and a half of good entertainment.Rating  710".

His last movie The Beaver was outstanding and really was in unison with his personal meltdown. This movie while not as good as that one still has some similarities to his life. This is about a man trapped and trying to not only help himself to straighten out but also realizing that helping others is just a fulfilling. I may be reading too much into this and it may be just me though. The only down side is that after a string of great movies like Edge Of Darkness and The Beaver this one isn't quite that caliber. This is a good and entertaining movie though just not at that level. Overall a movie that has the feel of an Oliver Stone type movie that is fun to watch and is entertaining as well as violent.

Certainly the most honest. For that it gets 910.Some gruesome violence but no TA or other sexuality.";

	schema:reviewBody "There's been a great deal said about Mel Gibson over the past few years and much of it has been disparaging to say the least. Unfortunately many critics and cinemagoers seem unable or perhaps unwilling to separate salacious gossip about Gibson's personal life from his quality as an actor and the strength of his films. Consequently The Beaver divided opinion last year and barely made a splash at the box office and Get The Gringo released in the UK as How I Spent My Summer Vacation has similarly slipped under the surface with barely a ripple.In both cases it's a great pity and whilst I'm sure it will have dented Gibson's pride and bankability as far as the studios and investors are concerned the real loss is yours. With The Beaver you missed a quirky treat with Get The Gringo you've missed a summer action delight. Thank goodness for DVDs! For those who saw the trailer it is almost entirely the opening scene of Get The Gringo and is a stomping good start. Driver Gibson is a criminal on the run from the American cops and heading to the Mexican border with his soontobedead fellow crook. Driver may be the criminal here but he evades one group of bent cops only to fall into the hands of another and winds up in the notorious El Pueblito where corruption exceeds that of either America's or Mexico's police forces. Tightlipped about the origin of the huge stash of cash in his car Driver quickly sizes up the situation in jail and makes plans that quickly become influenced by a young boy known simply as 'Kid' and his mother Kid's Mother according to the credits both of whom live in the prison and have their own fears and problems to contend with.Don't be concerned by Driver's voiceover across the opening scenes it quickly ends and evolves rapidly into the finest prison flick since The Shawshank Redemption though an entirely different filmic beast.It's a thoroughly entertaining romp where we cheer for the crook who though far from honest is a much better bet than anyone else around. Get The Gringo is fun at times funny throws in a few grimaces and is packed with action that while not up to the pace or jawdropping fluidity of The Raid is nonetheless absorbing engaging and the most fun I've had in front of the big screen this week.Kevin Hernandez gives a creditable performance as the boy who is both dignified and canny a born survivor while Delores Heredia is sensitive as his determined mum and succeeds in being warm and an obvious potential loveinterest without slipping into damselindistress mode. There isn't a weak link amongst the supporting cast most of whom are unknown to audiences north of the Mexican border and across the Atlantic but there are a few moments of 'Isn't he the bloke from?' although both Bob Gunton and Peter Stormare should be familiar to most.Naturally the star and standout performance is from Gibson in a grittier older weathered and more cunning version of Lethal Weapon's Riggs. He's effortless in his movement and delivery he's the ultimate rascal the bastard brother of Daniel Craig's Bond and the guy you absolutely want on your side if you ever end up in a deeply unpleasant Mexican jail.How bad can it be? Early on while wandering through the black market traders in the shadows Driver asks Is this a prison of the world's shttest mall? And if that doesn't make the point when the warden welcomes his new inmates with a resigned God bless you you know it's not going to be a fun home for the duration of your sentence.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Get the Gringo";
	schema:reviewBody "Mel Gibson's return to the big screen in front of the camera recent years seems to be getting back on track. He's taken a large knock for various well publicized and controversial allegations and abuses but those seem to have taken a back seat like how the lacklustre Edge of Darkness has been largely forgotten for more memorable fare and smaller films like The Beaver and Get the Gringo also known as How I Spend My Summer Vacation here. Count yourselves lucky all you Mel Gibson fans who are still out there we're one of the few countries getting this in the cinemas as the USA had opted for a videoondemand release instead.Gibson does what Gibson does best as a character here being the strong silent type who relies on his brains brawn and resourcefulness to get out of sticky situations. Innate abilities and a huge dose of luck also play their part in having his nameless Driver attempting to outwit outlast and outsmart his way past Mexican and American gangsters crooked cops and ambiguous agents in order to regain his freedom after being locked up in a Mexican penitentiary that is a minitown in its own right complete with the folks from both sides of the law making strange bedfellows. It's a glimpse into the murky world of corruption where criminals run rampant within the walls that are supposed to restrict their freedom but instead turning the premises into fiefs of operations.Based on a story written by Mel Gibson Stacy Perskie and Adrian Grunberg with the latter making his debut directorial feature after deputizing for numerous films it has all the ingredients necessary to stand tall amongst this season of summer blockbusters with a tale that keeps you guessing of the Driver's backgrounds and motivations which soon dissolve into the basic theme of friendship developed with a nine year old Kid Kevin Hernandez who holds a certain secret that keeps him alive within a notorious place and who may just be Driver's ticket out if the cards get played right. Needless to say the villains here were unfortunately relegated to single function caricatures but thankfully the plot picks up the pace when we get to witness how Driver and the Kid work their way through the system with subplots bubbling under the surface ready to explode in frantic rush to the finale.There are some moments that sag though as Grunberg just cannot lift the film's early act from droning rather repetitively on how tough and gritty the entire corrupt environment is through Driver's voiceovers. We get the point and it's time to move on only to find more scenes seemingly adamant in wanting to showcase just how miserable life can get in a corrupt prison system. It took a while to have elements set up and put in place although you'd get to appreciate the efforts it took to gel all character relationships together with Grunberg adopting a style especially in the beginning with its quick edits cutting very close to how Tony Scott would have stylistically done it if the latter was at the helm.For all the action that the trailer promises what truly stood out was a mid section free for all shootemup complete with its graphical depiction of bullet wounds flying all around entering and exiting various points of the body and the requisite slow motion to keep things watchable not forgetting having the Driver break his cover on his background having to save the Kid and his mother Dolores Heredia from gunfire coming at all sides. While conveniently set up how the Driver wiped his enemies from existence thanks to a little bit of play acting and impersonation became my favourite scenes in the entire film with Gibson at his element flexing some comedic abilities that just sat through really well and dare I say lifted this film from being just average. Recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Get the Gringo. Strange title. Hasn't been released in Australia or America I'm glad I got the chance to watch this movie. Right from the start the movie kicks off with a good ol' car chase. The chase scene is quite fun to watch and it results in the capture of Gibson's unnamed character who is then thrown into a prison. Mind you it is not a typical lights out at 10 sorta prison film but rather the prison has its own rules and to be honest there aren't that much rules. For starters the prison houses both males and females adults and children and the inmates can carry guns. Gibson is thrown into the prison and makes friends with a young boy with a knack for smoking. The two then work together to survive the harsh conditions inside the facility.Mel Gibson is back to kicking ass and being cool. No doubt he is the highlight of the show and it is great to watch him being in one of his better roles in recent years. I think it is safe to say that he is better here than he was at 'The Beaver'. But anyway Mel acts very cool and charismatic and his character is very likable. While the film may not star major or wellknown actors they aren't too bad. The kid he teams up with isn't too bad in this film and he is quite an alright kid. Kevin Hernandez has potential to be a great actor. It also stars Dean Norris from Breaking Bad who has a small but appreciated cameo in the film. This is Adrian Grunberg's directorial debut and he pulls of a fun sortof smart and stylish action film.The action in the film is entertaining enough but it is what we have all seen before in numerous other films. The thing I like about it is that it doesn't try to be anything too ambitious or over the top and throughout the film it keeps a constant and steady pace. the film is around 1 and half hour long and while it could have been a bit longer it was very well done.Some of the issues I did have was that some of the Englishlanguage was a bit hard to hear especially from the Mexicans or whoever they were. Some lines were mumbled or a bit too fast and I got annoyed in certain parts. And yes my hearing is fine.Overall it was nice action film to watch that didn't have a dumb story like lots of films today. Gibson has left a mark for people to see that he isn't going to be disappearing anytime soon and that he will still continue amazing us. While the film isn't going to gross much those who do see it will like it.'Over and out.' 13 May 2012".

This movie is really good and an interesting twist on this classic sort of Payback kind of story. It is worth watching just for the Mexican citywithinprison scenes all by itself. It is a solid action film from beginning to end with Gibson really delivering. There are a few scenes of harsh violence but nothing too shocking considering what people are used to today. I was totally blown away by what an amazing surprise this film turned out to be. Highly recommended as an actionadventure flick regardless of what you think of Crazy Mel.".

He gets into trouble with the police and pretty much everyone else with his racist views... then just when everyone has given up on his and starts calling him a has been he whips out a great film like this.The movie is about a criminal called Driver who gets arrested crossing the Mexican border who ends up in a rough prison. But this prison is like no other. Men Women and children are here. It is like a little town. The problem is this town is run by a bunch of ruthless criminals who do not care who they hurt. Driver just wants to get out and get his money from the police officers who arrested him and kept his stolen money. He gets a friend inside the prison who he looks out for... a 10 year old boy.OK so a good movie does not forgive Mel for his actions or his views but if you forget his personal life and just look at his career then the man can act and has made some fantastic movies.This is not one of his best but it proves he still has it in him.The story is very good. I like the idea of a prison where the inmates start up their own little town. Mels character was brilliant. Driver took no trouble from anyone and was not scared of anyone. I loved the way he didn't let anyone stand in his way.The movie might be called in Get the Gringo in parts of the world.The casting was really good. Mel Gibson does a great job as I have said before. I look forward to seeing him in The Expendables 3. I just hope he sorts out his personal issues. Other cast members were Kevin Hernandez Daniel Gimenez Cacho Jesus Ochoa and Dolores Heredia. The whole cast was great... but Kevin Hernandez was brilliant. He played his part so well. It was shocking at first but very well done.The action is good and the movie is a lot of fun.Mel is back and I hope he manages to get his fans back.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Well boys and girls. To the untrained eye it looks as if crime pays doesn't it? But bear in mind for guys with my particular set of karmic couldbe's there was bound to be a bump or two down the road. Ah what the hell. I'm going to enjoy what's left of the summer...For more reviews please like my Facebook pagehttpswww.facebook.compagesOrdinaryPersonMovie Reviews456572047728204?refhl".

The young boy in the movie is very good and it's a relief that there is no childish whining and screaming. The boy Kevin Hernandez is a natural for the part. The supporting cast fit easily into their roles. The director deserves credit for pacing the story and timing the humour appropriately. Get the Gringo is even better the second time around. That's when I caught some of the irony and jokes that I missed the first time around. It takes charisma and a special talent to carry a movie. It's hard to vision anyone else but Mel as the star of Get the Gringo. I urge everyone to view this movie. It's a reminder of why Gibson has endured for so long in the movies.

	schema:headline " Gibson and Grunberg are interested in selling an attitude but with little reasoning. They try their hardest to shock";
	schema:reviewBody "A man known only as Driver Mel Gibson is fleeing in a getaway car from the US Border Patrol. In the back of his car is a haul of several million dollars and his accomplice who is bleeding to death. When Driver crashes in Mexico he is arrested and thrown into the prison 'El Pueblito'. The place has the look of a filthy rough prison but it is also populated with children shops and drug dens. The place is overrun by organized crime meaning that the wealthy and the cunning stand at the top of its hierarchy and the guards are bought. Driver has a military background as a sniper and uses his vision to assess the area. He befriends a ten year old boy Kevin Hernandez who is being targeted by a crime boss because he is the right match for a liver transplant. Driver looks to protect the boy and his mother Dolores Heredia but there are people who are still keen to take back the money that he stole. Get the Gringo is from first time director Adrian Grunberg who was an assistant on Mel Gibson's Apocalypto 2006. Gibson helped him cowrite the screenplay and was also a producer himself which suggests that he must have thought this film was a good idea. The only redeeming feature of this appallingly savage and unpleasant film is its setting. The way that it is visualised here as a free roaming compound overruled by gangsters I could hardly believe that such a place would exist. Driver's voice over narrating the film asks us Was this a prison or the world's shittiest mall? Yet according to reports 'El Pueblito' was actually real. Prisoners could shop freely and the drug trade was so viable that it became pertinent in upholding the facilities economy. The prison was shut down back in 2002 after it was raided by two thousand law enforcement officers. I think it would make for a fascinating documentary to explore how such an institution could be so morally and politically bankrupt. The setting is undeniably intriguing but it's wasted on a subpar crime story that is increasingly implausible stupid clich He killed my father! and derivative of better films including Gibson's own Payback 1999. The direction of the film is as careless as the spatiality that is depicting. The look of the film feels right. It's grubby sweaty and ugly the textures belong to a hardcore prison block. Yet the potential for a realistic and detailed prison drama is undone by immature writing and meaningless stylistic decisions. Gibson and Grunberg are interested in selling an attitude but with little reasoning. They try their hardest to shock. Take an early freeze frame on Driver's friend as he coughs up blood in the backseat of the car. The image is paused momentarily so that we can see the blood spurting out of his mouth. What's the point?Similarly Gibson now in his midfifties is intent on pushing himself as an action hero with a chip on his shoulder. It's like he's joined forces with Liam Neeson determined to prove that geriatrics have still got it. He willingly throws himself into embarrassing slowmotion gunfights and commando rolls but gives us no reason to care whatsoever. Most of the personality in his dry onenote performance is derived solely from his voiceover which offers a handful of quips to lighten the mood. The one question I have about Driver is concerned with his athleticism. When he was in the army how regularly did they practice the move of diving in midair to catch a grenade to throw it back? Did he learn this from fielding in cricket matches? The film would like to be Robert Rodriguez's Desperado 1995 but it's missing the fun. Some of the gunfights are cartoonlike which is at odds with the violence that is offensively harsh. The boy and his mother are abused in the most heinous ways forcing us to endure moments of torture that only the disturbed or easily amused could enjoy. I found it utterly repulsive. Violence can be brutal as it is in any Tarantino film but it must always have a purpose. Relying on shock value like Gibson and his director do here is the cheapest and laziest way of drawing a reaction from people. Interestingly it must have been decided that the film would not bode well with American audiences as it is not seeing a theatrical release there. Wisely it's going straight to videoondemand services. I've already called the film a rehash of Payback but it seems as though Gibson's career is retracting in so many other ways.".

	schema:headline " 80's Heaven";
	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who wants to revisit the excesses of the 80's should definitely head straight for this movie.  Every element of it is strikingly evocative of its era.  It has all the obvious things like the absurd fashions the bricksized mobile phones the casting only in the 80's could a cast be assembled so wimpy that James Spader can convince as a tough guy! and of course the drugs.  But it also has the little touches that generate shocks of recognition from the pink and blue lighting to the opening Bangles track to the huge banks of TV screens masquerading as interior design it will rekindle memories you never knew you had.Like the central characters whom it both satirises and glorifies this movie is beautiful to look at and obsessed with surface and appearance. You don't look happy comments Clay McCarthy to Blair Gertz at one point But do I look good? is her rejoinder.  This film while not a happy one definitely looks good.  Some scenes notably one of McCarthy swimming and one of a swarm of motorcycles driving past him seem to have no other purpose in the film beyond being aesthetically pleasing.  The film's visual imagery is indeed so striking that when the makers of The Simpsons wanted to include a parody musical Kickin' It  A Musical Journey Through the Betty Ford Clinic they drew the leading man playing a celebrity busted for drug offences dressed in the distinctive black and white suit worn by Robert Downey Jnr during the first party scene presumably confident that it would be recognised.But despite its emphasis on visual style Less Than Zero does have some substance underneath most of it concentrated in Robert Downey Jnr's acute portrayal of the spoilt selfdestructive antihero Julian.  It is easy to say with hindsight that playing a drugaddled and desperate man was never going to be a huge stretch for Downey and plenty of critics have done so. However regardless of the reasons behind it's proficiency his performance has a depth and range that gives it an air of authenticity rare in a genre of character which traditionally leads actors into either an excess of hamminess or a glazed vacancy.  Downey's Julian swings between easygoing charm raw vulnerability spoilt petulance and an aggressive unpredictability in a way which allows the audience to sympathise both with his family's angry handwashing and his friend's reluctant love for him and determination to save him from himself.The role is a difficult juggling act and luckily Downey has the perfect foil in Spader's subtle turn as the cynically manipulative dealer Rip.  The film really comes alive in the exchanges between the two Julian puppyishly optimistic that he can sort his problems out and Rip cruelly cutting through his confidence to the reveal the selfdeception at its heart chipping away at Julian's fragile selfesteem in order to control him.Unfortunately the film rather lets itself down with a closing few minutes that seem to drag on for at least an hour.  It's lazy contrived and unlikely ending is more of a get out clause than a culmination and appears to have been written purely as a way of ending the film rather than as its logical conclusion.  Despite this fairly major flaw Less Than Zero is entertaining with enough snappy dialogue varied music and amusingly dressed extras to counteract its deficiencies.".

It has all the obvious things like the absurd fashions the bricksized mobile phones the casting only in the 80's could a cast be assembled so wimpy that James Spader can convince as a tough guy! and of course the drugs.  But it also has the little touches that generate shocks of recognition from the pink and blue lighting to the opening Bangles track to the huge banks of TV screens masquerading as interior design it will rekindle memories you never knew you had.Like the central characters whom it both satirises and glorifies this movie is beautiful to look at and obsessed with surface and appearance.

After watching it I would definitely agree that it is nothing like the book but I did like it for what it was.Clay McCarthy is coming back to Los Angeles for the Holidays. He meets up with his old Girlfriend Blair Gertz and Best Friend Julian Downey. Clay last caught them in bed together during a Thanksgiving visit. It seems that for the past few months Julian has developed a serious cocaine addiction that has put him 50000 in debt with his vicious Coke Dealer Rip Spader.So what can I say? The film looks terrific. The Cinematography by Edward Lachman is amazing and it is also highlighted by Thomas Newman's haunting score. The performances are great particularly Robert Downey Jr as Julian Who I think plays the part pretty accurately as his counterpart from the book and although Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz get a lot of bashing for their performances I think they're both quite effective. And Also worth noting is James Spader as Rip who seems almost like an even slimier version of Stef from Pretty in Pink.Although it has its critics and it isn't an adaptation of the book I personally love this movie and think that it deserves more credit than it gets.".

This movie is ridiculous containing absolutely none of the ambience of the novel. Instead we get stupid visuals a party with 20 TVs all stacked up on one another an idiotic fight at a party in Palm Springs with beautiful cokedout people looking on that lend little to promote the plot. Essential characters from the novel like Trent that could have helped explain the relationships are missing.

The move is highly stylized and slick. It's Maimi Vice meets The Breakfast Club. I state this because it has elements of the now unfortuneatly defunct Brat Pack However the depiction of Julian played by Robert Downey Jr.seems to be the embodiment of the age as it relates to cocaine and crackcocaine use and the effect it had and in many cases still has on the lives of families friends and love ones. For this reason as a baby boomer who lived through that era. I find the movie disturbing for its sheer view into the reality of lifestyle crashing into reality. I always try not to watch this movie. Sadly I'm drawn into it like a moth to a flame. I think its a scared straight movie for the rich or really any one that thinks that drugs are cool glamorous and harmless. From a directing and acting standpoint its excellent. Marek Kaniveska did an excellent job setting the scene and style of Los Angeles highlife. Cars money and clothes was what it was all about. Within that vein Kaniveska has put that portion of L.A. 80's lifestyle in the history books in this writers opinion Its really too bad the main characters are not as exposed as they once were in the industry. I think that anyone that sees this movie will enjoy it.".

	schema:headline " A movie about people who exist in perpetual uselessness. spoilers for the novel and movie";
	schema:reviewBody "'Less Than Zero' was a good book but a horrible adaptation. The movie plays out like an antidrug drama while the book explores California's wealthy socialites who exist in a state of perpetual uselessness. With vicious characters similar to Igby Goes Down and the unbearable and disgusting apathy of The River's Edge the novel portrays a dark reality of overprivileged city sleaze with too way much money.The novel is narrated by Clay an eighteen year old who returns home from his New Hampshire college for the winter holiday. Rightly characterized as a modern Holden Caufield Clay just seems to watch his surreal existence among the wealthy Califorian socialites with disgust. It is like the Roaring '20s of The Great Gatsby only much harsher. The characters have no emotional connection to one another neither to family or friends. When asked where her parents are for the Christmas vacation one girl Kim replies that she read in Vogue that her mother was in London or perhaps Honolulu. Everyone just seems to be content or kidding themselves that they are in their meaningless rituals. Meeting at one club after another doing endless amounts of coke engaging in casual sex. These characters are what Sandra Bullock's character in 'Murder By Numbers' refers to as the 'orphans.' Kids with too much money and no place to go nothing to do. Their lifestyles have turned them into the most disgusting creatures who don't seem to acknowledge their state of uselessness. They consider it the good life. In fact Clay does seem to be the only one to realize it. Though Blair may've once been his girlfriend and Julian may've once been his best friend in school they don't seem to matter anymore as they get carried away with this lifestyle. Everyone has turned into this sort of Il Conformiste notice that all characters are described as blond and tanned. Any sort of connection Clay might've had with his friends or family is lost. New Hampshire I suppose is his only escape from perhaps fantasies of suicide. Notice how he states at the end that he halfwished he could take Blair back with him. The movie is a ridiculous adaptation of the book. Important characters like Rip and Trent the most disgustingly apathetic of the characters in the book notice how they react when the twelve year old girl is hogtied to the bed at their friend's house or when they discover a dead body behind a club are made trivial in the movie. And largely because the theme these useless characters made so by their money and by the city life the same themes of the 20s and 30s becomes only secondary to the antidrug story. In fact another 80s drugthemed movie of the decade 'Big Lights Bright City' with Michael J. Fox and Kiefer Sutherland aside from the drug theme does a better job at illustrating the type of sickening cycle of useless people Ellis was describing in his own novel. 'Less Than Zero' is one of a few of Ellis's novels that have come to be adapted to the screen. The same cast of characters those rich useless kids of the city who delude themselves in a world of zero emotion or care return in 'American Psycho' 'The Rules of Attraction' and now 'Glitterama.' Although I suppose 'The Rules of Attraction' is much closer to the novel 'Less Than Zero' in that one character comes to realize how pathetic that cycle is and desperately seeks to escape it in the end.So I'd say the novel is good. The movie was not. I suppose the only saving grace of the movie is that yes it was an 80s movie with the hot young stars of the decade particularly Gertz and Spader who are always interesting to see. That and the antidrug message can't be totally disregarded especially considering the decade. Although then if that were all the filmmakers were looking for then 1 it was done better the following year 'Bright Lights Big City' Clean and Sober and 2 they didn't need an adaptation of a novel to create that kind of story. The movie is alright just by itself. But as an adaptation the novel fares much better.Moreover for those interested in reading the novel this narrative makes an interesting comparison to the 1979 Terry Davis novel 'Vision Quest' which was also poorly adapted into film in the early 80s. Anyways these are two very different books that would be quite interesting to read consecutively.".

	schema:reviewBody "Less than Zero has to be my ultime favorite 80's movie. Every time that I watch this movie I learn something new. This movie as many people know is Robert Downey Jr.'s break out film and boy did he do a wonderful job. I think Robert did the most amazing depiction of a drug abusive young adult that anyone of his age or stature could even try to imitate. He was just amazing! You know that someone is amazing in a movie when you can't see any other actor portraying his or her role and that's how I know Robert did an amazing job because i can't see any other actor at that time or even now who could portray the complexity of the characterJulian Wells justice. The movie also includes Andrew Mccarthy Jamie Gertz and James Spader but clearly after watching Less than Zero all your left thinking about is Robert's performance. Don't get me wrong it was a perefectly casted cast as you know Andrew being the preppy college student and Jamie being the modelgirlfriend and Spader being the villiandrug dealer but all you can think about is Julian and how everything in his life no matter how hard he tried just kept falling apart which therefore left him with no choice but to result to drugs. Even the director who hasn't directed many films is phenominal he gives a visonary to the audience the is just exceptional. And even the music in this movie is just great your left feeling the emotions as you listen to the music and I just find that completely rare now a days. As you can see i really do hold high regard to this movie and I actually do believe that if you took the time to watch it you would learn something from it and can apply it to your own life. And if there are any Robert Downey Jr. fans out there this movie would make you like Robert far beyond his irrestiable amazing gorgeous looks but it would make you look even further beyond that and have you respect him even more as an actor and as humanbeing and even if you are not a huge Robert Downey Jr. fan this movie will convert you into one as soon as the credits start to roll. Again this is an Amazing movie both visually and physically performance by Robert Downey Jr. so if your looking for a great movie to really leave you with something to think about rather apply to your own life than this movie is for you and I can say this because I too have learned alot from it and I thank Robert from the bottom of my heart for making it!".

There is 90 percent chance or higher that you will not want to use it after watching this. I was 13 years old when I watched this and wow did it scare the crap out of me. The ending was a bit sad but this is true to real life events then could happen so the script demands that it be taken seriously no matter how bad this film has aged. Again if you've ever been curious about using cocaine this movie will prevent you from using it. I can bet my 401k on it. Enjoy".

If you have EVER been curious or currently are curious about using cocaine I encourage you strongly to watch this movie. There is 90 percent chance or higher that you will not want to use it after watching this. I was 13 years old when I watched this and wow did it scare the crap out of me. The ending was a bit sad but this is true to real life events then could happen so the script demands that it be taken seriously no matter how bad this film has aged. Again if you've ever been curious about using cocaine this movie will prevent you from using it. I can bet my 401k on it. Enjoy";

	schema:reviewBody "Less Than Zero almost seems like a film that came too late if only for a couple of years earlier during the Brat Pack era. While it isn't John Hughes it's an interesting drama thanks to it's performances especially Downey's this role hitting a bit too close to home and James Spader as an oily drug supplier while McCarthy basically just has to look sharp smile and not say much while I almost don't know what Gertz has to do but just look independent. When graduating at the start McCarthy had gone away for a while and now he's back only to find friend Julian Downey at his worst with his drug habit spiralling into a darker hell as referred to the movie's title while Gertz is overly concerned. All three are from privileged families Downey's father disowning him cause of his addiction. Downey shows some powerfully acted moments too convincing you might say like when he's really strung out his supplier Spader a really bad influence ha ha different Spader movie reference acting as a kind of pimp when funds are short or due making him do some weird stuff. Less Than Zero is a flashy energetic drama all the more conflict driven in Downey's character refusing to be helped. Based on Brett E Ellis novel Gertz uses the same line regarding snorting coke as Jessica Biel does in 2003's Rules Of Attraction based on another novel by Ellis. The film does have some messy areas and it's ending tragic for one is thought provoking but if you want John Hughes go somewhere else.".

His hopeless optimism random outburst of rage and constant sweating all ring true. But everyone knows RDJ is brilliant. Andrew McCarthy does well with the character created by the screenwriters but that character lacks depth. If you've read Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the same name and are expecting the apathetic drugaddled jerk narrator step back 'cause you won't be getting it here. It's no surprise the author was only happy with RDJ and James Spader their characters are the only ones who even vaguely resemble those of the novel. The novel is shocking to the point of being nauseating and down right disturbing. The film is not. It's a beautiful vapid montage of 80s that sometimes drags. The soundtrack is killer especially LLCoolJ's Going' Back to Cali and the Bangles cover of Hazy Shade of Winter. But back to the acting a few times in the film Jamie Gertz hits on something real and heartwrenching but it's fleeting and before you can sigh with relief it's gone. Much of her performance is pretty wooden and her performance in the last scene is positively painful. The sex scenes are very realistic though. Probably the best acting Gertz and McCarthy do in this film. If you're into costumes check this film out they're pure 80s perfection.".

It's obvious to me that the director went to great lengths to make sure every shot was done right. The lighting was excellent using color and giving feeling to a lot of the night shots and especially all the scenes in the convertible. I read an earlier comment from someone who thought the music didn't fit however I disagree. I thought it added significantly to the mood and the feel in many of the scenes.

Half the scenes are good half bad etc. The real clincher in this film has to be Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of drug addict Julian. Never have I been so moved to the point of tears and I never cry. The film is about 3 friends Clay Andrew McCarthy Blair Jami Gertz and Julian Robert Downey Jr. They have just left High School and are all off to enter the real world. Clay goes to University Julian tries to fund a record project and Blair gets into modelling. After a year apart things have changed. Clay comes home at Blairs request due to her concerns about Julian after his record project falls apart he gets into debt and heavily involved in drugs. The remainder of the film explores the struggles between the three friends being reunited and seeing how each one has changed. Whilst Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz give very poor acting very little emotion it is Robert Downey Jr and James Spader Who plays Rip who steal the show and make the film worth while. The film has a very rustic 80's feel to it along with a fantastic soundtrack infitting with the films story. The film is supposed to based on the book Less Than Zero by Brett Easton but is only very loosely based. If you are a fan of the book i'd watch it with caution. Other than that i'd recommend you all watch it just to see RDJ's captivating performance. Go on give it a try!".

More and more women are answering a spiritual calling to take on the vestments of priesthood and seek equality in the religion they love. These daring women have risked banishment loss of livelihood and even excommunication to take part in what the Church calls illicit ordinations. The Vatican has vowed to end this threat to the male hierarchy even forbidding the mere discussion of female priests. The papacy has reached a time of crisis and the controversy over women's role and their place in the Church must be addressed if the Vatican is to have any relevance in the 21st century.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw two sneak previews in Vienna at UCI Millennium City past may 2006. They screened both the original German version as well as the English dubbed one. Although one and the same film the perception of the movie differs. Somehow and for a German native speaker the visuals and dialog seem to be more convincing in the dubbed version yet the movie is entirely  and for native Austrians recognizably  shot in Austria. Truly interesting phenomenon that is and potentially headache causing in the commercial exploitation of the film. Apparently AINOA is being released in Austria in fall this year by Buena Vista International a highly reputable distributor world wide as we all know primarily known for family entertainment. Chapeau in every sense if this is true I think the movie deserves it though. Despite some crucial character flaws and weaknesses as far as the overall dramaturgy pace and speed is concerned the movie leaves you with a certain sense of satisfaction and urge for discussion after wards which I personally like about movies. The images are epic and carefully composed the score supports and elevates the futuristic sense and settings convincingly sound design is precise realistically supportive and embedded in the picture in a detailed and sophisticated manner. Direction is acceptable considering the director and DP seemingly coming from doing commercials numerous internationally successful filmmakers went that path still for a firsttimer in the world of epic scifi features even remarkable. I cannot think of a single movie done in Austria dealing that proper and professional with such a demanding genre highly ambitious production value and courageous effort in the low budget field. It certainly will be interesting to see how the Austrian audience will cope with and accept AINOA once released. I think it depends on where you set your personal perceptive bench mark and what you are comparing an Austrian scifi flick with. Despite the rather obvious nodding towards existing scifi elements and ingredients Star Wars springs to mind the movie bears charm and sometimes puts a condoning smile on your face but not in a denouncing way. All in all given the limited financial means and long period of time it apparently took shooting the film I see AINOA as a remarkable and equally ambitious effort in setting a new bench mark in Austria. I can imagine the movie entering unchartered territory in Austria amongst film enthusiasts and identity driven critics but hey  no risk no fun as they say  thus may the force be with you young AINOA!".

All in all given the limited financial means and long period of time it apparently took shooting the film I see AINOA as a remarkable and equally ambitious effort in setting a new bench mark in Austria. I can imagine the movie entering unchartered territory in Austria amongst film enthusiasts and identity driven critics but hey  no risk no fun as they say  thus may the force be with you young AINOA!";

I didn't really expect anything great as Austrian movies except comedies usually lack any entertainment factor and are consumable for a small intellectual audience only. Ainoa is quite the opposite. Although based on a deeply poetic and philosophic thought the film convinced me with its narrative quality the surprisingly well performing actors and the enormous love for detail that these guys show in every scene of the movie. Hard to imagine this film has been shot entirely in Austria the locations throw you into another world. And hard to imagine they hardly had any money for that. Of course Ainoa cannot be compared with big Hollywood blockbuster movies but i think these filmmakers id a good job in making that NOT the point at all. That's what i really enjoyed about it. Its not just a poor Austrian Star Wars much more than that this movie has a soul and a quality of its own although the story might irritate some people with its very simple sometimes even naive but always thoughtful approach. Instead of relying on big special effects it convinces with its heart and poetry. Its worth while watching it for those who like Sci Fi and fairy tales or simply a movie not seen every day in cinema.".

I was instantly thrilled as I heard a lot about this ambitious project in the past two years! And I learned a lot last night... For starters Austrian actors synchronizing themselves for the English dubbed version  the one I saw  does not work. At all! It sounds odd and sometimes plain stupid. But as AINOA is a low budget project it is an understandable decision. Unfortunately one that hurts the movie a lot along the way. Secondly the movie fails to introduce its main characters properly in the beginning. Therefore the audience  and I am not just talking about myself here  felt not nearly as tied in with the story as intended by the writer and director. Dramatic sometimes even tragic moments felt as witnessed in a news broadcast far away. And then there is the pace of the story which is more like a crawl than a rush. Only at the end  the last 20mins or so  does the pace pick up a bit and the movie starts getting interesting as all the loose ends start coming together. On the positive side the production design was really well done considering the extremely low budget that the designers had to cope with. The camera angles are often unique as well and give the entire scenery a strange sense of familiarity although they are actually portraying future scenarios. Great idea! The bottom line as sad as it is is this Had the characters been properly introduced and the dubbing been done right this could well have been a marvelous SiFi epic.

Being married to one of the crew members I've had some first and secondhand insight to the working conditions for this movie over the years  quite special in this one aspect. Ainoa started out as an idea for a script of the director's. Actually he started filming or making his own movies as a teenager experimenting with his dad's VC. He took up studying arts and film as a vocation specializing in directing. He also started writing the script all by himself discussing his ideas with friends only getting some help with it by some people working in this line late in the production. Total Budget NIL. Consequently each and every member of the crew and that is including staff and actors got NIL. The actors you see were trying to build up at reputation and took a liking to being quite free to introduce their own ideas. Most of them were students. Or friends. As the credits indicate filmrelated companies costume shops filming equipment companies and the like  did of course give material for free. So the Filming and Production Time as it simply cannot be correctly reflected by the IMDb standards for an IMDb movie entry was a total of 6 years starting 1998. Post Production and SFX consumed another two years. Film making in Austria is something for people on a mission. Either you're part of a wellestablished establishment or you're getting no funds at all. The script had to be adapted several times. Meaning the director invested his own personal funds to have a couple of weeks shooting. We're talking here of numbers in the 3000 to 5000 USD range he had to cover all expenses for each shooting as I heard. There were five of them if my memory is correct. PostProduction took another two years  it's only then he got some funding he finally found an able producer  and this guy finally found a distributor. ONLY THEN major Austrian companies were ready to add some minor money of their own allowing him to complete the movie adding some product placement of course. Total Budget was a fivefigure number in USD I don't remember this exactly sorrySo why am I writing this down? In order to give you the right angle and perspective for a movie worth to watch As an experiment in perfection as far as your own studies may take you. Also I won't hide the main weakness of the movie which is in the script. SPOILER The first script contained a huge Action sequence which was shot right at the start. Most people you see within the first oddten minutes of the film were extras  and either experienced Live RPGs' or members of a major local Vienna Paintball Shootout Club. The changes to the script didn't exclude the material from the movie for it was too strong for that. However watching this opening sequence gives you the impression OK this will develop into an actionflick. In total contrast to a quite slow development in the next 100 minutes that offer a psychological and philosophical study of the classical SciFi Theme of machine becoming man woman for instance developing feelings bonds and affection. END SPOILERAINOA seen in the right context  is an exceptional piece for a student to give for getting his degree  cum laude. Therefore I give it a ten. If you expect a commercial movie maybe you'd rather chose something else. And presumably it won't be one of your tens. But if you're really into SciFi and SciFi philosophical plots give it a go. Cinematography costumes and acting are quite impressive. Dialogue is OK it's just this big break in the script right at the start. I don't know the English synchronization I've been to the world Premiere in Vienna which was held in German.".

I couldn't tell whether Mel Gibson's character was incredibly laid back or if the actor just wasn't giving his all  but for me the more interesting characters were the supporting cast anyway David Marshall Grant as Rob Diehl and Art LaFleur as Jack Niely. There were a few too many pilots to pad all of the cast out but the collective effort provided much of the humour. Robert Downey Jnr. was perhaps the best out of the main cast from cheesy 'eye in the sky' pilot 'the traffic is kinda sad kinda bumsylooking' to Air America rookie lost in a world of 'bar girls squiggly writing on signs and more bar girls'. Neither Gibson or Downey Jnr. were particularly convincing as pilots but luckily the planes such as Pilatus Porters and Caribous had enough character to pull off the airborne scenes. Downey Jnr.'s character had a spectacular if not slightly drawn out crashlanding scene slowly dismantling his aircraft as he slid along an old airstrip. The soundtrack was also a bonus placing the film in time where the main characters were slightly anachronistic. Frank Sinatra's 'Come Fly With Me' saved the cliched ending with the same droll humour that was peppered throughout the rest of the movie. Overall Air America is a  film best watched with your brain switched to 'idle'  although the subject is serious the film is best as pure entertainment.".

I did not fly for Air America but knew being a C123 pilot I knew a lot who did including those who flew in my Reserve Unit back home. I am not a movie critic but wonder about the subliminal motivation of Directors and Writers who make movies like this. The best part of this movie has to go to the cameraman. The flying shots and stunts although totally cartoon like are excellent. The movie begins with Hollywood's favorite fall guy in 1969. But the fact is Nixon did not start Air America he did not begin the lies. Johnson was responsible for Air America and Nixon inherited the lies the war and Air America. Its not fair or accurate to portray Nixon as a liar on the subject of Air America. All President's have inherited the lies of their predecessors. Nobody smart enough to fly a C123 was dumb enough to not know what they were joining. That makes the Downey character unbelievable. A C123 was a rugged airplane. It could easily fly on one engine or the two auxiliary jet engines. The three stooges shooting a duck with one shot is more likely. Pilots who flew with Air America were civilian employees of the CIA they were not reckless soldiers of fortune. They had a good reason to behave and believe in a future if they survived their extremely dangerous job. They were given double time towards a retirement pension. They weren't required to sell dope or guns to get a good pension. Dope was legal and a way of life in SEA as it still is today in Afganistan. If individual pilots tried to make money on the side it was not CIA policy. The CIA was fighting a war on communism not drugs. The writer based his story on war stories. Pilots love to BS anybody who will buy them a beer and listen. The writer and Director who had an ax to grind about VietNam and Nixon. See the movie and remember how it starts  it blames Nixon for what existed for years. Remember he didn't become President until Jan 20 1969.My favorite scene is the landing up hill in the jungle. Air America pilots put planes in places the aircraft designers never thought possible. Their were plenty of funny stories that could have been shown. Instead the Director chose to use the oversize rubber scene to show how dumb the CIA was. This scene shows that the Director and writer fell for some pilot bar talk and the joke is on them.

And I guess the same has to be said for Downey I watched this in part as a sort of catch up on his career after seeing Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Nice to see him in his nubile years and realize that he has accomplished more with his personal issues in tow than some of us accomplish while living within conventional bounds of correctness.And...

	schema:reviewBody "Easily one of my personal favourite lighthearted action movies...Air America takes place in Laos circa 1969 and follows the exploits of a band of roughneck pilots working for the company of the film's title flying dangerous cargo drop missions in the unfriendly skies. Billy Robert Downey Jr is recruited from his job as a traffic helicopter pilot to join Air America. As he wants to be down in the action not up above it he takes the job and so meets Gene Ryack Mel Gibson the unofficial head of the bunch who is as he puts it an adrenaline junkie.While the historical accuracy and believability of the story is questionable that's not why we watch these films is it? This is a great action movie with some REAL aerial stuntwork and no bluescreen or CGI some great one liners some awesome location photography and some decent humourHow often do you guys go on a bender like this? Oh this is not a bender. This is just nighttime!Roger Spottiswoode has made some remarkably good action films in his time light nongory violence with some humanity and a decent storyline to boot. He did the wonderful Turner and Hooch a year before this and a year before that did Deadly Pursuit or Shoot to Kill i think it was called in the US and later directed Arnie in The 6th Day. I enjoy all those movies find them tense exciting and lots of fun as Fridaynitepopcornflicks.Finally two things that I admire about this film are the fact there is no cheesy love story thrown in just for the sake of having a love interest for one of the male leads. And the final message delivered in the films closing scenes when Gene ditches his very lucrative weapons cache in favour of taking on refugees fleeing a warzone. Great message. Great stuff.".

Call my parents crazy but for some reason they let me watch this movie at the age of 3 and I have been watching it ever since 30 or so times. I must admit this makes my opinion somewhat biased especially since it has probably shaped me deeply psychologically which is a sad thought if you consider the topics of drugs war and Robert Downey Jr. But thats not really what this movie is about. It is a comedy with some decent action thrown in. The action like many war movies acts as a backdrop for the comedy by showing how crazy people become in war and what irony arises. It is about taking life as it comes. It is about life's odd ironies in weird places and finding those for your own wellbeing. It is about having fun and flying which is probably one reason i have always been fascinated by flight. It is about war. It is hilarious. It has an excellent soundtrack a perfect one in fact. Watch it if your in a mood for having fun. Peace.".

I hasten to add that the final Fred Astaire track really comes out of nowhere.I wanted to like this movie. It treats the CIA's drug and gunrunning in Laos during the vexed Vietnam conflict. President Nixon is shown on television insisting that there are no combat troops in Laos No boots on the ground! Sound familiar?. The plot focuses on the role played by the CIA in supporting the production of heroin in exchange for cooperation of the Laotian military. Some attention is given to the nature of covert activities and the types of people losers and mercenaries who sign up for such missions.The primary problem is that there is a real cacophony of tones and messages. Air America tries to be smart but it comes off as rather lame. Not really incisive enough to count as a serious critique of the war or US policy nor really funny enough to constitute comedy. Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr. are both pretty mediocre in this production and they are the best of the cast which abounds in stereotypical caricatures of the usual suspects CIA agents senators prostitutes Asian military figures among others.It would be great for people to learn about the involvement of the Caustic Incompetence Agency in the drug trade during the US military engagement in Vietnamespecially since many veterans came home addicted to heroin and ended up social outcasts. But it would probably be better to read some books than to watch this middling effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first of the 'Air Bud' series is as much wonderful as it is horribly underrated truly a 90's classic. It has a dignified place in the list of the greatest animal movies as well. In many ways it is a depressing movie but it's also heartwarming touching feelgood and tons of fun. There's more to it to like though. Cinematography is really beautiful and pure. The soundtrack is just perfect for this film. The boy and his devoted fourlegged friend make a marvelous team and have a perfect chemistry.Even though the film's title obviously refers to the dog his name is actually Buddy  that is once he ends up in the hands of Josh Framm. Even as the movie starts the little we see is enough to realize how horribly the clown treats his dog constantly yelling at him threatening him and hitting him hard with the newspaper. It is heartbreaking to see that. Fortunately this horrible man accidentally loses him and he finds Josh Framm a I assume 12yearold who is loving and caring but very shy and silent and currently under depressive mood. They quickly become best friends as Josh gives him the treatment he deserves. Buddy is a very special dog alone but he has a special secret that makes him even more special he can play basketball even more amazing better than humans can!.Even though the clown is a horrible person he doesn't have that much of a role. He is not someone I sympathize with and he certainly isn't funny although it is hilarious when his truck falls apart and he can't stop it and accidentally drives it into a river.Larry Willingham's father is a jerk. Even though Larry unfairly picks on Josh at least he isn't too bratty and is funny at times. But Larry's father that guy is such a jerk although not overly annoying. Coach Joe isn't especially sympathetic because he is very impatient and temperamental but he goes too far when he throws basketballs at Josh's peculiar friend Tom with aggressiveness.The movie is focused more on Josh and Buddy who are the most likable characters of the movie. Kevin Zegers is flawless as Josh Framm. Buddy the Dog is amazing as Buddy may this wonderful dog rest in peace wherever he is now. Brendan Fletcher does a good job as Larry. So does Shayn Solberg as Josh's good friend Tom. The late Eric Christmas is hilarious as Judge Cranfield.Title in Portugal 'Air Bud'.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first of the 'Air Bud' series is as much wonderful as it is horribly underrated truly a 90's classic. It has a dignified place in the list of the greatest animal movies as well. In many ways it is a depressing movie but it's also heartwarming touching feelgood and tons of fun. There's more to it to like though. Cinematography is really beautiful and pure. The soundtrack is just perfect for this film. The boy and his devoted fourlegged friend make a marvelous team and have a perfect chemistry.Even though the film's title obviously refers to the dog his name is actually Buddy  that is once he ends up in the hands of Josh Framm. Even as the movie starts the little we see is enough to realize how horribly the clown treats his dog constantly yelling at him threatening him and hitting him hard with the newspaper. It is heartbreaking to see that. Fortunately this horrible man accidentally loses him and he finds Josh Framm a I assume 12yearold who is loving and caring but very shy and silent and currently under depressive mood. They quickly become best friends as Josh gives him the treatment he deserves.

	schema:headline " Buddy and Josh make this movie";
	schema:reviewBody "'Air Bud' is one of doggy movies so much in fashion in its time. And it's surprisingly underrated.This is by no means a comedy although it has its funny moments. It is dramatic more than anything. In fact this is often a depressing film but joyful at the same time. Unlike its sequels this one has a clever plot a sentimental one I'd say. It's heartwarming in the line of others like this such as 'Old Yeller' 'Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey' 'Napoleon' and 'Fluke'.Despite the title the story isn't just about our very dear canine friend Buddy even if he is the main star. The story also focus on Josh Framm who is a crucial character together with the dog. After all they are destined to be best friends. Josh is Buddy's salvation but Buddy also plays an important role to save Josh's life. Buddy escapes from his alcoholic and aggressive owner and finds a peaceful life with Josh. On the other hand Josh gets over depression and shyness thanks to Buddy which gives the him will to live and brings back Josh's lost interest in basketball.That's when the movie's most original thing happens Buddy can play basketball! That is just amazing! Like everybody else in the movie to see the dog playing basketball leaves me speechless. That dog has an incredible talent for basketball and even more unbelievable is that he never fails. He's a much better and naturalborn player than the humans themselves. He becomes the mascot of Josh's basketball team... which brings them lots of luck.The beauty of this movie isn't just in the dramatic story but also in the friendship between Josh and man's best friend. Plus Buddy is a Golden Retriever my favorite dog breed. Golden Retrievers look so friendly and pacific. They are in fact. They are among the world's sweetest and most beautiful dogs.But the magnificent scenario also gives beauty to the movie rivers green places a nice village. All of this is very well combined with soft relaxing and beautiful piano music like in Fluke.Tom is an eccentric boy who always carries minor pieces of garbage to give him luck. It is however a bit disturbing to see that Joe coach throwing him numerous basketballs causing the boy to shake nervously and feel very tired.Larry although constantly picking on Josh isn't really annoying or stupid. He is more of an arrogant and jealous guy than actually mean. Despite having some deeply touching moments the most heartbreaking moment of the movie is when Buddy crosses the river and tries to follow the river boat which Josh catches. That scene always makes tears come to my eyes.As for the cast Kevin Zegers a sports boy in real life just like Noah Hathaway is wonderful in the role of Josh Framm and Buddy the Dog is simply fantastic as Buddy. I was so sad when I found out that Buddy died. He was a friendly adorable beautiful and very talented dog. The little girl who plays Josh's cute little sister whoever she is is alright either.But I don't like some of the characters at all. Norm Snively is a drunk abusive man and a loser as a clown. Coach Joe is a jerk and unkind. Larry's father is a jerk and a hypocrite. This should definitely be on Top 250.".

As far as dog movies go Lassie Come Home and Old Yeller are the best in my opinion but Air Bud is not a bad family movie at all. It is too short though and there is some uneven direction and some hit and misses in the script However some of it is fitfully amusing and the story is appealing. And the characters are engaging especially Buddy and Josh those two have great chemistry together. Kevin Zegers is likable enough while Buddy steals the film whether it is the stunts or the bonding scenes. Air Bud is nice to look at and the soundtrack is decent. But I have to give special mention to the acrobatics because they are amazing. All in all an entertaining and likable film not perfect but decent family fare without taking itself too seriously. 710 Bethany Cox".

Josh is an 11 year old boy who moves with his sister and his mum after his father died. He's lonely and he doesn't make friends at his new school. Until he finds a dog also lonely. The dog belongs to some sort of clown who mistreats him and isn't really nice to him but the dog got lost and escaped from him. And then they the boy and the dog become friends. Josh is the 'waterboy' of the school's basketballteam but that changes when he discovers that the dog with the name Buddy can play basketball. There's nothing wrong with this film. It's a warm movie about a special friendship between two 'loners'. The story is not always really logical it's never explained how the dog did find Josh back but that isn't important. It's a kids movie and children don't think about the logicalness of the movie. The actors are all wonderful in this film. Wendy Makkena the shy Maria Roberta in the Sister Actfilms the young Kevin Zegers a sympathetic Bill Cobs in a clich role and most of all Michael Jeter. It's really a shame that he died it was such a wonderful actor. And of course Buddy with his wonderful trainer Kevin DiMaccio also one of the writers and producers. In this time of tragic bloody and heavy cinema people should enjoy this kind of films. Warm lighthearted and most of all funny.".

But when buddy comes into his life everything changes. He is having a lot more fun and you can see that throughout this movie. How can anyone say this is movie has no plot?

For example there's the scene in which the basketball coach after a game in which the character Tom had trouble catching passes is alone with Tom in the gym repeatedly firing balls at Tom that batter him all over his body. When Josh and the principal find them Tom turns and we see bruises on his face and a black eye. That's a little disturbing.Other than that this movie is not that bad. All of the sequals suck. Dogs can't play baseball that's why the ball in the fourth movie is computer animated completely ruining the spirit of the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this movie a lot of times and I have liked it on some occasions and disliked it on some.  It has a very good plot to it although it may be a bit absurd.  The family featured in the movie is a very real type of family maybe a little more perfect than your everyday family but real enough to be in a movie.  The films that have followed this one have been okay but they have just kept getting weirder and odder.  I mean a dog playing football?  Then soccer and then baseball?!  The second and third were reasonable but the baseball one just doesn't make sense.  The main reason I even had a care for liking this movie is because it has a dog in it.  Movies that feature animals are usually ones that are more heartwarming and ones that took more effort to make than just telling somewhat what to do where in this case they actually had to train a dog. The other thing that I really liked about this movie was the music.  The music was composed by Brahm Wenger who did the music for the MVP chimpanzee movies as well.  The music has a lot of string instruments in it which give the movie an athome feeling.  Since there is no suspense in this movie there is no need for suspenseful music but if there was a need the music would probably be really good coordinating to the main music of course. The setting added to the outstanding music made this movie one that I like to watch.  Just the three key elements that I have listed kept me watching and liking this film.  The three elements are involving a dog in the movie the amazing music and the realistic setting.  The reason the setting is a key element to why I liked the movie is because it was a very beautiful setting with lots of greenery and trees.  The setting also seemed a lot more real than a lot of other movies I have seen.  The setting in those other movies is one that is perfect like I said about how the family in the movie wasn't.  So the setting adds to a lot of the ambition of this movie.Kevin Zeggers who plays Josh Framm in the movie continues to grow up in the concluding movies.  He starts out as a kid and arrives a teen at what will seem to be like the end of the movies if not and adult.  There are some real issues that this movie elucidates giving it a ratiocination at the least to be a favorable movie.  There is a little bit of comedy in this movie especially concerning the evil clown.  There is also a little bit of sadness accompanying the laughs.  I cannot think of any reason off the top of my head that would make this movie better than it already is.  With all of the reasons I have given I entrust this movie a 9 out of 10 for lacking nothing of main concern.".

He finds a stray dog and finds out it can play basketball and he himself joins the team and him his buddy Tom Shayn Solberg and dog Buddy win at the end and he was having his dog taken away from him by the dogs rightful owner who abused him but he got it back...PART 2  A vet named Patrick Sullivan moves in on Josh's mom and freaks little Josh out but he finds out Buddy can play football so he along with his friend Tom join the football team. There is Russian animal circus owner trying to kidnap Buddy but it all works out in the end and they win the big game PART 3..Patrick Sullivan played by a new actor marries Josh's mom played by a new actress and all seems well Andrea is older and plays soccer and Josh gets the hots for Andrea's British coach Emma so he joins soccer along with his friend Tom and finds out that Buddy can play soccer too meanwhile Buddy mates with Emma's golden retriever Molly and they have pups and a crazy dog catcher kid naps all the dogs and Josh and Emma and Andrea have to get them back just in time to win the big game. PART 4 has Josh in it for just a little while Kevin Zegers departure from the series and sister Andrea takes over and find that Buddy can play baseball and he joins the team he has kidnappers on his tail and it all works out in the end. Patrick is now replaced once again with Richard Karn in the role and Cynthia Stevenson is back as the mom and they now have a son named Noah. Also the friend Tom sees his farewell here. PART 5 Cynthia returns as the mom but Patrick is replaced by Alf Humphreys and once again the Bo Jackson of animals a.k.a. Buddy Air Bud Framm this time around finds that hes pretty good at volleyball and yea kidnappers puppies and so fourth.....NOW THIS BRINGS US TO A WHOLE NEW SERIES... AIR BUDDIES There is 5 puppies in this house  The old house from way back when. Both Josh and Andrea are away at college and young Noah and the 5 puppies there was once 6 live under one roof. Daddy Patrick who goes by the name Patrick Framm although he used to be Patrick Sullivan and the name Framm is his wives original husbands surnametells the back story of how their next door neighbor had a dog named Molly who still lives there although Molly was actually from a dog that lived in a mansion a good distance from them when the dogs originally met. Anyway the pups get rowdy and they try to find homes for them but they are being kidnapped by bad guys...no sports are played and thats a bonus and in the end it all works out and all 5 dogs are split up to loving kids... The End This story has major flaws but it's a kids movie it's a new franchise and I am the only dork that cares. This movie is loaded with C.G.I. and yes THEY TALK NOW!! All animals do.This series has ripped off 101 Dalmations so many times and they are watching it at a drive in here. This movie has stupid things like the bad guys being trapped in a barn with a cell phone but never call anyone. Such a silly movie.Actors and voices such as Don Knotts Patrick Cranshaw both who died shortly after this film was made did good jobs as the sheriff and his hound. Cranshaw had played in some of the last air bud movies as well. Molly Shannon and Tom Everett Scott did the voices of Buddy and Molly and Abigail Brelin did a great job as Rosebud the only female pup.Good for kids and much better than any of the Air Bud sequels.. 310 stars".

Surprising to me 2 of them commented that they liked it much more than the Material Girl the Hillary Duff movie  and these girls are the age where most are big Hillary Duff fans It is corny and there were a few parts I didn't care for. I think the part suggesting that the puppy was drunk from swimming in some wine would have been better left out. Tell me  wine isn't fermented yet at the point he was swimming in it is it?

I think the part suggesting that the puppy was drunk from swimming in some wine would have been better left out. Tell me  wine isn't fermented yet at the point he was swimming in it is it?

This movie is fun cute sweet teaches children valuable life lessons and is a movie that the entire family can enjoy. This movie has spawned many sequels where the puppies get into all sorts of adventures from meeting Santa Clause to being in a dogsled race to going into space to finding treasure.This movie is about five puppies. The Air Buddies as they are known. They're Budderball Mudbud BDawg Buddah and Rosebud the only girl. These puppies are very special. They are the children of a dog who can play basketball baseball soccer volleyball and football. How adorable is that? The Buddies all live with different families but they meet up to play. Their parents Buffy and Molly are dognapped the five adorable puppies set off to say them. And it's adorable and hilarious.Family Friendly? Definitely.Overall I give this movie a 10 out of 10.".

Easier way is to include adorable dogs. This formula woks well all the time as there are a number of avid dog lovers like me who would swarm over to watch this film.I was a bit ambivalent whether this film would be good enough as some movies based on dogs have been a bit too sweet. This one too leads the league of sweet movies.Frankly speaking the story could've been a lot better. The tiger thing would normally be present is a B grade flick. The voice acting could've improved. Some of the dogs were funny but the voicing of the Sheriff dog was bad. Even the Sheriff dog's lip movements looked unreal. The puppies were really cute especially Buddha who was funny. But the names of some could've been somewhat more different. For example 'Rosebud' 'Mudbud' and 'Budderball' had so much 'bud' present. Instead of mud bud they could've kept mud'something else.It was edited for obtaining 'G' rating but it could've had a variety of jokes that could be rated G but were a bit more mature.Overall it is a cute film that would be liked if you keep in mind that it is meant to be cute only. 5 out of 10.".

After all its not about the NSDAP ideology it's mostly about bravery and selfsacrifice. Replace Hitlerjugend with American Boy Scouts and most people would agree what a good and moral film it is.Rob from England pointed out that from today's point of view the Communists in the film with their beer food and sex would seem far more better deal today. Probably so. But that only shows how the world has declined since the cultural revolution of the late 60s. Values like moral purity patriotism and courage must be held high by all. They are the essence of survival for any nation whatever ideology they may have.I also think German government should have considerably more trust in their citizens and should lift the ban off of films like this so they could become available on DVD and not only in P2P networks as it is today.".

Replace Hitlerjugend with American Boy Scouts and most people would agree what a good and moral film it is.Rob from England pointed out that from today's point of view the Communists in the film with their beer food and sex would seem far more better deal today. Probably so. But that only shows how the world has declined since the cultural revolution of the late 60s. Values like moral purity patriotism and courage must be held high by all. They are the essence of survival for any nation whatever ideology they may have.I also think German government should have considerably more trust in their citizens and should lift the ban off of films like this so they could become available on DVD and not only in P2P networks as it is today.";

There is a scene of our enterprising Hitler Youths organizing themselves  a little like Mickey and Judy putting on a show  to turn out a propaganda newspaper in support of their political dreams and aspirations. Do you recall the scene in Mr. Smith where Jimmy Stewart's struggle  Sein Kampf  against a corrupt and antiquated political system is vindicated through a grassroots campaign organized by a bunch of boys with wagons and a cheap printing press?

	schema:reviewBody "The short unhappy life of Herbert Norkus a young member of the Hitler Youth who was killed by Communist street thugs is the basis of this film entitled in English Our Flags Lead Us Forward. The martial song you hear vocally and instrumentally throughout the film was the official song of the Hitler Youth and the words were written by Baldur Von Schirath the organizer of the group. Note in the opening credits the producers at UFA give thanks to the members of the Hitler Youth Berlin chapter who appeared as extras in the film.The film is only the Herbert Norkus story indirectly. A novel that was required reading for the Hitler Youth was the basis for the film and said novel was written K.A. Schenzinger. I'm sure it was quite the potboiler. Of course that allowed the Nazis to take quite a bit of poetic license with the truth and they never passed up an opportunity to do that.Jurgen Ohlssen plays Heinie Volker who is being apprenticed to the trade of printer and he comes from parents who are Communist in their political sympathies. In the year of 1932 with Germany in the midst of the Depression many competing groups and ideologies were battling to rule the Reich. The neighborhood that the Volkers live in is a working class area that the Communists are dominant.Heinrich George is Heinie's father who is on relief and is idle way too idle. He beats on his wife and rags his son to join the Young Communist League. But the kid is attracted to those clean cut fresh scrubbed teens in their uniforms with their marching songs. They all look quite middle class and he wants to be one of them. If you remember in The Young Lions Marlon Brando's character discusses how Hitler has promised to do away with the class system so prevalent in Europe. Young Ohlssen is exhibit number one for Brando's contention.The film is interesting on a number of levels. Other than Henie's long suffering mother played by Berta Drews the only female role of any consequence is that Rotraut Richter who plays Gerda a teenage temptress who works as a Communist agent luring the Hitler Youth away from their duty. There is a conspicuous lack of the female gender in the Hitler Youth at least at these gatherings. When the Nazi state was established the Hitler Youth did have a woman's auxiliary of sorts where the girls were taught to be good breeders and mothers to make and raise plenty of good Aryan youth for the Fatherland. Nazi Germany was one of the most patriarchal societies ever created on Earth.Other Nazi targets most prominently Jews get not a mention in Our Flags Lead Us Forward. The film strictly concerned with the Communist menace. All the Communists in contrast to the Hitler Youth are these plug ugly proletarian types who smoke cheap cigars and get stinking drunk when they're not infecting our workers with Bolshevist ideas. The father Heinrich George is such a man although later in a good scene George is talking to Ohlssen about how all he wants is the best for his son and society has to change in order for that to happen. A more complex character than you would think would appear in a film that is strictly labeled propaganda. But then again it's what makes it more affective.The bleakness of Depression Era Berlin plays like one of our noir films and the kids are shown as the hope for Germany's future. As it turned out these kids who were the extras in the film probably 90 of them died during World War II. A truly lost generation.Our Flags Lead Us Forward is a slick piece of propaganda designed to recruit the impressionable young German minds who did not want to think of themselves as a beaten country from World War I. Viewed with a critical eye about its purposes it holds up very well for examination today.".

It is in blackandwhite and it was from the early years of sound movies in Germany. If you see the year 1933 and know a bit about history you will immediately realize that this is the year when Nazis came into power in Germany almost 85 years ago. And they started with a bang in terms of propaganda movies. This one here is probably the secondmost known nondocumentary film behind Jud S from that dark era in world history. It is the story of a teenage boy who comes from a leftwing background but quickly discovers that the Nazis are the good guys and the socialistscommunists his father belongs to as well are the bad guys. They are depicted as people planning terrorist attacks and they are the ones who are indirectly responsible for the boy's mother's death and finally directly for the boy's death as well. The only intention director Steinhoff and writer Schenzinger had in this case was to show the population that leftwing politics lead to devastation in the end but also that the Nazis' will to oppose these is very strong and that the boy did not die for nothing but for the good cause. There is of course a priceless irony to this film with what happened in the 12 years afterward and I am not only talking about the concentration camps but also to Hitler sending teenagers to war when all his adult soldiers had died. And in terms of irony the future fate of lead actor Jrgen Ohlsen puts a major question mark behind this movie and the way the Nazis dealt with him when rumors about his alleged homosexuality surfaces. All in all this film is really only worth watching for all the absurdity but from the political perspective and in terms of understanding the events back then this is almost a mustsee just for the wrong reasons.

I found out the stories about Ohlsen and a gay romance with Vom Schirach were originated in BBC broadcasts that went into Germany and as a rule spread nasty  for the time stories about German celebrities to demoralize the enemy. Saying the  quexing slang for gay sex was also BBC. I found out WHO wrote the broadcasts. He died in Berlin in 1969 of alcoholism. I try and try to get Wikipedia to print my findings but they keep erasing it and keeping the sex nonsense. Von Schirach s transfer to Vienna was a reward for a service. The BBC put icing on the cake saying it was a sex scandal. Ohlsen never clarified anything. I don't know his sexual preference and in out times it s no big deal who cares? But the Von Schirach and Ohlsen take was very effective propaganda. It s still all over the internet today. Sadly Ohlsen s not here to speak. He was anti Nazi. Another fact Ohlsen was of Danish ancestry bears a resemblance to teenage Jamie Lee Curtis who IS half Scandinavian And Herbett Norkus the real martyr in real life was Lithuanian background. And right now might be buried in a public park unknown to hikers and picnickers. I did my homework. Lol. Quex IS a good film at face value.".

Another fact Ohlsen was of Danish ancestry bears a resemblance to teenage Jamie Lee Curtis who IS half Scandinavian And Herbett Norkus the real martyr in real life was Lithuanian background. And right now might be buried in a public park unknown to hikers and picnickers. I did my homework. Lol. Quex IS a good film at face value.";

Much of the filming is studio shot..and it shows. The film is saved by the performances of Weimar film veteran Heinrich George and accomplished actor Hermann Speelmans as a nasty Communist.Sixteen year old Jurgen Ohlsen played the ill fated central character Heini 'Quex' Volker. It was his first of three screen appearances Alle Machen Mit a short information film and the aviation film Wunder Des Fliegens were to follow before he disappeared back into comparative obscurity. Ohlsen is quite well cast here though blonde good looking and innocent he's archetypal 'martyr' material and he ends up dying after being knifed by Communists at a local fairground.Historically valuable but cinematically mundane for a Nazi propaganda film it's totally eclipsed by the film Hans Westmar which was based on another 'martyr for the cause' Horst Wessel".

We get to see quite many street scenes of the time in France and Italy and of course lots of cars from that period including two RollsRoyces. For railfans even a Picasso railcar is thrown in...I'm normally not a fan of Louis de Funs' frantic humour which is also evidenced here but he also has very admirable nontalking moments like the Cadillac repair to a classical music score or the muscle comparison in the camping shower.In all a turbulent comedy plus Italian road movie. Very lovely. The German DVD I bought Universal 2008 titled Louis das Schlitzohr also has English Spanish and Dutch dubs but not the original French soundtrack. Still jolly good fun which made my Friday night perfect ".

For railfans even a Picasso railcar is thrown in...I'm normally not a fan of Louis de Funs' frantic humour which is also evidenced here but he also has very admirable nontalking moments like the Cadillac repair to a classical music score or the muscle comparison in the camping shower.In all a turbulent comedy plus Italian road movie. Very lovely. The German DVD I bought Universal 2008 titled Louis das Schlitzohr also has English Spanish and Dutch dubs but not the original French soundtrack. Still jolly good fun which made my Friday night perfect ";

However Bourvil always bores me while Fufu is a delight he may be nervous but i can feel behind a great humanity and i really like his beat.Here they are filmed in Italy in the sixties and it's cool to see how it was like 50 years ago. Personally i found this movie funnier than the one mentioned above but it lacks its dramatic background as well. The idea of someone who is spied who is spied is original and I don't think it has been used often. Maybe the great surprise of this movie should be its score because Delerue finds a lot of very great themes!".

	schema:headline " The Sucker who ruled French comedy meets the Giant of 5'4''...";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1965 French comedy was lead by a triumvirate of actors the Big Boss Fernandel whose Mediterranean accent resonated in every syllabus like a musical tempo and whose large mouth served as a decoy to the most iconic and heartwarming smile on the big screen. Then there was the legitimate son Bourvil the provincial guy the lovable and goofy idiot who just like Victor Hugo who wanted to be Chateaubriand or nothing wanted to be the next Fernandel. And then came the third one the turbulent intruder named Louis De Funs who popularized the figure of the authoritative yet sneaky boss any powerful figure with Napoleonic complex.De Funs was no newbie actually he had twenty years to warm up in supporting roles but 1964 marked his spectacular entrance as the leader of the French boxoffice with no less than two major successes The Gendarm of St Tropez and Fantomas. He would never desert the box office top five until his death in 1983. De Funs had also previously worked with Bourvil he was the hot tempered butcher in The Crossing of Paris and no one can forget the cave scene where he almost stole the thunder of Gabin and Bourvil. There was just something in this human Donald Duck that magnificently completed the gentle goofiness of Bourvil like Laurel and Hardy and George and Lenny. Grard Oury felt the potential and wrote a story where the two comical schools would finally interact.But sometimes they can collide and have regrettable side effects. Bourvil had just finished a movie he made with his alltime idol Fernandel in 1963 it was the first and the last. Bourvil was disappointed by the prima donna attitude of Fernandel during the shooting and swore they would never work together. Fernandel probably felt guilty about it as he delivered one of the most poignant eulogies to Bourvil in 1970. But things were different with De Funs as he was still a lesser shining star than Bourvil. There was mutual respect between the two men and their only differences were in the acting methods De Funs needed rehearsals and Bourvil was a natural. But apart from that the chemistry worked and The Sucker released in 1965 proved Oury's intuition right as De Funs and Bourvil are still regarded as the most iconic pairing of French cinema represented by that unforgettable concluding scene where they both laugh together. The film attracted 11 millions of viewers which is a remarkable box office gross even by today's standards. It is still by the way in the Top 20.And as soon as the movie starts there's a joyous accordion and violin melody playing while we admire the Parisian landscape the score exudes the optimism of what they call now the Glorious Thirties this blessed era of prosperity from the war aftermath to the early 70's. And to add to this little joy in the air it's summertime and good old Antoine Marchal Bourvil embarks on his 2CV the ultimate popular car to go South. And then there's one of the most famous accidents of French cinema where the Bentley of Leopold Saroyan hits the poor 2CV which is instantly dislocated like in a Tex Avery cartoon. It isn't much the accident than Bourvil's reaction that makes the scene he's still holding his wheel and shouts now it won't work as well that's for sure an improvised line that took De Funs offguard and you can see him hiding his face to cover a nervous laugh. This scene marks the first direct interaction between two actors two worlds the snobbish bourgeois and the popular sucker.But this accidental encounter gives Saroyan an idea as a syndicate of crime member he decides to use Augustin as a decoy to a sinister plan consisting on taking a Cadillac from Naples to Paris in this car gold heroine jewels including the most precious in the world are hidden. So in order to avoid the police who better than an inoffensive schmuck who looks like Antoine to drive the car without danger? Saroyan promises to track Antoine in the process unbeknownst to him a gang of Italian gangsters are also on his tail. And this is how the crazy road movie with the Italian and French seaside in the backdrop starts. But if the story gives enough material for both actors to show their comical talents it is really De Funs who steals the show with two incredible scenes one where he's imitating his personal idol Charlie Chaplin using a Rossini opera and garage props like the Jewish Barber his scissors during Brahms' Hungarian Dance and another in the shower where he confronts a huge bodybuilder with the most sensual and ambiguous smile. This is just classic De Funs. As for Bourvil he's never as funny as when he interacts with his companion but the film makes a right choice by not making him a sucker all the time and in a move that reminded me of the conclusion of Dinner of Schmucks the sucker is the one who leads the show and gets it to the delightful conclusion where the two men have the last laugh together.The film's success was a surprise to everyone and convinced Oury to make a second film with Bourvil and De Funs this one would be the highestgrossing French movie of all time La Grande Vadrouille and this time the two men will act together because this might be the one reproach we can address to The Sucker there are not many scenes with De Funs and Bourvil. But there was enough for De Funs to take the reins of French cinema and consolidates his status after the untimely passing of Bourvil and Fernandel in the early 70's. The Sucker can be seen as the historical transition toward the De Funs era a torch passing moment between two comedic giants. And it beautifully shows in the poster.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why the plane crashed in the first place is uncertain when the plane crossed over the island it's engines where running and the pilot had both elevator and aileron control judging by the way it maneuvered around obstacles on the island. The crash was of course necessary to setup the main plot of the movie. This is a pretty standard action flick except the main Rambo type hero character is female. Like most movies of this genre the hero's seem to be immune to pain or serious physical injury even when they jump out of a moving jeep and slide down the side of a cliff apart from the occasional cut or scratch. The hero's never miss a shot while the villains can take out a sundry character with a single shot but can't seem to hit the hero's even when there are several of them using machine guns. If you like action flicks it is quite entertaining but like most of this type of movie one is not expected to take them seriously. I must admit I was a little surprised by MagicStarfire's review and his obsession with lesbian sexuality I was not sure we had watched the same movie. I saw Mariel Hemingway's character as a welltrained exmarine as capable tough and resourceful as any regardless of gender. I have never subscribed to the belief that unless a woman is weak and helpless she must be a lesbian. The tension between the to female character's I saw as territorial in that the reporter was encroaching on her relationship with the Vicepresident. However I guess one sees what one wants to see. As to the suggestion that it should have had a sex scene I feel that given the time frame the events are supposed to have occurred the plot scenario and the pace of the film any sex scene regardless of sexual orientation would have been inappropriate Evan if MagicStarfire would have given more points. PS with apology to MagicStarfire it appears that we were not watching quite the same movie in the Australian release for some reason all references to Mariel Hemingway's characters sexuality has been edited out so the character comes across as a strong resourceful woman and in the context of the plot such as it is the characters sexual orientation is irrelevant there is no reason why a strong resourceful woman has to be a lesbian.Goofs In the opening scene's in the aircraft despite the apparent turbulence affecting the passengers the cards and glasses did not slide around on the polished wood table although the liquid in the glasses did slop around slightly.Incorrect procedureWhen the six passengers put on their life jackets they all inflated them immediately. If you inflate the life jacket before you leave the plane it will pin you to the ceiling with the rising water making it extremely difficult if not imposable to get out.When the plane crashes into the sea with enough force to rip the engines from the wings the cards still do not slide off the table even as the water rushes in the cards are still there.".

Like most movies of this genre the hero's seem to be immune to pain or serious physical injury even when they jump out of a moving jeep and slide down the side of a cliff apart from the occasional cut or scratch. The hero's never miss a shot while the villains can take out a sundry character with a single shot but can't seem to hit the hero's even when there are several of them using machine guns. If you like action flicks it is quite entertaining but like most of this type of movie one is not expected to take them seriously. I must admit I was a little surprised by MagicStarfire's review and his obsession with lesbian sexuality I was not sure we had watched the same movie. I saw Mariel Hemingway's character as a welltrained exmarine as capable tough and resourceful as any regardless of gender. I have never subscribed to the belief that unless a woman is weak and helpless she must be a lesbian. The tension between the to female character's I saw as territorial in that the reporter was encroaching on her relationship with the Vicepresident. However I guess one sees what one wants to see. As to the suggestion that it should have had a sex scene I feel that given the time frame the events are supposed to have occurred the plot scenario and the pace of the film any sex scene regardless of sexual orientation would have been inappropriate Evan if MagicStarfire would have given more points. PS with apology to MagicStarfire it appears that we were not watching quite the same movie in the Australian release for some reason all references to Mariel Hemingway's characters sexuality has been edited out so the character comes across as a strong resourceful woman and in the context of the plot such as it is the characters sexual orientation is irrelevant there is no reason why a strong resourceful woman has to be a lesbian.Goofs In the opening scene's in the aircraft despite the apparent turbulence affecting the passengers the cards and glasses did not slide around on the polished wood table although the liquid in the glasses did slop around slightly.Incorrect procedureWhen the six passengers put on their life jackets they all inflated them immediately. If you inflate the life jacket before you leave the plane it will pin you to the ceiling with the rising water making it extremely difficult if not imposable to get out.When the plane crashes into the sea with enough force to rip the engines from the wings the cards still do not slide off the table even as the water rushes in the cards are still there.";

	schema:reviewBody "possible thematic spoilers Excuse the length of this comment I feel like I might be one of few IMDb users to see the film while it's in theaters so I'm trying to be thorough For years Hollywood has been releasing bigbudget testosteronedriven action films. Now finally Here! TV has released its own challenge to the dominant paradigm.The film begins with a standard action plot the Vice President's plane is caught in a storm and crashlands off the coast of a Pacific island filled with violent rebel insurgents. Fortunately the VP was a former Marine and he and his Secret Service agent manage to survive the crash along with a garrulous and driven reporter played with aplomb by Jill Bennett. When discovered by the rebels the agent must save the VP find a way off the island and get the girl. What's the twist? The agent is herself female.There are many difficulties confronting any filmmaker deciding to show a gay or lesbian relationship. Primarily the trouble is one of focus should the story take precedence over a character's sexuality as in your average heterosexual film or does a character need to have an emotional coming out wherein their sexuality pulls focus from the plot? Unfortunately those films that choose the latter path often end up losing any sort of impact on the audience as their narratives become lost in a jumble of sexual definition and redefinition. Happily In Her Line of Fire begins with  and maintains  sexual tension between the two female leads while the males who know Delaney seem to respect and jokingly admire her attraction to women.Even when these issues of plot can be resolved to include sexuality without fixating on  and thereby othering it women rarely stand on their own as lesbians. Films like Kissing Jessica Stein or Chasing Amy suffer from this second problem if one can call it that whereby characters that are bisexual or bicurious stand in for true lesbians giving a lesbian audience little with which to relate even in supposedly lesbianthemed pictures.By choosing not to overemphasize the women's sexuality In Her Line of Fire joins what will hopefully be a new upsurge in films including such recent fare as Imagine Me  You which have the potential for mainstream acceptance due to their classical Hollywood style and narratives while still depicting lesbian and gay relationships.Of course the main drive of the film is its plot which stands up to most typical action fare. The film is violent enough for any thrillseeking viewer whether their interest lies in the women's relationship or not unfortunately the violence is not tempered with enough sex and comic relief  some of which falls flat  but despite this In Her Line of Fire lives up capably to the legacy of action movies preceding it.The main flaw of the film is the lack of solid actingwriting on the part of the rebel leaders. The onedimensional badguy is somewhat played out and is not revitalized by the mediocrity of this film's characterization. The best  and most surprising  part of the film is Jill Bennett who manages to outshine most of the other actors. Her relationship with Mariel Hemingway's character builds suitably and though clearly contrived gives her an opportunity to express a range of emotion that feels natural.In terms of the visual style it certainly seems like a madeforTV film and hopefully will get a strong run on DVD. My tastes tend not to run to action films and though not the best film I've ever seen  or even seen in the last month  hopefully this will be a precursor to stronger films with similar themes. Certainly worth watching and I'd recommend it for a rainy day.".

It has got to me in my bottom 5 movies of all time and I did work in a movie store for more than 12 years. I always rent Mariel's movies since I used to take tennis lessons alongside her sister Margeaux. It makes me wonder what is going on with her and her agent or whatever. Also there was this girlgirl thing at toward the end that was pretty ooky. I know movies can be hard to get right but it would be better sometimes if they'd apply more quality control. I think I've watched worse movies at least 3 or 4. I have a sense of humor about these kinds of things. If you want to watch a pretty bad movie go ahead.".

I learned from watchin' the opening the movie was called Air Force Two which I seriously doubt was a sequel to the Harrison Ford film. Only as I found the film's page here on IMDb have I learned that Mariel Hemingway was playing a lesbian. When I was watching the movie I wouldn't notice it as it just appeared to be another shoot'emup mindless action film w Spanish dubbing.  yep once I also found out that those reviewing this movie were Austrians I must've been the only nonHispanic American watching it.  I also thought this movie was made in the 80s90s not 2006! R U kiddin'? A movie where the bad guys are jungle insurgents a la IranContra Sandinistas Manuel Noriega?  made while the War on Terrorism's in progress? Well that could explain why In Her Line of Fire didn't come to a theater near me or other Americans. The film was such a blatant throwback to those Rambo or Die Hard flics. Even if this film is available here in the U.S. I ain't sure if I can find it in the bargain bin at Costco or Target. Besides this is the type of film that Telefutura would air on a Wednesday as opposed to a Sunday night which would draw more viewers. That's why I saw more promos for SpiderMan 2 when it was on Telefutura on that Sunday night. This is for sure a film you will likely stumble upon when nothing good's on TV  not a movie you prepare for by w8n' for it 2 start watch it w others  have a snack.".

Harrison Ford as always did an excellent job as the star of this movie. Gary Oldman the greatest movie bad guy of all time did not disappoint. It was cool to see Glenn Close as the vice president keeping the bloodsucking politicians at bay. Another great performance although not given enough credit is from William H. Macy who is one of my favorite of the lesser known actors.The storyline is fair but nothing special or too original. The only difference is in this case the president is not a hostage but the man fighting the terrorists. Terrorists manage to hijack Air Force One and kidnap many important people the presidents kids some politicans some secret service guys and a bunch of extras they threw in to fill up the plane. They thought the president had escaped but the truth was he stayed behind to fight the terrorists retake the plane and save his family.This movie is a great action flick which I enjoyed a lot. It's not meant to be groundbreaking or anything like that it's just meant to be enjoyed. So go out and enjoy it!".

That's to say Ford appears acts and just plain feels like he should be President. Come one who saw this movie and wanted him to run. Gary Oldman's performance as the main villain Ivan should be up there with the likes of Alan Rickman's Hans from Die Hard and John Malkovich's LearyBoothCarney from In the Line of Fire coincidentally directed by Wolfgang Peterson as well. Glenn Close pulls of the Vice President role with smirks and spunk.Stars aside I think the supporting cast should get an equal if not harder pat on the back. These guysand girls. really made the movie. They're the ones that brought the chuckles and caused gasps. Wendy Crewson The Good Son nailed her role with more grace than a first lady has actually shown in the last recallable years. Paul Guilfoyle CSI The Negotiator was the kind gentle best buddy chiefofstaff who brought a small smile to your face every time he is onscreen. Xander Berkeley 24 Terminator 2 plays the chilling secret service agent Gibbs. The lovable William H. Macy plays the goodmannered Air Force Officer who puts himself in harm's way for the President more time than the Secret Service agents do. He just doesn't get enough screen time toward the beginning. And Dean Stockwell will have you cussing under your breath as the powerhungry Secretary of Defense. And it seems that Wolfgang Peterson watched every great ActionMilitary movie of the past 3 years and hired all those briefing room generals. For this I applaud him. As for the terrorist they rival those of Die hard. Cold stonefaced funny smooth and just plain hateable they did their job.The bulk of the movie takes place aboard the Air Force One no kidding eh?. And boy do you believe it. The production designer Williams Sandell obviously paid attention to detail mimicking the real Presidential Aircraft. Small claustrophobic and believable.Andrew W. Marlowe's script gets it job done as well. Nothing award winning. It's everything you would expect given the story it has to tell. Couple times it will make you cringe but again look what it needs to accomplish.The late Jerry Goldsmith's score for this movie is a hands down classic. Only having two weeks to score the film after Peterson rejected Randy Newman's work Goldsmith with the help of Joel Mcneely composed one of the most bombastic riveting emotional suspenseful and patriotic scores I've heard come out of the film world. It works perfectly with the movie.A few times your mind is going to be stretch you may have to resort to the It's just a movie mindset. Overall its fun. Not a bad way to spend 2 hours. Harrison Ford for President.".

And boy do you believe it. The production designer Williams Sandell obviously paid attention to detail mimicking the real Presidential Aircraft. Small claustrophobic and believable.Andrew W. Marlowe's script gets it job done as well. Nothing award winning. It's everything you would expect given the story it has to tell. Couple times it will make you cringe but again look what it needs to accomplish.The late Jerry Goldsmith's score for this movie is a hands down classic. Only having two weeks to score the film after Peterson rejected Randy Newman's work Goldsmith with the help of Joel Mcneely composed one of the most bombastic riveting emotional suspenseful and patriotic scores I've heard come out of the film world. It works perfectly with the movie.A few times your mind is going to be stretch you may have to resort to the It's just a movie mindset. Overall its fun. Not a bad way to spend 2 hours. Harrison Ford for President.";

When you want the perfect blend of drama and action you call Harrison Ford think The Fugitive for example... don't think Star Wars.Ford is great as a diplomat but equally as good with a gun and in a fight. But the real star of this is Gary Oldman who plays an evil and soulless terrorist determined to get his old general freed from prison. Oldman plays it like he means it killing mercilessly while still appearing cold and calculated rather than insane. The writer even had the decency to have Oldman deliver lines condemning the president for bombing villages while being against terror.Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell made great supporting stars and even William H. Macy seemed a little less flamboyant than usual in his role as a military man.This film is especially interesting in the context of our current president George W. Bush. Bush has also gone on record many times for not negotiating with terrorists and takes a hardline approach similar to Harrison Ford. What would Bush do if terrorists hijacked his plane or kidnapped his family? Even giving me that visual image made this film worth the viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plane is damaged one of his engines is out and he's leaking fuel. How can he make it? Something like that anyway. The clichs came so thick and fast I couldn't remember them all. I couldn't even GRASP them all quickly enough piled as they were one atop the other like a pile of Leggos.I don't really think it's necessary to bother with the script except to say a rogue group of Russians hijacks Air Force One is overcome by the President of the United States and most of the good guys are saved and all of the bad guys perish usually in some colorful fashion.Wolfgang Petersen made a gripping movie with Das Boot. It was a long flick of mostly quiet moments a leisurely examination of life aboard a UBoat punctuated with shocking moments of action. In Air Force One Petersen's talents have been  dare I say hijacked by Hollywood? There is no leisurely examination of anything. There is neither leisure nor examination. All the parts that might bore a twelveyearold weaned on Call of Duty have been cut out of the script and nothing is left but one recycled action scene after another some of them already parodied in Airplane backed up by a booming score.Here's an indication of how the movie was assembled the kind of thought that went into it. When it was released there appeared an article in the NY Times written by an actor whose name I now forget playing one of the characters whose name I don't know in innocent conversation with Harrison Ford as the President when shots are heard from elsewhere in Air Force One as the takeover starts.As the actor described the first runthrough at the sound of the gunshots he rose to his feet and sauntered over to the window to find out what was up. He was told he'd have to jump to his feet and run to the door. Why? he asked. The Secret Service is aboard there are security agents all over. Nobody could possibly be expecting an armed attack. A normal reaction would be to try to find out what the noise was. He was told by the director that everyone in the scene would immediately recognize the gunshots for exactly what they were. Ford a seasoned veteran of such attacks told the actor tiredly They're gunshots period. Why waste three or four flaccid seconds having the actor stroll to the door? That kind of dedication and efficiency is in evidence throughout Air Force One. Bang bang whoosh zap. The President by the way is practically superhuman. He speaks Russian albeit with a gloopi American accent. He cuts his bound wrists free and immediately disarms and kills two or three of his captors. I lost count. Well okay he was a CMH winner. But then how did he learn to fly a jumbo jet? Never mind.A more interesting question is how did they pick the villains? Kazakhistan rebels? A rogue group of Russians? This is rather retro stuff because absolutely nobody watching the movie knows or cares about Kazakhistan or its internal affairs. The simple fact is that viewers will see and hear the heavies speaking Russian and that will be enough for them. I forget when Crimson Tide was released using the same ploy. It's the Russkies again alright only a splinter group. The faces of American fighter pilots are illuminated by a comforting pale offwhite light while their opposite numbers are as green as algae. To top it off the Russian Premier looks like Jonathan Winters coming down from battery acid while our President looks exactly like Harrison Ford. And if you STILL don't get the point the Kazakhhomaniac rebels sing a rousing version of Die Internazionale. Nowadays of course nine years later they'd all be speaking Arabic.The movie offers some fascinating tidbits in addition to its knucklewhitening suspense. The set representing the interior of Air Force One for instance. It's full of nooks and crannies and it seems about the size of the Dixie Hotel. Functional furniture but comfortable and expensive. Soundproof bulletproof insulated against an atomic blast. A staff of welltrained servants who know when to leave the master alone to ponder weighty questions about the world's future. In all these respects it rather resembles my place. It also has a steam pipe which the list of clichs calls for just as in those factories or warehouses in which the final shootout takes place in other action movies. The steam pipe is shot up and people in pursuit of each other wisp their way through the mist. What is that steam pipe doing there? Have we been mistaken all these years about how jet engines work? Are modern airplanes really powered by the same plants that made the Stanley Steamer roll on its merry way? I half expected Ford to stumble across the gigantic elastic band that spun the engine blandes. What makes it finally so preposterous is the notion that this or any other country could organize itself with such alacrity and efficiency in the face of an unexpected emergency of these proportions. When the president finally contacts the situation room and asks who has taken over Air Force One the reply is A group of Russian ultranationalists. This is nothing more than cashing in on ancient hatreds for a buck. And we pay for that self satisfaction on the world stage by damaging the image of America abroad. How about a Russian movie in which a group of murdering thugs tries to kidnap Vladimir Putin and they are called American ultranationalists? How would we respond?As propaganda it is retrograde and execrable crap. As a movie it's just another Airport 97 with the president and his family aboard.".

In Air Force One Petersen's talents have been  dare I say hijacked by Hollywood? There is no leisurely examination of anything. There is neither leisure nor examination. All the parts that might bore a twelveyearold weaned on Call of Duty have been cut out of the script and nothing is left but one recycled action scene after another some of them already parodied in Airplane backed up by a booming score.Here's an indication of how the movie was assembled the kind of thought that went into it. When it was released there appeared an article in the NY Times written by an actor whose name I now forget playing one of the characters whose name I don't know in innocent conversation with Harrison Ford as the President when shots are heard from elsewhere in Air Force One as the takeover starts.As the actor described the first runthrough at the sound of the gunshots he rose to his feet and sauntered over to the window to find out what was up. He was told he'd have to jump to his feet and run to the door. Why? he asked. The Secret Service is aboard there are security agents all over. Nobody could possibly be expecting an armed attack. A normal reaction would be to try to find out what the noise was. He was told by the director that everyone in the scene would immediately recognize the gunshots for exactly what they were. Ford a seasoned veteran of such attacks told the actor tiredly They're gunshots period. Why waste three or four flaccid seconds having the actor stroll to the door? That kind of dedication and efficiency is in evidence throughout Air Force One. Bang bang whoosh zap. The President by the way is practically superhuman. He speaks Russian albeit with a gloopi American accent. He cuts his bound wrists free and immediately disarms and kills two or three of his captors. I lost count. Well okay he was a CMH winner. But then how did he learn to fly a jumbo jet? Never mind.A more interesting question is how did they pick the villains? Kazakhistan rebels? A rogue group of Russians? This is rather retro stuff because absolutely nobody watching the movie knows or cares about Kazakhistan or its internal affairs. The simple fact is that viewers will see and hear the heavies speaking Russian and that will be enough for them. I forget when Crimson Tide was released using the same ploy. It's the Russkies again alright only a splinter group. The faces of American fighter pilots are illuminated by a comforting pale offwhite light while their opposite numbers are as green as algae. To top it off the Russian Premier looks like Jonathan Winters coming down from battery acid while our President looks exactly like Harrison Ford. And if you STILL don't get the point the Kazakhhomaniac rebels sing a rousing version of Die Internazionale. Nowadays of course nine years later they'd all be speaking Arabic.The movie offers some fascinating tidbits in addition to its knucklewhitening suspense. The set representing the interior of Air Force One for instance. It's full of nooks and crannies and it seems about the size of the Dixie Hotel. Functional furniture but comfortable and expensive. Soundproof bulletproof insulated against an atomic blast. A staff of welltrained servants who know when to leave the master alone to ponder weighty questions about the world's future. In all these respects it rather resembles my place. It also has a steam pipe which the list of clichs calls for just as in those factories or warehouses in which the final shootout takes place in other action movies. The steam pipe is shot up and people in pursuit of each other wisp their way through the mist. What is that steam pipe doing there? Have we been mistaken all these years about how jet engines work? Are modern airplanes really powered by the same plants that made the Stanley Steamer roll on its merry way? I half expected Ford to stumble across the gigantic elastic band that spun the engine blandes. What makes it finally so preposterous is the notion that this or any other country could organize itself with such alacrity and efficiency in the face of an unexpected emergency of these proportions. When the president finally contacts the situation room and asks who has taken over Air Force One the reply is A group of Russian ultranationalists. This is nothing more than cashing in on ancient hatreds for a buck. And we pay for that self satisfaction on the world stage by damaging the image of America abroad. How about a Russian movie in which a group of murdering thugs tries to kidnap Vladimir Putin and they are called American ultranationalists? How would we respond?As propaganda it is retrograde and execrable crap. As a movie it's just another Airport 97 with the president and his family aboard.";

It's understood that some Americans would like to see Indiana Jones or Swarzenegger or Stallone as their president  Even though Gary Oldman is known for playing bad guys this time he did a bad job  he has nothing in common with Russians. Sorry Gary we know you have very good brains and lots of decent offers guess your agent didn't read the script carefully and when you realized how bad it was there was no turning back.....We laughed our asses off hearing those presumably Russian characters and trying to understand what they were saying. Actually the only Russian actor who spoke perfect Russian he said two words! was killed in the very beginning  Big mistake  And during the rest of the movie we were reading the English translation being unable to get through horrible American accents of the Russians.President Petrov is as funny as if the American president was called John Smith From our Russian point of view it's a surprise that this movie wasn't prohibited here in Russia. Well looks like our country has more freedom and sense of humour  We are happy that we watched this movie on the TV and didn't spend a single ruble on buying or renting it just lost 2 hours of our time otherwise we would have been sorry. Actually we don't really regret spending our time it's been a long time since we laughed that much on a movie that wasn't meant to be a comedy P.S.

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen good movies mediocre movies and bad movies. I have seen very bad European arty movies and very good U.S. ones despite being a little bit of a mass market product. But Air Force One is a movie that breaks all records of low quality and standards.What really puzzles me is why on earth respectable decent actors agree to play such idiotic characters in unbelievable stupid and overbudgeted productions. Of course I didn't expect to find an awardwinning movie with such a gringo topic but I did expect to have good acting with a fairly decent story nothing fantastic but at least worthy of spending two hours watching. This was not the case.Ok most of Hollywood movies go somewhere along these lines democracy defenders and Beacons of the World i.e. The U.S.suffer some kind of attack by some crazy fanatic and perverted representative of the forces of Evil i.e. anyone but the U.S. although the good ones are outnumbered outwitted and cornered by the evil ones they always find a way to overcome the crisis and win. In summary any of George Bush's pot dreams.

But Air Force One is a movie that breaks all records of low quality and standards.What really puzzles me is why on earth respectable decent actors agree to play such idiotic characters in unbelievable stupid and overbudgeted productions. Of course I didn't expect to find an awardwinning movie with such a gringo topic but I did expect to have good acting with a fairly decent story nothing fantastic but at least worthy of spending two hours watching. This was not the case.Ok most of Hollywood movies go somewhere along these lines democracy defenders and Beacons of the World i.e. The U.S.suffer some kind of attack by some crazy fanatic and perverted representative of the forces of Evil i.e. anyone but the U.S. although the good ones are outnumbered outwitted and cornered by the evil ones they always find a way to overcome the crisis and win. In summary any of George Bush's pot dreams.

I as a former US Navy SEAL am outraged. Whatever happened to the concept of technical assistance and for that matter continuity. This movie gives new meaning to the term disaster film. Where did scarface the Mexican computer genius come from. After 2 years his face still hadn't healed? I particularly liked the scene where the flight crew are engaging in banter in some country in Eastern Europe...right one where the buildings have Greek lettering on them. And the plane boss...the plane! According to electronic map the transponder which was turned off I believe showed that they were crossing Italy at a speed approaching 3500 mph. And while we're on that subject it would have been nice to have a shot of a REAL plane in flight and REAL scenery instead of 57 minutes of MS Flight Simulator 2003 graphics. I hope Bill Gates got his money up front and didn't have to wait for box office receipts. I really think that the Director and Producer of this monumental tribute to video trash should be heavily fined and sent to bed without supper. Try as I might I can find no connection between the opening scenes and the rest of the movie. Does the Writer or Director have ANY idea of the Chain of Command that flows downward from the President? Do they honestly think that a prepubescent squeakyvoiced suit can order a military strike on a civilian target in a sovereign nation? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

I can not imagine any of the people involved being able to go home and look at themselves in the mirror and believe that they earned an honest days work. Lets start from the beginning some of the worst possible acting that has ever occurred on the face of the planet. The corny lines where BRETT PRESCOTT tried to be funny are absolutely the biggest farce in the world. Um next would be the plot. Completely terrible difficult to follow considering there is not logical sequence and it down right sucks. Lybia I believe is spelled Libya but hey Who's counting? These special forces are rebels without a clue. The hand signals that BRETT uses really show how great of a leader he is. Then they raid the building and have a stare down for a while. Then they finally decide to shoot and they don't hold back one bit. They pepper the place pretty good leaving nothing behind. Then when exiting the building instead of leaving out the front door they decide to bomb through a stone wall in genius. Last of all they fail the mission by letting the hostage kill himself. Great job guys!!! Finally this takes us to the plane. Was it me or did the constant touching of the little boy by everyone kinda make you cringe. Anyways I'm not sure how many times that I counted PRESCOTT getting his ass beat getting his gun taken away getting passengers shot and killed and basically screwing up. Speaking of people getting killed did anyone notice as soon as someone got the slightest flesh wound they would instantly die ex... the pilot the terrorist with the hatchet that barely nicked his back. These terrorists were real smart cookies. They had numerous times to kill PRESCOTT but no they don't. Instead they kill the biggest threat the guy with the phone and of course the Buddhist. Wow good choices. The intel guys in DC really kept their composure well. I feel so much safer since 911 when dingleberries like that make decisions that affect our national security. Then that brings us to the HIspanic partners in all of this. Um...WHO THE HELL WERE THEY??????? Oh well no explanation. Then the Senator who by the way was apparently butt buddies with the president decided to make the ultimate sacrifice and said Lets Roll. Galliant effort as one flesh wound completely halted their lackluster efforts. Great job guys. Way to take one for your country. Finally the kid who decided to stroll up to the cockpit which was okay by the way helped land the plane. Hmmm. when the movie ended wasn't their still one terrorist still on the plane that was unaccounted for??? Ahh who cares anyway PRESCOTT did his country proud. One of the worst movies in history but funny enough I've enjoyed making fun of it so much I guess you could consider it entertaining after all. Thanks for reading this.".

Completely terrible difficult to follow considering there is not logical sequence and it down right sucks. Lybia I believe is spelled Libya but hey Who's counting? These special forces are rebels without a clue. The hand signals that BRETT uses really show how great of a leader he is. Then they raid the building and have a stare down for a while. Then they finally decide to shoot and they don't hold back one bit. They pepper the place pretty good leaving nothing behind. Then when exiting the building instead of leaving out the front door they decide to bomb through a stone wall in genius. Last of all they fail the mission by letting the hostage kill himself. Great job guys!!! Finally this takes us to the plane. Was it me or did the constant touching of the little boy by everyone kinda make you cringe. Anyways I'm not sure how many times that I counted PRESCOTT getting his ass beat getting his gun taken away getting passengers shot and killed and basically screwing up. Speaking of people getting killed did anyone notice as soon as someone got the slightest flesh wound they would instantly die ex... the pilot the terrorist with the hatchet that barely nicked his back. These terrorists were real smart cookies. They had numerous times to kill PRESCOTT but no they don't. Instead they kill the biggest threat the guy with the phone and of course the Buddhist. Wow good choices. The intel guys in DC really kept their composure well. I feel so much safer since 911 when dingleberries like that make decisions that affect our national security. Then that brings us to the HIspanic partners in all of this. Um...WHO THE HELL WERE THEY??????? Oh well no explanation. Then the Senator who by the way was apparently butt buddies with the president decided to make the ultimate sacrifice and said Lets Roll. Galliant effort as one flesh wound completely halted their lackluster efforts. Great job guys. Way to take one for your country. Finally the kid who decided to stroll up to the cockpit which was okay by the way helped land the plane. Hmmm. when the movie ended wasn't their still one terrorist still on the plane that was unaccounted for??? Ahh who cares anyway PRESCOTT did his country proud. One of the worst movies in history but funny enough I've enjoyed making fun of it so much I guess you could consider it entertaining after all. Thanks for reading this.";

I need to learn to specify my wishes because even though AIR MARSHAL does indeed turn Dean into a leading man the vehicle itself is pretty darn dreadful. With poor action scenes and a seriously flawed screenplay this is definitely one of the worst offerings from the Nu Image  Millennium catalogue.The story When a transEuropean flight is hijacked by extremists an undercover air marshal Cochran must find a way to save the passengers before the plane is shot down by the military.This movie was released in 2003 but might as well have been released 20 years earlier given its mindset. Hollywood never tires of vilifying Arab characters but AIR MARSHAL is so irredeemably embarrassing in its heavyhanded Islamophobia that one would almost think it's an ironic statement against it. The whole movie actually feels like a farce on traditional action moments of idiotic heroism e.g. the captain's roller coaster flying flow smoothly into the most harebrained coincidences e.g. the friendly stowaway while women fawn over hero Dean for no real reason and a child Luke Leavitt is almost sucked out of a sprung windowSPOILER an hour before he helps land the plane putting his video game experience to good use.Eli Danker leads the hijackers and even though his character is a walking clich he's a rare example of competent acting in the film. There's also good old Tim Thomerson playing a hostaged senator but he's mainly  there to pad the cast and doesn't do anything cool. Dean Cochran looks like he's enjoying himself but is stuck playing a completely unremarkable character. It's a relief when he can stop talking and fight but the four cramped brawls likewise lack any shred of uniqueness no shortage of slow motion though. A narrow body jet is an awkward place to stage an action flick to begin with but the characters don't care at all about wantonly firing guns  even purposely shooting the window that the aforementioned boy gets to see the outside of.I'd see another Dean Cochran action vehicle if such a thing ever came about but only if it were helmed by a completely different set of filmmakers. I haven't gotten into the ridiculously transparent special effects but only because they're the least of this one's problems. It's worth skipping.".

So glaring accuracy errors pointed out by other posters aside even the most uninitiated in military matters or warfare will see that a major faux pas is committed in the first five minutes of the film.

Plus there's the fact that much of the movie is shot with a jiggly camera to simulate turbulence I guess but is VERY distracting. The movie is full of flaws yes. But at the same time I can't say I was BORED with this movie. The bad parts of the movie are often entertaining in their own right.

	schema:reviewBody "It amazes me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this. Really. Let's forget for a second that the plot doesn't even give a single hint of originality... Most of the movies today are based on other movies' stories so a simple lack of originality is not that big a deal. But I can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie had never even got on a plane before shooting this. Because let's be honest that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous. To be sincere I think a 6yearsold child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable. Some examples following.The scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane. When they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like Ok push the 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard. Now those are not buttons. They should not be pushed they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot. That's something only planeaddicted would know you say? Wrong. The next scene you can see their fingers pushing the buttons... And of course the so called buttons don't move at all! Not even a single millimeter! And note that I haven't even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines are not like cars engine that you just turn the key and the magic happens... You have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on... Come on guys! You could have faked the movements at least!! Not to mention the hilarious final impact where the plane crashes against every single thing along the runway Light poles along the runway? What where they thinking?!... And the wings don't even get ripped off! It happened to me too once... Except the plane was made of Lego! What about the flight attendant? She's actually so skilled that she perfectly knows where the aux 1 and aux 2 fuses are in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit. Should we mention then the guy that can drive an ambulance and fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer? And how did he turn the other airplane engines on?Really I could go on hours with this stuff. This is the dumbest movie I've ever come across and I'm including garbage like Alone In The Dark and other stuff in the list. Want to do yourself a favor? Don't watch it.".

Because let's be honest that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous. To be sincere I think a 6yearsold child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable. Some examples following.The scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane. When they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like Ok push the 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard. Now those are not buttons. They should not be pushed they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot. That's something only planeaddicted would know you say? Wrong. The next scene you can see their fingers pushing the buttons... And of course the so called buttons don't move at all! Not even a single millimeter! And note that I haven't even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines are not like cars engine that you just turn the key and the magic happens... You have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on... Come on guys! You could have faked the movements at least!! Not to mention the hilarious final impact where the plane crashes against every single thing along the runway Light poles along the runway? What where they thinking?!... And the wings don't even get ripped off! It happened to me too once... Except the plane was made of Lego! What about the flight attendant? She's actually so skilled that she perfectly knows where the aux 1 and aux 2 fuses are in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit. Should we mention then the guy that can drive an ambulance and fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer? And how did he turn the other airplane engines on?Really I could go on hours with this stuff. This is the dumbest movie I've ever come across and I'm including garbage like Alone In The Dark and other stuff in the list. Want to do yourself a favor? Don't watch it.";

Some of the special effects aren't bad for what was a low budget and the movie is shot and lit fairly well. Still I was disappointed with this movie. Although I was not offended by the opening as some viewers will be the movie was made BEFORE 911 the movie manages to feel rather flat and surprisingly not exciting despite all the chaos that happens to the protagonists.

	schema:reviewBody "ok lets see where do I start I love watching action bmovies because I like to see what they can do with a low budget and to get a laugh out of the stolen stock footage and poor acting but this movie takes the cake.What we have here is a poor clone of Executive Decision.SPOILERS Standard plot terrorists take over the plane a unit is sent to eliminate them. Predictably just like in Executive Decision our hero team uses an air hatch to transfer to the 747. Yet what is the most surprising thing is that they didn't use the Executive Decision footage of that scene rather it looked like a computer merging since the resolution and color saturation of the 747 far exceeded the SR71. Anyways back to elite unit of commandos who in a real gunfight would shoot each others heads off with their positioning. They make their way into the plane and attack the terrorists with a deadly barrage of.....handguns. And the battle ensues as the good guys shoot 2 times and hide then the terrorists shoot 2 times and hide then the good guys shoot 2 times and hide etc.. until this intense battle ends when the terrorists decide instead of ducking they will wait for the good guys to come out and shoot them which they did all at once yet for some reason there are no bullet holes or blood stains on the commandos.Lucky for us our main hero IceT is alive and only his leg is wounded but in his poor attempt to act he gasps for air as if he had run a 2 hour marathon. But wait.. a stewardess saves the day and they prepare to land. But wait the bad guy has revived so he gets thrown out of an open door at 30000 feet and clings at the door while a fog machine covers him with fog to simulate clouds. Yet at 30000 ft the stewardess leans outside and closes the door without any problems or gusts of wind disturbing her clothes. As if that was not bad enough it could have been a good scene had she pretended to be scared and closed the door as if she was at 30000 feet instead of a stationary plane on the ground. Whats that called....oh yea...ACTING!And as we approach the runway with all this turbulence shaking the plane from the inside it looks as if they're on one of the most smoothest flights. The least they could have done is shake the camera star trek style. I understand that the budget is bad but this movie is so bad they overlook the smallest details which dont cost them anything. My rating  action0 comedy0 unintentional comedy10. Watch only if you need a good laugh.".

	schema:headline " Most Hilarious Ripoff I've Seen Lately...";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers? Maybe a few details but nothing too plot related. Not like it would matter with this movie. Air Rage blatantly rips off the midair infiltration premise of Executive Decision. IceT leads a team of four elite commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine must conceal invisible body armor as their idiotic tactics similar to what 3rd graders use when playing Star Wars on the playground lead them to absorb a hail of gunfire. What entertained me the most about this flick was the use of lookalike hasbeen actors. You'll immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked though it was so long ago that you probably won't be able to place it it was Porky's. Here Cyril plays a decent knockoff of a Bill Paxton character. Most Hilarious is porker Gil Gerard who's so fat that you will never recognize him as TV's Buck Rogers. Instead of evoking his mildly heroic character past Gerard gives us a passable performance of the crusty fat tough guy persona which was clearly imagineered for John Goodman. Finally Alex Cord gives us a nice hybrid lookalike performance as a Chuck ConnorsKirk Douglas type. In the 10 years since New Jack City IceT's acting has deteriorated remarkably. It's not acting so much as regurgitation of lines that he might have actually memorized. One of the items that plays into this movie is a CDROM of classified information. It's being hand carried and it's apparently and unbelievably not encrypted despite the securitysavvy aura of Gerard's NSA character. What a joke. I'm severely doubting that the information purported to be on the CD would ever even all be assembled into a portable format. Despite being in a closed aircraft without silencers the gunfire is about as loud as canned air and causes nary a person to flinch so apparently no foley budget. The assortment of weapons chosen is pretty funny. The flight attendant's use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film. When she takes intuitively to the miniUzi pistol which has got to be one of the worst pistol designs ever that's just too stupid. A true elite team would carry MP5s for this type thing or maybe SOCOMM .45s or even customized Hi Powers if they were really old school or maybe something FN 5.7 if new school... The lameo standard issue 92Fs are totally unbelievable having lost most of their cool after Lethal Weapon I. The bad guys supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types have an assorted mixture of absurdity like the aforementioned miniUzi pistol and a Tec9 with the infamous nonfunctional barrel extender that isn't a silencer. There was one touch of realism on which I would like to correct the other reviewers The flight attendant and IceT did lower the craft to 10000 feet for breathable air before they opened the door. And I also got the impression that the flight attendant was NOT able to get the door closed that she basically just gave up on that point. As far as the landing there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before touchdown. Sigh. Only the Dukes of Hazard eluding Roscoe P. Coltrane at the pass could shame this movie for use of stock footage. They obviously chose the incredible and retired SR71 because they couldn't get stock of an F117. Aside from the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001 let's also forget for a moment that the SR71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the B2 and that at point blank range... Well I'm no expert but I'm having doubts as to whether it would be invisible on Radar. As others have pointed out the repeated references to F15s when they were showing F 16s was laughable. Details of the 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would put that few passengers on a 747 to begin with not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring. Wow. What a show. Catch it on Stars or something. Don't pay to rent it but do watch it for laughs. In contention for worst movie ever right up there with No Holds Barred which at least had some originality.".

Plot notwithstanding when a movie's action revolves around airplanes you'd think the writersproducersdirector or ANYONE! would do a little bit of homework as to at least a FEW of the details. The mistakes were so glaring that I was fuming by the end of the movie. Here are just a few I'm glad I missed the SR71 sequence  certain to have been worse than the Air Force One F117 spectacle. Commercial airlines usually have their logos painted on the aircraft rather than BOEING 747  likely the cheap use of some Boeing advertisingpublicity footage by the director. Exposed wiring connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house wiring much less multimillion dollar aircraft avionics wiring. Airplanes like the 747 rely on pressure alone rather than ship's supply oxygen to maintain breathable air and if they did rely on an onboard supply the canister would be far bigger than fist sized. Medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a threaded hose connection. Those were F16s NOT F15s. Mach 1 speed of sound would be difficult to attain on a static engine run up for takeoff watch the airspeed indicator. Standard formation is simply keeping the formation inside one nautical mile route formation is what they were flying  not the most useful formation for an intercept. Acquiring missile lock is not likely to get an airline pilot's attention  they have no radar detection or countermeasures. Wait for my signal is not interflight communication for preparing to fire anything. Depressurization from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate steep left bank. Yelling into a headset does not make it transmit. Magnetic headings are given as headings not bearings and headings are between 001 and 360 degrees compasses in the air are just like compasses on the ground! so turning left not port  that's a boat thing from a bearing of 618 to 502 is just stupid. It is in most cases impossible to just turn the yoke left until the correct heading is reached  that sort of thing will result in 360 degree rolls until the yoke is centered again. The likelihood of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the autopilot is only slightly greater than the likelihood of her actually landing the jet safely. Airplanes don't stall immediately upon pulling the throttle back and 747s have more than one little lever to control the multiengine thrust. Flaps are lowered in increments usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear extension not seconds before landing good way to crash. Wheel brakes are required to stop an airplane simply pulling the throttles this time a different lever in the movie to idle will just allow you to go off the end of the runway at a slower speed. Did I mention that those fighter aircraft were F16s and NOT F15s? Guess I did And that's just what I REMEMBER from recently watching this horrific movie.".

Loading passengers into an aft baggage compartment supposedly accesible from the cabin  Even if such a compartment existed placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable. 4. Hollow point bullets that won't damage the aircraft. 5. The entire landing procedure was so bad I wanted to puke. 6. An SR71 of all planes with a pressure seal hatch 7.

Hollow point bullets that won't damage the aircraft. 5. The entire landing procedure was so bad I wanted to puke. 6. An SR71 of all planes with a pressure seal hatch 7. Opening a cabin door outward  into the wind  in flight!!Ah nuts it was just a truly lousy movie.  Gotta make the list of bottom 10 of the year.";

Just a few of the awful moments in the movie A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds?!? Thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience. When on the runway perfectly straight of course she is instructed to pull on the flaps HUH!! Come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power! I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss take my word for it!".

To start with the technical first there are a LOT of mistakes regarding the airplane. I won't list them here but just mention the coloring of the plane. They didn't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline but instead used a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times before only much much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early. Also I was on the bad guys' side all the time in the movie because the good guys were so stupid. Executive Decision should without a doubt be you're choice over this one even the Turbulencemovies are better. In fact every other movie in the world is better than this one.".

Are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly?Although it's IceT who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at ACTING while he's not busy putting the c back in front of rap who is glorified on the cover the movie actually stars the less than amazing Kim Oja as a stewardess who is 'surprisingly' OVERLOOKED by the five hijackers which naturally comes back to haunt them. As for the rest of the cast the only person I managed to recognize was Steve Hytner more commonly known as Kenny Bania from Seinfeld.I can't forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie when a hijacker used about a POUND of PLASTIQUE to blow a lock off a door... BRILLIANT.The plot was unnaturally predictable.The script  atrocious. It got to the point where I could say something which I felt would make a stupid comment and it would be the next line in the movie.As for special effects... the only thing special about this movie is that I wasted the cost of electricity to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes.And the title  the movie DID take place in the Air.

The Chief Judge Adjutant General Harlan Prescott Cord throws out their initial plea agreement probably so he could bellow at them and then give them the maximum punishment. Later on Prescott boards a plane with his assistant that looks exactly like Eugene Levy. Sykes and his disgraced army men board the same plane and take it hostage. Now with complete chaos on board only one man can come in and save the day Matt Marshall IceT. But because he gets wounded in a firefight he isn't as active in daysaving as he should be. That's when spunky flight attendant Kelly Young Oja gets into the act. One minute she's serving drinks to obnoxious passengers like Morton Hytner the next minute she's killing baddies and flying the plane. Will everyone on board make a safe landing...or will they be overcome with their AIR RAGE?First came Executive Decision 1996. Then came Strategic Command 1997. Now comes Air Rage an overlong unnecessary addition to the planehostage movie canon. Over its 100 minute running time you won't see anything you haven't seen before. Another plane is taken hostage another strike force is brought in to save the day another terrorist wants yet another CDROM filled with information and it all seems very very familiar. The only actual air rage is felt by the viewer as he takes in this repetitive muck.After we were watching the movie for a while we noticed IceT was nowhere in sight so we went on IceT watch. Despite appearing very prominently on the box art Ice doesn't show up until exactly 40 minutes in. And even after that he's not a forceful hero because he's injured and in pain for a good amount of time. If there's a main hero here it's Kelly the Stewardess. We were happy to see Oja not be put in an ineffectual stewardess role and instead get in on the action. But she's not on the box art. Could it be sexism? Maybe because he was fresh off of fellow plane flick Stealth Fighter 1999 where he was the baddie perhaps IceT was sick of planes and he doesn't care as much this time around. And is it just us or is it racist that IceT of all people leads a Black Ops team where the code name is Blackbird?Pretty much the only bright spot in this air disaster of a movie is the presence of Alex Cord as the General. His presence is great and his voice is fantastic. He should have narrated the movie. That might have fixed things. As seems to be standard for Fred Olen Ray while the movie itself is substandard he gets a lot of great character actors to shoulder the weight of the project. This seems to mitigate the cruddiness of the proceedings somewhat. Jack McGee Glynn Turman and Gil Gerard are all welcome faces and they do their best. Even Steve Hytner immediately recognizable as Banya from TV's Seinfeld is here and he plays an unlikeable jerk very well. But it's just not enough to overcome the lack of originality here and the boredom that ensues from it.Pro tip If you want to watch something like this but want to see a movie that's actually good and very entertaining watch Passenger 57 instead.".

The Chief Judge Adjutant General Harlan Prescott Cord throws out their initial plea agreement probably so he could bellow at them and then give them the maximum punishment. Later on Prescott boards a plane with his assistant that looks exactly like Eugene Levy. Sykes and his disgraced army men board the same plane and take it hostage. Now with complete chaos on board only one man can come in and save the day Matt Marshall IceT. But because he gets wounded in a firefight he isn't as active in daysaving as he should be.

It's bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence but when you find yourself groaning over and over again you have to conclude that the director also isn't the brightest bulb in the movie business nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place.

It may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser. I see no point in summarizing the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case for to do so would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand.

The twists were terrible the story was terrible but had potential the acting was fine but they were all given a terrible script and story to deal with.The first review posted is so fake it's not even funny and to point out this film does not have the dead reanimated it's just a lie to pull in zombie film fans.The one good thing about the film is that the plot could of been interesting if it took off much sooner it took about 50 minutes for the plot to form then the film is over shortly after.If you want 120mins of people running around a plane screaming and various closeups of a shaking box then this will be perfect for you.";

There are numerous plot holes  some novice acting throughout but somehow I was unable to stop watching maybe I'm just a sucker for B movie airplane horrors. There was just enough mystery  level of suspense to rope me in to the end even though I was sure I would be rolling my eyes over it. Actually there was quite a bit of eye rolling I laughed at a good part of it. I won't even begin to lay down the plot I went in blind  I think that's why it worked. There were a few recognizable actors from the UK to give credit to with Craig Conway  Billy Murray both with long careers in many memorable films though they may have been limited with the script here. Hell at least it was better than a SyFy channel film although I don't recommend going to any great lengths to obtain this time killer.If you choose to rent it on PPV just be sure it's either on .99 special or that you just happen to be a fan of the genre in the mood for an off beat suspensethriller to have fun with while you wait for people to die. I'll give it a 510 it tried  while it failed in some areas it was entertaining to the end not bad for 2AM  a laugh. Anyone who says this is the worst they have seen has a VERY limited experience in the genre!".

And there was less than twenty people in total on the flight including the staff. It was just so implausible.The characters in the movie were fair enough actually though I personally didn't fully grasp the way that they were behaving in the given situation and a lot of the things that was done were so out there that I didn't buy into it for one second. The acting was actually alright the actors and actresses just had some really outrageous characters and dialogue to work with.Despite these faults and flaws then Airborne was actually fair enough entertainment because I stuck around throughout the entire movie wanting to see just what would happen next. However that being said this is hardly a movie that I will watch a second time. The movie is not scary nor does it really manage to work out any great thrills or suspense. It is below average in every sense unfortunately.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what movie the first couple of reviewers watched but it was not this one. There is no snowstorm contrary to the plot synopsis. The plane is the last one out to to a hurricane or tropical storm moving into the flight plan. It can clearly be seen in the credit sequence that rain and high winds not snow is causing devastation. There are also no zombies or reanimated dead in this movie. The plot is a little ridiculous but not at all twisty. The last plane out to New York takes off just before a storm makes flights impossible. There are very few people on board. At the last minute one of the stewardesses is replaced by a steward who looks middle eastern. Great pains are taken to play on Muslim  terrorist sentiment. You also see a crate loaded. The crate contains a priceless Chinese vase. The vase contains the earthbound spirit of a lightning God who is looking for a soul to possess. The crate occasionally shakes and makes gas like shimmers in the air. Meanwhile the passengers board. Most of them are not nice people. There is a gun runner and his two thugs two soldiers being sent home from Afghanistan accused of war crimes and an annoying drunk. The rest of the passengers are pretty much clichs the young couple who just want to have sex all over the plane the doctor whose daughter was just killed an American who talks all the time a woman who is traveling to see the world and an old man who is actually some sort of government man who has devoted years to getting the vase into his hands.People start disappearing shortly into the flight. After much unnecessary yelling and screaming and posturing that is frankly just boring and annoying the doctor notices the plane is turning off course. After quite a while longer of paranoia and turning on each other you find out the truth. The head stewardess a manly woman named Harriet is in league with one of the weapon dealer's thugs to hijack the plane and steal the vase. Between them they killed the pilots and all the dead people except the white steward. No one takes credit for him. The doctor then appears to be possessed and kills himself prompting the government agent to tell the story of the vase. Harriet while possessed shoots the vase freeing the spirit to jump among the plane passengers still living. There is much mayhem and most of the remaining characters are killed. The government agent takes over the plane and attempts to crash it into the ocean. The possessed thug tries to stop him. The blond stewardess realizes the old man is right and they all need to die to contain the spirit. She goes into the cargo hold and after some violence and more death crosses two wires that apparently make the plane drop out of the sky in her own words. Unfortunately the possessed traveling girl screams into the microphone seconds before the crash and the spirit is able to possess someone in the airport tower who was trying to save them. The acting is actually not bad but there are many places where the scripting just plays out as unrealistic. People don't really act like that or say things like that. It isn't the actors' fault. Mainly it was an unbelievable plot that took much too long to start unraveling and contained way too many extraneous details and side stories.".

The story never engages bogged down by sluggish pacing the story taking far too long to get going a fair few draggy irrelevant scenes and trying to do too much at once and doing it very badly indeed. You feel no emotional connection to the characters and know next to nothing about them while the dialogue is stilted and improvisedsounding often and while you can excuse lowbudget there was excuse for a lack of effort put into the special effects. Airborne is shot in a rather drab and veering on amateurish way is uninterestingly scored and flatly and characterlessly directed. Overall very very poor not worth bothering with. 110 Bethany Cox".

None of the characters saw the man leave and none of them even seemed to remember him except for one person!.Also how can a man go missing on an Airoplaine? especially a man as big as him?.It does Not make any sense to me and it doesn't make sense that the killer can kill this man and nobody notices! nobody see's or hears a thing?.How was that even possible? i have No idea.Later in the film a few body's are found and its revealed that someone is killing off the passengersalthough they didn't really need to explain that because it was pretty obvious what was going on from the start. This film is very predictable and very flawed and the film has a few plot holes and allot of the characters did stupid things which made me not like any of themand the one guy i did like who happened to be the lazy guy he then started acting stupid too which made me not like him anymore either and the ending of this film completely destroyed It!. There are so many stupid twists in this film and things that don't make any sensebut the ending was the worst part of the film for me its the ending that i hated and found the stupidest!. This film has one of the most ridiculous endings iv'e ever seen!. Please Avoid this film! it is very Ridicoulous! and poorly written.".

Malcolm Hamill is responsible for getting the plane safely to where it needs to be before retiring. Soon after take off the passengers begin to notice strange things going on as one by one the passengers start to disappear. Tensions begin to mount until they find the pilots both dead then fear takes over. Going in I had pretty low expectations for this one which may have helped in my enjoyment of it. This was better then I expected and for being another stuckonaplaneinflight movie this actually had a little twist to the genre. This movie is Brate at best though as the biggest stars are Mark Hamill and the old guy from Snatch. This is not really a movie to rush out and buy but this does the job if you are looking for a rental to entertain you for an hour or so. Overall nothing amazing but entertaining and keeps your attention. I kinda liked it. I surprisingly give it a B.".

What do they tell you? Basically you should know that this is little more than a low budget British thriller with no real stars. If you feel you can put up with that for just under an hour and a half give it a go.Airborne is about an airliner which takes off from England bound for America. There's not many passengers on it and soon there's even less when they start getting murdered one by one. There's plenty of red herrings and I doubt you'll guess what's really happening as there are one or two nice twists. Of course for every plus point I can name there are a fair few low points  lack of character development daft writing here and there and a moment of sheer disbelief at the end.I know it wasn't great but I still didn't think it was all together bad  definitely worth more than a lowly 3.810. About the only truly tragic thing about it was how much weight Mark Hamill has put on since he last wielded a lightsabre. I hope the Jedi order have a good weightloss plan if he's going to reprise his role for Disney's episodes 79.".

	schema:headline " Strange fun little planebound movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those low budget British movies that drags in loads and loads of familiar faces so that their names can be plastered all over the DVD cover to hopefully shift a few copies. It seems to be made by the same sort of producers who released the likes of DEAD CERT and loads of other recent British gangster movies.AIRBORNE is a planebound horrorcumthriller that mixes up both a tale of supernatural possession with a more conventional hijackingturnedrobbery. It's a story that plays its cards very close to its chest for the most part refusing to reveal much to the viewer until the last 20 minutes as a result it's the sort of film to start making you feel restless over the amount of questions asked and lack of forthcoming answers. On the other hand it's often tense and sometimes exciting featuring some mild gore and plenty of twists to keep you watching. The production values are good enough so that you don't notice the lack of budget and the strong cast helps.Mark Hamill is featured prominently on the packaging but turns out to have one of those boring guy on the ground roles but the other cast members fare better. The wonderful Alan Ford plays to type as a gangster Billy Murray is the usual tough guy and Andrew Shim acquits himself very well as a soldier. The only weak spot in the cast is Gemma Atkinson who comes across as totally wooden playing a stewardess who told her she could act?".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of those low budget British movies that drags in loads and loads of familiar faces so that their names can be plastered all over the DVD cover to hopefully shift a few copies. It seems to be made by the same sort of producers who released the likes of DEAD CERT and loads of other recent British gangster movies.AIRBORNE is a planebound horrorcumthriller that mixes up both a tale of supernatural possession with a more conventional hijackingturnedrobbery. It's a story that plays its cards very close to its chest for the most part refusing to reveal much to the viewer until the last 20 minutes as a result it's the sort of film to start making you feel restless over the amount of questions asked and lack of forthcoming answers. On the other hand it's often tense and sometimes exciting featuring some mild gore and plenty of twists to keep you watching. The production values are good enough so that you don't notice the lack of budget and the strong cast helps.Mark Hamill is featured prominently on the packaging but turns out to have one of those boring guy on the ground roles but the other cast members fare better. The wonderful Alan Ford plays to type as a gangster Billy Murray is the usual tough guy and Andrew Shim acquits himself very well as a soldier. The only weak spot in the cast is Gemma Atkinson who comes across as totally wooden playing a stewardess who told her she could act?";

	schema:reviewBody "Early in watching this I thought I'd found a neglected gem. There's a very solid cast. The production values while not spectacular are all right. But in an extremely short running time the story spins totally out of control.The action starts takes place over the course of a dark and stormy night. Right that. The various characters are introduced and we learn a little of their background information. One character a very self centered and aristocratic man traveling with two bodyguards quickly is at the head of the list of characters we want to see die horribly.At first we seem to be in Agatha Christie territory. But too soon we realize that things well just don't add up. This particular flight to New York is the sole flight taking off that night all others have been indefinitely delayed due to weather and it's a huge jetliner about to fly to North America with about a dozen passengers and seemingly acres of empty seats.A few characters disappear mysteriously. Where could they have gone? Could there be a killer among the crew or passengers?Then a supernatural element rears it head. There's a vase on board that's valued in the millions and just may be the residence of a demon.Then in the third act the story turns flat out ridiculous. The control tower at the airport is commandeered by a government agency that eventually decides that the flight must not ever land and is going to use military jets to ensure that it never reaches its destination.And then the story gets even sillier.In case anyone wants to watch AIRBORNE I'll leave the final revelations hidden. But the sum and substance is that I watched this on my computer using Netflix and still felt that I'd been robbed.However I'll admit that it could have had a few more clichs. There are no children on board no adorable old couples no nuns and none of the characters ever burst into song. That said I'm sure that there are many cut scenes of actors choking back laughter with varying degrees of success while playing out these scenes.We never see the demon. Stranger yet we never even see the vase. Thankfully the film's makers have the sense to realize that with their limited resources they couldn't pull off the effects for a demon. But wouldn't some cast or crew member's family have a decent looking Chinese vase they would let the producers borrow?Violence is fairly subdued. The first couple to vanish sneaks into a bathroom to join the Mile High Club but there's no graphic sex or nudity. There are the inevitable bursts of profanity proving Cole Porter to be correct that writers who one knew much better wordsNow only use four letter wordsWriting prose.Anything goes.Worse yet the movie is a downer. None of the plot lines come to a satisfying resolution. In the very last seconds there's a hint setting up a sequel. No.".

All seem to say the same thing that this tried to be a Top Gun with helicopters. I really didn't see any comparison to Top Gun whatsoever. No more than there were people flying and there was a love story. Someone mentioned the Iron Eagle series. If one copied the other it was probably Top Gun copying Iron Eagle Since Iron Eagle came out 3  4 months earlier. I just got finished watching this movie Which I saw originally on NBC. I thought originally that this was a Made for TV movie for some reason but I guess after reading here that it was put out at the theaters. I would have loved to have seen it on the big screen but admit I would not want to pay 7 dollars to see it. IT still rates better than 1 or 2 stars and all the bad insults it is getting here. I agree with one of the people that posted here that it would go great as a Movie for Guy's who like movies As a guy I love movies with action. I am not in the army and know a Little about the equipment. I am not a fighter pilot though and am not in the military. As a civilian I love this movie as an action movie. If I wanted to see realistic and authentic representations of Millitiary equipment I'll go to the History Channel. If I wan't an action movie with just the right amount of comedy and romance I'll go see fire birds again.Is it realistic? NO Is it fun? Yes Is it accurate? No are there some corny lines? Yeah but let me ask you this. All these people talking about Top gun being so big... how many pilots would really fly upside down and flip off a Russian and take it's picture? how many pilots would really do those kinds of fly by's and still be in the Navy? and I won't go into the corny lines from that movie. All in all Firebirds is deserving of just as much respect based on it's merits as a fun actionromance movie as is Top Gun without comparing them to each other.".

What's important to understand is that it's one of those movies that are NOT supposed to have a deep storyline. The plot is nice and simple just enough to keep a story going and show off the Apaches.I love Top Gun for its beautiful F14 footage and a simple story that doesn't get in the way of the viewing experience. And i don't really mind the corny lines and obvious lack of any realism. It's not a documentary it's an action movie one of the few of its kind aerial action movie? As for Fire Birds...I love Fire Birds for the same reasons  beautiful AH64 footage and a simple story that keeps the thing going and doesn't get in the way of what I want to see there in the first place  the Apaches in action.

The plot is nice and simple just enough to keep a story going and show off the Apaches.I love Top Gun for its beautiful F14 footage and a simple story that doesn't get in the way of the viewing experience. And i don't really mind the corny lines and obvious lack of any realism. It's not a documentary it's an action movie one of the few of its kind aerial action movie? As for Fire Birds...I love Fire Birds for the same reasons  beautiful AH64 footage and a simple story that keeps the thing going and doesn't get in the way of what I want to see there in the first place  the Apaches in action. I don't mind the corny lines nor flaws in realism. Just like TG it's not supposed to be a documentary. It's an action movie of the same rare genre as Top Gun. I wish there was more of those...";

	schema:reviewBody "'Wings of the Apache' is a truly awful film. I can find little good to say about it. During the first five minutes I was 'on the edge of my seat' only in a bad jawdroppingly amazed kind of way. I've watched many bad films over the year. I normally turn them off. However I sat all the way through this one's one hour and seventeen minute runtime. I really couldn't avert my eyes.Most people describe 'Wings of the Apache' as 'Top Gun with helicopters.' Yeah I think that's a reasonable description only Top Gun was watchable for different reasons. The opening five minutes I spoke about is basically Nicholas Cage narrating over a bland action scene involving a helicopter dogfight over some mountains. Now I'm no expert but I seem to remember the first rule of storytelling is 'show don't tell.' Yet Cage just tells us what's happening in a monotone voice. Apparently the drugs cartels are now using helicopters to shoot down American helicopters. Does this actually happen in real life? Never mind it does here. And Nicholas Cage  being the only guy who's seen the cartel's helicopter in action  must lead the charge against the lone chopper.He's ably aided by Tommy Lee Jones  a great actor in his own right now reduced to barking orders in the most stereotypical 'drill instructor' way possible. Plus there's a love interest. Guess where that subplot goes? So Nick Tommy and the token woman must train to fight the baddie then fight the baddie then save the day. Hardly inspiring but I think the most unforgivable element of the film is the editing. It's just bad. It's like every shot has been filmed separately to every other one and then spliced together  badly. There's a slight pause between when someone answers the person original speaking making conversations seem stilted assuming the dialogue spoken was any good to begin with  and nine times out of ten it isn't.So in case you haven't got the drift of what I've been saying 'Wings of the Apache' is just bad. And I watched it all until the last credit rolled. Now I've seen it I wonder why I did and yet I'm also curious as to why I may  one day  even watch it again just to remind myself how bad it was. It's bad but bordering on that sobadit'sgood kind of way. If you're prepared for that it will certainly keep your eyes fixed on the screen for exactly one hour and seventeen minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the good fortune of seeing this movie and I use that term loosely on German television so I was most likely spared a great deal of terrible dialogue. The other review was correct about consistency the stock footage switch back and forth between FA18 and F14 footage. A Navy Captain was wearing the wrong size rank insignia. Most of the squadron patches aviators are wearing are U.S. Air Force patches. When an plane is launching off a bow catapult they depict the pilot saluting a fellow aviator not the shooter and then they depict the throttle being thrown to full as the aircraft is being released from the launch gear. In reality Hornets are on autopilot and pilots hold their hands up to show they aren't mucking things up. This is in many respects a low budget attempt at Behind Enemy Lines but that itself was a terrible movie. NEVER NEVER expend money to watch this film!!! Even if you have the chance to watch it on broadcast or cable television a drinking game must be involved that is the only condition under which this movie may seem to be remotely appealing.".

	schema:headline " Not extremely bad";
	schema:reviewBody "In his hilarious book Film is Hell Matthew Howe claims that this movie he shot for Sultan Productions is the worst movie ever made. I've seen many awful movies and while this is one of them it's certainly not the worst.Howe's photography is quite good considering the low budget and time constraints. The real footage he shot on a carrier and in actual helicopter training are excellent stock footage although they don't fit into the rest of the film very well. Most of the shots are in focus with just one shot certainly out of focus and a few combat scenes that are strangely blurry. The locations mostly run down industrial parks are creepy and the handheld camera motion is often very good. Some of the sets are not as bad as I expected and almost reach mid90's cable television quality. And of course the explosions are so good you'll get to see them over and over. ProducerDirectorActor John Christian has a nice restrained acting style which I'm sure he refined over his many low budget productions. Several other actors put in adequate performances. I expected the editing and pacing to bother me more than they did.What really kills the film is it's obvious that no frame of it was ever intended to be shown in a theater. It's shot full frame the title cards were obviously added in video and there are even long fade to blacks that might as well say Airboss will be right back after these messages! You never forget that you're watching the lowestbudget television imaginable. There are far too many closeups of actors pointing at stuff and describing it to us strategically avoiding any background that could tell us where they are. Many scenes appear to be first takes with lots of panning substituting for coverage. The combat scenes have no direction with tanks moving around aimlessly and guns shooting in every direction.Some of the acting and dialog is terrible. Kayle Watson is good looking but rarely delivers a line convincingly. His acting couldn't buy a role in a Lifetime movie. Caroline Strong has had some success in television but tries too hard with her tough woman act which is not helped with the terrible tough woman dialog she was given. The moments of painfully bad dialog are numbed by needlessly long scenes of dull exposition but the painful scenes still linger in your mind.The plot is nothing more than a series of barelyrelated international crises designed to send our heroes to what appears to be the same location over and over to shoot bad guys kidnap terrorists and bring some American justice to the rest of the world. It repeats over and over until the movie is long enough to finally end. This formula is not much different from a season of 24.I will not be watching any of the sequels.".

Any movie that has Steve Buscemi as a longhaired foulmouthed bass player and Ernie Hudson in general I'm going to love.

Speaking of Buscemi this one has a GREAT cast with Brenden Fraser as the leading man Chaz Adam Sandler as the pool cleaning drummer Pip and also features Joe Mantgena Michael McKean Chris Farley David Arquette and a whole slew of others even Michael Richards. The soundtrack rocks and the laughs come so often very dumb laughs that it's impossible to keep count.  Enjoy.".

This is not an intellectual film but it is very funny with all three of the main cast playing very different characters.  Brendan Fraser is honourable Adam Sandler is so dumb he attracts women who feel a bit sorry for him and Steve Buscemi is his older brother who brandishes the gun.  If you want an hour and a half of pure light entertainment watch this!";

The film is about 3 not so smart striving rock stars who after they get blown off on a radio show with an obnoxious boss and stuck up radio leader. Well from then they end up holding up the place and there leads to an hilarious movie. This movie is a very funny one Adam Sandler did very well in not to say the other 2 main character did not as even the cameos and co stars did a good job in this film. Overall the movie is extremely funny and I think is the funniest Adam Sandler movie that he does not star outrightly in. I rate this movie a fair 73 for keeping me laughing the whole way".

Brendan Fraser is pretty good as Chazz. Steve Buscemi is awesome as Rex. Adam Sandler on the other hand felt awkward here. While Fraser and Buscemi seemed to enjoy there roles Sandler felt off key. He was not bad just unbalanced if you will. However the plot is fine. Three frustrated musicians hold a radio station hostage to finally play their demo. The demo gets fried and all hell breaks loose. Their is some nice humor here and some fine acting. We get other nice appearances by Mike McKean and Judd Nelson as well.What works is the gathering of all the metalheads outside the station in unified glory to the freedom of true radio. Run by people like them. I also liked the band stickers inside the band's van. All sorts of true underground metal bands to be noticed on the wall of that van! The knowledge of metal is well put. I LOVED it when Chazz insulted the Seattle grunge scene! As he called it Seattle bull st Wonderful. This movie knows that all rock music is not the same thing!The movie is filled with great music and some nice comedy to boot. An appearance by White Zombie was also excellent too. Be sure to check out a cameo by none other than Lemmy! If you are metal you know who i'm talking about!The Last Word Killer music! All metalheads unite! This is the movie that takes metal more seriously. Fun times. Airheads rocks!".

We got that well kinda. In place of the formulaic setup that tends to include seeing the band play their hardships and then their big break we get something very different. What was intended to be a 'simple' breakin to a radio station to have their song played turns into a hostage situation...with plastic tommy guns filled with spicy sauce. Excellent.The comedy was silly the hair was long and the characters had the intelligence of shoes. But it was a film that made me laugh and was different from the typical 'stupid' college student film. I found it very enjoyable. If you like the old Adam Sandler and seeing Brendan Fraser in his prime then you will love this film. Give it a watch!".

I was certainly not expecting it to be as funny as it turned out to be. I've never been a huge fan of Brendan Fraser and I still have a strong dislike for Adam Sandler but this trio came together in 'Airheads' and created something so funny I laugh out loud whenever I think about some if it's moments which does earn me the occasional glance in a public bus.

The special FBI agent runs around with her gun and when she does some swift kicks supposed to be looking like some martial arts they blurred the movie so you can not see any moves. The sky martial an old retired man in the back corner looks like any old gentleman but totally scared and pulls out a cell phone and texts I love you  stands up and pulls out his gun also and one of the hijackers pops him. He knew he would be shot? It was so lame.One third through the movie I wanted to turn it off but I left it running while doing other things at the same time just throwing an eye at it now and then.It was Bacting lame stunts the air craft take offs are animations and so obviously studio done.Do not waste your time on this. You will have a better time washing your dog or pulling weed in the backyard.The producer should be billed for putting out such low quality stuff. This DVD should hopefully not even make it to Block Buster NetFlix or the Red Box.".

The sky martial an old retired man in the back corner looks like any old gentleman but totally scared and pulls out a cell phone and texts I love you  stands up and pulls out his gun also and one of the hijackers pops him. He knew he would be shot? It was so lame.One third through the movie I wanted to turn it off but I left it running while doing other things at the same time just throwing an eye at it now and then.It was Bacting lame stunts the air craft take offs are animations and so obviously studio done.Do not waste your time on this. You will have a better time washing your dog or pulling weed in the backyard.The producer should be billed for putting out such low quality stuff. This DVD should hopefully not even make it to Block Buster NetFlix or the Red Box.";

If the plane had crashed and everyone died within the first five minutes of the film and then it just went on to show pictures of fake log fire for the next hour and a half I would have been satisfied. At least then there would have been a point insulting but a point never the less.Please if your going to make a B movie make it truly awful.

Most from my age would probably remember them playing together in the Family Ties TV show.Well this movie was bearable to watch but definitely not one that you would want to return to again later for a second viewing. There are far worse disaster movies out there than this one though. If you have nothing else to watch and just want to lay waste to an hour and a half then this could do the trick.

Maybe they sold it on the use of CGI special effects at knock down prices?The plot lets down the pedestrian acting and Londale Theus who plays FBI Agent Melville is so strenuously seriously serious as to be comical.Believe me I am not spoiling anything by mentioning that solutions and the technology suggested to the President and their implementation is simply cheap scifi and poorly done at that.So if your into a bad film then this is the one and a good laugh can be had as you pick it apart minute by minute. Great for film students and bad film buffs but not sure that is a viable market?How did this rate 3 stars???".

What made me laugh the most was the river landing and hitting the monument. Surely the monument would of ripped the plane to bits and the river landing itself the engines stay on?? When it cuts to the pilot meeting his family on the bank of the river the monument is intact and the planes gone only to reappear and the monument is destroyed. Did they forget to employ someone for continuity  Definitely the worst film I've seen in a long time but it did make me laugh.".

	schema:reviewBody "i watched this movie the other day and found it really good for a low budget asylum movie. it's basically about a brand new aircraft on it's maiden flight which gets hijacked and the president has to choose between family on the plane her brother is the captain of the plane and the lives of all on the ground as a sort of insurance policy the hijackers on the plane also have contacts on the ground who kidnap the captains family and you know what the story will be here if anything goes wrong on the plane they will kill his family.i must say that I'm a massive fan of air plane films and have seen some bad ones in my time but this one is certainly one of the better ones i have seen so i was confused when i saw that this film had such negative reviews i guess everyone has their own tastes in movies but i loved this film. i like the futuristic and bright coloured design of the star quest plane even though it's obviously cgi shots of the plane if you ignore the cgi effects you can really enjoy this movie the actors are good i have nothing bad to say about any of the actors.my only criticism about this film is certain errors throughout the film that are noticeable to anyone watching here is the ones that bother me. 1 the first one that bothers me is when the leading terrorist blows off the cargo door the door hits one of the engines and removes it from the plane so it is flying with only three engines but in a shot later in the film as the plane flies toward then away from the camera the plane has all four engines attached even the one that blow off then the next shot of the plane it has only three again. 2 another is when the plane is forced to make a landing on the water when it comes to a stop the size of the plane seems to change in between shots one shot shows the planes nose lower than the top of the bridge but when it is shown in the final scene the nose is higher than the bridge top. 3 the last little niggle i have with this film is in the ending sequence just before the captain is reunited with his wife and kids there is a helicopter towards the rear of the plane which descends slowly then all of a sudden it just stops and hovers doing absolutely nothing and the only movement is some slight movements in the tail rotor thats alltotal cgi error lol.I have to say though that the above mentioned are just slight niggles i have with this film but it wasn't enough to ruin my enjoyment of the film my overall opinion of this movie is great and i give it 810.".

The story was tight music awesome and special effects told the story they needed to tell. The Asylum films that don't take themselves seriously Megashark MegaPiranha are sometimes the most fun.

Ultimately I'd say I paid 2.99 more than I later wished.Along the way of this script which like many politicians was FactFree I kept wondering if the director and cast actually meant to produce such a discordant mess. The story actually bears telling  after it's rewritten to be more credible. But turn after turn the film snatches defeat from the jaws of victory.One example the fed in charge is a crosseyed FBI guy whose impossible to take seriously. And speaking of FBI how in the world did a nearlyhijacked plane come to the President's attention so quickly? Oh oh  yeah right  her brother was flying the plane.And name one model of commercial jet aircraft that requires two pilots to managed the control yokes which magically respond independently and quite differently? Ah but the flight crew did display uniform looks that alternated between Duh and terror  with or without reason.Oh this film was a romp...and for 0.99 I might even agree it was worth the price of admission.".

Take one severe snowstorm add multiple schedules gone awry one elderly Trans Global Airlines stowaway shortages an aging meretricious pilot unreasonable peevish spouses manpower issues fuel problems frozen runways and equipment malfunctions and you get just a sample of the obstacles faced by weary disgruntled personnel and passengers at the Lincoln Airport.

	schema:reviewBody "Another of my guilty pleasures is AIRPORT the 1970 allstar cast drama based on the best selling novel by Arthur Hailey. This soapy potboiler follows multiple stories throughout a busy metropolitan airport. Subplots that appeared in the book naturally had to be watered down or removed entirely but that was to be expected in telling a story of such size back in the late 60's. However after 35 years I still find this film a lot of fun to watch even though it really should be experienced in a theater. Burt Lancaster is all stonefaced authority as Mel Bakersfield the airport manager who neglects his wife Dana Wynter while lusting after his passenger relations agent Jean Seberg. Dean Martin almost gives an actual performance as Vernon Demarest the smoothtalking pilot who also neglects his wife Barbara Hale while having an affair with a stewardess lovely Jacqueline Bissetwhom he has impregnated. George Kennedy began his long association with the character of Joe Patroni herehe would play the role in three subsequent sequels. Van Heflin is extremely effective as D.O. Guerrero the sad and twisted man who plans to blow up an airliner. Helen Hayes won an Oscar playing Ada Quonsett a little old lady who stows away on the plane but that Oscar should have gone to Maureen Stapleton who is just devastating as Guerrero's wife who is totally dismayed about her husband's plan and is tragically heartbreaking during one brief scene near the end of the film. For those who like their adventure films spiced with some somewhat corny soap suds put your brain in check and have your fill with AIRPORT.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thoroughly enjoyed Airport hands down the best of the four flicks in the serialdoes Concorde count? It was MFTV. There was so much tension going on both with the airline the airport and the lives of some of the passengers and crew members. This was a good old fashioned 60's flick but not too cheesy. Helen Hayes is excellent as the little old lady who with all the grace and charm has made a career out of stowing away. I love how she fights with Jacqueline Bisset's character in order to distract the mad bomber on boardVan Heflin. The tension when Joe PatroniGeorge Kennedy guns the plane's engines and gets that plane out of the snow was gut wrenching. Burt Lancaster as the married and harried airport manager who has some what of an affinity for his assistant. Dean Martin gave such a surprising dramatic performance as the captain who was carrying on a love affair with Bisset's stewardess who later tells him she's pregnant. Even Gary Collins wasn't THAT bad. The film's climactic ending leaves you nothing short of disturbed and breathless. Maureen Stapleton upon learning the plane has landed after being blown up by her husband walks up to the injured passengers bawling her eyes out and apologizing for her husband's actions. Of course my favorite is the scene where Bisset's character Gwenwho was wounded in the blast is being escorted by the doctor who tells the EMT's on the ground that Gwen is pregnant. Martin is also escorting her completely bypassing his wife who is ready to give him a hug and then soon puts two and two together. What a way to find out! That dejected look on Hale's face who is once again playing her oh so kind and understanding character you can't help but hate Martin for this last scene. Hale almost never played the bad girl. She's a favorite of mine. Airport will keep you on edge. Haley managed to intertwine the suspension and soap opera dramatics that made the prime time soap opera Hotel so popular. He definitely walks a fine line and doesn't go over either one.".

I was surprised at how well it has held up with the passage of time. Although there have been disaster movies from the beginning of cinema in the late 19th century and one that dealt specifically with an airplane in danger The High and the Mighty this was the film that launched the modern disaster craze that produced The Towering Inferno The Poseidon Adventure and countless others including The Day After Tomorrow. The hilarious spoof Airplane which poked fun at the clichs and pretentiousness of the films did much to discredit the genre until recently.Airport was based on the popular best seller by Arthur Hailey. Although over two hours long the movie moves and the viewer never gets bored. The stellar cast does an exceptional job with a standout performance by the legendary Helen Hayes. The ending is both happy and sad. So it does not cop out on several key themes of the story. Many of the roles such as George Kennedy's Joe Patroni are played lightly and this adds zest to the performances. When the script begins to get syrupy a new element of emergency is thrown in to pick it up and go.Forget all the clichridden disaster flicks you have seen since Airport. You will be entertained and not feel cheated when the closing credits appear.".

I think he should have recieved an Oscar for his role as Joe Patronni. To recieve 10 Oscar nominations is an incredible achievement for a film of this Genre. Alfred Newman gives an upbeat and suspenseful music score and Ernest Laszlo's cinematography is good. Altogether this film is a great one and there isn't any down spots that I noticed.

The acting and characterisation is good and the subplots genuinely involving. There is also an interesting use of splitscreen type devices and a nice line in comedy. A great film if you can ignore all those silly disclaimers insisting that Boeing 707s are excellent aeroplanes etc. Not that they aren't good planes or anything...".

A great film if you can ignore all those silly disclaimers insisting that Boeing 707s are excellent aeroplanes etc. Not that they aren't good planes or anything...";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1968 Arthur Hailey's best selling novel Airport was a fixture atop the best seller's lists.  It was an intricate detailed telling of the inner workings of fictional Lincoln International Airport trying desperately to function during one of the worst snow storms in decades.  Hailey had researched the book for five years and as he weaved his soap opera storyline magic we gained a fascinating behind the scenes look of airport operations why airlines function the way they do and a detailed look at the stressful lives of airtraffic controllers.  It was these details that made the novel great.  Hailey wrote his characters with substance digging deep into their personalities motivations and psyche so that we always understood their actions and reactions.  The basic plot lines may have been high class soapopera but the book as a whole was one of great substance and readability.In 1970 Hailey's book hit the big screen as an all star glitzy Hollywood production.  Unable to put the complex details of Airport operations onto the big screen director and writer George Seaton gave us all melodrama and not much technical details.  As Hollywood spectacle it's fun to watch and taken on that level you won't mind giving it a look.  If you've read Hailey's novel you'll probably be disappointed.Of course in a film such as this with enough plots to make six movies you are bound by the unwritten law of Hollywood to have a recognizable all star cast. So get your pens and pencils out and get ready to draw a chart. Headlining Airport are Burt Lancaster as Mel Bakersfield the airport manager and Dean Martin as his Mel's brotherinlaw and a philandering pilot Vern Demerest.  Lancaster is easily the better of the two.  He has this aura about him that makes us believe he could be running a Metropolitan Airport.  Martin is not quite as successful as Lancaster.  He is Dean Martin playing Dean Martin pretending to be the aforementioned playboy pilot. Heck though he makes the character a likable enough guy that you won't mind it a bit.  Another disappointment is that Martin and Lancaster only have one brief scene together.  It would have been nice if Seaton would have added a few more just so we could watch two legends work together.Jean Seberg plays Tonya Livingston an airline representative who has designs on Mel despite the fact that Mel is still married.  We believe her as the airline rep. but the chemistry between Seberg and Lancaster never really clicks. If the relationship were gone into in more detail then perhaps one would feel differently.  Unfortunately that's one thing this film is in short supply of is important details.Next up in our role call is Jacqueline Bisset who plays stewardess and Mistress Gwen Meighen who also happens to be pregnant Captain we have an extra passenger on board.  As Gwen Bisset gives us one of the more believable characters in this film making us understand her feelings for Vern enough that though she never says it we see her love for him. George Kennedy provides comedy relief as Joe Patroni an ace airline mechanic brought in to remove an airliner mired in the snow and blocking a key runway.  Helen Hayes is on hand as an airplane stowaway.  Though she may look like a sweet little old lady don't be fooled.  Having won an Oscar in 1932 for The Sin of Madelon Claudet she would pick up another on thirty eight years later as a supporting actress for her role as Ada Quonsett.The very best in this film though are Van Heflin as D.O. Guerrero a down on his luck out of work construction worker who hatches a chilling desperate plan to change the financial fortunes of his family.  As his wife Inez Maureen Stapleton may not have copped the Oscar but should have.  Her portrayal of Inez has some of the more touching moments in Airport.One of the other great stars of Airport is the snow storm itself.  In scenes filmed by Ernest Lazlo and directed by Henry Hathaway the outdoor settings of snow blanketing the airport are so realistic you'll be going to the closet to grab a coat.  Alfred Newman's lush score blends right into the goings on and his opening title overture will suck you right into the film.Ross Hunter was the producer on airport. His involvement in glitzy Hollywood soap operas of the past such as Imitation of Life Madame X would help to explain much of the goings on in this film.  On another note I was unimpressed with Edith Head's costume design for the stewardesses.  They are unattractively bland  and seem almost matronly.Airport will never be confused with great film making.  None the less it is still highly watchable entertainment.  It gives us a lot of plots a lot of stars a lot of snow and a some suspense.  And for all that you get my grade which is  B".

I suppose it's not entirely their fault. I mean an action film to them has to involve no less than 55 CGI effects 25 scantily clad or outright nude actresses oh! and more times than not a totally unrealistic plot. But you see many years back in the early 70s and beyond they didn't have CGI to make up for lacking plots and poor acting. And at that point and time you couldn't really show full nudity so you couldn't rack them into theaters that way either note the first scene with the lovely Miss. Bissett where she emerges from the shower and barely flashes just the side of her breast. That was probably pretty racy for the time.So since you can't have any cheap outs like you can today Gee Whiz! you had to have a real plot and have the ability to act! Lancaster has always been a favorite and he did act very well in this film. Youngsters see the likes of Dean Martin and George Kennedy and don't know what to think because all they've ever known was a Hollywood that produces computer generated fluff. Frankly guys if your idea of an action movie is watching Speed then you need to widen your horizon no offense to the great Dennis Hopper.Airport was not as in depth as the book this is true. Seldom will you find a screenplay to be written with the same depth. Do you know why? Because you can't make the film last for 9 hours!I know this is more a rebuttal that an outright review of the movie but it amazes me how some of the CGI junkies have room to talk when it comes to offering their disdain for films with some of the most historic actors in history. This movie is totally entertaining and works well. And the idea some whine because it may not be 'PC' by today's standards is nothing more than extremist liberal drivel. Dino womanizing is apparently an offensive nono. But today you can show something 50 times as bad and because its more modern and allegedly more acceptable by this standard no one blinks. Amazing.".

Whether it be a bomb exploding on a plane a tidal wave tossing a cruise ship upside down a skyscraper catching on fire or a massive earthquake Hollywood filmmakers became obsessed with finding new ways to toss old and new actors together to bring fun onto the screen while giving its audience something to bite their nails over as famous people fought to survive something totally beyond their control.Of the four Airport films this is by far the best although Airport '75 is certainly more famous as a camp classic. Here a group of strangers are tossed together in an enclosed space where they have no idea a disgruntled man has gotten onto the plane with a man made bomb he intends to explode so his wife can get money from the insurance policy he's just purchased. It doesn't matter that innocent people will be taken out with him or that there are laws that would keep her from getting anything he's determined to put his evil plan into motion. Yet there's a pitiful quality about this down on his luck elderly man a magnificent Van Heflin that prevents you from totally hating him and his lovable wife Maureen Stapleton in one of her finest performances has obviously remained loyal in spite of his shortcomings.To offset the tragedy there's a cute old lady Helen Hayes who stows away all the time in order to go see her grown children. Yet this time she may not get away with it giving away her secrets to amused airport executive Burt Lancaster and the nononsense Jean Seberg whom Hayes politely tells to lighten up after Seberg grills her for breaking the law. Pilot Dean Martin is involved with pretty stewardess Jacqueline Bisset even though he's married to the older and very rich Barbara Hale. Bisset has a secret however which will be greatly affected by the results of what occurs with Heflin's bomb.Then there's irascible George Kennedy in the first of four Airport appearances as Patroni a technical genius who spouts all sorts of technical jargon to give the audience the opportunity to understand how an airport works behind the scenes of the ticket counter and the baggage claim. Kennedy's dialog in these films seemed to get sillier and sillier and by the time of 1979's Concorde his appearances here were deemed as some sort of bad joke.Veteran actress Jessie Royce Landis is amusing in a cameo as a wealthy matron smuggling diamonds in her pooch's collar and Lloyd Nolan is memorable as an aging security guard. A ton of familiar character actors pop in and out in amusing cameos with James Nolan very funny as a priest whose patience has run out as he deals with the obnoxious passenger next to him on the plane.While Hayes won the Oscar here for her first film in 14 years it is Stapleton who was certainly more worthy. She would have to wait more than a decade to get an Oscar but her performance is certainly more memorable although Hayes is an adorable old lady. All she's missing is the tweety bird and cage and black and white cat because ultimately she is more of a cartoon character than a real person. This created a huge box office sensation in the early 70's and remains greatly enjoyable. The split screen sequences are a lot of fun having been used by producer Ross Hunter a decade before in Pillow Talk and an excellent music score by Alfred Newman also adds to the tension. Yes there is a bit of a lack of reality but ultimately when you've got so much fun on screen who really cares?".

But does it work? Yes overall. It's fast enjoyable and not really serious even though it's gripping at times. Don't confuse this with Airplane for sure though the comedy gets part of its inspiration here for sure.When I say stellar cast I don't just mean Burt Lancaster who is terrific and who called it the biggest piece of junk ever made. He plays the determined leading man running the airport very well. Not just Dean Martin Jean Seberg and Jacqueline Bisset either. These all play fairly thin roles and very well if you can play a thin role well. I'm thinking not even of every larger George Kennedy who is in charge of keeping the runways running and that's the core of the crisis here as a plane has turned too soon and gotten stuck in the snow nor Helen Hayes who plays a terrific batty old woman who sneaks onto planes she won the Oscar for best supporting actress.Maybe most impressive are the two actors playing a troubled couple the man an actor I think is always underrated Van Heflin. This is his last role and he's still a master at subtle believability. His wife is played by the really impressive Maureen Stapleton pouring out a small but moving performance as a worried disenchanted sad woman who suddenly realizes her husband is going to do something terrible. She won a Golden Globe for best supporting actress well deserved.The production? Glossy and sterile. The plot? Sterile for sure and predictable. Subplots of which there are many? Forced and absurd. One exampleMartin and Bisset playing pilot and stewardess are having an affair. And she's pregnant. And they get serious in the aisles about what do to. But then she gets hurt in the big crisis in the air later on and so on.I hate to admit I enjoyed this movie. It really is a big piece of junk. But all these actors are fascinating in some way or another. And the crappy plot is still exciting and interwoven in that way airport novels are. Yes that kind of book you pick up to read on the place because it's distracting and not demanding. That's it said and done.".

In fact the main disaster about a mad bomber on a plane takes backstage to everyday disasters the drama of different people set on a busy snowy night at the airport. Although its rather trite by today's standards AIRPORT is an excellent relic of pure 70's cinema. Hate to bring up a clich but they don't make 'em like this anymore!It's a busy winter night at Lincoln International Airport. A 707 takes a shortcut across the runway and gets stuck in the snow. Airport manager Mel Bakersfield Burt Lancaster sorts out the problem with a little help from  while at the same time having a few problems with his angry wife Dana Wynter. Meanwhile pilot Vernon Demerest Dean Martin married to Bakersfield's sister Barbara Hale is having an affair with stewardess Gwen Meighen Jacqueline Bisset. Back on the ground Bakersfield's assistant Tanya Jean Seaberg is having a few problems with a stubborn elderly stowaway Ada Quonsett Helen Hayes in an Oscarwinning role whose not the nice old lady you think she is. Meanwhile desperate loose cannon Guerrero Van Heflin boards a plane not to coincidentally the plane piloted by Martin with a suspicious suitcase. Add to that the airport struggles to stay open despite a devastating winter storm and the bickering of angry homeowners and engineer Joe Patroni George Kennedy struggles to move the trapped airliner to clear the path of the runway. Whew! Now that's more plot than you'll ever find in one soap opera! Based on the novel by Arthur Hailey and written for the screen by George Seaton who also directed AIRPORT tries its best to balance these several stories as advertised that's seven stories! together. Although the movie's several subplots tend to be too crowded and therefore a bit confusing the movie still plays along just fine moving along from one subplot to another without harming the film's overall narrative and all is resolved in the end. But AIRPORT is nothing without its legendary cast which the advertisements proclaim The biggest cast ever assembled for a Universal Picture. They surely won't be able to do this kind of casting today without risking half a film's budget. That along with the tuneful score by Alfred Newman and a witty oldschool screenplay give AIRPORT that irresistible oldfashioned charm that makes it still worth seeing.Rating  out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not only did Airport spawn a whole new film genre of epic movies dealing with the full variety of catastrophes modern life has to offer for which alone it would deserve its kudos it is also a very rich colorful and highly entertaining journey back into the late 60's.For the wonderful allstar cast alone this movie is fun to watch. But what really thrills me every time is how much our world in general  and aviation in particular  has changed in the last 40 years and how well this movie albeit unintentionally captures it. And then there's Joe Patroni.  Just think of Mrs. Quonsett's wallet trick  unimaginable today. Smoking in airplane and in many other scenes as well no security inspection to pass a wardrobe on a plane... but there also are things that don't seem to age a bit airport expansion struggle with residents living close to an airport and of course the drama of work vs. social life.Arthur Hailey's novel may be richer in the details but it's also lengthy at times and the movie does a good job in focusing on the relevant things while still keeping many parallel plots progressing smoothly through the story. Even though so many things are happening in parallel or maybe because of it the movie never ever gets boring. Also it is technically surprisingly adequate when it comes to aviation except for a few glitches which are acceptable.Even though the special effect of the plane rising through the cloud layer is not very convincing the rest of the movie is  especially because the shots of the 707 on the runway at the end of the movie are real which make for some breathtaking scenes. I'm sure that the Flying Tigers would've though twice before lending their airliner to the production had they known what they'd do to their lady.  I could go on with many scenes or things I like about the movie but it's best if you see for yourself. Please forget about today's blockbusters though they aren't the right reference frame to use. If you can let go of this you will find yourself enjoying a gorgeous movie about people planes and disaster from the first second to the last.By the way I do think that Chuck Norris was a padawan to Joe Patroni.

	onyx:emotionText "Not only did Airport spawn a whole new film genre of epic movies dealing with the full variety of catastrophes modern life has to offer for which alone it would deserve its kudos it is also a very rich colorful and highly entertaining journey back into the late 60's.For the wonderful allstar cast alone this movie is fun to watch. But what really thrills me every time is how much our world in general  and aviation in particular  has changed in the last 40 years and how well this movie albeit unintentionally captures it. And then there's Joe Patroni.  Just think of Mrs. Quonsett's wallet trick  unimaginable today. Smoking in airplane and in many other scenes as well no security inspection to pass a wardrobe on a plane... but there also are things that don't seem to age a bit airport expansion struggle with residents living close to an airport and of course the drama of work vs. social life.Arthur Hailey's novel may be richer in the details but it's also lengthy at times and the movie does a good job in focusing on the relevant things while still keeping many parallel plots progressing smoothly through the story. Even though so many things are happening in parallel or maybe because of it the movie never ever gets boring. Also it is technically surprisingly adequate when it comes to aviation except for a few glitches which are acceptable.Even though the special effect of the plane rising through the cloud layer is not very convincing the rest of the movie is  especially because the shots of the 707 on the runway at the end of the movie are real which make for some breathtaking scenes. I'm sure that the Flying Tigers would've though twice before lending their airliner to the production had they known what they'd do to their lady.  I could go on with many scenes or things I like about the movie but it's best if you see for yourself. Please forget about today's blockbusters though they aren't the right reference frame to use. If you can let go of this you will find yourself enjoying a gorgeous movie about people planes and disaster from the first second to the last.By the way I do think that Chuck Norris was a padawan to Joe Patroni.

In fact it is so bad they advertised it as a comedy!The plot is inane  wealthy weapons manufacturer Robert Wagner is confronted by television anchorwomangirlfriend Susan Blakely who tells him she has evidence that he is selling secrets to the Russians and is going to expose him.  Does he kill her then?  No.  Since she has been assigned to cover the inaugural flight of the Concorde Washington D.C. to Paris to Moscow he decides to shoot down the plane with the anchorwoman in it. So when the plane takes off with the usual Hollywood Squares cast of television hasbeens as passengers and the two most unlikely pilots in the business Alain Delon as Capt. Marquand and George Kennedy as Capt. Joe Patronithat's right airline mechanic turned executive turned Concorde pilot he tries to shoot it down with a wayward missile which he could conveniently blame on equipment failure.  After the pilots elude the missile by flipping the plane over a halfdozen times and firing a flare out the window while flying at mach 2 !! they survey the damage and decide to fly on to Paris since noone is hurt and structural damage evidently not a concern.  Then they get to Paris where they are attacked by a couple of fighter jets which they manage to elude.  They then crash land in one of the most cheesy uses of obvious miniatures I have ever seen in a supposedly bigbudget filmeven the trees are obviously plastic and disembark. That's the end right?  Wrong.  The movie is only half over so after an overnight layover in which the cast couples as if the Concorde is Noah's Ark everyone reboards the plane to go on to Moscow even though they know someone is trying to bring it down.Anyway let's just say the second leg of the trip ends even worse with the plane crashing into a snowdrift without a single passenger or crew fatality. So what does our wealthy weapons manufacturer do?  He shoots himself in the head.  Fade to Black.Where do I start?  Obviously this is absolutely ridiculous from start to finish.  And then there are the actors  softcore porn star Sylvia Kristel as a stewardess Jimmie J.J. Walker a saxophonist Mercedes McCambridge looking ridiculous as a Russian gym coach Andre Marcovicci as a gymnast who appears to be six feet tall John Davidson as a TV reporter Bibi Andersson a prostitute Eddie Albert the idiot Concorde owner and Sybil Danning his trophy wife David Warner the flight engineer etc. etc.  There's even a cameo by Charo yes Charo as a passenger who tries to smuggle a chihuahua onto the plane by pretending to be blind and saying it's her seeing eye Chihuahua.  And sadly we're treated to the sight of the great AfricanAmerican actress Cicely Tyson reduced to picking up a paycheck as the mother of a hearttransplant recipient who's accompanying the heart to Paris where her son waits.  In the late '70's the two most highly regarded TV performances of the decade were Sally Field in Sybil and Cicely Tyson in The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.  Field was rewarded for her performance with a film career that was capped by two Oscars.  Tyson disappeared after appearing in this travesty.  How sad.Yep the stupidity runs rampant  Kennedy and Andersson make love by a fire. Kennedy tells stewardess Kristel They don't call it the cockpit for nothing honey a line that would get you fired in a second nowadays. Albert says upon disembarking in Paris Nobody is keeping us from going on the Moscow!  Martha Raye adds unfunny comic relief as an old lady with weak bowels.  When she's nervous she runs to the bathroom.  She spends the entire film in the bahtroom.  Ho! Ho! And no one even mentions lawsuit once even after the plane turns upside down.  And the cast?  Dreadful. All the way down the line.  Paychecks paychecks paychecks.  That's all anyone was after on this one.Incidentally the director of this mess was yet another television hack David Lowell Rich who may as well be named Ed Wood.  But he's the least of the problems.  No the problem is a studio that insisted on dumping cheapjack product like this on an undemanding public instead of taking the time to hire truly talented visionaries who could come up with a decent premise or better yet not make the darned film in the first place.  The only good thing about The ConcordeAirport '79?  Released at the same time as Beyond the Poseidon Adventure and the year before When Time Ran Out... it delivered strike two in the at bat that mercifully ended the disaster craze of the '70's.  And not a moment too soon.  no stars out of ".

The movie is only half over so after an overnight layover in which the cast couples as if the Concorde is Noah's Ark everyone reboards the plane to go on to Moscow even though they know someone is trying to bring it down.Anyway let's just say the second leg of the trip ends even worse with the plane crashing into a snowdrift without a single passenger or crew fatality. So what does our wealthy weapons manufacturer do?  He shoots himself in the head.  Fade to Black.Where do I start?  Obviously this is absolutely ridiculous from start to finish.  And then there are the actors  softcore porn star Sylvia Kristel as a stewardess Jimmie J.J. Walker a saxophonist Mercedes McCambridge looking ridiculous as a Russian gym coach Andre Marcovicci as a gymnast who appears to be six feet tall John Davidson as a TV reporter Bibi Andersson a prostitute Eddie Albert the idiot Concorde owner and Sybil Danning his trophy wife David Warner the flight engineer etc. etc.  There's even a cameo by Charo yes Charo as a passenger who tries to smuggle a chihuahua onto the plane by pretending to be blind and saying it's her seeing eye Chihuahua.  And sadly we're treated to the sight of the great AfricanAmerican actress Cicely Tyson reduced to picking up a paycheck as the mother of a hearttransplant recipient who's accompanying the heart to Paris where her son waits.  In the late '70's the two most highly regarded TV performances of the decade were Sally Field in Sybil and Cicely Tyson in The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.  Field was rewarded for her performance with a film career that was capped by two Oscars.  Tyson disappeared after appearing in this travesty.  How sad.Yep the stupidity runs rampant  Kennedy and Andersson make love by a fire. Kennedy tells stewardess Kristel They don't call it the cockpit for nothing honey a line that would get you fired in a second nowadays. Albert says upon disembarking in Paris Nobody is keeping us from going on the Moscow!  Martha Raye adds unfunny comic relief as an old lady with weak bowels.  When she's nervous she runs to the bathroom.  She spends the entire film in the bahtroom.  Ho! Ho! And no one even mentions lawsuit once even after the plane turns upside down.  And the cast?  Dreadful. All the way down the line.  Paychecks paychecks paychecks.  That's all anyone was after on this one.Incidentally the director of this mess was yet another television hack David Lowell Rich who may as well be named Ed Wood.  But he's the least of the problems.  No the problem is a studio that insisted on dumping cheapjack product like this on an undemanding public instead of taking the time to hire truly talented visionaries who could come up with a decent premise or better yet not make the darned film in the first place.  The only good thing about The ConcordeAirport '79?  Released at the same time as Beyond the Poseidon Adventure and the year before When Time Ran Out... it delivered strike two in the at bat that mercifully ended the disaster craze of the '70's.  And not a moment too soon.  no stars out of ";

	schema:reviewBody "In the beginning there was Airport an Alist ultraslick adaptation of a bestselling book nominated for multiple Oscars including Best Picture! Then came Airport 1975 with too much humor intentional and unintentional and Karen Black flying a damaged 747. Airport '77 had a private plane sinking beneath the ocean while rich passengers dropped like flies. In an inane attempt to continue the exploitation of the original film and cash in on the notoriety of the thennew Concorde the fastest commercial plane ever this film came along and ended the series for good. A year later Airplane! would slam the coffin lid and seal it with it's hysterical sending up of the many clichs of the airdisaster genre. Here Wagner is a highpowered industrialist who's been selling arms to enemies of the U.S. When his reporter mistress Blakely is informed of this he tries kill her. After she boards the Concorde en route to Moscow he ludicrously decides to pull out every stop in the book to demolish the aircraft even though it is full of Olympians TV journalists music legends human organs and little old ladies who can't stay out of the bathroom! The entire film is both stagnant and simultaneously uproarious at the same time. The director writer editor and the actors can't seem to get ANYTHING right! See Blakely's ridiculously unconvincing newscast in which she never once looks into the camera and in which clips from events AS THEY ARE HAPPENING IN REAL TIME parade across the screen. It also contains some of the most abominable bluescreen and model special effects ever to be seen in a major studio film.

	onyx:emotionText "In the beginning there was Airport an Alist ultraslick adaptation of a bestselling book nominated for multiple Oscars including Best Picture! Then came Airport 1975 with too much humor intentional and unintentional and Karen Black flying a damaged 747. Airport '77 had a private plane sinking beneath the ocean while rich passengers dropped like flies. In an inane attempt to continue the exploitation of the original film and cash in on the notoriety of the thennew Concorde the fastest commercial plane ever this film came along and ended the series for good. A year later Airplane! would slam the coffin lid and seal it with it's hysterical sending up of the many clichs of the airdisaster genre. Here Wagner is a highpowered industrialist who's been selling arms to enemies of the U.S. When his reporter mistress Blakely is informed of this he tries kill her. After she boards the Concorde en route to Moscow he ludicrously decides to pull out every stop in the book to demolish the aircraft even though it is full of Olympians TV journalists music legends human organs and little old ladies who can't stay out of the bathroom! The entire film is both stagnant and simultaneously uproarious at the same time. The director writer editor and the actors can't seem to get ANYTHING right! See Blakely's ridiculously unconvincing newscast in which she never once looks into the camera and in which clips from events AS THEY ARE HAPPENING IN REAL TIME parade across the screen. It also contains some of the most abominable bluescreen and model special effects ever to be seen in a major studio film. The cast of the film is huge and full of names though most of them are given literally nothing to do but embarrass themselves. Wagner looks very tired and hardly bothers to vary his facial expressions. Blakely works hard but is defeated by the stupidity of the character and the script.

Kennedy replies They don't call it a cockpit for nothing! What floors me is that after the first disaster the plane takes off for another flight and the passengers get back on!

That much said it really is pretty dire.Never mind the laughable backprojection or the awful awful cameratracking of supposed inflight objects it's the stunts that the Concorde pulls off that will have you blinking in disbelief at the absurdity. Barrelrolls looptheloops and violent evasive maneuvers left me wondering why the AirForces of the world didn't just fly Concordes as their main fighters.So here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheesefest 1. The Concorde is at least as agile as a Phantom 4 jetfighter.2. You can fire a flare gun at Mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and sticking your arm out.3. If the flare gun fails to discharge do not drop it as it may then go off.4. The Concorde can dodge up to two Sidewinder missiles fired at it at once.5. A flare will distract a heatseeking missile every time.6. Switching off your jetengines is a surefire way of throwing heatseeking missiles off track if 5 above fails.7. When performing a crashlanding in the Concorde it is apparently impossible to jettison your fuel beforehand.8. Concorde pilots are all combattrained veterans.As you might imagine this film is not very realistic. The effects are primitive by today's standards and that coupled with the nonsense acrobatics the Concorde performs makes this a movie deserving of little but scorn.Not recommended.

Plenty of stock roles with regurgitation of all usual stereotypical situations from disaster films  including a fairly moronic screenplay .

The movie was made and released around the time of another Concorde film Concorde Affaire '79 1979  the two films both had French cast and French story elements  even their titles were similar . Look quickly to Eddie Albert  Bibi Andersson  Charo  Andrea Marcovicci  Cicely Tyson  David Warner Mercedes McCambridge  Jimmie Walker  Sybil Danning  Jon Cedar  Ed Begley Jr  final feature film of actress Martha Raye among others . In addition  George Kennedy and Monica Lewis are the only returning actors from the Airport movie series to appear in the movie  Kennedy's continuing character of Joe Patroni appeared in all four Airport pictures . The motion picture was ridiculously directed by David Lowell Rich  habitual TV director and occasionally for movie theater . It's an inoffensive diversion but is sometimes tediously unspooled . The flick won't appeal to disaster genre enthusiasts . This sagas belongs the following films  the first was Airport 1970  unanimously deemed the best  it paved the way for many lesser flicks including its many sequels  being directed by George Seaton with Burt Lancaster  Jean Seberg  Dean Martin  Van Heflin  Airport 75 1974 by Jack Smight with Charlton Heston  Karen Black and Gloria Swanson  Airport 77 1977 considered one of the best of the series  being directed by Jerry Jameson with Jack Lemmon  Christopher Lee  James Stewart  Lee Grant  Robert Hooks  Monte Markham  Kathleen Quinlan  Darren McGavin Gil Gerard  M.

The movie was made and released around the time of another Concorde film Concorde Affaire '79 1979  the two films both had French cast and French story elements  even their titles were similar . Look quickly to Eddie Albert  Bibi Andersson  Charo  Andrea Marcovicci  Cicely Tyson  David Warner Mercedes McCambridge  Jimmie Walker  Sybil Danning  Jon Cedar  Ed Begley Jr  final feature film of actress Martha Raye among others . In addition  George Kennedy and Monica Lewis are the only returning actors from the Airport movie series to appear in the movie  Kennedy's continuing character of Joe Patroni appeared in all four Airport pictures . The motion picture was ridiculously directed by David Lowell Rich  habitual TV director and occasionally for movie theater . It's an inoffensive diversion but is sometimes tediously unspooled . The flick won't appeal to disaster genre enthusiasts . This sagas belongs the following films  the first was Airport 1970  unanimously deemed the best  it paved the way for many lesser flicks including its many sequels  being directed by George Seaton with Burt Lancaster  Jean Seberg  Dean Martin  Van Heflin  Airport 75 1974 by Jack Smight with Charlton Heston  Karen Black and Gloria Swanson  Airport 77 1977 considered one of the best of the series  being directed by Jerry Jameson with Jack Lemmon  Christopher Lee  James Stewart  Lee Grant  Robert Hooks  Monte Markham  Kathleen Quinlan  Darren McGavin Gil Gerard  M. Emmet Walsh  Pamela Bellwood  Michael Pataki  James Booth  leading to the last of the tired ones  this Airport 79 1979 by David Lowell Rich with . This picture was nominated for Worst Picture at the Hastings Bad Cinema Society's 2nd Stinkers Bad Movie Awards in 1979 and listed among The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made in The Official Razzie Movie Guide . Furthermore   Skyjacked 1972  by John Guillermin with Charlton Heston  James Brolin and this film was parodied heavily in Airplane! 1980 by Jim Abrahams and David Zucker";

In its attempt to be the biggest AIRPORT yet CONCORDE AIRPORT '79 is the worst one yet and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 1970's. With its bad boxoffice results it is no wonder that the genre has overstayed its welcome.The film opens with a rather catchy score by Lalo Schifrin backedup by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its former glory the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in July 2000. But then the credits appear and we get a glimpse of the allstar cast which is composed nothing more of faded Hollywood stars TV actors and nonetoopopular B actors. The plot is sillier than ever George Kennedy is back in the role of Joe Patroni now the pilot of the Concorde co piloted by copilot Alain Delon en route to France after the Summer Olympics. On board is reporter Maggie Whelan Susan Blakely who has just discovered that his boyfriend renowned weapons manufacturer Kevin Harrison Robert Wagner is selling their weapons to terrorist. To prevent her from revealing the news to the world Harrison sends his most advance missiles and best saboteurs to prevent the Concorde from landing.The castsubplots are dumber than ever even sillier than an alcoholic Myrna Loy or a singing nun. We have Cicely Tyson transporting a live human heart in a cooler ! Martha Raye as a woman with a bladder condition and the character doesn't go deeper than that J.J. Walker a a potsmoking saxophonist arguably the most annoying character in the film Eddie Albert married to old wife Sybil Danning Avery Schreiber as Russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally a love story between reporter Jon Davidson and gymnast Andrea Marcovici much to the sour watchingeye of coach Mercedes McCambidge. Plus the movie gets much closer to LOVE BOAT episode than ever with the silliest cameos of Charo and her pet Chihuahua and Bibi Anderson. Camp buffs will no doubt get a real kickintheballs in this silly entry in a long strain of 70's disaster movies. This one is in more than the sense of the word a true disaster.Rating 12 out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original 1970 Airport was excellent with a good cast working with a top script about a hectic winter night at an urban airport. The 1975 and 1977 sequels were watchable if a little silly. However this movie outdoes all the others combined with campy ridiculous silliness.Paul Metrand Alain Delon and Joe Patroni George Kennedy are Concorde pilots who run into a little bit of trouble courtesy of sinister arms dealer Kevin Harrison Robert Wagner. Harrison is determined to bring down the plane because reporter Maggie Whelan Susan Blakely has the goods on him and is on the plane. Harrison scrambles jet fighters apparently he has his own private air force to fire missiles to shoot down the Concorde without success. Then Harrison's henchmen rig the cargo door to open in flight which will surely rip the plane apart and kill everyone. Metrand and Patroni manage to belly land the crippled airliner at a French ski resort in the Alps wow! and evacuate the passengers before the plane explodes. Harrison is so distraught that he commits suicide at the end of the film. Also along for the ride are Sylvia Kristel Eddie Albert Charo John Davidson Jimmie Walker and many other familiar faces.I really liked this movie not because it's good but because it's so darn campy that it's irresistible. Any movie that has George Kennedy firing a flare gun out an open Concorde window during flight at 30000 feet maybe? has to be seen to be believed. The plane also turns upside down and later spectacularly lands on a ski slope plowing up enormous amounts of snow. Campy dialogue absurd situations you name itit's not good but it's certainly entertaining.Best line Joe Patroni Kennedy We've got explosive decompression!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "All the entries in the 70's disaster movie franchise Airport  a total of four movies spread over one decade  have been chastised by critics as well as regular action movie fanatics for being too grotesque and ludicrous. Me personally I liked the three previous installments a lot but I can't but admit that the swan song in the series is a completely laughable effort. The supposedly adrenalinrushing script is absurd the stereotypical characters are cartoonish the acting performances are wooden and the action sequences are downright hilarious. The setup and plot of The Concorde is faithful to the previous movies. We have a cast full of acclaimed names often in inferior little roles and a screenplay that brings together pretty much everything that can go wrong on an intercontinental flight. The prestigious Concorde aircraft is ready to fly from New York to Paris and then onwards towards Moscow in celebration of the 1980 Olympics. One of the passengers is the female journalist Maggie Whelan who's in possession of some important evidence that will unmask her exfiance Kevin Harrison as an illegal weapon dealer. It's most vital for him that Maggie never reaches Moscow and thus he tries to kill her as well as the rest of the Concorde passengers and crew subsequently through nuclear missiles and sabotage. Luckily for the passengers the Concorde has two of the world's biggest macho men behind the steering wheel with the French Captain Paul Metrand and the American veteran pilot Joe Patroni. The Concorde Airport 79 is a dumb and fairly pathetic film but fortunately enough it remains amusing and never bores for one second. The sight of an hitech advanced airplane making loops in order to evade missiles is definitely bad in an entertaining way and the hammy performances of Alist stars are fun to observe as well. Particularly Robert Wagner is tremendous as the villain. With his straight face and eloquent monologues he represents the prototype of Bondmovie villains and I strongly suspect that Mike Myers hired him to play Number Two in the Austin Powers' movie solely based on his performance here. Alain Delon looks quite bored and softerotica star Sylvia Emmanuelle Kristel is rather unnoticeable when she keeps her clothes on. Fun bloke George Kennedy is the only actor who appeared in all four of the Airport movies so it's truly a shame that he plays his biggest role in the worst of the series. The dialogs are lame and some of the clichd sub plots are horrendous does there really have to be an emergency donor organ transport in every disaster movie? but I certainly didn't regret the two hours of my life that I wasted on watching this film.".

As it is too often it's the script that cripples the movie.The premise isn't the worst. What is the problem is that there isn't just one disaster there are three. And the trick is that the first two happen on the U.S. to France leg of the trip. Even though the plane has to do loopdeloops to avoid missiles on both occasions and the plane was under attack everyone pretty much gets back on for the France to Moscow leg! What are the odds? Zero of course! Take a wild guess about what happens on the second leg? Hmmmmm... See more dots! It all deals with an illegal arms dealer who wants to kill off his girlfriend a reporter who is on to his nefarious schemes.A crazy cast is along for the very bumpy! ride. Chief among them is George Kennedy a mechanic in the first three Airport movies who is all of sudden a pilot. Okay! That is only the first of many aeronautical inconsistencies. Plus lots and lots of logical inconsistencies. The main one is why did I watch this? And why am I taking time to review it? Oh my gosh! I make as much sense as this movie does!  2 out of 10 Stars ...Yeah I'm being VERY generous!".

By far the most idiotic move ever seen in whatever movie from whatever country in history period. No Clist horror movies ever went that low. Compared to that Jason Vhoorhees's seventh resurrection seems like something you'd see every week in your local newspaper.Finally everyone and I do mean everyone who knows anything about a plane will tell you that nothing in this movies remotely make sense.I almost forget to tell you about the fakest special effects in the decade. I think they add explosion with more realism on Sesame Street.My only fear is that somebody would sees this without having seen the first one and think that the series is entirely like this.

For those who care this one deals with a teenage daughter of a software giant who gets trapped on flight 666. Seems they might be making a stopover on pavement and not the good kind either. See bad weather has hit lightening strikes the plane and next you know she's gotten fly the plane to ground and safety.I always like these movies with the sight of a dubious average everyday citizen being able to land the plane  no training needed  always brings a smile to my face. Makes me wonder why we need those highly trained pilots when all you gotta do is pull a lever and stickshift.This movie doesn't offer ANYTHING redeeming worth spending ninety minutes of your time on. It has the general feel of a tight budget and there's very little variety. Either we're on the plane listening to the whiny girl or on the ground in the air traffic control tower listening to dialogue we've all heard before. I became so bored with the movie I couldn't help but pick holes in it. The rougharoundtheedgesacting implausible technical aspects. I did anything mildly possible to sink the movie before it has reached an end. If it had even succeeded in entertaining me lightly maybe I wouldn't be so harsh. Was Turbluence a good movie?

That being said most movies expect you to suspend disbelief for a little bit in order to enjoy the flick. I couldn't get past the fact that at 2030000 feet above the earth the temperature of the air is beyond normal cold and a big hole in the plane would depressurise the cabin sucking everything out into the big blue yonder. At skydiving height yes you can do neat heroic things like run a guy wire from one plane to the other and save lives. You can peek outside the back of a low flying aircraft like in the old war movies. Not on a jet. Sorry folks it's not going to happen. Everybody would turn blue and die. Even the cute little girl who almost fell through the hole lost a shoe to the great beyond but managed to push herself away so she could get up and move about the aircraft. If it COULD be done I do believe there are people insanely heroic enough to jump across on a tether and save the day...but not on this planet. Aside from that...one of the better flicks I've seen. I'd rate it up there with the USA Network movie called Class Warfare. I was half asleep and missed seeing the contrived ending to that movie 10 minutes into it. I like it when movies can trip me up like that.".

The controls for the autopilot are above the center console where both pilots can reach it. Not above the captain's control column.3. The auto pilot gets scambled and is guiding the aircraft into a imminent crash into the airport. The autopilot is electronic and must have power to function if you want to disengage it pull the circuit breaker that's readily available in the flight deck. Pull the breaker and there's no more power for the system that is guiding it into the ground.4. The Boeing 727 has 3 engines there were only 2 thrust control levers in the movie's flight deck.5. Air traffic controller ATC was left to give instruction and technical details about the aircraft no pilot or technical personnel were brought in to help.6. Airtoair fueling boom was manipulated sideways not possible. Cannot even maneuver in horizontal direction from the aircraft and it would have been torn loose long before fill extension.7. Nose wheel well pressure panel through which 3 persons were evacuated only had 4 screws in it. such a panel would require at least 20 screws and is much smalller than was shown.8. ATC said the autopilot was in the back of the aircraft. Auto pilot computer is in the E  E bay located behind the nose wheel well which is exactly where the pressure panel they removed would have lead. oh since I am anready in the wheel well I might as well remove the autopilot computer to prevent us from crashing into the airport.9. Only 1 pilot was flying the tanker there are 2 pilots. Gee one of those pilots could have been transfered to the B727 to land it.10.

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a pilot for over 40 years. I know whereof I speak. I like airplane movies really I do. This one has more senseless factual errors than AIRPLANE which was one of the best comedy movies I ever saw. Unfortunately this one is no comedy. I DVRd it this week. I wish I hadn't. First off when the plane was 95 minutes from it's intended landing the copilot was talking to the tower. In fact ALL communications were with THE TOWER. 95 minutes on a 727 would be about 750 miles. At best an aircraft FM transceiver has a range of about 100 miles. At the range they were from touchdown communications would be with a regional air traffic center not a TOWER 750 miles away. The refueling boom is another anomaly. The boom extends from the center rear of a refueling plane. I have laid on my belly in the boom operator's position of a KC135. The operator doesn't stand behind a pulpit. The boom has a stub wing on it which flies the boom. There is no way the boom can be moved at a 90 angle from the tail of the refueling plane. Once the 727 depresurized the folks on the crippled plane would have frozen to death in a matter of a minute or so at cruising altitude. It's negative 50F up there. They were not dressed for arctic travel.How can a rescue guy shinny down the boom at an airspeed great enough to keep a 727 in the air? Approach to landing speed in probably about 125 knots 144 MPH. Minimum speed to maintain altitude is probably 200 knots. Then they have the stupidity to take passengers back the same way. Why not leave them on the plane and send over a fresh pilot to land the thing intact? Once the kid starts flying the plane the air traffic controller trains her to fly on instruments. That's a pretty tough first lesson. In fact it's impossible. I've only done it after MANY HOURS of training starting in a small single engine airplane. Jam you foot into the brakes OK where are the brakes? And why would a controller be the one to talk a plane down? Only a 727 rated pilot would have a prayer of being able to do it and on those RARE occasions when it has been dome it's been done with a chase plane alongside.OK it's only a movie but let's at least try to make it seem believable.".

And somewhat luck again that I found it online to purchase. I knew if I could find it I'd buy it immediately. After some searching I gave up....then I decided to look again. This time for real. After about 5 minutes of real searching I found it on yesasia.com. Bought this and the soundtrack to a great movie called Crying Fist.I receive the movie in the mail about a week and a half later. I pop it in my region free DVD player. Damn! No subtitles. I must have been so excited I forgot to check if it had English subtitles. Oh well. I probably would have bought it anyways. So if you have seen this movie with subtitles...give me a break. Movie time! Talking about Anticipation!!!!!! First scene you see Vanderlei and some Asian dude going at it. Alright! This movie's gonna kick ass! Then the movie begins. I tried pretty hard to follow the story...actually not that hard. I'm pretty sure it's about the love you believe that!? of two siblings. Which are not blood related by the way. They are the children of the Bad Guy in the film. I know he's not the birth father of the Young Man and I'm pretty sure he's not the father of the Young Lady.  But I know that the two young lovers grew up together under the watch of the main Bad Guy. The head Bad Guy and another nerdy bad guy are two clan leaders of their own Yakuza gang. They both love MMA but what's even better they both love DEATH MMA. They each bring in their own fighters and you guessed it they fight to the death. There's a little white guy in this movie that is up to no good. He speaks with both yakuzas so it might seem they are both after the same goal. Which I believe could be a drug. The story eventually gets violent and the story unfolds to a very strange ending that left me scratching my head. If there were subtitles I suppose I would have understood.....I'll just leave it at that.Okay! Let me get to the reason I bought this DVD. Prides Fighters!!! You got Sakuraba Takayama Rampage Frye and Vanderlei. Those guys fight it out. Try to guess which ones win? Real hard stuff. You also get a quick glimpse of Matsui Daijiro. I'm pretty sure that was him playing chess with Sakuraba. The pride officials also get some screen time.It's probably the best mma fight footage shot for film. But that's not saying much. The Eliminator gave it a run for it's money.Cinematography was VERY GOOD. Great shots of the fighters. Music on the other hand was good at some times and weird at others. They played jazz fusion at one point. And some bad rock at a pivotal point in the movie.The fighters are definitely the best part of this movie. And unfortunately they weren't that great. Rampage and Saks fight seemed too slow. Vanderlei didn't try hard for his staredown. You could tell Rampage and Silva knew they were on camera. They still did a fine job with the screen time. Frye and Yakamoto did well their parts also.Overall the movie was alright. Nothing great. Sakuraba was the shining star when it came to the film. He actually has a pretty good screen presence. Very similar to Takeshi Kitano. If it was just based around Sak and the fighters the movie would have been unbelievable.I wondered how much the fighters got paid. If they got almost the same as their purse when they fight they should have actually had them fight! At least have them grapple hard when it hits the ground. They could have just pretended they were training. Oh well.Recommended for hardcore MMA fans. Or hardcore movie fans.".

However having read from other users that Yume is a waste of time and too personal to be enjoyed I was so disappointed that I felt the right time to speak up had come.I am the first one to agree that this is not a film for everyone. It is actually far from that. Alas in this world where the vastest majority of people feel that the necessary and sufficient condition for a film to be good is to have as much special effects as possible Yume sadly faces no other fate than to be overlooked by almost everybody.It is those few people that might consider watching this film that have the opportunity to appreciate its full greatness. There are still many hurdles on the way though. For many Western people including myself the fact that Yume orbits around Japanese legends is a big obstacle to overcome as we are not well acquainted with their meaning. I am convinced that Kurosawa's Dreams conceal much of their true objective to us who are not familiar enough with the Japanese culture.But my advice is forget these problems. There are thousands of other details to enjoy. From just a cinematographic point of view Kurosawa's mastery of colour is unrivaled and a sound reason to watch this film yet not the only one by far. The true value of Yume in my opinion is the use of the parabolas presented disguised as dreams to teach us a way of life. The absurdity of war. The beauty of nature. The need to preserve our environment. In summary a praise to life. And yet Kurosawa being old himself when he filmed his Dreams looks at death and presents it as the last station of a wonderful journey. Carpe diem yes but not to the point of being scared. Life will follow its course as does the river at the end of the movie with or without us being here to enjoy it. Just be thankful for the small things in life they are the most important. Enjoy them while you can and you will leave this existence in peace with yourself.Yume is one of these small humble things so humble that it can be overlooked by many. It would be a waste. Don't let this happen to you. You would miss a true masterpiece. You would miss Kurosawa's way of life.".

There are very few films that manage to embody personal local and global concerns as Akira Kurosava has managed in this production. There are so many underlying topics that it is difficult to concentrate in just a few for the purpose of this review but I believe it is fair to say that Dreams portrays our individual and collective dreams and nightmares reflecting that sometimes what we dream of today is what will keep us awake tomorrow. A nice range of representations of concerns from the deepest and most personal childhood worries and fantasies to the more complex issues of mental illness extreme ambition destruction of our environment and death. In all I recommend this film to anyone who has the chance to see it It is possible that Dreams may not appeal to a mainstream audience in terms of content because there is a lot of symbolism and critical engagement but the photography and sceneries are for sure something that should not go amiss for anyone. If you get the chance it is truly worth giving it your time a fantastic experience.".

	schema:headline " So I'm not the only one with weird dreams";
	schema:reviewBody "Going back to what made Akira Kurosawa a star Dreams is a film driven by a completely original concept. Like Rashomon this is something that had never been done before. To my knowledge nobody since has had the skill or guts to make a movie that accurately captures the spirit of........ bizarre Dreams. These stories are filmed and written just like real dreams. They're full of strange events that most of the time make no sense yet everyone in the story totally believes it to be normal. My favourite segments are The Tunnel as story where a former military commander encounters the ghosts of all the soldiers who died under his command. The Commander explaining why his soldiers died is hands down the best acting in the movie. My second favourite wold be The Peach Orchard. This is about a young boy that finds a group of living dolls in the fields. The dolls are furious that the boy's family have destroyed all the peach tress in the Orchard. This segment was the most dreamlike. My third favourite would be Mount Fuji In Red. In that there is a nuclear meltdown. Panic spreads and a few survivors contemplate whether or not to end their lives. In traditional Kurosawa fashion this movie is visually breathtaking. Kurosawa films don't just look great they look unique and interesting. The visuals in Dreams helps create the hypnotic dreamlike state. In the Crows story a man enters the world of a Van Gogh painting. Parts of the scenery here are natural landscapes and parts are made to look like a painting. In Blizzard mountain climbers are on the verge of death. They're rescued by a snow spirit. The blinding snow and the sort of slow motion effect when you see the Snow Fairy makes this segment perhaps the most hypnotic images Kurosawa has ever produced. I wouldn't want anyone to get the idea that this is just a bunch of unconnected segments. Several characters appear in various segments and some are meant to play back to back. I have to say that Dreams may not be for everyone. I'd recommend everyone alive check it out though. Some may love it some may not understand it. I'm on the side of this being one of the last brilliant works of the World's greatest Director.".

I saw this film for the first time in 1993 and it was placed forever in my mind as one of my greatest cinematic experiences. I agree with what another reviewer said about this film that it is not for everyone. It is very artistic in that the cinematography carries a lot of the story and some may become bored with it. Hollywood has a way of brainwashing a lot of viewers into needing a lot of dialog or action. If that's what you're after you wont find it here. You have to use your brain for this one. This movie is Japanese and what little dialog there is is in subtitled for the American viewer. So you may need to do a little reading. This is not simply a movie it is several short amazing stories that stem from the mind of Akira Kurosawa a genius in my book. One is like a beautiful fairytale and another is a nightmarish fable and still another is a terribly haunting ghost story there are others but all are done very well. This film needs to be seen in the letterbox format as it was intended. The cinematography as I said earlier contributes so much that it should be viewed completely. I really don't know what else to say about this movie except that if you have an artistic streak and like to see how movies can become art I would highly recommend Yume Dreams.".

This is the first Kurosawa movie I have seen but I can see how true it is that Kurosawa is a master of creating atmosphere in a film. Such as the dark postnuclear apocalyptic world of THE WEEPING DEMON. Or the very first episode when the little boy sees something he is not supposed to see in the forest.I found THE BLIZZARD rather strange and you'll see a scary part when the mountainman is having his mirage of the beautiful woman who symbolizes the snowstorm. I'm not sure what the significance of the dog was in THE TUNNEL but I guess it illustrates the fact that though he was the commander of Third Platoon  he felt like a coward because of his command his men paid the price.... yet he is guilty of still being alive he's afraid of the dog.It ends rather low key but the last episode THE VILLAGE IN THE WATERMILLS is the most insightful and bold in expressing the movie's theme... of harmonizing with nature and maybe harmonizing with ourselves.The procession displays the unity and the communal harmony that the villagers have. And it is the exact opposite of what is grieved about in MOUNT FUJI IN RED or THE WEEPING DEMON. The cinematography is just beautiful. The movie is beautiful and captivating. Akira Kurosawa's YUME is Grade A 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Most people dream but I wonder how many are rewarded with such beauty when their eyelids close and they drift into semiconsciousness.  Kurosawa has collected some of his dreams and shares them with us.  I don't ever remember seeing such vivid colours in my own dreams but like Kurosawa's they are often fragmented and incomplete with a mystical quality involving spirits and the dead.I like the peach tree scene where true repentance makes things right.  Not only the peach blossom but also the kimono of the characters tiered up the hillside are most pleasing to the eye.  As also is the meeting with van Gogh when his paintings with mad whirls of colour are brought to life and form part of the landscape.Some dreams can be very frustrating when we are caught in a dangerous situation from which there is no ready means of escape.  This is dramatically illustrated in the Mt. Fuji episode in which nuclear plants explode and a fog of coloured radioactive gases envelopes the characters. There is a strong message here about saving the environment.  This message is also accented in the ogre scene and the peach tree scene and the water mill scene.Some viewers might find the going slow at times.  For example the mountain climbers struggling in kneedeep snow seem to move at the rate of a few steps each minute and being encouraged by their leader to keep going as they strive to reach their camp.  A mystical event occurs and in the morning when the heavy fog clears a surprise awaits them.  This feeling of striving and getting nowhere is common in dreams at least in mine.There is also mysticism involved in the tunnel scene where an exsoldier meets the remainder of his platoon all of whom were killed in battle.  The sound of their marching feet echoing through the empty tunnel is quite chilling.Apart from a few dramatic moments the film is somewhat subdued.  It is an art film beautifully conceived and should be reserved for one of those quiet moments when we are in a meditative mood.".

I think this should be the order1 Sunshine Through the Rain 2 The Peach Orchard 3 The Blizzard 4 The Tunnel 5 Mount Fuji in Red could also be deleted altogether 6 The Weeping Demon 7 Crows move this episode down two notches 8 Village of the Watermills Moving Mount Fuji and Weeping Demon ahead of Crows fulfills several things a Simple cinematic effectiveness With The Tunnel the film gets gradually darker more like nightmares than dreams. The Tunnel has an ominous ending with the barking dog. The stories that immediately following The Tunnel should explore the darker end of things rather than being followed by a lighter story like Crows which is a mistake for dramatic reasons. b This also makes the film's point clearer The first two stories feature a young boy. As a child we have a much more innocent relationship to nature. A child might wish to penetrate nature's secrets but does so innocently. The boy merely wanted to watch the fox wedding. He was caught looking but meant no real harm. Even so the boy is rejected by his mother and he is sent on a quest to seek forgiveness from the foxes. A recurring theme in this film is that interfering with nature can have serious consequences. The boy in The Peach Orchard is too young to do anything about the trees being cut down. He simply loves peaches and trees in bloom. At the end the boy realizes how terrible the consequences can be if Man acts against nature. The following four stories 36 show a fully grown adult presumably the boy grown up?. In the Blizzard he is struggling against nature which he sees as threatening and hostile to him unlike the boy's less confrontational feelings towards it. An interesting thing in The Blizzard is the ambiguity of the Snow Spirit woman. Is she trying to help the mountain climber or kill him? It is left deliberately obscure. I interpret this to mean that the forces of nature while very beautiful can also be deadly. We should show nature the proper respect. Next in The Tunnel the subject is the ultimate destructive act of Mankind war. The man claims to have sympathy for his dead troops which they meekly accept and go back to the grave. However the company dog is not so easy to fool. It is an animal and does not accept the rationalizations that his men do for being sent to their deaths. The dog is depicted almost as a Hell Hound on the his trail. This is why Crows MUST NOT following The Tunnel. The Tunnel should have set up the next two stories featuring the fully grown adult. These take the idea of being at war with nature to the most hellish extreme. The dog in the Tunnel acts as an omen and a harbinger of doom which we seen in the nightmares of Mount Fuji and The Weeping Demon. The Weeping Demon is nothing less than a vision of hell on earth. Finally the last two stories feature an older man Van Gogh and the village elder respectively who impart the wisdom of old age to a younger man. These men are totally in harmony with their natural surroundings. Crows plays better if it isn't sandwiched between The Tunnel and Mount Fuji and Weeping Demon. It comes across as irrelevant and lightweight in its present position in the film. FIX IT YOURSELF! Repositioning it makes it seem more effective even if this doesn't fully address the films other weaknesses. The village elder in the final episode has the innocence of a second childhood tempered with a whole lifetime of experience. This is why Crows and Village of the Windmills should be paired together as the last two stories. We have gone from youthful daydreams to the nightmares of the adult world into a second rebirth of innocence. The Village of the Windmills is not so much a real place but rather a kind of Heaven on Earth the mirror opposite of the Weeping Demon's hell on earth. The Village has no name just like in the U2 song Where the Streets Have No Name which of course refers to Heaven. I think is a clue that this village is not of this world but rather the next. It is a perhaps impossible dream of total harmony with nature that Mankind can aspire to though it may be unachievable in this world. If you look at the meaning of Village of the Windmills in this way the ending is incredibly melancholy as is the music on the soundtrack. Perhaps the dreams referred to in this film aren't necessarily dreams Kurosawa had while he was sleeping but his waking dreams and nightmares about Man's relationship with nature. Mount Fuji in Red is the least effective sequence precisely because it is too literal coming across as even more preachy and didactic than the rest of the film. It feels like something out of a Godzilla movie or an Irwin Allen disaster picture. If we eliminate Mount Fuji then one story about war follows another. The Tunnel is about World War II and the Weeping Demon is about World War III. This makes that argument that warfare is Man's ultimate and unnatural way of making war against nature. This is why the company dog in The Tunnel behaves the way it does because it sees the threat Mankind may ultimately pose to nature itself in a way the officer's dead soldiers cannot or will not.".

Perhaps the dreams referred to in this film aren't necessarily dreams Kurosawa had while he was sleeping but his waking dreams and nightmares about Man's relationship with nature. Mount Fuji in Red is the least effective sequence precisely because it is too literal coming across as even more preachy and didactic than the rest of the film. It feels like something out of a Godzilla movie or an Irwin Allen disaster picture. If we eliminate Mount Fuji then one story about war follows another. The Tunnel is about World War II and the Weeping Demon is about World War III. This makes that argument that warfare is Man's ultimate and unnatural way of making war against nature. This is why the company dog in The Tunnel behaves the way it does because it sees the threat Mankind may ultimately pose to nature itself in a way the officer's dead soldiers cannot or will not.";

	schema:reviewBody "More than Just a Dream By Cris Evert Berdin LatoA series of subconscious peregrinations is not new to the world of cinema.

Yet Akira Kurosawa8217s Dreams Yume was more of diverting the normaldreamoccurrenceescapade into something worth analyzing and comprehending. It was more of the cinematography rather than the dialog though there were a number of striking lines worth pondering. Cinematography speaks for the movie itself.Dreams have woven together the stories of people from different generations. The first two stories Sunshine through the Rain and the Peach Orchard focuses on the little boy though the 2nd story is not a sequel of the first8212directly telling viewers about childhood. Kurosawa interprets childhood as a period of uncertainty where one is bound to obedience and is often overcome by innocence and free will.For those who are not openminded Sunshine through the Rain may seem like a showcase of lopsidedness the mother actually putting more weight on beliefs rather than protecting her own child. The power that culture carries is almost always unstoppable.The obvious choreography of the foxes was both entertaining and interesting. Entertaining because they look like 8220out of this world beings8221 who can8217t do anything to straighten their lives. Amazing and interesting because such organization is peculiar for creatures like them. Peach Orchard on the other hand tells us about child8217s innocence. How hard the boy explained to the imperial spirits that he tried to stop destruction. The story was also about metamorphosis8212how a simple and ordinary scenario can turn into something spectacular and extraordinary. Likewise it tells us about man8217s destructive nature and how such abusive act brought so much suffering to the boy. Yes childhood of uncertainty but this period is also the moment when values are shaped stainfree pure and untouched.For the first two stories Kurosawa magnificently presented childhood a stage where thoughts are initially shaped learnings are taught bit by bit and values are molded.The next two The Blizzard and the Tunnel tackled Kurosawa8217s struggle with the self when an individual seeks his individuality. But such searching happens tumultuously.When all else fails one has the tendency to give up and let things be. And just when things get all the worse you suddenly find the strength to survive. The Blizzard8217s atmosphere was good but I find the scene where the other mountain climbers got up after the storm absurd. Yet I commend the climber who never gave up to his frozen exhaustion. The most effective story was The Tunnel. Astonishingly Kurosawa has shown that memories of the past could never be hidden even though it may appear to be forgotten. The Tunnel expresses feelings memories in retrospect. One cannot be ostentatious8212pretending to know nothing or as if nothing happened. 8220Time cannot ease the pain of old wounds instead the scars it leaves continues to be seen and serves as a reminder of what has transcribed.8221But I was totally dumbfounded when the dead soldiers obeyed their superior. It was both heartwarming and nervebreaking.A major shift happened on the fifth segment Crows. For the previous two movies the atmosphere has been hazy cold depicting emotional struggles.

Virtually stimulating Crows invites viewers to get to know Van Gogh8217s paintings as the young Japanese artist likewise 8220invaded8221 the world of Van Gogh8217s paintings.As one travels through the sands of time one also discovers his true self.As the film moves on Kurosawa evidently led viewers to a more mature stage.

Towards the end of the film Kurosawa introduced man8217s role to society. That after finding one8217s self an individual can now relate himself to the society.Mount Fiji in Red the Weeping Demon and the Village of Watermills were all environmentally inclined. It appears succinct that environment is important yet if one takes more plodding work one realizes that merely saying how important environment is is truly different from experiencing that importance. As a metascience fiction of visualization of the end of the world it awakens feelings of guilt and fear.8220Flowers are crippled8221 is a very striking statement in The Weeping Demon. It tells viewers how environmental pollution can destroy everything. Among the eight films I found the title of this segment ironical but appropriate. I8217ve never heard of a demon weeping since all I can reckon is a laughing and chuckling one.Village of the Watermills significantly features a Utopian place a place where man blends harmoniously with the environment. Actors of Dreams portrayed roles well although for some segment I found certain dialogues inappropriate and some actors needed more practice. But as a whole Dreams was a movie which invites viewers to dig deeper to fathom the real meaning of each dream understanding them both with the mind and the heart. Dreams a movie which allows viewers to think and analyze more. In the end all the efforts were rewarded.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.I arranged to see this as I was visiting Italy. It deepens my experience from the great filmmakers to orchestrate the context so.Italians make a fuss over the simple pleasures. They eat like they speak with their entire upper bodies as they caress the most direct abstractions. Their language is designed to be beautiful in itself in that easy alliterative tossing of vowels.But those simple abstractions crowd out the more sophisticated ones as one can see in by Mediterranean standards absurdly blunt religion politics even crime and sex.Each person must make a choice whether the simple pleasures are worth the cost of the deeper ones. It is a matter of design versus art.Kurosawa chose the more difficult path his entire life except for a brief interlude with the Soviets and here.Usually his films begin life as meditations on ineluctable insights then get captured in detailed paintings. The resulting film images provide insight into the ideas which is the thing that makes his films worth living with. Ran' is complex and is a different film on each viewing each one potentially lifealtering. Not so here. Sometimes film can be personal but that is impossible when you must have many collaborators. In order to come to some common purpose things need to START with the visual as sort of a lowest common denominator. That's why special effects film are rarely worth the viewing.Here Kurosawa has scores of collaborators so he needs to shape his film in the Italian way. That's why the fulcrum of the thing features our leading Italianstyle filmmaker as an ersatz Van Gogh. He incidentally misunderstands Van Gogh by the way. Vincent was perhaps our most cerebral and literate painter. His absinthe addiction and porphyria gave us the first intelligent hallucinogenic art. But his intent was very conscious and deliberate not the obsessive Italian locomotive of intuition depicted here. But never mind we get what he means.In this simple lowest common denominator Kurosawa falls back on solidly established tradition of Japanese ghost stories particularly the films of ??? as a short cut. Only the first one and a half story and the last deliver what makes him special beyond the genre.Those segments are excuses for highly abstract pageants selfreferentially staged  with the watcher nominally the filmmaker built in. The last one is the one that sticks with you. It is amazing how often over the years I have consciously recalled that funeral procession.That last story is perfectly ironic. A 103year old man preaches a simple life while surrounded by waterwheels that superficially appear naturefriendly. But instead of being the primitive devices he is working on they are made of machined lumber with excessive use of bolts. It is as if we were all in a great modern machine that we have abstracted into something that comfortably feels like nature. I'm sure that is the way it was with this elaborate studio set.The mechanisms of those wheels is some combination of his generative imagination Mother Nature and the gears of society.I can hear him saying I'm not dead yet like his alter ego in Madadayo' but with a certain resignation of a valued life lived without the simple pleasures. Bless him for his life  who among us will credit such a funeral celebration?Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Dreams was a film I didn't like very much at first but did admire it for how beautifully filmed it was. Watching it again I do like it much more. Although it is one of my least favourite Kurasawas and still disappointing for me it is not a bad film. A couple of the vignettes are rather selfindulgent and muddled in the messaging some of the more political parts could be seen as somewhat naive and the pacing is uneven perfect at times but drags too much in others. However again like with all Kurasawa's work it looks absolutely gorgeous especially in the Crows vignette full of beautifully composed cinematography and colourful imagery. Kurasawa's direction shows what a versatile director he was often genteel and poignant here. The music compliments each vignette very well the haunting tune of the concluding Village of the Watermills vignette fared the most effective. The environmentalism is appropriately heartfelt and Martin Scorsese is excellent as Van Gogh. Overall not one of Kurasawa's very best for me but after hearing not so good things about it I am glad I gave it a second chance as it is not for everyone but I found it much better second time around. If anything Dreams is decent it is just that it falls short of the greatness of the likes of Seven Samurai Ran Yojimbo Ikiru and Hidden Fortress. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie seems as if Kurosawa intended it to be his last. It has an air of testament of final words. In a number of separate episodes he takes us through scenes of increasing darkness and lands in one of peace and light. Surely he intended the obvious likeness to Dante's Divine Comedy.WARNING SLIGHT SPOILERSThen Kurosawa's Paradise is one of minimal splendor a return to agricultural simplicity man in harmony with nature. It's the same kind of ideal as expressed in the last verse of the Chinese book Tao The Ching. I have always suspected that ideal to be little more than a romantic illusion  a sweet dream but boring to actually live in.The previous episodes are much more intense and fascinating to the extent where one has to wonder if perchance Kurosawa would not have preferred to end up in one of them rather than the last one  in spite of the torment they contain.Anyway the film starts and ends with procession  the first a wedding the last a funeral. In Kurosawa's Dreams the former is threatening and the latter joyous. I wonder why there is no birth. There are children though but they are in no way spared from the sorrows of the world. Sadly that is true to life.Less realistic is the scarce presence of women. The most prominent female character is a sort of Snow Queen trying to kill some men lost in the mountains. The snow is warm the ice is hot she says to one of them to make him sleep. True indeed  but a harmful warmth a deadly heat. Still it cannot compare to the genocide heat produced by men later on in the movie.These are dreams? If so they are surprisingly barren. Not the likes of Dante's  or I dare say anyone else's. Dreams are complex things and when studied closely they open up like Pandora's box. Kurosawa's episodes are not dreams in that sense but mere silhouettes of them. For dreams to be revealed they must be entered. Kurosawa seems to have kept them on a distance taming them with his waking state.Perhaps he had found that his dreams could not compare to what he had accomplished in his many great movies.".

I've heard this movie praised over and over again and being a newcomer to Kurosawa's film making I was looking forward to a strange adventure into this man's mind. Unfortunately what I found was a segment or two that was great in concept sometimes beautifully filmed but overall surprisingly pretentious and poorly executed.There are segments that seem to drag on forever without dialogue and others that spew what seems to be propaganda from the mouths of the actors. Personally I don't mind films with slow pacing and the segments that dragged to me were the more enjoyable than the ones full of propaganda. I'll clarify what I mean by propaganda. It seems to me that the writing is far too overt. Yes there are deep and important messages being told to us but they're not subtle in the least. I felt like I was watching a couple of plays written at the high school level. Most of the characters stand still on screen while they talk seemingly directly to the audience about whatever moral or ethical dilemma the segment is addressing.Still if you like odd movies and some experimental film making you should at least give this a rent. Unfortunately I bought it and am unsatisfied with my purchase but had I rented it for a couple dollars I would not have felt cheated. It's something to watch once but the dialogue is painfully unnatural at times and ruins some great concepts with poor writing. It's not a classic but it's not a complete failure in every aspect either.".

Well there lies your answer.

Every frame was a painting so intentional so fluid and quite removed from the lets use cgi for every other shot attitude that is so present in film making today thats not a bash to the industry but you can make a great picture using cgi without over using it.The order of which the shorts were put together I believe was perfect. Starting with youthful folly and ending with hope isn't that life's gambit? There are parts where it gets preachy but if this is your last picture wouldn't you want to get as much of yourself into it as possible?At the end of the picture I felt overwhelmed with an urge to create I said to my selfI want to be that good as I want to be a filmmaker.

There wasn't one of his films that I felt surpassed classics like 2001 Citizen Kane Raging Bull or The Godfather. The one I had felt was the best was Ran his adaptation of King Lear. But now I've found one that I believe is among the ranks of the classics of cinema.And oddly enough Dreams is not considered a masterpiece. Maltin only gives it . I give it a square 1010. I was skeptical at first. The first three pieces were nice but I didn't find them extraordinary. The fourth one The Tunnel began to interest me and about halfway through that one I realized that putting dreams to film made a lot more sense than I had originally thought. I began to examine them from a psychological point of view. I became obsessed with the first three diving deeply into them for their meanings coming up with pearls of wisdom. I think this film affected my unconscious mind more than most films. Only 2001 which works on every level conscious subconscious and unconscious simultaneously and it is alone among films in that respect is similar.I will not go into any of the plots. One should experience everything in this film with no preconceptions. Besides no one should on this site these comments ought to be only about why or why not the commenter liked the film heshe is commenting on. Just rent it sit down and let your mind absorb the beautiful images and the halfcoherent thoughts expressed. When you fall asleep afterwards you will certainly have the best dreams you've ever had.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have just seen it once in the 1990s but I still remember it with fascination. Dreams contains different short pieces containing a enactment of several real dreams that Kurosawa had. You have to remember that when watching it as the film is full of surrealism and unconsciousness but also of shocking inexplicable images as most of our dreams are. The dreams have different tone and mood but all of them are beautifully filmed and brought to life. However some of them are very sad and shocking and not easy to understand.This is one of those films rarely created in the history of film making in which a director bares his soul naked in front of the spectator to show those fears oniric patterns and stories that populate his most inner world. Imagine how difficult is to remember a dream and even more difficult to recreate it and make it understandable visually for a person who is not you i. e. for people to whom the images are presented as a projection of your unconscious. That's precisely what Kurosawa does in this movie. It is an exercise of both psychoanalysis and an intimate way of communication of the self with the viewer.This is perhaps a movie too complex for the usual moviegoer but an oniric masterpiece rare and unique that will delight cinema lovers and Kurosawa's fans.".

However some of them are very sad and shocking and not easy to understand.This is one of those films rarely created in the history of film making in which a director bares his soul naked in front of the spectator to show those fears oniric patterns and stories that populate his most inner world. Imagine how difficult is to remember a dream and even more difficult to recreate it and make it understandable visually for a person who is not you i. e. for people to whom the images are presented as a projection of your unconscious. That's precisely what Kurosawa does in this movie. It is an exercise of both psychoanalysis and an intimate way of communication of the self with the viewer.This is perhaps a movie too complex for the usual moviegoer but an oniric masterpiece rare and unique that will delight cinema lovers and Kurosawa's fans.";

While abroad in Japan tragedy strikes for the couple which sets the course for the story. It really is a simple story about how a married couple long for having a home and a family of their own. Grant surprised me with his family man role quite different from the sophisticated characters he played later on in his career. His monologue during the adoption hearing was one of the best scenes in the whole movie and very well done. Irene Dunne was great in her role as his wife. The little girl who plays their daughter was too cute for words. It was also an interesting insight into how a couple struggles to raise their first child which is something many people can relate to no matter what the time period. It was also interesting the way Dunne went through all the flashback scenes in the movie by playing records that reminded her of their life together. Beulah Bondi who played George Bailey's mother from It's A Wonderful Life has a great supporting role as the head of the adoption agency who has doubts about the couple at first but then grows to care a great deal for them. The ending was a complete surprise. If you like Cary Grant or old Hollywood movies this is something different. Sad but sentimental. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Julie Adams is seen going through recordings as the story unfolds each song she plays brings back memories and it represents a chapter in her life. Julie who has decided to leave her husband Roger remembers aspects of an unfulfilled life. The thing she most wanted in the world is denied to her being a mother. Not everything in Julie's life has been bad as we get to know her. Julie was lucky in finding a man like Roger who did everything possible for her except give her the child she longed for.As Roger returns home from Japan he establishes a small paper. He struggles to keep it going but unfortunately his business doesn't make it. It's at this juncture in their life when Roger and Julie decide to adopt. They are lucky in that the kind head of the agency Miss Oliver realizes they have all it takes to be good parents even though their finances don't add up. When Trina the infant girl is offered to them they decide to take the chance. Roger who wanted a boy has an emotional encounter with a judge that wants to take the girl away from him and Julie when his paper folds.As Trina the infant girl is brought home Julie and Roger realize how ill prepared they are to take care of the baby. Applejack who helps run the paper saves them from their own awkwardness and shows the couple how babies are taken care of. Trina who grows to be a sweet little girl contracts a mysterious illness and dies. Her death together with all the Adams' financial problems breaks their marriage. We watch Julie preparing to do but the providential call from Miss Oliver with the offer of a new orphan boy serves to bring the Adams' together.George Stevens directed skilfully this melodrama. By emphasizing the financial problem of the Adams' and not dwelling in Trina's tragic loss Mr. Stevens got away from the total tear jerker the material could have turned in the hands of another director. Irene Dunne and Cary Grant had appeared in two other comedies before. Without a doubt Cary Grant steals the picture with his amazing take on Roger Adams a man who is a reluctant adoptive father only to have his heart stolen by Trina. Mr. Grant proved here he could have easily made a serious dramatic actor. Ms. Dunne is also effective as Julie a woman who can't have children of her own. Edgar Buchanan is seen as the loyal Applejack and Beulah Bondi appears as the kind Miss Oliver the woman who brings happiness to the Adams. The film is worth seeing because of Cary Grant's invaluable contribution to the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Far from the comedy of The Awful Truth and My Favorite Wife this pairing of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne pulls out all the sentimental stops to get you sad and keep you sad. A Penny Serenade is the chronicle of a marriage between the two World Wars of the last century. Cary is an aspiring newspaperman who meets Irene while she's working in a record shop. They marry and Cary takes an assignment in the Far East.The Japanese earthquake of the Twenties causes Irene to have a miscarriage and she can't have any other kids. They come home and this time adopt a little girl. A few years later she falls ill suddenly and dies. The strain is too much for both of them.I think you get the idea where this is going but under George Stevens's skillful direction Penny Serenade remains sentimental without descending into the maudlin. It's also due to the skill of the leads.Cary Grant got his first of two trips to the Oscar sweepstakes with this film. This was due to a great scene he has with a family court judge as he pleads for him and Irene to keep their child. There couldn't have been a dry eye in any theater this was playing in back in 1941. Grant lost the award to Gary Cooper as Sergeant York.In the supporting players mention must be made of Edgar Buchanan and Beulah Bondi. Buchanan is Grant's good friend who comes to work as a pressman when Grant starts a small town newspaper after coming home from the Orient. He has a wonderful scene showing the new parents how to change a baby's diaper. Beulah Bondi plays the wise and sympathetic head of an orphanage who's a very shrewd judge of people and the qualities they need for parenting.A lot of similarities between this and the 1970s film Pete and Tillie with Carol Burnett and Walter Matthau.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cary Grant and Irene Dunne are very good in this bittersweet romance mainly made up of flashbacks with the links between them being records from the past played by Dunne.  We see the couple through their first meeting marriage move abroad and so on.  The central thread of the story is when they adopt a baby girl Trina who fills the void in their marriage.  When Trina dies as a child it seems there is nothing more to hold them together. Edgar Buchanan is excellent as uncle Applejack the printer who knows how to handle babies and the little girl playing Trina is cutesy cute in the nativity play scene.  Grant's best moment is in the judge's office when he pleads to be allowed to keep his adopted daughter because she isn't like an automobile you take back when you can't keep up the payments.  The ending however is weak another baby is found for them to adopt and all their troubles are over.  This feels rushed and doesn't really work.

	schema:headline " Uneasy Mixture of Comedy and Tragedy";
	schema:reviewBody "The title Penny Serenade refers to a popular song of the period and it is popular music that provides the framework for this film. Julie Adams a young married woman on the verge of splitting up with her husband sits beside a pile of records. Each one has a special meaning for her and as she plays them she is reminded of episodes from her past. She originally worked in a record shop and first met her journalist husband Roger there. The film shows in a series of flashbacks Julie and Roger's first meeting their life together after he was sent to be his paper's correspondent in Japan how she suffered a miscarriage and how they adopted a baby daughter because she was unable to have children.Most of the reviews of this film that I have seen both on this board and elsewhere express the opinion that it is a romantic drama rather than a comedy like The Awful Truth and My Favorite Wife two earlier films in which Irene Dunn and Cary Grant also acted together. This is not an opinion with which I would altogether agree. Although I have never seen The Awful Truth there are moments in Penny Serenade which reminded me strongly of the pure comedy of My Favorite Wife. Indeed I felt that the comic scenes in Penny Serenade were better done and more amusing than anything in the earlier film. I laughed out loud something I never did with My Favorite Wife at some of the scenes of Roger and Julie's life together with little Trina particularly the Nativity play and the scene where Cary Grant is trying to change a nappy.The trouble with Penny Serenade is that it can never decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a serious drama. The early scenes of Roger and Julie's courtship and their days in Japan are all lighthearted. Interestingly enough for a film which opened only a few months before Pearl Harbor the Japanese characters are presented in a generally sympathetic way which suggests that there was little hostility in America towards Japan at this time. The idea of some underlying enmity between the two peoples seems to have been an invention of the Japanese politicians and generals. Tragedy briefly intrudes with Julie's miscarriage but when the Adamses adopt Trina this leads into the most comic part of the film.The plot then moves back into serious mode. Roger has given up his job as a foreign correspondent in order to become the editor of the local paper in a small California town. As the circulation of the local paper is less than a thousand this struck me as an unlikely career move but it is one made necessary by the demands of the plot. The paper folds financially and Roger loses his job which means that he and Julie are threatened with losing their adopted daughter because the adoption agency will only place children with financially secure families. Roger saves the day with an impassioned speech to the judge and there is a brief return to comedy with the Nativity scene before the final tragedy of Trina's death.The main flaw of the film is not so much that it is excessively sentimental but rather that the comic and tragic elements do not sit easily together. The switches from one to the other are often abrupt. The scriptwriters seem to have been aware of this problem as the sentiment is sometimes downplayed. Trina's death for example is simply announced in a letter from Julie to the head of the adoption agency without any heartwrenching deathbed scene. The ending of the film in which Julie and Roger's marriage is saved when the adoption agency offer them another child to adopt is a particularly implausible way of providing a happy ending. That the loss of a child could have brought them so close to divorce within a few days suggests that there was something seriously wrong with their marriage in the first place and the idea that their grief could be so completely and suddenly overcome by the adoption of another child seems a very unrealistic view of the psychology of loss and bereavement.Despite my reservations I have given this film a mark of six partly because it is in parts very funny and partly because it is very professionally acted particularly by Cary Grant Irene Dunn and Beulah Bondi as the lady from the adoption agency. Grant is very good in the comic scenes he was normally better at comedy than at serious drama although there are exceptions such as his work with Hitchcock. My overall impression however was that it was an uneasy mixture of comedy and tragedy that did not quite hang together as a coherent whole. 610".

	schema:headline " Great movie except for the ending";
	schema:reviewBody "After 65 years this film still rings true in many ways. Several people have mentioned the bathing the baby scene but my favourite is the alarm clock scene. One thing I appreciate is that Dunne and Grant's new baby actually looks fairly new jerky movements and all  maybe not 5 weeks old as stated but definitely younger than the usual Hollywood newborn. I'm sure that at the time this movie was quite educational for many people like the two main characters who thought that you adopt a baby by going to the nearest orphanage picking out the one you like and walking out with it. I only wish the filmmakers had taken the opportunity to really underline the fact that everybody wants a 2yearold with curly preferably blond hair blue eyes and dimples but what about the 99.999 of less perfect children very much in need of a good home? The film does slide toward melodrama on occasion  did it take a fullblown earthquake for Irene Dunne's character to have a miscarriage? One thing I noticed is that this film actually shows a married couple sharing the same bed! Mind you Irene Dunne is lying on top of the cover with her dressing gown on tensely waiting for the baby's next feeding while Cary Grant is off to sleep but I still wonder how it got past the Hays office. The little girl who plays 6yearold Trina is not too saccharine except for her voice but at the end of each speech she is obviously remembering that she's been told to Smile dear smile!.What ruins it for me is the ending  their little girl has been dead for only a few days and her parents are ready to start with another baby. IMO at this point any normal parents would react with revulsion to the thought of replacing their dead child. As another reviewer mentioned in this film it's like replacing a dead goldfish. If only the filmmakers had implied that several months or better yet a year or more had passed and shown the couple finding each other again first it would have been much more believable and touching. BTW several reviewers have mentioned the poor quality of the DVD or video they watched but the one I had from Triton Multimedia was not outstanding but quite all right.".

I only wish the filmmakers had taken the opportunity to really underline the fact that everybody wants a 2yearold with curly preferably blond hair blue eyes and dimples but what about the 99.999 of less perfect children very much in need of a good home? The film does slide toward melodrama on occasion  did it take a fullblown earthquake for Irene Dunne's character to have a miscarriage? One thing I noticed is that this film actually shows a married couple sharing the same bed! Mind you Irene Dunne is lying on top of the cover with her dressing gown on tensely waiting for the baby's next feeding while Cary Grant is off to sleep but I still wonder how it got past the Hays office. The little girl who plays 6yearold Trina is not too saccharine except for her voice but at the end of each speech she is obviously remembering that she's been told to Smile dear smile!.What ruins it for me is the ending  their little girl has been dead for only a few days and her parents are ready to start with another baby. IMO at this point any normal parents would react with revulsion to the thought of replacing their dead child. As another reviewer mentioned in this film it's like replacing a dead goldfish. If only the filmmakers had implied that several months or better yet a year or more had passed and shown the couple finding each other again first it would have been much more believable and touching. BTW several reviewers have mentioned the poor quality of the DVD or video they watched but the one I had from Triton Multimedia was not outstanding but quite all right.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first 34 of the movie is cute but nothing to rave about boy meets girl they eventually falling love marry she becomes pregnant and everyone is happy. Then disaster strikes in the form of an earthquake causes her to miscarry and her injuries are such that she will never be able to have a child. They are sad but stick together through it and they eventually put their lives back together again. They decide they still want a child so they adopt. When they get to the adoption agency a kind adoption lady presents them with a baby girl and they fall in love with the child and decide to adopt her. You see the adoption process and how happy they are. It is cute to see them learn how to take care of a baby. Their financial situation changes when the child is about 2 and before the adoption is final the adoption head honchos threaten to take her away because now they are poor. A stirring speech by Grant and the faith of the kind adoption lady convinces said honchos that Grant and Dunne are still good parents and that their child will never starve. They are allowed to keep the child who we next see as sweet a little girl as anyone could wish for. Now as I said up to this point everything has been fine some downs but they've worked out their problems and are a happy functioning family unit. As a whole the movie up to this point has been as cute and sweet as their little girl.Then BAM the next minute the kid is dead no warning to the audience that the kid is sick just BAM dead of something or other. They are too grief stricken to help each other and instead tear themselves and each other a part. It's only been THREE DAYS since the little darling's death and they are splitting up because they just can't handle the grief this explains why Dunne is packing to leave Grant throughout the current time scenes in the film. Dunne wrote to the kind adoption lady telling her their tragedy as soon as the girl died and before Dunne has a chance to leave Grant for good the adoption lady informs the couple who have yet to make up and are just as miserable as ever  remember it has only been three days since their little girl died that the agency just got in a sweet little boy two years old golden curls the sort of kid they thought they wanted to adopt before they saw their baby girl and would they be interested in seeing him? Now suddenly everything is aokay and they have plans to turn their daughter's room in to the perfect room for a little boy. Nothing has been resolved in their marriage. Before they found out about the boy they were in the middle of deeply grieving for their daughter in fact they were so grief stricken I thought for sure they were going to turn the little girl's room in to a shrine or something. Then they hear about this little boy and it's like their little girl never existed. In short the ending is unnecessarily tragic in the little girls death alone more so when her death splits Dunne and Grant apart and ruined both by the fact that the couples problems are not fixed at the end of the movie just papered over and the treatment of a loss of a child as something a kin to the loss of a goldfish. Oh you lost your child? that's sad but not a real problem. Just never you mind that and buckup mom and dad here's another. It is as though the movie is almost a warning to parents enjoy them now because the little ones you love maybe taken from you at any moment except just kidding that does not really matter because you can always have another and poof your grief will be gone. Basically if you stop the movie at the Christmas when the girl is six it is not bad it's a cute film though not worth its rave reviews. The last twenty minutes or so ruin it turning a tolerable film in to something that I just can't take.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are so many things to recommend about the film Penny Serenade. This is a heart tugging yet not sappy story of a couple who realize they need a child to keep them together and their only option is adoption. The Cary Grant character starts off wanting nothing to do with children and ends up having his adopted child being his raison d'etre. There are many familiar yet well executed themes adopted children can be just as loved as birth children you don't have to have lots of money to be a good parent. Another thing that is very impressive about the film is a unique film technique for its time. The plot is revealed through flashbacks which happen while the Irene Dunne character is playing phonographs the record spins and dissolves into the scene from the past. I found this transition technique quite effective and ahead of its time. The other thing that stands out is the casting of the young actresses that play their daughter. All 3 are adorable but not in an annoying mock precocious ShirleyTemple way. Finally this film is billed as a change of pace from the DunneGrant comedies like The Awful Truth but the awesome truth is that this film has hilarious moments. Grant is is fine comic form especially in the early morning feeding scene. You can find the DVD Penny Serenade in the bargain bin at many stores which in a way is an insult but a great opportunity for you to add this great film to your DVD collection for pennies.".

But it seems the film has now drifted into public domain and the result is incredibly dire a very muddy soundtrack coupled to a picture that shudders and shakes so that you can barely stand to look at it.This a great pity for PENNY SERENADE is a fine film that deserves much better. The concept is simple as wife Julie Irene Dunne packs to leave her husband Roger Cary Grant she plays the various records the two have collected over the years. Each recording recalls the various phases of their lives their chance meeting their rather unexpected marriage early years spent in the far east. But they are unhappy in their inability to have a childand so they return to the United States to adopt. But their happiness ends in tragedy a tragedy which neither seem able to surmount.The story is sentimental melodrama of course but it transcends its own genre. George Stevens was one of the great directors of Hollywood's golden agedirector of such diverse classics as A PLACE IN THE SUN SHANE and WOMAN OF THE YEAR. In lesser hands the film might have been reduced to pure soap but he strikes the perfect balance between charm and tearfulness. The leads are equally perfect with both Irene Dunne and Cary Grant who were memorably teamed in such frantic screwball comedies MY FAVORITE WIFE and THE AWFUL TRUTH discarding their broad comedic skills in favor of plausible humor and sincerity. The supporting cast which sports nice performances by the likes of Beulah Bondi and Edgar Buchanan is also very fine the script is quite good and the cinematography both functional and elegant.But all this counts for nothing if you cannot actually stand to watch the truly awful VHS and DVD versions available. And they really are that bad. Over the years I've picked up several copies of this film released by several companiesMadacy Laserlight and most recently Front Rowand although the transfers vary a bit from company to company they are never more than extremely bad and quite often downright unwatchable. This is a film in desperate need of restoration and until it receives that you're better off looking for it on the latelate showfor I can almost guarantee that the print you will find there will be superior to virtually any homemarket release you can lay hands on.Gary F.

Drawn out by the incredibly sensitive nature of George Stevens's direction they reveal great versatility in the dynamics of their onscreen repertoire playing a couple who meet suffer tragedy and experience great highs and exasperation alike. What I find funny is that I do not want to describe the story very much at all for fear of diminishing the effect of going through the experience freshly without any knowledge of it but the film is nothing more than a film about a middleclass couple trying to start a family! That's the movie! There is nothing dull about it either. Stevens perhaps the ablest filmmaker of the era next to Hitchcock saw the profundity and catharsis in it and the receptive insightful control and room to allow his particularly personal vision to make it feel like the experience cinema is meant to be a chronicle ensuing the lifechanging happening of falling in love and the innate personal longing to make a family and a home with the one you worship and the trials and grief that can be as intense though never really more than the pleasure and gratification it begets.There is not a single insincere frame in this picture. Even its story being told in flashbacks is done to remind us how significant music is as it synchronizes the soundtrack to our lives. In effect whenever music plays in the film and it is predominantly source music rather than underscoring there is a magnified reaction on our parts. Moreover Grant and Dunne's urge to settle down in a traditional American lifestyle is a minor supplement to their purely individual intentions behind it. Their innocence their artless simplicity is refreshing. The screenwriters Martha Cheavens and Morrie Ryskind have unspoiled grace in their phasing of the sequence of narrative that you become interactive with the characters.Aside from the inimitable lovability of the beautiful graceful flexible hilarious touching and gifted Irene Dunne Cary Grant is pitchperfect in his entirely assured performance especially during his moving monologue in front of a judge. The energy between the two create such endearing realism. You become aware of yourself laughing out loud with the daytoday surprises and farcical obstacles with which they get involved.".

Nostalgic and sensitive picture with brooding drama  adequate cinematography and evocative musical score . Well thought movie in which the couple's big dreams give way to a life full of unexpected sadness and unexpected joy . Sensitive film which deals with interesting issues such as family life  couple relationship  sons  death and many other things . The story is plain and simple  nonetheless results to be a moving experience . It is a tearjerker about an agreeable couple who looks rather stiff and maudlin nowadays . This overexpended weepie flick relies heavily on the relationship between Gary Grant and Irene Dunne but this does not get bored or spoils the tale . Slightly overrated but excellent all the same time  the picture is enjoyable and entertaining  but overlong .

	onyx:emotionText "This weeper movie turns out to be a simplistic tale  however provides an enjoyable time . Nostalgic and sensitive picture with brooding drama  adequate cinematography and evocative musical score . Well thought movie in which the couple's big dreams give way to a life full of unexpected sadness and unexpected joy . Sensitive film which deals with interesting issues such as family life  couple relationship  sons  death and many other things . The story is plain and simple  nonetheless results to be a moving experience . It is a tearjerker about an agreeable couple who looks rather stiff and maudlin nowadays . This overexpended weepie flick relies heavily on the relationship between Gary Grant and Irene Dunne but this does not get bored or spoils the tale . Slightly overrated but excellent all the same time  the picture is enjoyable and entertaining  but overlong . The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility  the intelligent screenplay was written by Morrie Ryskind and based on a story by Martha Cheavens . Sensational protagonist duo  Gary Grant is extraordinary  as usual  and Irene Dunne is magnificent . They don't make'em like this anymore and no one plays Grant better tan Grant .

	schema:reviewBody "warning definitely includes spoilers to the story! Having been a Cary Grant fan for some time and more recently an admirer of director George Stevens I was eager to watch Penny Serenade. I find that unfortunately I have to disagree with most of the other listed comments.That Cary Grant and Irene Dunne are wonderful actors there can be no dispute. However it is the screenplay that is at fault here. Both main actors are luminous and riveting but they are either burdened with lines that fall flat or in many instances with a lack of words and dialogue.spoiler While in Japan the newlywed couple are caught in an earthquake and the pregnant Julie Dunne miscarries. The word is never mentioned which I found hard to believe. I am supposing that this must have been due to the censorship code of the time.spoiler After their adopted daughter Trina dies there is an appalling absence of dialogue between husband and wife. Julie and Roger Grant are left without words sitting in silence supposedly to convey despair and sorrow. I found this such an unimaginative way to handle what the couple was experiencing. A series of brief scenes in which Dunne tried to talk with her husband in ordinary daytoday situations might have better depicted Grant's withdrawal and depression.The gimmick of using different songs to lead into flashbacks of various stages in the marriage was heavyhanded stilted and trite. I think that the movie might have been better organized if the story had simply played in sequence from past to present. It put too much of a burden on Dunne to do what little acting she could as she put one record on the turntable after another. After the second record I no longer found it credible that she would play those songs and temporarily relive all her heartbreak considering the fact that she and her husband were on the brink of divorce and she was getting ready to leave him. I can only suppose that in 1941 this idea was more workable and more acceptable for the audience of that time.The actress who played Katrina at age six had a forced smile that did not seem natural or genuine. The couple of times she smiled at the end of her lines was distracting. She was trying too hard to be cute.In some scenes it almost seemed as if Dunne and Grant were told to improvise their lines and it was clumsy. Here I think of the scene when Miss Oliver from the orphanage comes to the apartment to check on them for the first time and the scene in which they go to the orphanage to see the baby for the first time. Even Miss Oliver is not given sufficient credible lines. In describing the infant Katrina to the couple all she can say is she is like no other child two or three times. It was wearing. The scene when they take the fiveandahalf week old Trina home from the orphanage was overlong and overplayed. Grant seemed very uncomfortable while Dunne managed her way. The scene where several of the men who worked on Roger's newspaper were in the apartment watching the nervous and inept Julie washing and diapering her baby was again overplayed and overdrawn especially the repetition of the cracking of the peanut shells as a distraction to Julie and wearing on her nerves.As many have said the highlight of the film is Grant's scene with the judge pleading that his daughter not be taken away because he is out of work. It is such a powerful and wonderful scene which for me only emphasizes the fact that so much of the rest of the movie is weak by comparison.As for the director I think it is fair to say that films like A Place in the Sun and Giant were far more successful and far better achievements artistically and dramatically.I can really only recommend the film because of Grant and Dunne. They have done much better work in other films. I was surprised to learn that Grant was nominated for an Oscar in this movie.".

I only stuck with it for love of Anthony Quinn who looked very handsome in his silverhaired splendor. Tony and Italian actor Adriano Celentano are jailbirds who escape due to a series of bizarre con jobs on the prison guards. They team up for the larger goal of getting revenge on Tony's exwife Capucine but for the vast majority of the movie they're just pulling pranks and con jobs on random people. For example Tony wants a new suit so after he's tried one on Adriano tells the shop owner that Tony has leprosy. The shop owner tells Tony to leave the story immediately and he gets to keep the suit without paying for it. This is a pretty silly movie one that only kids might like if it weren't for the terrible dubbing that would make them tune out. Unless you're in love with the cast you can skip this one. Try The Secret of Santa Vittoria instead.".

It starts off with 2 high school gangs squaring off against each other with bad kungfu. A scenario found in countless other Korean films. Hohum. Add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote He Was Cool which was barely passable and well I thought I was in for a nondescript 2 hours.But don't give up so quickly! A Romance of Their Own was directed by Taegyun Kim who also did Volcano High which I thought was loads of fun. Anyway Romance of Their Own soon takes a turn much for the better. A high school girl just having moved to Seoul finds herself in the middle of attention from two prospective suitors. Each guy has his own merit and it is not clear which one if either would be the right pick.What follows is not your usual teen love triangle. The emotions are complex and while you may not agree with certain choices or actions as the film develops you can certainly understand why the characters make them.The movie asks questions of the characters and the audience. Who does one choose? At what point is one obligated to even make a choice and is it unfair to one if it seems he is being strung along? After you or your heart has made a choice how do you react and how should you react when new information comes up that sheds new light on the situation? There is one scene near the end that is very subtle but perfectly captures what I think would be a reallife reaction instead of overthetop movie reaction. The subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene. Recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed. Basically he doesn't know what to make of things. Instead of having him act out something or look all gapemouthed dumbstruck he just stares off at some fixed point unable to react or say anything at all. It's like someone just pulled the plug on him. His reaction rang true to me and I appreciated the scene.Like most Korean films there is a mix of action bravado slapstick and melodrama. Korean films often take abrupt turns see Sex Is Zero for a great example which can be quite a shock for the uninitiated. Go ahead and initiate yourself with this one. Like it love it or hate it I think most viewers will be able to relate to and appreciate the characters' actions and reactions.".

If the guys can't fight like that in real life they sure fooled me. There isn't as much fighting as I would like I have to say but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular. They don't show much but you can tell it's violent and cool. But there's also the plot that goes around a love triangle between the main characters though it's a bit twisted. Taesung is a carefree guy who seems to love getting into trouble as well as fights. He's the leader of his school and is the rival of Heawon who's the leader of his own school  a bit of a playboy hotheaded and a rich boy. Then there's Hankyung a girl with not a lot going for her  her father just passed away and she moved back with her mother the guy she liked is dating her old friend  and then she meets Heawon who goes to her school and Taesung who calls her nuna older sister. Eventually she discovers Taesung is her brother fruit of one of her father's affair and he loves her despite of their blood relation. Meanwhile Heawon falls for her and takes her as his boyfriend. But she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother who confesses her love to her. Overall it's a wonderful movie but if I was really depressed after the end and I just couldn't help but think Damn are all Korean movie I watch about fightingdeathdepressing stuffincest??

Kang Dong Won did an excellent job acting along with rest of the cast. However it is not a comedy story or an action film .. it falls into drama category.Story stars with an average looking girl moving to Seoul and 2 high school rival gang leaders falling in love with her charming personality one of them being her biological brother... The story could've been better if they had skipped the falling in love with the sister part instead focus on building their relationship as new found siblings while trying to protect the sister from the rival gang leader. I didn't mind the dying part though.. Overall I'm giving it 8 stars..".

Second there's a notsopopular girl and two gorgeous popular guys who fall for and fight over her. Third one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease which eventually takes his life.Still I like this movie.Without the right actors this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. But because the actors fit the roles perfectly the movie is engrossingI honestly couldn't stop watching. Kang Dong Won despite his pretty face gives an awesome heartrending performance not to mention Lee Chung Ah and Jo Han Sun plus all the supporting actors.I'd definitely recommend this movie to everyone.".

Add to this the fact that any dialogue almost entirely fails to manifest itself...But then you forget about Kim Kiduk! If anyone was born with the eye of the cinematographic magician it must be him. Despite the fact that I did not like The Isle at all the photography was utterly unbelievable. Same for Spring Summer... But then I still thought well anyone with reasonable skill can get a good image out of such landscapesspaces. But none of that here  mainly indoors or in the city  just a guy spending his nights at other unknown people's places while they're away and in turn repairs stuff and cleansdoes the laundry. And STILL the images are nothing less than breathtaking. The light is superb the framing everything... Also the storytelling... pacing is perfect  he tells the story with images more than with events. The film actually becomes light as feather and then lighter. Sublimation. And besides that he manages to squeeze in some real drama and the occasional laugh. Go figure.I'm gonna quit here there's really nothing much more I can add.

I must admit that even though South Korean films appeal to me my expectations were quite low not least because the movie was described in a way that was vague to say the least. But after watching it... it all made sense. Because how do you describe a movie like this one? It moves somewhere in the shadowland between reality and fantasy. One of those movies that has very little plot to it but still comes across as beautifully written. And above all things it made me feel good! The closest reference i can find to how this movie made me feel is Lost in Translation. Don't get me wrong the movies are not very alike. But the feeling they gave me is the same. When i watched these movies for the first time i felt like i didn't really know what i was i just saw. I only knew that i liked it and it made me feel good. A warm sensation in my gut telling me that maybe there is hope after all. Hope for what? I don't know life maybe? In the end the 3iron the golfballs and the surface are not important. What's important is life love and warmth. This is a beautiful movie both on the surface and beneath it. It is also a truly unique movie experience and i don't get to say that very often. Highly recommended and definitely one of the best i've seen so far this year.910".

	schema:reviewBody "3Iron Analysis spoiler This is not another review. There are sufficient reviews already. This movie was a deep sensitive imaginative masterpiece and I glad that I saw it. Fortunately the trailers did not warp it into a thriller or emphasize violence or I would have skipped the movie and missed a special experience.Taesuk lives life vicariously scooping up and assimilating the experiences and relationships of families and individuals with varied lifestyles talents and living situations. It is a precarious game but it is Taesuk's reality and he accepts it without fear and without being dissuaded by close calls and dangerous encounters.Taesuk is basically a good person intent on doing what he can to repay for the bit of life memories and lodging that he borrows from others. However he cannot escape the karma of his actions and he accepts those results completely often cheerfully.Taesuk is a deeply internal person and always true to himself. Thus he would not think of fabricating a story to turn around the situation with the man who died of lung cancer to his advantage. He simply flows with the unfolding of the Tao. That is part of my own interpretation of the movie.Taesuk is a free uncontainable spirit. Incarceration is but an opportunity for him to develop and refine that aspect of consciousness perception and ability that is uniquely him. He is totally true to his personal reality which is a sort of game that he plays in his manner of interacting with the realities of others. That development takes him in the direction of Shaolin type skills which are the perfect extension of his own mode of being and perceiving.It is not untypical for martial artists to choose nonsharp everyday objects as their respective weapons of choice. In ancient days that might be a walking staff. In contemporary society perhaps a 3iron. I just hope that no one gets the idea from this movie to try it. I am not a golfer but I gather that the 3iron is a seldomused club for driving the ball hard level and with precision for shortrange distances. Even when used with a tethered ball its power cannot always be controlled. There is always the possibility that it will get out of control as when Taesuk hits a car and kills a woman. This is a metaphor for Taesuk's wellmeaning style of life. Of course he would not have driven the ball toward the car had his reality not been complicated by extending to a real relationship which kept standing in the way of ball's intended direction.One also cannot use a weapon or interact with another lifestream without occurring karma. Karma is not a bad thing it is a teaching agent. Out of emotional involvement Taesuk maims Sunhwa's husband and thus Taesuk must also experience the opposite end of the action by himself being the object of a golfball attack. Taesuk accepts that karma and still retains the 3iron as his martial arts weapon staying true to his lifestyle and personal reality.Taesuk's lack of tolerance for abusive people is an admirable conviction. The way it affects him though is one of his few character flaws. In two instances that of Sunhwa's abusive husband and his own abusive prison guard Taesuk is violently vengeful.For Sunhwa Taesuk's reality is a positive alternative to her empty abusive marriage relationship. Taesuk is kind genuine integris protective and loving. His adventures are far richer than the confines of a suburban definition of paradise.In the end Taesuk develops a deep more permanent love relationship with Sunhwa but in keeping with whom he is a perpetually precarious and dangerous one. The game and the allure have risen to a higher level.David D.".

	onyx:emotionText "3Iron Analysis spoiler This is not another review. There are sufficient reviews already. This movie was a deep sensitive imaginative masterpiece and I glad that I saw it. Fortunately the trailers did not warp it into a thriller or emphasize violence or I would have skipped the movie and missed a special experience.Taesuk lives life vicariously scooping up and assimilating the experiences and relationships of families and individuals with varied lifestyles talents and living situations. It is a precarious game but it is Taesuk's reality and he accepts it without fear and without being dissuaded by close calls and dangerous encounters.Taesuk is basically a good person intent on doing what he can to repay for the bit of life memories and lodging that he borrows from others. However he cannot escape the karma of his actions and he accepts those results completely often cheerfully.Taesuk is a deeply internal person and always true to himself. Thus he would not think of fabricating a story to turn around the situation with the man who died of lung cancer to his advantage. He simply flows with the unfolding of the Tao. That is part of my own interpretation of the movie.Taesuk is a free uncontainable spirit. Incarceration is but an opportunity for him to develop and refine that aspect of consciousness perception and ability that is uniquely him. He is totally true to his personal reality which is a sort of game that he plays in his manner of interacting with the realities of others. That development takes him in the direction of Shaolin type skills which are the perfect extension of his own mode of being and perceiving.It is not untypical for martial artists to choose nonsharp everyday objects as their respective weapons of choice. In ancient days that might be a walking staff. In contemporary society perhaps a 3iron. I just hope that no one gets the idea from this movie to try it.

But I will add an additional warning that you really should not read this if you want the full effect of this film.I've seen Spring Summer Fall Winter... and Spring by this same filmmaker and found it tediously sweet with none of the advertised transcendental insight.And I knew coming into this that it was inspired by Chungking Express both in its hasty assembly and in the story itself. I expected it to be a watered down version of that and it was indeed. But its shifted into imagination. And its believe it or not more cinematic at root.Its more directly rooted in the romance movie but wholly now. And in the kung fu movie but equally new.And more surprises it is so amazingly effective that I found myself helplessly bawling at the end. It succeeds in showing a growing love that is both pure and that does what Spring... does not it transcends.It transcends the normal romance model. The form is fairly rigid. For all the humanness we have as people and all the variety in lives and real relationships we have a startlingly small number of target stories when it comes to love and by this I mean the romance the engagement the charm of shared scented bliss. One reason it was so effective for me is that it sneaks up on you. The story is something like Badlands and is very much in the Malick tradition. We expect the fragility of perfect merging of souls to be revealed as a fantasy of opportunism with charm  including cinematically narrative charms  along the way. We expect disaster. And it does come slowly ratcheting up. Of it appears to come each time being deflected a bit from the norm with the destructive power being deflected.And then after you have been watching for 78s of the thing it shifts ever so gently into a slightly different magical world. Its all so natural that the logic that it does is plain this is where love lives with the magic of the romance natural as a permeating field. This really does sneak up on you and the ending is so lovely so expressive of love that you won't be able to get out of your seat. Its even engineered so that the only words from our lovers in the entire film are those three ordinary ones made magical at the end by their rarity. I wish to recommend this to you. Everyone needs to be reminded what love is and we often come to film for registration. This is something you need to see with your partner if you suspect you have found your soulmate.As a student of film I especially appreciate how in the film our hero tinkers with machines he finds in our houses. And how after working for an hour and a half on visual beauty the woman is a model whose photo we see all over after all that the trick of love is invisibility.In the Mood for Love was my best film about love but it was hooked into dreams not life.

However I had to admit that after about 65 of viewing this film admiring the characters I was still kind of wondering if this film was going to go somewhere. It had to make some direction. Only the last 3rd brought me back and really showed me how ingenious this film is.The lead actor Hee Jae really performs one of the most memorable performances with hardly saying a word his arching brows or glare in his face conveys every emotion masterfully compared to other actors who would have to say a million lines. I won't go over plot details that have already been discussed what is interesting is that all the houses the two break into are all of couples in some stage in a relationship one breaking down one that is well established and peaceful one that is young and virile but perhaps inexperienced.It all seems to be a metaphor for how two beings meet to coexist and compliment each other particularly the final scene that ends with the two antiheroes meeting up and finding their lives in perhaps perfect balance.Be patient with this film STICK with it it's well worth it.

Yes there may be 'turn off's' and disapproving situations  can we do we have the heart to forgive? Are we so 'sacred' and impeccable without ever making mistakes in our lives? Yes we may not be so bold and brash as to 'crash' into another man's house  yet the thought of the young man's 'reality' of being so simple 'matter of fact' walking into someone else's home is not so improbable? He actually appears to be a thoughtful person. He handles with care the content of the house. He picks up the clothes lying around the place gathers them handwashes them hangs them up cleans up the place literally enjoys the home environment the bath the kitchen the food the bed etc. The observant dilemma being he obviously appreciates the househome more than the ownersoccupants.There is 'suspense'  we'd worry what will happen to him to him and her and as the worse fear may arise just like any cops and robbers film can true justice prevail after all? Just when you think you figured out what's going on wd Kim gives us something more to think about. Elements that we don't expect  we're in awe at the concept and perspective presented to us the viewer. It's quite extraordinary really. And be afraid not it will be rewarding satisfying somehow and you just might savor that last moment of magic between the two lead characters her and him. The strength of the two leads portraying to perfection at sublimated tempo by Lee SeungYeon as SunHwa the woman and Jae Hee as TaeSuk the man is truly a godsend both in their debut performances.Once again bravo to Sony Pictures Classics for the choice distribution of this film. Check out the Official Site for Director's Statement and a detail synopsis best to do this after seeing the film. Spring Summer Autumn Winterand Spring 2003 is another film by wd Kim exquisite in cinematic visual and integral in storyline experience. For nongolfers the title 3Iron refers to golf club.".

My vote is seven.Title Brazil Casa Vazia Empty House";

The loneliness where the characters live is a sea of dreams like empty houses of golf balls without have been used. This movie should be considered like one of the year's best. I hope that the people in USA will see it because it's totally beautiful. Like in all the kiDuk movies the violence is an essential element that can't appear hidden because in this time the violence is the gun of the characters.I'm looking forward to his next movie The Bow but before I've got to see Samaritan girl that has been released in my country this weekend.".

Especially after a friend of mine told me it was a dramaticromantic movie with almost no dialogs. Instead i was surprised by how charming touching and pleasant is this movie. The plot is about a guy who enters in empty houses and puts them in order repairs things does the washing manually and stuff like this. The photography is absolutely awesome and added to the skill of the actors supplies to the almost complete absence of dialogs. We assist to this platonic form of platonic love between the protagonists while they live their absurd lives as they were the most normal people in the world.

	schema:reviewBody "Silence is easy but it's also very powerful. In this the information age it's easy to look over this. Fortunately for the filmloving public this entity has not been overlooked by Kim KiDuk in his film 3Iron. KiDuk holds base in South Korea as one of the finest in amongst a country full of excellent directors. His efforts go from strength to strength and this in no exception being one of his finest movies to date.The story follows drifter Taesuk Jae Hee who inhabits empty houses when their proprietors are away. He leaves the house before the homeowners return in search of his next empty abode to squat. One night he gets into a house he believes to be empty and is met by a girl with bruises on her arms and face Sunhwa Lee Seungyeon they don't say a word to each other Taesuk leaves. Taesuk returns to the house to find Sunhwa's husband abusing her he apprehends and he and Sunhwa ride off together. Between them both they share no dialogue except for a sentence at the end of the movie. All of their thoughts and feelings are put into their actions and the manner in which they perform their actions. Considering the complexity of their relationship you'd expect the last thing they'd be is silent but it acts as an excellent metaphor to how silence entitles you to absolute freedom the ability to lock up your problems and leave them behind affords you the chance to be someone different for the duration. Their silence speaks volumes about their characters.The majority of the movie being left without dialogue does not mean to say that the acting is only halfdecent. If anything not having dialogue makes it as hard a job for the two lead actors involved as a decent level of ability is demanded to be able to convey things through expression and body language rather then speech. Jae Jee and Lee Seungyeon put in very affectionate performances absent of overdramatics and instead focusing on delivering humane subtlety the likes of which you're only like to find in a Kim KiDuk movie.3Iron charts in as Kim KiDuk's eleventh movie. It's hard to imagine that a man with this much talent and vision has released so many in as little as 9 years but the world can only hope he continues to release them at this standard in such frequency. KiDuk's definitely a dramatic marvel almost Korea's answer to Wong KarWai in a lot of senses and 3Iron has concreted him as one of the most important directors in the far East.".

	schema:headline " One of the most remarkable films ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "Kim KiDuk's films portray a black world view one by which our selfish impulses cause us to destroy each other and ultimately ourselves. They are driven by the central character's desire to escape this world in their own ways eventually finding a way out of the reality that engulfs them. In Real Fiction 2000 the protagonist disappears into a day dream in which he has revenge on all those who wronged him in the past in Spring Summer Autumn Winter... And Spring 2003 a Buddhist monk lives literally on an island separated from the rest of the world any contact with the outside world results in tragedy be it a visiting mother fleeing with her child she drowns though the child gratefully survives or the monk's apprentice running off with a girl he ends up murdering her and is wanted by the police in Bad Guy the eponymous protagonist tries to find solace through his own love fantasy and then there is 3 Iron Kim KiDuk's magnum opus and one of the most remarkable films ever made.3 Iron seems to tie all the visual and thematic aspects of Kim's films together neatly and impressively making it the ultimate Kim KiDuk film much the same way Fitzcarraldo is the ultimate Herzog or North By Northwest was the ultimate Hitchcock film. Like every Kim KiDuk film the protagonist is a rank outsider from mainstream society. Like Bad Guy the character plays his part almost entirely mute and on this note both Jo Jaehyeon's and Lee Hyunkyoon's performances have to be utterly applauded for being both wonderfully subtle and yet so forcefully expressive. Once again we are faced with a latent dual reality where the protagonist escapes the world around him but is also brutally dragged back into it. Like Bad Guy 3 Iron is a strange love story albeit a far more assuasive one where both the characters decide to disappear into their own world.However 3 Iron defies explanation. Can you imagine trying to pitch this to a Hollywood producer? Ok there's this guy and he like breaks into people's houses. He washes their clothes dishes bathrooms .. he even wears their clothes sleeps in their beds and repairs stuff for them like clocks or broken toy guns with hilarious consequences in the latter's case!. One day he breaks into a house thinking he's alone but meets an abused wife. When her husband returns he proceeds to attack the old philanderer in a very original way which neatly ties in with the title of the film... you'll see and she runs off with him. They then enter his world and live his life together breaking into houses etc before they get dragged back into the real world with all the pain and suffering it brings. Yeah! That'll really get the 1825 demographic rolling down the aisles! Chances are I would have been kicked out midway through the second sentence though if I'm really honest I wouldn't actually mind trying to pitch this to Don Simpson just to see the reaction on his face.But it really would be doing this movie little justice to try and summarise it in some neat little way. It needs to be watched it needs to be experienced like all the great movies. There is no real idea in this film necessarily nor is there a big statement of sorts  Kim KiDuk is not a statement filmmaker like Godard or Eisenstein. Rather like Lynch he prefers to make films that work on an instinctive level in that they draw a gut emotional reaction from you that cannot necessarily be articulated or expressed in an intellectual manner. Is it any coincidence then that Kim like Lynch primarily hails from a painting background and actually wanted to be a painter before he became a filmmaker?Paintings are an apt analogy since every frame is clearly carefully and thoughtfully choreographed characters are either separated in both the physical and emotional sense by vertical or they are united by horizontal lines. But putting aside any visual and textual comparisons to Lynch Kim KiDuk also draws a lot from Wong Kar Wai in terms of narrative and anyone who has seen Chungking Express should notice comparisons to 3 Iron in that both concentrate on a character who breaks into someone else's houseflat and lives their life without them noticing or how one song is ceaselessly repeated to emphasise both the love between the two central characters and furthermore the characters' wish to escape reality though 3 Iron does so more on a less literal level as I mentioned before  in Chungking Express it was California Dreamin' a song that will never be the same for me after that film and I suspect a lot of people feel this way while in 3 Iron it's Gafsa by Natasha Atlas.Still I suppose I can conceptualise and intellectualise to my heart's content  somehow I doubt that any of this will spur you to watch this movie. But I think it should. This film deserves to be seen. It's a tender thoughtprovoking and ultimately and quite strangely heartwarming film as well as quite possibly. an indication that Kim KiDuk is slowly coming of an age as a filmmaker moving on from an entirely pessimistic worldview to one that is more reassuring and serene. Yes there is suffering and darkness but there is also hope and I think this ultimately is what 3 Iron is trying to tell us. It is in short utterly required viewing not to mention the work of a true genius. And it's really not very often I bandy this word about.".

	schema:headline " Elegance saves shallow high concept";
	schema:reviewBody "Selfpossessed lone mute drifter Taesuk Hyunkyoon Lee who has a very spiffy new silver motorcycle and comes from God knows where breaks into houses just to putter around do laundry clean up and fix broken appliances. Some may be reminded of the girl in Wong Kar Wai's Chungking Express Fayae Wong but this chap isn't shyly romancing he's just odd and he enters the houses of complete strangers shifting from house to house testing to see who's not at home by leaving pizza ads on doorknobs then coming back later to see which ones are still there. He never takes anything but he tries out the homeowners' clothes riffles through their mementos and sleeps in their beds. He seems rather effeminate since his whole thing is housekeeping. Accordingly first the young actor on whom the whole film depends seems to be just a little prettyboy type but he proves to have exceptional mime and acrobatic skills and a sly defiant quality that is intriguing. The wordless sequences highlight the film's strong emphasis on photographic images sound and picture which are beautiful chilly and unique. An Arabic love song played over and over after he connects with an abandoned and abused wife is haunting if a bit cloying after a while. After the young man beats up the abusive husband by pitching golf balls at him an odd recurrent theme as is arty still photography of women and goes off with the wife he emerges as more of a man a kind of pied piper of suburban frustration. He gets out of his depth when they move into a poor flat and discover a corpse but the romance goes on....to the end... while remaining dreamlike and unreal.Though the highconcept plot of this very quickly made low budget film may seem rather pat and the director doesn't quite seem to know where to go with it he does present a character and a mood that will stick in the mind. Director Kim Kiduk may be just a bit too much in love with his own ideas and stylistic tics.

	onyx:emotionText "Selfpossessed lone mute drifter Taesuk Hyunkyoon Lee who has a very spiffy new silver motorcycle and comes from God knows where breaks into houses just to putter around do laundry clean up and fix broken appliances. Some may be reminded of the girl in Wong Kar Wai's Chungking Express Fayae Wong but this chap isn't shyly romancing he's just odd and he enters the houses of complete strangers shifting from house to house testing to see who's not at home by leaving pizza ads on doorknobs then coming back later to see which ones are still there. He never takes anything but he tries out the homeowners' clothes riffles through their mementos and sleeps in their beds. He seems rather effeminate since his whole thing is housekeeping. Accordingly first the young actor on whom the whole film depends seems to be just a little prettyboy type but he proves to have exceptional mime and acrobatic skills and a sly defiant quality that is intriguing. The wordless sequences highlight the film's strong emphasis on photographic images sound and picture which are beautiful chilly and unique. An Arabic love song played over and over after he connects with an abandoned and abused wife is haunting if a bit cloying after a while. After the young man beats up the abusive husband by pitching golf balls at him an odd recurrent theme as is arty still photography of women and goes off with the wife he emerges as more of a man a kind of pied piper of suburban frustration. He gets out of his depth when they move into a poor flat and discover a corpse but the romance goes on....to the end... while remaining dreamlike and unreal.Though the highconcept plot of this very quickly made low budget film may seem rather pat and the director doesn't quite seem to know where to go with it he does present a character and a mood that will stick in the mind. Director Kim Kiduk may be just a bit too much in love with his own ideas and stylistic tics.

The acting is great as is the photography. Halle Berry does a good professional job  and as I really like Bernard gis a job Hill it's great to see him in another big budget movie complete with Geordie accent. The main problem with the plot is that is is completely unbelievable. Whereas films like Sixth Sense and The Others allow and invite the audience to suspend belief and just go with the film Gothika fails to do this on all accounts. I'd give it a 410.So on to 3Iron. It's just great. Common wisdom suggests that for any book or film there can be only 1 of 13 plots. In current films from the USA it seems there are only about 5 plots. Watching 3Iron as as a nonKorean speaking Brit is a pleasure  they seem to have released other plots and have the skill to combine them with the existing 13.A minor point that helps is that although the film has English subtitles it really does not need them as it speaks for it's self. Again as a non Korean film expert there's no need to even bother about the performance of the actors  I've no idea if they are Big in Korea but they all give great performances.What you eventually make of the film is completely personally  are these real situations? Are they played by ghosts? Are they scenes acted out of our own minds? In any event it really doesn't matter. At the moment 20042005 it seems the Koreans are on a roll and I can't imagine anyone with a true love for popular cinema could fail to draw thought benefit and pleasure from a film of this quality.Anyway if you don't agree feel free to slug it out via the site or email!

	schema:reviewBody "BinJip 2004 My personal interest in KiDuk Kim appeared some months ago after buying Bad Guy on DVD that movie challenged and moved a lot but at the end it did bother me that it contained certain plot holes. Months later my path came across another movie of his The Isle while this story were without obvious plot holes it failed to contain the emotional strength that made Bad Guy such a remarkable experience for me. Now my path has crossed BinJip and I must say that as an overall vote I rate it higher than both The Isle and Bad Guy but I don't necessarily consider it a better movie. It is a challenging movie that will leave each viewer with a unique interpretation because as in other of KiDuk Kim's movies it's all about interpreting what happens on the screen.The story roughly drawn is about a young man who lives an almost entirely anonymous life breaking into various houses fixing things living their lives doing their laundry for a little while before he moves onto his next location a nomad. One day his path comes across a wealthy house in which he finds a wife beaten up. Once the husband returns he hits golfballs at him with the husband's 3iron and leaves with the wife taking her with him on his journeys.The first thing that strikes me on this movie is how extremely slow and quiet it is it often feels like nothing is happening in the movie at all but actually a lot manages to happen through those 95 minutes. The challenging part about the movie is interpreting the many changes of mood and morals in the movie and as always with KiDuk Kim almost everything is hidden beneath the surface. I don't wanna cross my own interpretation of things in this review as that is impossible without making needless spoilers.Both the acting and the directing is really quite remarkable the main characters of the movie hardly says anything actually the lead male doesn't say one single word at all and the female says only 3 words therefore it can only be considered admirable how many feelings are actually expressed through their faces and movements. The directing is equally brilliant and KiDuk brings a powerful and intelligent visual side as he usually does and of course this movie also includes some fantastic music fitting the mood of the movie perfectly another typical KiDuk detail.As a final note I'd prefer to say it very directly if you like to think during your movies this will interest you especially if you've found KiDuk's other work interesting but if you prefer nonstop action on the screen you'll be extremely disappointed with this one because all the action of this movie happens inside each viewers head.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Kim Ki Duk's surreal film 3 Iron masterfully presents the world as we only think we know it. For the world is never static is it? and that is precisely what this extraordinary film forces its viewers to confront. It's hard to tell whether the world we live in is reality or dream reads the film's epigraph and indeed it is hard to tell much about the film just viewed. Yet we shall try.Known for presenting reality in a twisted yet ironically accurate form see Spring Summer Fall Winter Spring director Kim reaches for and grasps heights yet unknown. Story aside the most notable aspects of the film are so sublime that they cannot go unnoticed itself an ironic observation. In the film beauty is presented in such unlikely manifestations as a small pond of fish a drawing on a palm furious cleaning on a washboard. Its tragedy is presented in similarly unlikely fashion with golf balls fired off by men wielding a 3 iron golf club creating the majority of the violence suffering and death. This is all metaphorical of course but Kim presents such absurdity so convincingly and believably that even the most astute of viewers can come to believe in the literal truth of his eerie ethereal reality. As hard as it may be to believe adversaries do go around pounding each other with golf balls slung from a 3 iron and Kim with seeming effortlessness renders such nonsense plausible. A peculiar naturalness pervades these scenes and instead of being filled with disbelief a viewer wonders at how painful it might actually feel to be struck by a golf ball just after it has been struck by a club in the hands of a knowledgeable player. These otherwise ludicrous scenes become believable in Kim's world.This is not a slasher film with a villain emerging from the links the golf club seems almost accidental in Kim's presentation. Rather the plot is minimalist so simple that it can fly over viewers' heads unnoticed. Being unnoticed is a major theme of this movie as the protagonist seems to possess an uncanny ability to disappear or at least become so flimsy that he seems not to exist even as he dwells right there in front of our eyes and in front of the eyes of his adversaries as well.A benign squatter is our protagonist Tae Suk a guy who lives in temporarily abandoned homes using doorknob menus as evidence of temporary residential abandonment and a locksmith's skill to get himself inside those domiciles. While living in such homes he luxuriates sure but he also cleans laundry and repairs small appliances and electronic gadgets as apparent payment for his short stays. What he doesn't count on is entering an ostensibly empty home wherein hides a fearful and disfigured woman the beautiful model wife of an abusive but oft absent husband. The two meet under incredibly bizarre circumstances move beyond distrust to friendliness befriend one another and eventually fall in love. And this is where Kim's magic works resplendently. The two never once speak to each other at least on camera. Tae Suk played memorably by Jae Hee despite being caught by police tortured and left to suffer the wrath of a vengeful husband never utters a word. The female lead played marvelously by Lee Seung Yeon screams once and only once disingenuously tells her husband I love you. This is the entire extent of the lead players' dialogue. While the world screams at these two dreamlike creatures they maintain their silence their confidence and their selfassured sense of righteousness. Those who speak are corrupt. The silent ones are pure.Stalking his adversaries like a whisper like a shadow Tae Suk breaks our hearts with his refusal to speak. Similarly Sun Hwa the frightened childwoman tears us apart as she imparts a tenderness that she herself has never enjoyed. Somehow these mute characters survive and transcend the noisy ugliness that surrounds them and it is in these sequences that the characters and the viewers experience joy. The film concludes in a simultaneously terrifying and somehow tender scene that only the likes of Kim Ki Duk could imagine and successfully transpose onto film. Film hobbyists reviewers and students alike will undoubtedly find themselves moved by Kim's latest production subtle beautiful tragic and redemptive as it is.The experience of 3 Iron cannot be convincingly conveyed by words only visually can this film be truly appreciated. Rent it buy it see it. This film deserves no less.".

It's hard to tell whether the world we live in is reality or dream reads the film's epigraph and indeed it is hard to tell much about the film just viewed. Yet we shall try.Known for presenting reality in a twisted yet ironically accurate form see Spring Summer Fall Winter Spring director Kim reaches for and grasps heights yet unknown. Story aside the most notable aspects of the film are so sublime that they cannot go unnoticed itself an ironic observation. In the film beauty is presented in such unlikely manifestations as a small pond of fish a drawing on a palm furious cleaning on a washboard. Its tragedy is presented in similarly unlikely fashion with golf balls fired off by men wielding a 3 iron golf club creating the majority of the violence suffering and death. This is all metaphorical of course but Kim presents such absurdity so convincingly and believably that even the most astute of viewers can come to believe in the literal truth of his eerie ethereal reality. As hard as it may be to believe adversaries do go around pounding each other with golf balls slung from a 3 iron and Kim with seeming effortlessness renders such nonsense plausible. A peculiar naturalness pervades these scenes and instead of being filled with disbelief a viewer wonders at how painful it might actually feel to be struck by a golf ball just after it has been struck by a club in the hands of a knowledgeable player. These otherwise ludicrous scenes become believable in Kim's world.This is not a slasher film with a villain emerging from the links the golf club seems almost accidental in Kim's presentation. Rather the plot is minimalist so simple that it can fly over viewers' heads unnoticed. Being unnoticed is a major theme of this movie as the protagonist seems to possess an uncanny ability to disappear or at least become so flimsy that he seems not to exist even as he dwells right there in front of our eyes and in front of the eyes of his adversaries as well.A benign squatter is our protagonist Tae Suk a guy who lives in temporarily abandoned homes using doorknob menus as evidence of temporary residential abandonment and a locksmith's skill to get himself inside those domiciles. While living in such homes he luxuriates sure but he also cleans laundry and repairs small appliances and electronic gadgets as apparent payment for his short stays. What he doesn't count on is entering an ostensibly empty home wherein hides a fearful and disfigured woman the beautiful model wife of an abusive but oft absent husband. The two meet under incredibly bizarre circumstances move beyond distrust to friendliness befriend one another and eventually fall in love. And this is where Kim's magic works resplendently. The two never once speak to each other at least on camera. Tae Suk played memorably by Jae Hee despite being caught by police tortured and left to suffer the wrath of a vengeful husband never utters a word. The female lead played marvelously by Lee Seung Yeon screams once and only once disingenuously tells her husband I love you. This is the entire extent of the lead players' dialogue. While the world screams at these two dreamlike creatures they maintain their silence their confidence and their selfassured sense of righteousness. Those who speak are corrupt. The silent ones are pure.Stalking his adversaries like a whisper like a shadow Tae Suk breaks our hearts with his refusal to speak. Similarly Sun Hwa the frightened childwoman tears us apart as she imparts a tenderness that she herself has never enjoyed. Somehow these mute characters survive and transcend the noisy ugliness that surrounds them and it is in these sequences that the characters and the viewers experience joy. The film concludes in a simultaneously terrifying and somehow tender scene that only the likes of Kim Ki Duk could imagine and successfully transpose onto film. Film hobbyists reviewers and students alike will undoubtedly find themselves moved by Kim's latest production subtle beautiful tragic and redemptive as it is.The experience of 3 Iron cannot be convincingly conveyed by words only visually can this film be truly appreciated. Rent it buy it see it. This film deserves no less.";

	schema:reviewBody "Watched Silenced here on DVD with English subtitles. Didn't really know what to expect from the film before going in but came out shaken angered and left with the feeling of having seen a powerful film that can bring about positive change. The basis for the movie is purported to be based on a true story which makes things all the more striking. Having not watched Children... a Korean movie that came out earlier this year also based on a true story my closest point of reference is Bong JoonHo's by now classic film Memories of Murder. Silenced doesn't possess the master of cinema feel that Memories of Murder has nor does it have the first mover advantage in its story but Silenced is able to deliver the same if not more type of jolt to the viewer which is really saying something. Some criticism I had for the film were 2 scenes felt just too graphic and a few other times the movie seemed to carry a far too simpleton feel but in hindsight I'm guessing both of these points originated from the filmmaker's desire to have maximum impact with the largest group possible. In that case the filmmaker got his wish. While walking out of the theater I did feel energized from having watched something so moving and also filled with fear  anger at just how wicked some parts of society can become. Performance wise I thought Gong Yoo was good and Jung YuMi was her usual great self. There was a final scene with Gong Yoo holding a bible in the middle of the street that didn't move me as much as I thought the scene wanted. Maybe I was just too exhausted from having witnessed humanity at its darkest hour prior to that. The movie also featured large amounts of courtroom drama in the second half which I really enjoyed. Silenced has already brought in a lot of people into the theaters in South Korea and also opened a lot of eyes to the injustices that occurred in South Korea just a few years ago 2005. I think Silenced is a film that will likely leave you in a state that only a few others films probably can. Be prepare to be moved when you watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Silenced aka the Crucible is a 2011 South Korean film that is not really an easy watch. It's quite good for the most part but it will leave a bad taste in your mouth for sure. I do recommend watching it but with the caveat that it will pretty much spoil your evening afterwards. So you've been warned!SPOILERS AHEAD!I have a number of general rules that I try to live by which allow me to go about my life in a civilized society with a clear conscience. These rules include simple mundane courtesies like saying thank you or opening the door for little old ladies or not flipping the bird to that idiot who doesn't know how to drive to more serious matters like not disrupting someone else's marriage or abusing animals for kicks or cheating someone out of their life savings which would incidentally be quite easy to do in my line of work. My list of rules escalate to not hurting people but the list has always topped out with the following DO NOT PHYSICALLY MENTALLY OR SEXUALLY ABUSE CHILDREN!If you don't know already this movie is all about breaking my golden rule stated above. A school chock full of deviant teachers principals and employees which has been systematically and repeatedly raping beating and torturing the child students there on a wide scale. To make matters worse if that's possible is the fact that this is a school for the deaf  mute and that many of these children are from broken homes are orphaned poor etc. To top it off this movie is based on a true story a thought which frankly I could not get out of my head while watching the thing. Now I'm not privy as to what was depicted in the movie is actually factual or what amount of dramatic license was invoked or what have you. But even if the tiniest bit of any of this is even remotely true the I am utterly disgusted. Sadly however I am no longer surprised by hearing stories like this in the world I live in.As for the movie itself it basically revolves around a new teacher who comes to the school and soon uncovers the abuses within. He and a human rights activist he gets to know begin to work to help the children in harm's way and to punish those involved with the crimes. It's a straight up drama story line and courtroom procedural for the most part. There's little to no action or vengeance involved and it's not anywhere near as graphic as it might have been considering the subject matter if this were part of some other type of film genre.Production pacing and story are all solid enough. Acting is pretty strong throughout particularly from the children which had to be bit uncomfortable performance wise for them. There's a side story involving the new teacher's child which quickly takes a back seat to the primary plot point along with the hinting of a budding relationship between said teacher and the activist. Aside from that this film focuses almost exclusively on the evil deed at hand what will be done about it once uncovered and what efforts the community will go to in order to just make this all go away as quickly  quietly as possible. Oh and this IS a Korean production so SUPER SPOILERS you might not want to get your hopes up for the happiest of endings. Bottom line It's in the 78 out of 10 stars range for me. I'll give it an 8 because it is stuck in my brain at least for now after watching it and it was well done overall. And after all isn't that what watching cinema is all about?...If you want any type of a remotely feel goodgood time flick watch something else!...but if you're in the right mood to watch a solid and effecting drama about a sad and horrible topic than this film comes fairly well recommended by yours truly!".

Aside from that this film focuses almost exclusively on the evil deed at hand what will be done about it once uncovered and what efforts the community will go to in order to just make this all go away as quickly  quietly as possible. Oh and this IS a Korean production so SUPER SPOILERS you might not want to get your hopes up for the happiest of endings. Bottom line It's in the 78 out of 10 stars range for me. I'll give it an 8 because it is stuck in my brain at least for now after watching it and it was well done overall. And after all isn't that what watching cinema is all about?...If you want any type of a remotely feel goodgood time flick watch something else!...but if you're in the right mood to watch a solid and effecting drama about a sad and horrible topic than this film comes fairly well recommended by yours truly!";

	schema:reviewBody "Gang Inho takes a job working at a school for the hearing impaired in Gwangju. The movie opens with him driving to the school and having an accident about the same time as a young boy from the school commits suicide by walking in front of a train. From almost the beginning of his time at the school he notices that something seems out of kilter. The school seems almost dark and unfeeling. The students not particularly friendly and one teacher is just damned mean. The movie focuses on two sisters one of whom is especially standoffish and the other unfriendly and with issues about eating and their brother who seems to be bloodied and bruised worse every time he comes to class. We eventually learn that the two girls are being abused physically and sexually by the Principal and the Asst Principal with the knowledge of one female teacher the security guard a local police officer and at least one staff member who is abusing the boy both physically and sexually The teacher enlists the help of Seo Yujin a human rights activist to help the children and him Initially they find little support for their cause. The police are totally disinterested in what Yujin tells them. Partially because here in Korea making the establishment look bad is not something people do readily and partially because the police officer is a fairly high ranking figure within the department. Finally they turn to YTN News. And a reporter does an interview with the children that is seen on TV throughout Korea. The police reluctantly spring into action and arrest the principal asst principal and the teacher  no one else. The movie then moves onto the second trial. The children are 'raped' again this time by members of the establishment. The Superintendent for Public Instruction and the defense lawyer try to bribe the teacher into ending the case. When he refuses they pay off the aged and mentally feeble grandmother of the children. The local evangelical community rallies to the defense of the principal. The prosecutor seems to be on the side of justice but in the end it appears he left the children hanging out to dry. The movie is extremely graphic and painful. The rape scenes are not glossed over and the physical abuse of the oldest brother is difficult to watch. But more painful is the end of the trial where the audience is left frustrated angry and saddened by the way these three children and their dead brother are left with nothing even remotely resembling justice. What makes this hard to take is that while the movie is based on the events the events still happened and they were as horrid as the movie describes. And were it not for the book and this movie some of these people would have continued with their lives as if nothing had happened. A definite 10.".

The reason is simple they are suffering from pain through twinprincipals and other teachers. Kang Inho first was blind towards the horrible acts however he wakes up very quickly and puts his life in the background to devote him entirely to these children in the deepest distress.Written and directed by filmmaker Donghyuk Hwang who runs his second coil after My Father 2007 based on the novel by Jeeyoung Cong taking Novel in one hand and camera in the other Hwang Donghyuk takes us into a hell where cruelty is watchword. Men who abuse children are already a disgrace but when equipped with a handicap that prevents them to express them while we pass this stage to speak only to be demonic. Moreover work is in addition to killing these demons exposing South Korea where levels of justice are rotten to the point that despite overwhelming evidence everyone comes out innocent or at worst a slight slap on the wrist. Such injustice deserved to talk about it and if the literature does not always express them on a large scale the cinema can more easily and in 2011 the film has been a blow pushing the government to close the school and start a new trial.Hwang Donghyuk who directs his cast with strength and power conveys a strong message with an eye opener. We can feel the players involved everyone is in the place and nobody is ever too much especially children crying for truth despite their silence but the look says a lot about the work of management. No melodramatic pathos not only the accuracy enhanced by fluid narration and exciting equally divided between face to face with the horror and the trial or rather mock trial. The director also quite unsettling talent to film scenes touching working the image at the point of giving an atmosphere of morbid poetry returning the stomach although almost everything is hidden to the Unlike scenes about bullying that they go into bestiality at the lowest.Silenced is a work that takes you to the gut but also a masterpiece at all levels sad very sad because during filming like writing a book hopelessness was most certainly in the spirit all nobody is expecting that the film can shake rotten legal foundation at this point to the bone. The arrival of this film is welcome but it remains a work paradoxically awful cinematic should play a social role rape torture and death stories of children who have so far had very little impact. We think Hwang Donghyuk has done considerable work but we also think these children whose childhood or life were stolen. The story is very centered and never leaves its intention as I said earlier it is based on the true story we can feel the sufferings of the characters.This is a take on the human with animal instinct and the actions will shake the base of humanity.Recommended to everyone who can digest the kinky truth.910".

	schema:reviewBody "What happened to the kids is something you hear from the media with disbelieving eyes. We usually ask ourselves how could the people commit such horrible deeds? Can that really happen in our society? Though the movie is the fiction based on the bestseller novel written by Gong Jee young the novel itself was based on the reallife incident reported by the South Korean media in 2005. As depicted in the movie it drew lots of attention from the people at that time and there was the trial for this heinous crime later  but that was not the end of the story and there are still scars remained.When we meet InhoGong Yoo for the first time he is coming to the local area named Mujin as the new art teacher of the boarding school for the deaf students. While his daughter is taken care of by his mother in Seoulhis wife was dead he lives alone in some shabby apartment. He does not particularly like his new job but he needs a job for earning the money for his sick daughter. When the principle and the administration supervisor the principle's twin brotherboth are played by Jang Gwang demand Inho to pay the considerable amount of money as the contribution for school development fund on his first day he accepts their demand without question. It is not right thing to do but he has no choice if he wants to keep his job.However it turns out that is not the only thing he has to deal with while working at this school. He sees one of the teachers savagely beating one of his students in the teachers' office while other teachers ignore the abuse being committed right in front of them. At one night he hears a strange sound from the ladies' room when he is about to leave. He tries to find out who is behind the bathroom door but he is soon interrupted by the night guard who assures him that nothing happens. Later he witnesses the other teacher abusing the other student with the washing machine at the basement  while the washing machine is turned on.If you have some knowledge about the South Korean society you will probably have some good idea about what will happen next. Inho and Yu jin want these disgusting people to be arrested but as shown in his expensive office the principle is a wellrespected member of the local society. He is also an elder of the local churchthat means we will see some unpleasant side of Korean Christians and he has some powerful connections to the local authorities. On the day when he comes to the office for the giving the money for the school development fund Inho happens to see a local cop stopping by the school for his money. Even when they try to report this crime to the other local government officials they ignore them with bureaucratic indifference while saying it is not their job due to the jurisdiction rule.Eventually after the kids' story goes out on TV the principle and others are quickly arrested and the trial soon follows but Inho and Yujin find themselves more helpless as the time goes by. The kids are willing to testify what happened to them and there are some evidences to support their testimonies but it is possible that their abusers will not be properly punished in the end. The counsel for the accused a former law official is wellconnected to judges and prosecutors as a custom inside the South Korean justice system they give some advantages to him because it is his first trial after leaving his office. The kids' parents are poor or disabled so they can be easily persuaded to withdraw the suit on the behalf of their children. They even approach to Inho who has been in financially difficult situation.The director Hwang Donghyeock wisely does not hurry his story. While providing the good atmosphere with the hazy fog covering the town he effectively conveys the frustration inside the story. Though his character is rather bland and passive Gong Yoo does a passable job as an ordinary man who tries to do the right thing while knowing that there is little he can do for the abused kids. Jeong Yumi is trapped in her flat character who mostly functions as the mouthpiece of the story but she does as much as she can.The movie is not free from its flaws. Despite its good intention it sometimes stumbles with a heavyhanded approach. While the villains are played effectively by good actors they are just mean and despicable in onedimensional way. They seem to come from the other movie whenever confronting the other characters. The court scenes have some awkwardness although it is less stiff than other South Korean movies featuring the court scenes. The finale is overlong and a little too melodramatic while emphasizing the characters' bitterness they have to face at the end of their struggle.Nevertheless Silenced has enough power to draw you into its anger and you will identify with its indignation toward the unfairness in South Korean society. As reflected in the epilogue in the movie the abusers were only sentenced to light punishment and they did not even go to the jail. How could they let that happen? Will such a horrible thing happen again? Sad thing is it is really hard for us to prevent the world from changing ourselves let alone change the world.".

They'll always be the manipulative child abusers I have just witnessed. This movie has simply left me shocked which is rare. I had no problem watching A Serbian Film but this movie had one specific scene that made me gag. The bathroom scene with Minsoo's little brother. I had to rewatch to be sure it was just a doll. But as soon as I noticed the doll move I was so close to throw up. That is something I have never seen in ANY movie! Though it was disturbing I must give a standing ovation to the actors in that scene. How brave of them to put themselves in that kind of scenario.Speaking of actors can you get any better child actors?! Jesus Christ on the cross these kids are so good I would not be surprised if I was watching a documentary. Defintely a good watch... if you have the stomach for it. Make sure to be hydrated though otherwise the tears will dry you out.".

SILENCEDTHE CRUCIBLE is an effective  realistic drama feature that appeals because of the sincerity towards the film by its actors and the justice done to the script by the director. Such strong content oriented films can definitely change the society and it's not a spoiler it did. To find out more search about it on Internet. SILENCED is by no means an ordinary film it's a film which questions South Korean society as well as the people of the world as humans too.I don't think it would be right to tell what the film is about since that can be found out easily. But wait. Why don't you simply see the film and recommend it to others? This is a realistic film and the word is enough for you to understand what kind of a film it is. The topic is what is being commonly raised in our Indian movies too but from a totally different perspective. I think this is the first of its kind. The film is made in a way that you'll end up rooting for the lead characters their efforts and the young victims. I was indeed shocked to see how far can the devilish nature of humans go. Some scenes rather many scenes might be by no means an easy watch. But I support the director's reason for adding these realistic scenes to make us feel angry and I not just felt angry but also happy that he succeeded in making us emote.SILENCED is a film which can end up raising hot debates and talks and it would be a surprise if one doesn't end up liking the film. The film is a perfect example of films that can change the society the country and eventually the world. Even though I'm not a South Korean I ended up liking this film very much. What happens in this film happens in India almost daily but still it was refreshing to see such a realistic film from South Korea the country from where we get terrific films everywhere.Technically too this film is brilliant. I recommend catching it on Blu ray. The dialogues are powerful. Gong Yoo once again proves himself and I don't need to say why. Jung Yumi is not just pretty but a talented actress too. You can see it from her performance. The child artists surprise you with their acts since you don't expect kids normally to do such a dark film. They all give terrific performances eventually making you feel their pain. The pain in the torturous violence can be felt and is thus not meant to entertain you. The cinematography is excellent. Visuals are excellent. The music supports the film and the editing is great as the film doesn't bore you for even a second. SILENCED is a very very powerful film which deserves to be seen. Sadly I can't recommend it for kids since they would be saddened but I recommend it to people around 15 and above to watch it. Such films don't intend to entertain you only but also to make you aware and alert. It won't be right to call it an enjoyable film but it's definitely thoughtprovoking and at times entertaining too.".

First of all this is one of the best films of 2004 and I hope it gets a wider release in America. Why did the Korean film Spring Summer Winter Fall...and Spring get a significant release in the USA but Untold Scandal has not? Untold Scandal is the far better of the two. Secondly I felt this version of Dangerous Liasons was FAR superior to the American version that was made a number of years ago with Glenn Close and John Malkovich. This version was played more as a love story more of a Shakespearean tragedy and infinitely more heartbreaking. While all the performances are strong the woman playing Lady Sook the Michelle Pfeiffer role in the American version was by far the most moving of all the performances. As someone noted earlier in their comment I didn't see this as a comedy at all. But again this was absolutely tremendous and I hope it gets a wider release in America so that more will have the opportunity to see it.".

Why did the Korean film Spring Summer Winter Fall...and Spring get a significant release in the USA but Untold Scandal has not? Untold Scandal is the far better of the two. Secondly I felt this version of Dangerous Liasons was FAR superior to the American version that was made a number of years ago with Glenn Close and John Malkovich. This version was played more as a love story more of a Shakespearean tragedy and infinitely more heartbreaking. While all the performances are strong the woman playing Lady Sook the Michelle Pfeiffer role in the American version was by far the most moving of all the performances. As someone noted earlier in their comment I didn't see this as a comedy at all. But again this was absolutely tremendous and I hope it gets a wider release in America so that more will have the opportunity to see it.";

More than that he is a nobleman one Jowan Bae YongJun accomplished in not only painting but also poetry calligraphy and martial arts. And for good measure he paints scene of his own licentious encounters.Untold Scandal is yet another adaptation of 18th century classic Les Liaisons Dangereuses better known to moviegoers as Dangerous Liaison 1988. The scene however is transported to feudal Korea. The main story line is Jowan's bet with his cousin Lady Cho Lee Misook that he can seduce virgin widow Lady Suk Jeon Doyeon. Along the way we are privy to Jowan's other exploits including his painting model Lady Suk's maid and an adolescent concubinetobe Sook. In the last case Lady Cho also got her prey in Sook's young admirer through a wicked conspiracy she and Jowan executed over the innocent young couple.So much for the pleasure of the flesh. The light comic tone turns dark when a measure of affection develops between Jowan and Lady Suk ending in a fatalistic tragedy.Comparison with Dangerous Liaison seems inevitable. Both Li Misook and Glenn Close gave an excellent portrayal of this intelligent cultured completely bored and thoroughly wicked highborn lady. In Dangerous Liaison the woman's brilliant performance is perfectly matched by the man's in John Malkovich's cunningly charming nobleman. In Untold Scandal however Bae YongJun despite his immense popularity in Korean soup operas is coming short. His Clerk Gable style charm and wit are rather superficial rendering the successful seduction of this immovable lady rather unconvincing.With the character of Lady Suk it's yet another story. Michelle Pfeiffer and Jeon Doyeon both did a marvellous job but it's not meaningful to compare them because their style is so different. Here I'd rather concentrate on Jeon Doyeon who must be considered one of the best actresses in Korea today. To fully appreciate her brilliant versatility one has to see both the shy innocent lonely girl yearning for love in Cheobsok 1997 and the scheming reckless adulteress in Happy End 1999. Those who consider her lovemaking scene in Untold Scandal daring for a Korean movie should see the first ten minutes of Happy End for an eyeopener.The story of Untold Scandal is told in a simple manner with conspicuous frequent use of voice off. Art direction and cinematography are the forte of this movie. At the close range we see a meticulously detailed shot of a serving tray with a sumptuous Korean meal served in some thirty bowls and dishes. A similar shot but on a different subject matter is the makeup tray for the high lady. In the medium range the colourful Korean consumes and architecture become the star. Finally there are breathtaking views of sea and snowfield that accentuate the poignancy towards the end.".

Malkovich seemed like the faking unfaithful perp till the end but in Untold Scandal you genuinely see the transformation in him from a seducer to a man desperately in love. While i didn't give a hit about the characters in Dangerous liaisons since they are all pretty much ruthless bastards you really care for everyone in Untold Scandal which made the ending even more depressing. Lastly the simple and beautiful scenery of 18th century Korea is in itself breathtaking enough to see the film. I recommend both versions you might want to see them back to back.".

It is about the wages of cynicism a tragedy where the wicked are justly punished by experiencing on their own bodies and souls the effects of their ruthless actions. It shows how people's actions have consequences and how those consequences will eventually come full circle to slap the perpetrators in the face. It is a movie about human nature saying that cynicism goes against our nature and can destroy us all if running unchecked. A morality tale. A good and true one. A Classic.My rating 9 out of 10.P.S.

	schema:reviewBody "Revenge is sweetest when done secretly. Untold Scandal is a lush adaptation of the novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses set in Chosun Dynasty Korea. I have not read the novel nor seen any of the other film adaptations e.g. Dangerous Liaisons Cruel Intentions so my review is on the merits of the film itself rather than a comparison to other works.Lady Cho is none too happy when her husband brings in 16yearold SoOK to be his concubine. She is cute and virginal and of course Lady Cho can't stand it. So she turns to her cousin Sir Cho Won and makes a devious propositionseduce this innocent flower and impregnate her. The thought of presenting her husband with a pregnant concubine makes Lady Cho's eyes sparkle. What would Cho Won get in return? What he has always wantedto enjoy the carnal pleasures of Lady Cho.But the idle rich are easily bored and this is hardly the test Cho Won was looking for. Seducing a nave teenager is no challenge. A few flattering words and well what girl would not fall into bed with the dashing and charming Cho Won? He offers a counterproposal. If he can bed the virginal Lady Chung who belongs to a Catholic group and has made a vow of chastity that would be a true accomplishment worthy of the reward Lady Cho offers. Of course being the Lothario that he is he can't help making eyes at SoOK as well. Just a little something on the side to keep in practice. Now the games begin. Cho Won finds it rough going as Lady Chung wants nothing to do with him. She has heard of his reputation and she has no interest in anything but her Catholic service and charity work. She's rather a plain Jane and can't even conceive of why Cho Won would want to have anything to do with her anyway. In fact she tells him straight out that she would rather live with the plague victims than even carry on a conversation with him. He's certainly got his work cut out for him.Lady Cho gets a perverse pleasure out of this game of seduction and manipulation. And she's got her own devious games to play with the clueless SoOK.The scheming escalates in intensity and nefariousness. Will Lady Chung crack? Will Lady Cho have to pay up on the bet? Will SoOK end up a pregnant bride? Will the Law of Unintended Consequences come back to bite Cho Won? The challenge for the actors is to make such characters engaging enough so that the viewer isn't completely turned off by them. Let's face it. Cho Won is a cad of the first degree and Lady Cho is no better. Even when it appears that Cho Won is succumbing to actual feelings of affection and love we are not sure if it is genuine or just a part of his merciless game.Many films can offer up good villains but they are usually played off against protagonists who have the audience's sympathy and interest. It is more of a task when the villains have to carry the film. I think Untold Scandal rises to the challenge admirably. The scheming cousins set about their plans with such style and panache that viewers may find themselves actually rooting for them. These are interesting characters who are surprisingly multidimensional especially in the case of Cho Won.My major issue with the film was that the ending seemed sort of slapped together. Up until then we've been treated to a very tight and contained piece but then things start spinning all over the place. I'm not sure if this is true to the original story or if the director felt that after 2 hours he'd better just wrap things up.If you like costume and period pieces this is the movie for you. The look of the film is colorful and vibrant. The Hong Kong DVD version carries a Category III rating for some nudity eroticism and sensuality but it is not some silly sex romp. The characters develop and there are some surprises along the way.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is an interesting one. The story is adapted from the French novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses Dangerous Liasans. It's an 18th maybe 17th?century French novel of intrigue and scandal and the movie is set in... 18th century Korea during the Chosun period. If you've seen Dangerous Liasans or a modernday adaptation Cruel Intentions you've basically got the plot down. Male womanizer and scheming female near relative make a bet that womanizer can't seduce a pure woman. And stuff goes crazy from there.So I decided to watch this film because it was a massive boxoffice opener in Korea beating out all of its competition at the time. A few things that I noticed 1 I like watching Korean period films especially those of older Korea because the costumes and set design tend to be very aesthetically pleasing. The art direction is beautiful.2 The acting was actually quite impressivecertainly better than Cruel Intentions which is the only other version of this film that I've seen.3 There are a few graphic sex scenes and many suggested ones so if you can't handle that don't watch the film.4 The tragedy is tragic and the love story is surprising. The ending was quite moving and was tragic because the flaws of the characters led to their own demise and loss of the things that they love.5 Cinematography and direction are very strong and the primary actresses are particularly strong.In the end this was a well rendered adaptation so much that I'm curious as to what the original source material is like. I really like the plot lines and the story because it converges so many different themes into a tragic tale of human weakness and yet manages to paint the weak fallible and sometimes wicked characters in such a way that you still have some sympathy for them showing that there is something in everyone that was or is beautiful but it can get buried under the vices of this world.All the actors are not strong and the film suffers a little from slow pacing but in the end it's a very watchable film that has a lot of strengths even if the film isn't one of the great films of all time. If you can handle the content I recommend this film. 810.".

I really like the plot lines and the story because it converges so many different themes into a tragic tale of human weakness and yet manages to paint the weak fallible and sometimes wicked characters in such a way that you still have some sympathy for them showing that there is something in everyone that was or is beautiful but it can get buried under the vices of this world.All the actors are not strong and the film suffers a little from slow pacing but in the end it's a very watchable film that has a lot of strengths even if the film isn't one of the great films of all time. If you can handle the content I recommend this film. 810.";

Still I think that Frears'is film is way stronger. The only acting work that stood out stronger then Frears'is characters was the lady who played the virtous Madam Sook Michelle Pfeiffer's character in Frears'is version. This was an incredibly strong performance and I liked it more then Pfeffer's approach.As to the others they slightly lacked detail and depth. Overall the Korean protagonists were no match to John Malkovich and Glenn Close. And the whole lot of other characters both men and women looked and acted in such a similar way that it took me some time to distinct them from each other.However the film was still very interesting to watch and all this historical Korean world was beautifully shot. The film got better at the end and when the bad guy changed it was really moving and believable. Specially the last scene with him on the beach. I also very much liked the scene between him and Madam Sook in the library.".

But falls flat in other areas as well. But did a good job of incorporating the classic sexual tale into taking place during the 18th century Korea. Bae Yongjun plays the flirtatious seducer that picks on the weak minded girls and woman. I am not a fan of Bae Yongjun and this movie didn't make me have a different thought about the actor. But I still think he fit the this role quite nicely. Bae Yongjun's character pulls all the tricks up his sleeves in order to seduce someone for a bet. Who is a this virtuous woman that is difficult to tempt. But the chemistry between the two leads just didn't seem all that strong or leaves a presence. Even if it's one sided for quite a while. The build up is a bit weak for the most part. And thus made the ending less impactful and believable.

	schema:headline " Excellent film with superb performances by Nargis and Dilip Kumar";
	schema:reviewBody "Andaz is considered one of the alltime classics of early postindependence Hindi cinema and the 'original' love triangle of Hindi film. Set among the at least superficially extremely Westernised uppercrust of metropolitan Indian society Andaz tackles the perennial question of the feasibility of a purely platonic friendship between members of the opposite sex. This is a valid issue but where I think the film errs is in equating one possible answer to the question with Westernisation and the other with Indianness which to me is simplistic and therefore unsatisfactory. This flaw apart however Andaaz makes for very satisfying viewing and feels fresh and topical  and very modern in terms of both content characterisation and presentation extremely glossy! even today 53 years after its release.Neena Nargis in a breakthrough performance that established her as the reigning female superstar of Indian cinemais the headstrong slightly tomboyish and wonderfully freespirited and perhaps slightly naive only child of a milllionaire. Out riding one day she loses control of her horse and is rescued by Dilip Dilip Kumar with whom she becomes fast friends in spite of her father's misgivings about such a friendship and its potential for misinterpretation. Dilip proves to be a reliable friend to whom Neena turns when her father passes away making him a partner in her business but it is clear from the start that Dilip's feelings extend beyond friendship he is falling in love with this charming young woman. However Neena is in love with Rajan who is away in London and when he returns she picks up the threads of their relationship. Dilip reveals his love for Neena to her on her wedding night though she loves only Rajan. However the path of true love is rarely smooth and Rajan's suspicions about his wife's relationship with Dilip lead to tensions between him and Neena leading eventually to the melodramatic but surprisingly effective tragic denouement.Andaaz has a sparkling script peppered with witty conversations between both the lead pairs which is pitched just right and Mehmood's direction is polished and intelligent. The ostensible theme is a conflict betwen tradition and modernity equated here with 'India' and the 'West' with the director firmly on the side of the former but although I was not convinced by this premise it worked wonderfully as an engaging romantic comedy for the first half and a dramatic tourdeforce in the second.However the key to Andaaz's success in my opinion is a virtually perfect central performance by Nargis. She plays the many shades of the complex character of Neena to perfection growing from the carefree tomboyish girl of the beginning just watch her in the charming opening sequence as she gets dressed in her jodhpurs and strides out to go riding  this is masterful filmmaking and acting establishing a character in a few frames to the intense morally conflicted yet steadfast woman of the latter half with elan. Her body language is  pleasure to watch  immensely confident especially in her interaction with the male leads yet wonderfully controlled in the moments of high drama. Rarely have I seen such a wellmodulated selfassured performance though it helps of course that Nargis had a complex not entirely unambiguous character to play with and that the film revolves around her. Nonetheless for me watching Nargis in this film was added confirmation of her immense talent and it is amazing to think that she was barely a few films old and 19 years old when it was made! Watch her in the scene where she and her father discuss the central dilemma of the plot her use of her body language to situate her mental state and their relationship is very polished. Of course she looks luminous aided in no small measure by Faredoon Irani's glossy cinematography and her onscreen chemistry with both heroes is a pleasure to watch. She had a beautiful speaking voice too capturing shades of emotion with ease without overacting or sounding shrill or screechy. Her singing voice is a young Lata imitating Noorjehan which to my mind is a good thing since it's a better fit than Lata's later shriller vocals.The male leads are a great foil for each other and for Nargis. Raj Kapoor is good though he does overplay sometimes. Dilip Kumar is as always magnificent in his restraint and the depth he brings to his character. Although his character is not entirely a pleasant one in the final analysis one sympathises with him. The supporting cast are good too especially Cuckoo as Neena's friend Sheela who is given to dancing sexily at parties an added bonus and the guy who plays Neena's father. Even the mandatory comedy track involving an old Professor of Rajan's is actually funny and actually makes some of the points the director is seeking to make only with humour thrown in. Perhaps a bit redundant especially given that the interaction of the principal characters is often funny enough peppered as it is with witty lines but it isn't annoying as these things sometimes can be.This is a great film strikingly modern in tone and feel though it is over half a century old. Whether or not one is convinced by its eventual rejection of 'the modern West' in favour of 'traditional India' it is well worth a watch not only for itself but because some of the set pieces and situations from this film have come over time to be part of the stockintrade of the Indian commercial filmmaker though rarely has this level of accomplishment been achieved so that if you're interested in seeing how the grammar and vocabulary of Hindi films has evolved over time this is crucial reference viewing. Great actors great script great direction great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has quite a reputation in Indian cinema apparently although it's difficult to see why. Working strictly within the established confines of Bollywood genre moviemaking it tells a simple love triangle story that mirrors the tensions between traditional Indian values and Western ideology in the early years of India's independence from its colonial masters. Perhaps it is renowned because it was the first of its kind because there is little here when viewed nearly sixty years after it was made to distinguish it from other films of its genre.The nineteenyearold Nargis plays Neena headstrong daughter of a wealthy widowed industrialist who is saved from certain death when her horse bolts by lowly Dilip Dilip Kumar. The pair strike up an intimate friendship which Dilip mistakes for mutual love but tragedy looms when Rajan Raj Kapoor the love of Neena's life returns from London.From its lighthearted opening Andaz travels an increasingly dark path as Neena finds herself torn not so much by the two men in her life but by the conventions and expectations of a traditional Indian society that conflicts with her westernised outlook on life. She is an innocent victim a figure of tragedy whose life by the movie's end is irredeemably destroyed through no fault of her own. Given this it's surprising how unmoving her plight is. Again this is no fault of Neena  or of Nargis who gives an outstanding performance as she slowly transforms from a carefree young girl into a tragic broken woman  but of a script that jerks hesitantly along between a slew of musical numbers an increasingly hysterical and implausible storyline especially in the last couple of reels and an overbearing performance from Raj Kapoor. In fairness to Kapoor he is saddled with a character so irritating that it is impossible to understand what Neena sees in him. Accompanied by an even more annoying professor Rajan is one of those types who relentlessly fires off a barrage of jokes and quips that are consistently unfunny so that after a while you wish someone would smack him up the side of the head for being so annoying.As the film grows increasingly darker and ominous it also grows increasingly melodramatic as having dragged its feet for two hours it suddenly realises the final credits are looming and it still has a load of stuff to do. The writers could have added a decent mystery aspect to the story had they used Neena's trial as a framing device for the entire movie but instead the trial is summarised in a couple of minutes screen time. Kumar gives an admirably restrained performance as Neena's rejected suitor but even he can't salvage anything from the mystifying aboutface his character performs after being bashed on the head with a tennis racket. At that point all semblance of credibility is lost and the film sinks beneath the weight of its own hyperbole.".

Her gratefulness and treating him as purely a friend is misconstrued by all especially her chain smoking father Kumar himself and eventually the real love of her life the whimsical Raj Kapoor. She's accused of social naughtiness but is completely innocent later murders in self defence and is given life imprisonment. Harsh!

It was her film her two men one overplaying the other underplaying in here were not worthy or her! As a counterpoint to her amazing elegance the production values were excellent too especially her elegant house  or should that be temple  showing to good advantage. Favourite song is Koi Mere Dil Mein sung by Lata with Nargis dawdling on the enormous ornate staircase.Sadly time has taken its toll  the only print I've ever seen gets a bit blotchy at times but it's never too distracting.

Peter Strelzyk comes up with a daring idea to construct a homemade air balloon big enough to carry the two families across the EastWest militarized border. The border between East and West Germany is heavily militarized complete with watch towers guard dogs barbedwire alarms sensors search lights and patrols. Rumors have it that some areas of the militarized border are mined. The only chance of crossing the border is by air. The Strelzyks and the Wetzels commence their risky venture by purchasing lots of taffeta fabric and sewing it together with a sewing machine in the attic. Peter Strelzyk builds an experimental homemade hot air balloon burner. In 1979 when the balloon is ready Peter and his son test it but the Wetzel family becomes hesitant. The Strelzyks decide to go alone but bad weather causes the balloon to crash inside the Communist zone. ...";

Mann doesn't skimp on East Bloc clichs like spying neighbors and a scarcity of fresh produce but it is frighteningly effective when the police start throwing their totalitarian weight around. Of course the movies are full of mean authoritarian Germans who regardless of their ideological leaning dress neatly and shout orders in heavily accented English Gnter Meisner who plays the chief communist baddie gave much the same performance in The Winds of War miniseries as a famous anticommunist Hitler.  Still even if a lot of this is Bgrade stuff the flight sequences are beautifully filmed with the usual Disney flair.  This also is interesting as one of a series of adultthemed films Disney produced in the late 70s and early 80s The Devil and Max Devlin The Watcher in the Woods as the studio struggled to define itself in the postpostWalt but preMichael Eisner years.".

I was arrested by the Vopos in Checkpoint Charlie and accosted by a man in his leather coat and dark glasses I am led to believe was Stasi.

The Trabants constantly breaking down were still the main mode of private motorised transport the shops still featured nothing much to tempt me uniforms were still commonplace but the people the ordinary people were open and nice once you had gained their trust.

It is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed. I would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape. It did not happen in or around Berlin as supposed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the Berlin Wall. The escape balloon was flown over the Iron Curtain which not only divided Germany but it divided the whole of Europe at that time. The balloon took off from Pssneck 170 miles southwest of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic East Germany and flew 14 miles to Naila in Bavaria and freedom in West Germany. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year. Whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from East Berlin other parts of the GDR or other Sovietcontrolled states.".

Not intelligent satire not quite slapstick but somewhere in between you get a lot of funny jokes. However this film is the opposite of political correctness.

Unfortunately he isn't particularly funny in this and his sense of timing is virtually nonexistent. He also has absolutely no charm beyond a perpetual grin. So this leaves Sutherland and Lithgow to save this creaky vehicle and they do their best in the cause of a fast paycheck. I miss Vidmark.

It's more a fault of the film than anything else.The simplistic plot meanders from location to contrived location offering us up more ludicrous situations than you can shake a stick at and a bit of unfunny slapstick humour here and there. Thomas Ian Griffiths looks the part as an action hero and is sufficient as an actor but lacks charisma while Tia Carrere is absolutely hopeless as the tough annoying heroine who constantly gets on your nerves. Only Donald Sutherland comes off relatively well compared to the others as a psychotic hitman who often rambles to himself in some mildly amusing indulgences. John Lithgow plays the villain and to say he is underused is an understatement. Still this may be a good thing as his screen time is disappointing.There's nothing worse than an unfunny comedy and this is one of the worst I've seen. Truthfully I laughed only twice throughout the entire film in a couple of absurdist scenes one where a man tries to roll under a closing door and gets there too late and the other where a casual villain walks up to a doorway and fires a rocket straight in through the doors in a matteroffact way. Otherwise I sat there unable to believe my eyes at how clichd and miserable this film was. This review has been written as a warning avoid this at all costs!".

Then if by the end of a month if he can show the intact bill he will indeed be a man worthy of whatever fortunes might befall on him because of the sheer luck of proving the brothers right.The lucky recipient of the note is one Henry Adams an American in London who is just a poor man with no money or prospects of a job in the near future. He tests his good fortune when he decides to dine at a modest restaurant. As the bill comes he shows his one million pound note which of course the owner can't possibly change.

He is given a set of smart clothes a suite at one of the best hotels in town and an introduction to high society something that is not always available to Americans even rich ones as Henry appears to be.This delightful comedy of 1954 was a total surprise. The film made in England at the famous Pinewood studios was directed by Ronald Neame. Based on a Mark Twain story which we haven't read it counts on the great work of Gregory Peck a man that was one of the most charismatic performers during his years in the cinema. Mr. Peck is the whole movie it's unimaginable to think of any other actor playing Henry Adams.The supporting cast shows familiar faces of consummate English players who contribute to create the Edwardian atmosphere. Ronald Squire and Wilfrid HydeWhite are the Montpellier brothers whose bet trigger the action. Reginald Beckwith is the mute valet who sticks by Henry through thick and thin. Jane Griffiths plays Portia the woman that conquers Henry Adams heart. Also in the cast we saw Hugh Griffith in a noncredited role. Joyce Grenfell another delightful character actress has some brilliant moments as the Duchess of Cromarty.An enjoyable movie. Catch if it ever plays on your classic movie channel.

	schema:reviewBody "This is an amusing trifle set at the turn of the century in England but based on a story by Mark Twain of all people. Twain at his best could take a trifling idea and run off with it. He demolishes detectives in The Stolen White Elephant which describes the ineptitude of detectives in finding a huge creature that has run off. Similarly here he demonstrates the limitations of money and how easy one can live on credit by simply having a note that nobody can cash.Two brothers who are very wealthy give the Bank of England one million pounds so that they can settle a bet. There is a single bank note for one million pounds in existence. What would happen if someone in need were given the note as an act of charity? An American sailor is shipwrecked and brought to England when rescued without any money on him. He is given the note. Like the two wealthy brothers in Trading Places they have a bet will the sailor survive or starve to death because nobody can cash the note? Less we think that such notes don't exist the Federal Reserve System used to use a limited set of 100000 bills with the face of Woodrow Wilson the President who signed the Federal Reserve Act into law for transfers between the branches of the Federal Reserve Banks. I do not know if they are still in use. There were also notes for 10000 with the face of Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase  who okayed the first national greenback currency and for 5000 with the face of President James Madison who refused to save the first Bank of the United States but did push the recharter of the second Bank of the United States  a semiprivate early version of the Federal Reserve System.The film follows Gregory Peck's discovery that he is a guinea pig for this bet but making the most of it. The two brothers Ronald Squiers and Wilfred HydeWhite stay mostly in the background. Both give good performances and while I agree with another writer on this website that HydeWhite is better remembered today Squiers was a widely respected film and stage actor of the time The Rocking Horse Winner for example. Jane Griffiths plays the aristocrat who falls in love with Peck. A.E.Matthews has a nice role as a Yankee hating aristocrat who suddenly realizes that there is one thing worse that that  a greedy Briton. And Hugh Griffith does the most with the part of a suspicious newspaperman.Twain was fascinated by a legal case of the 1870s the Ticheborne Claimant wherein an impostor claimed title to a baronetcy and it's multimillion pound estate. Twain even wrote a novel The American Claimant based on the incident. One of the noteworthy incidents of the actual case was that Ticheborne Bonds were sold promising profit to investors who would give money needed for the Claimant's legal fees if he won they'd be paid out of the estate. Similarly here in the film bonds supporting Peck's honesty are printed. At one point there is a run by the bond holders when they believe that they've been lied to.It is a very amusing trifle and well worth catching whenever it appears on television.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arriving home with a long day of work behind me and another ahead I was in the mood for something friendly and undemanding. Ronald Neame's 'The Million Pound Note 1953' was exactly what the doctor ordered. This lightweight British comedy is for one wholly and absolutely pleasant notice how there is not a single villain in the entire film every character likable in their own distinctivelyBritish way. The old family friend whom we are certain is a grumbling and untrustworthy shyster turns out to be an honest entrepreneur. The man who arranges to deprive Henry Adams Gregory Peck of his wealth is merely a doddering old eccentric who just wants to show some patriotism for a personal lark. This is the sort of film whose conclusion is never in any doubt Peck will get the girl achieve happiness and learn to live without the extravagance to which he thought he would become accustomed. Frankly I can't imagine the film ending any other way.When penniless American stowaway Henry Adams Peck probably on his way to Italy to film 'Roman Holiday 1953' requests a small loan from the US embassy in London he is flatly denied by an indifferent official. However a pair of childish millionaires Ronald Squire and Wilfrid HydeWhite have an even greater plan for him. They loan Henry a rare million pound note which he is forbidden to cash in for just a one month engagement. Pretty soon every store and hotel owner in the city is tripping over themselves to offer him free services irrationally smitten with the honour of serving a wealthy American however unorthodox his dress manner may be. Of course the arrival of millionaire Henry Adams doesn't go unnoticed in the high societies of London and Portia Landsdowne Jane Griffiths is soon lovestruck with the humble American though his apparent wealth hinders rather than aids their love affair. Will the couple be together by the film's end? You don't need me to tell you.Though I had expected 'The Million Pound Note' to be a slightly wooden comedy it was great to find the film regularly inciting a hearty chuckle. Two moments stand out above all the others. Firstly Gregory Peck opening the brothers' envelope for the first time to pay for a hearty meal and dazedly apologising for not having anything smaller the storeowners accept Henry as an eccentric millionaire and offer the meal for free. Secondly the charity auction event in which the famous American millionaire carefully counts the coins in his hand to bid 82 12s before inadvertently bidding 5000 for a rather commonplace vase. As lightweight as it may be the film also aims a few modest jabs at the superficiality and hypocrisy of British society most of the characters welcoming Henry Adams only when under the impression that he is absurdly wealthy there's a harsh but alltootrue irony in the fact that Henry can only secure a cash loan once the American embassy believes that he doesn't need it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on Mark Twain's novel 'The Millionaire Pound Note' takes an interesting satirical look at the hypocrisy stemming from class distinction in the 50s England. England is a country where class and wealth are given extreme significance especially among the rich. The film shows the hypocrisy that existed among these people how the rich are quick to change face when in an instant they find out that you're a man of wealth and how within the next moment they revert back to their condescending selves when all wealth is lost. Interestingly 'The Millionaire' also briefly looks at how the English perceived Americans in that era. Rich Americans were welcomed as outsiders and the poor were quickly shunned away. The fact that he's an outsider either makes him more appealing or the complete opposite. The story sticks to the main theme by emphasizing on the hypocrisy of the upper class society but at the same time it also creates a balance that prevents the movie from being a mockery of the British society. The movie drags at some point but the love story appears at the right time and there is plenty of comedy to keep one entertained. A charming Gregory Peck totally nails the part and the luminous Jane Griffiths is a treat. Reginald Beckwith as Peck's sidekick Rock is amusing. The ending is a little predictable but the director does an overall good job by rounding it up and presenting his points.".

Hence the bet is on and a promise of a job for Henry if he can go for a month without breaking into the note.Chirpy yet astutely cynical is The Million Pound Note. The laughs come courtesy of the ridiculous way that people react to money and those that have plenty of it. As Henry a wonderfully cast Peck moves from penniless bum to upstanding wealthy gentleman without spending anything the moral of the story is blatantly obvious. Very much a forerunner to the Eddie Murphy starrer Trading Places in 1983 it also has similarities with Twain's own The Prince And The Pauper themes that always produce interesting results as regards the human condition. There's the obligatory romance angle in the piece which thankfully doesn't cloy the picture at all and Neame has an array of interesting characters from which to keep the story zippy watch out for a delightful turn from Reginald Beckwith as Rock. A real safe recommendation this one across the board it works well both as a comedy and as a wry observation. 710".

Part of the reason is that unlike most of Peck's output it was not made in Hollywood but in Britain. Peck made another British film The Purple Plain during this period. Even in Britain however few people seem to have heard of it.The film was a based on a short story by Mark Twain. The basic idea that of two elderly wealthy brothers entering into an eccentric bet which affects the life of a complete stranger is similar to that in the later American comedy Trading Places. That film was a contemporary satire on the greed is good attitudes of the 1980s but The Million Pound Note is a period piece set in the early twentieth century. The exact date is uncertain. A fortyeightstar flag flying outside the U.S. Consulate would seem to indicate that the film must be set in 1912 or later but some of the costumes and the absence of motor vehicles in the streets would suggest a rather earlier date.The hero is Henry Adams an American who finds himself stranded in England by an unusual combination of circumstances after a sailing accident and needs money for his passage back home. By chance he meets the two brothers Oliver and Roderick Montpelier who give him an envelope telling him that it contains money. When Adams opens it he finds that it contains a single banknote to the value of one million pounds. This is a fiction invented by Twain in reality the Bank of England has never issued notes for such a sum. For the purposes of the story however we have to accept that the note is genuine and not a forgery.Like Trading Places The Million Pound Note is a satire on the capitalist system but satirises it in a rather different way. Trading Places sends up the rapaciousness and heartlessness of the rich represented in that film by the greedy avaricious and corrupt Duke brothers. The satire of The Million Pound Note is directed less at rich people themselves than at the absurdities of the system through which they have obtained their wealth. While Adams has the note he is taken to be an eccentric millionaire. He can obtain whatever he needs without having to pay for it. This is the reason for the wager Oliver has bet the sceptical Roderick that mere possession of the note will enable the possessor to obtain limitless creditAdams is accepted into the company of England's grandest High Society and is asked to back a business venture when a fellow American wishes to start up a gold mine. He does not actually have to put up any money himself the mere fact of his association with the project is enough to start a boom in the value of the company's shares. When he temporarily mislays the note and a rumour spreads that he never actually had it in the first place the share price plummets. It does not matter that a geological report has indicated that the company is actually on the verge of striking gold. What matters to the capitalist system is not reality but belief and confidence. A falsehood that people can believe in can be more persuasive than the truth. Businessmen may like to think of themselves as hardheaded realists but in Twain's eyes they are as prone to fantasy and delusion as anybody else. Indeed they are more so because they operate within a system which depends upon fantasy and delusion in order to function.The film was directed by Ronald Neame who two years earlier had made The Card. The two films have much in common. Both are based on literary sources The Card on a novel by Arnold Bennett. Both are comedies set in Edwardian England. And both have similar themes the importance of belief even credulous or misplaced belief to the money economy. Or to be more accurate to the credit economy. The very word credit is derived from the Latin for to believe. Denry Machin the hero of The Card is a young man who makes a fortune by promoting business schemes which if not exactly dishonest are nevertheless heavily dependent upon his charm persuasiveness and plausibility. When one undercapitalised venture seems set to fail he manages to save the situation by persuading an aristocratic lady to back him. As with Adams the mere fact of her association with the scheme brings the investors flocking in.I would not rate this film quite as highly as The Card perhaps the greatest nonEaling British comedy of the early fifties. Nevertheless it has a lot going for it. It has some serious points to make but makes them in an amusing way with wit and style. Gregory Peck had a wide range as an actor but he was often at his best playing an ordinary decent man who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances The Big Country and To Kill a Mockingbird are two other examples and here he makes a charming hero. It is visually attractive being shot in what would today be regarded as the heritage cinema style. It may be little known today but I would consider that it deserves to be known more widely. 710".

Special mention also to A.E. Mathews striking just the right note as an antediluvian peer.I found curious the billing of Ronald Squire and Wilfred HydeWhite playing the brothers behind the scheme. They have exactly equal time at the beginning and end of the story but Squire is listed second with HydeWhite fifteenth! I'm sure Wilfred of My Fair Lady fame is the one remembered today.Please note alternative title Man with a Million'";

	schema:reviewBody "Gregory Peck is Henry Adams a raggedy goodnatured American shipyard worker stranded in London and penniless. Poundless too and this was 1903 when a pound was worth a pound. He's picked off the street at random by two millionaires of a betting disposition who hand him one of only two existing notes for one million pounds. If he returns the note intact at the end of one month he'll have any sort of job he wants. Peck doesn't discover until later that he's rich beyond imagining. And he's aghast as is the suspicious waiter who has just served this illgroomed customer an expensive meal. Peck tries to return the note but his benefactors are on holiday for the month. It's all up to him.That plot point is a little confusing. Maybe I missed something. But suppose that instead of giving the note back in a month Peck just said The hell with it and skipped town? He could live like a Pasha for the rest of his life.At any rate when the public discovers that Peck has the note everyone kisses his ring. Tailors give him a free wardrobe Bumbles Hotel puts him up in the Bridal Suite London society opens its doors to him and when rumors start that Peck has invested in the New Hope Gold Mine the price of shares skyrockets.There are less harmless memes. Nobody has seen the note recently. They've been operating on the sociological principle that if men define situations as real they are real in their consequences. Does he really HAVE such a note or is Peck an adventurer? Peck's fortune goes down then up again and he winds up in a clinch with Lady Bracknell's niece or something.It's based on a story by Mark Twain a curious writer. He had a fine sense of irony perhaps because he'd lived through the Civil War and was even briefly in the Confederate Army. Tom Sawyer is a child's adventure story but Huckleberry Finn is not. Twain poked understated fun at European pretensions and especially nobility. Huck and Jim pick up two scalawags who get into a quiet conflict over their social status until one finally admits that he's the lost son of the King of France which Huck swallows.That European nobility business gets a poke in the eye with a sharp stick in this film. So does capitalism. The question that wafts like a bouquet through the comedy is whether simply having a lot of money is better than being a gentleman. Is it better to be rich or to be a Duke?Peck's forte was never comedy. He seemed by nature to be upright and bourgeois. And to the extent that he was amusing on screen rather than only likable it was because that air of self righteousness was made ludicrous by events. His reaction is always one of masked embarrassment. It requires only the slightest change in his features. He must have had a very good time playing a mad Nazi scientist in The Boys From Brazil. The cast is filled out with familiar faces from British movies of the period.It may have been written by Mark Twain whose name is itself a joke but it's veddy British colorful and funny. You'll like it.".

	schema:headline " Gregory Peck with Mark Twain in England";
	schema:reviewBody "Man with a Million is one of the few comedy films that Gregory Peck made. Known as a dramatic actor Peck didn't play characters who could spew witticisms or clever lines or who went through hilarious antics. But he could hold his own in comedic situations as in this film. He is mostly a straight man who gets into situations that are comedic and in which the cast around him are more the sources of humor. I think his best comedy was Designing Woman of 1957 with Lauren Bacall. He had some very laughable situations in that film. This movie is based on a Mark Twain short story The Million Pound Bank Note published in 1893. It closely follows the Twain story with a few changes. The one thing I would like to have seen unchanged was the ending in Twain's story. One of the Montpelier brothers is revealed as the stepfather of Portia. The movie was filmed in London and at the Pinewood Studios in England. It was released there in January 1954 under the title The Million Pound Note. The J. Arthur Rank Organization made the movie and it was distributed in America by United Artists. The cast are all quite good. Peck is Henry Adams and Jane Griffiths plays the girl he falls for Portia Lansdowne. Hartley Power is the Adams family friend Lloyd Hastings. The Montpelier brothers are played by Ronald Squire as Oliver and Wilfrid HydeWhite as Roderick. Joyce Grenfell is Portia's mother the Duchess of Cromarty. The large supporting cast includes a number of people in various business settings who are very good and humorous with their airs and then humbling demeanor after learning that Adams has a one million pound note. These include George Devine as the Chop House proprietor John Kelly as the Bumbles Hotel manager and Maurice Denham as the exclusive tailor Jonathan Reid. Mark Twain nee Samuel Clemens set a number of stories in England. He was an avowed Anglophile. From his first trip to England in 1872 he fell in love with the culture the people and the country. But this didn't stop him from poking a little fun at the Brits from time to time. He was taken under wing by the upperclass and wrote glowingly of the people their love of history and tradition and the countryside. This story is a soft satire of both England and America. The Duke of Frognal says rhetorically to the Bumbles Hotel manager Are you trying to tell me that American money means more than an Englishman's name? I won't stand for it. This country's going to the dogs.This movie is a fine production from the Twain story set in England. It doesn't have rollicking laughter but it has warmth and an endearing tale amidst the mostly gentle humor. A later film made in America did a successful take off on the Twain story. Trading Places of 1983 was an adult comedy that starred Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd.".

This film never bores and has many great twists and turns as the viewer tries to determine just who knows what and what everyone's motives may be. The cast is just great and the final moments of the film where it all comes together are incredible.

Walker Jr. was an uncanny replica of his dad and a a terrific actor in his own rightso where is he now? and the glorious Mimsy Farmer the blonde sexpot who lusted after James MacArthur in Spencer's Mountain wisely then headed for Rome where she was typecast as '70s Eurotrashand wbatever happened to HER? The plot as I recall takes place at a desolate Mexicanbordertownmotel where drifter Walker shows up and is immediately hired by its owner Ms. Hayworth who is convinced the sexy stranger is her longlost son.  No problem for nympho Mimsy who after drooling over him in the outdoor shower quickly introduces him to the joys of skinnydipping a bold display of frontal nudity no big deal in the early '70s now a cause for alarm for the increasingly bluenosed MPAA and rollicking in the altogether in her boudoir. Ed Begley Sr. portrays Hayworth's queasygeezer companion and the scene of them doing the frug is a mindblower! Seething with an undercurrent of carnal desire plus the appearance of Bruce Pecheur another handsome traveler who checks into this cursed roadhouseand is brutally murderedin the film as in real life two years later. Road to Salina is a gorgeously photographed souvenir of '71 actually 1969 when it was filmed. Road to Salina is a hypnotic dazzlingly photographed unjustly forgotten or critically panned movie of its time. It concluded the careers of two veteran actors Ms. Hayworth Ed Begley Sr. while simultaneously featuring a quartet of talents primed for stardom.  Marc Porel whose death in flashbacks nails the real killer and you will be surprised died at age 32. Road to Salina can easily function as an exercise in morbidity. But enjoy it as audiences did in 1971 and what awaits you is a hypnotic lusciouslycolored insidious and wickedly mesmerizing psychodrama.The Betamax copy I bought of this film in the late '70s has long since disappeared.  High time for a restored letterboxed version on CableTV or DVD. P.S. POSSIBLE SPOILER If you want to know the identity of the psychokiller look no further than Dario Argento's FOUR FLIES IN GREY VELVET!".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Le Grand Chef";
	schema:reviewBody "A romantic comedy about food should evoke some hunger pangs as well as some mouthwatering oohs and aahs for the sheer visuals of food that you'll probably swear you can smell and taste if done right. However the first reactions from Le Grand Chef is eeeeeeeeeeeee followed by plenty of reeling from the graphic nature of fresh sashimi preparation. The opening scene is the preparation of fresh golden blowfish where you'll see the fish still gasping in its last stages of life snuffed through a deft decapitation of its head followed by the fins before skinning it in one fall swoop disembowelment and the slicing of its meat so thinly that it's translucent.Based on a popular comic book series Le Grand Chef perched on the 1 spot in Korea for three weeks touching very familiar territory in the likes of films shown a few months back such as No Reservations and Ratatouille. We're soon introduced to two rival chefs Sungchan Kim Kangwoo and Bongjoo Lim Wonhie where they are to present to a judging panel to wrestle control over a famed restaurant. Needless to say Sungchan fails miserably through obvious foul play and quits the scene.Becoming a well known produce farmer with fans made from middle aged housewives Sung chan is soon persuaded to return to the scene by VJ Jinsu Lee Hana through a cooking competition where the prize is a rusty blade belonging to the Royal Chef an artifact with so much rich history it just had to tie into the lives of Sungchan and Bongjoo and their ancestors. So it's game on everybody!With good food photographed so beautifully there's nothing not to like about the movie despite its very familiar storyline The plot may be recycled from various cookeryfood movies even like Stephen Chow's God of Cookery but here it goes to show that the delivery plays a huge part. While it is very obvious to rattle on and on about the competition proceedings director Jeon Yunsu mixes things up and borrows loads from Japanese movies where food is concerned Udon anyone? and added ingredients from melodrama to bloat the plot. Fortunately they don't dilute the movie but provided a good variety of subplots on the side ranging from supporting side characters such as a famed charcoal maker to comedy involving the quest to cook the perfect Ramen. Running through the narrative is plenty of flashbacks into the ancestry of the rival chefs which had a simple mystery on the sins of their ancestors adding some form of depth into the hatred these men have toward each other. For once I thought the flashbacks were as effective as they were entertaining.While the subplots serve to entertain the cookery competition serves up a feast for the eyes albeit it took a backseat in the second half of the story after a flurry of first half activity so much so that split screens in comic book style had to be employed to squeeze as much as possible on screen at the same time. And the presentation was kept fresh with different styles employed so that it's not the same after each round of competition keeping in line with the necessity of having things fresh akin to food.Le Grand Chef is a delightful film to sit through and probably fired the first salvo for 2008 as a contender to be amongst the top of my list this year. It's not just or always about food but the philosophy ingredients and plenty of heart nevermind the clich that come along with it especially with the some similarities to Pixar's last offering from plot to characters. One thing's for sure food critics aren't really a likable bunch from the way they are portrayed in movies ha!".

	schema:reviewBody "Le Grand Chef is a film about cooking. That's not necessarily a bad thing in itself taking its origins from what appears to be a popular comic book. It's comic book origins are very apparent in the film from framing choices to character development to story progression. Unfortunately in its adaptation the film appears to try too hard to make it a comic book in movie form and leaves the dynamism of cinema behind.The story is about a young man who outcast from his culinary school as a result of accidentally poisoning food tasters with golden blowfish sashimi is recruited into a culinary competition to win the title of the greatest Corean chef and claim a historically important cooking blade belonging to the last royal chef. Or something like that. He is rivaled by the heir to the school he got kicked out of and there are a number of supporting characters.I think one of the problems with this film is that it compressed a comic book series into a film and tried to pack in as much as it could and also played it as close to the comic book as possible. Unfortunately it makes the film seem a bit like an anime series in fast forward. The story itself is very comic booklike with lots of subplots and hidden revelations that aren't exactly necessary. Consequently we don't see a lot of character development but rather character revelations instead as they or we learn about their background sigh in flashback. Ultimately it leads the characters and the overall story to seem more than a little two dimensional.Another thing that surprised me was how a film about cooking can fail to make the photography of the process of cooking all that interesting. There are plenty of other films with cooking themes that do this very well. Granted I could see that a lot of the framing was probably taken from the comic book itself but I feel that there is a place to copy and a place to use the strength of the cinematic medium and this film relies too heavily on the former.In the end I imagine it would be more worthwhile to read the comic book series instead. With such a two dimensional story characters pacing and uninspired photography and merely adequate performances from the players there isn't much here to recommend. On the other hand production specs are good and the film isn't ugly. While it isn't painful to watch I can't recommend it as it's equivalent to eating only a bowl of plainly cooked rice as your meal. Not very interesting. 510.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an enthusiastic fan of Italian Westerns I must say that I was quite bored with Sergio Garrone's Se Vuoi Vivere... Spara aka. If You Want To Live... Shoot of 1968 which is by the way not to be confused with Giulio Questi's brilliant and surreal Se Sei Vivo Spara aka. Django Kill If You Live Shoot! of 1967 with the great Tomas Milian in the lead. I'm generally not the biggest fan of Sergio Garrone's Westerns but I admit that films like Django The Bastard certainly have their qualities. Furthermore I haven't seen Garrone's No Room To Die yet which is supposed to be great. In If You Want To Live... Shoot however the boredom unfortunately outweighs the qualities. As many other lowbudget Spaghetti Westerns this was absolutely inappropriately given a 'Django' title in German speaking countries. Unlike most of the other unofficial 'sequels' to Sergio Corbucci's 1966 masterpiece Django however If You Want To Live... Shoot doesn't even have a real antihero. This Django who is played by Ivan Rassimov is more of a typical good guy. An absolutely cheesy love story and Django's relationship to a family of farmers even take this film further away from the typical Spaghetti Western feeling.Nevertheless Se Vuoi Vivere... Spara is not a complete failure. The score is pretty good but far from great. The film also has some cool brutal moments. But then again the film's boring and cheesy parts outweigh the good ones and the film's 97 minutes seem very long. The movie is at least 20 minutes too long they just should have left out all the sentimental family stuff which seems horribly out of place in a Spaghetti Western.All things considered If You Want To Live... Shoot is not completely awful but it's definitely quite boring and a disappointment for a fan of Italian Westerns.".

	schema:headline " Soso Spaghetti Western with a brave hero  Ivan Rassimov Django  confronting a nasty villain and his hoodlums";
	schema:reviewBody "If You Want to Live... Shoot! is a lowbudgeted movie middlingly made by Sergio Garrone . A young cowboy  Johnny  is playing in a rigged poker game and when he is accused as trickster he is forced to shoot one of the other deceitful players . The cowboy takes quick leave  as he is framed of murder and subsequently killed by the twofisted Stark Giovanni Cianfriglia or Ken Wood . A bit later on  there shows up Django Ivan Rassimov who is also accused as tricky cardsharp  and he kills contenders and a reward for his capture is posted . Django is pursued  chased and wounded  being healed by the McGowan family  and especially by the young daughter Sally Isabella Savona who falls for him . But the powerful baron land Marlowe Tom Felleghy wants to take the McGowan's farm to build the railway and orders to General Alvarez Peter White to carry out a punishment against them . Django  then  seeks revenge  at the same time being relentlessly pursued by Stark . Django is helped by the shrewd as well as mysterious bounty hunter Donovan as Rick Garret  Riccardo Garrone . Valiant Django and earnest  experienced gunslinger Donovan join forces to rescue the poor family from the group's vile clutches . Both of whom arrive to establish law and order against the ruthless Marlowe . As astute Django and Donovan unite to terminate a reign of terror carried out by a brutal band of criminals .This belowaverage Ravioli Western packs thrills  go riding  action  brawls  crossfire and drags at times  balancing in ups and downs . The plot summary is plain and simple  a small town is besieged by a brutal band of bandits led by a villain as well as ruthless owner called MarloweTom Felleghy who takes on the famous Pistolero named DjangoIvan Rassimov helped by an elegant bounty hunter  DonovanRiccardo Garrone  and along the way they free an abducted beautiful girl . As stubborn and cunning Django along with saintly roving gunslinger Donovan take on Marlowe . The movie has the customary Spaghetti characters  as the violent facing  greedy antiheroes  bloody and spectacular showdowns  quick zooms  extreme baddies but being wretchedly directed in some scenes . It packs an enjoyable and attractive musical score by Mancuso and Vasco directed by L. Gori in Morriconespaghetti style . And an atmospheric cinematography in Eastmancolor by Sergio Mancori  though a perfect remastering is necessary  being shot in Elios studios and El Lazio Rome . This lowbrow motion picture If You Want to Live... Shoot! was regularly filmed by Sergio Garrone and with lots of zooms . Sergio's direction is badly crafted  here he is more inclined toward violence and packs some thrills and action  but especially this exciting Western contains moving shoot'em ups and some gloomy scenes when a family is massacred . Sergio serves as a classic example of a journeyman Italian exploitation filmmaker and freelance screenwriter . As Garrone penned a great number of screenplays and lackluster films  working from the 60s in all kind of genres and B movies . He directed this embarrassing western  genre in which he would not only excel but one where he would spent much of the rest of his career .

	onyx:emotionText "If You Want to Live... Shoot! is a lowbudgeted movie middlingly made by Sergio Garrone . A young cowboy  Johnny  is playing in a rigged poker game and when he is accused as trickster he is forced to shoot one of the other deceitful players . The cowboy takes quick leave  as he is framed of murder and subsequently killed by the twofisted Stark Giovanni Cianfriglia or Ken Wood . A bit later on  there shows up Django Ivan Rassimov who is also accused as tricky cardsharp  and he kills contenders and a reward for his capture is posted . Django is pursued  chased and wounded  being healed by the McGowan family  and especially by the young daughter Sally Isabella Savona who falls for him . But the powerful baron land Marlowe Tom Felleghy wants to take the McGowan's farm to build the railway and orders to General Alvarez Peter White to carry out a punishment against them . Django  then  seeks revenge  at the same time being relentlessly pursued by Stark . Django is helped by the shrewd as well as mysterious bounty hunter Donovan as Rick Garret  Riccardo Garrone . Valiant Django and earnest  experienced gunslinger Donovan join forces to rescue the poor family from the group's vile clutches . Both of whom arrive to establish law and order against the ruthless Marlowe . As astute Django and Donovan unite to terminate a reign of terror carried out by a brutal band of criminals .This belowaverage Ravioli Western packs thrills  go riding  action  brawls  crossfire and drags at times  balancing in ups and downs . The plot summary is plain and simple  a small town is besieged by a brutal band of bandits led by a villain as well as ruthless owner called MarloweTom Felleghy who takes on the famous Pistolero named DjangoIvan Rassimov helped by an elegant bounty hunter  DonovanRiccardo Garrone  and along the way they free an abducted beautiful girl . As stubborn and cunning Django along with saintly roving gunslinger Donovan take on Marlowe . The movie has the customary Spaghetti characters  as the violent facing  greedy antiheroes  bloody and spectacular showdowns  quick zooms  extreme baddies but being wretchedly directed in some scenes . It packs an enjoyable and attractive musical score by Mancuso and Vasco directed by L. Gori in Morriconespaghetti style . And an atmospheric cinematography in Eastmancolor by Sergio Mancori  though a perfect remastering is necessary  being shot in Elios studios and El Lazio Rome . This lowbrow motion picture If You Want to Live... Shoot! was regularly filmed by Sergio Garrone and with lots of zooms . Sergio's direction is badly crafted  here he is more inclined toward violence and packs some thrills and action  but especially this exciting Western contains moving shoot'em ups and some gloomy scenes when a family is massacred . Sergio serves as a classic example of a journeyman Italian exploitation filmmaker and freelance screenwriter . As Garrone penned a great number of screenplays and lackluster films  working from the 60s in all kind of genres and B movies . He directed this embarrassing western  genre in which he would not only excel but one where he would spent much of the rest of his career . Sergio went on to helm several other spaghetti Westerns  many of them Spanish coproductions that include Tre Croci Per Non Morire 1968  Quel Maledetto Giorno Della Resa Dei Conti 1971  Deguello 1966 also starred by Jack Stuart  Huracan Sobre Mexico 1967 and his greatest notoriety was the peculiar outing  Django il Bastardo 1969 .

This one was put out by Sergio Garrone who seemed to pump out western after western in the late '60s with barely time to draw breathe. The story is about a cowboy who finds himself on the run after a poker game goes wrong and his efforts to protect a group of farmers from the usual sinister bad guys. The cowboy is played by Ivan Rassimov one of my favourite Italian performers and is named Django in some versions of the movie. Supporting him is Giovanni Cianfriglia who was fresh off playing a superhero in the SUPERARGO films. The action is pretty decent but the plot is a little longwinded and bogged down in sentiment which lowers the enjoyability somewhat.".

Long time film star Piper Laurie steals the film as Emily Boynton a Cruela deVile style evil stepmother and former prison wardress.  Every moment she is on screen is pure delight as she marches around and belts out orders.  She has had a great second career in her elder yearsCarrie Wrestling Ernest Hemingway.  The film begins when her lawyer Jefferson Cope David Soul tells her that her recently deceased rich husband made up a second will that split her inheritance with her grown children a rather spoiled and naive group of sniveling brats.  She knows the lawyer to have a few skeletons in his closet and forces him to burn the will then announces she is taking her brood on a vacation to the Holy Land.  While on holiday she meets up with Lady Westholme Lauren Bacall.  Bacall is quite good as the AmericanturnedBritish member of Parliment.  If anyone could stand toetotoe with Piper Laurie's overthetop performance it would be Lauren Bacall but we see very little interaction between the two grand ladies of cinema.  An opportunity missed and for the most part just two women who happen to be on the same tour.  To fill out the cast we have Hayley Mills as Lauren Bacall's assistant John Gielgud underused as the governing legal agent Colonel Carbury and a host of capable actors as the usual assembly of suspects in the usual assembly of subplots mostly redhearings. Ustinov perhaps does a little less sleuthing here than usual and is really not much more than an excuse for the film to be made.  In the first hour the detective overhears just about everything the audience hears merely by the coincidence of having his chair in the right place at the right time. A gift he tells one of the suspects.  When such a fault in the script is so obvious that the director feels he must give an explanation a shoddy one at that to the audience I suppose the movie moves more into the realm of spoof than mystery.  This film does have a lot more humor and entertainment than the other films in the series.  Whereas most of the UstinovPoirot films tend to be a bit dry and long Appointment with Death is quite breezy and whisps us along a plot that has by now become way too familiar. Without the humor and eccentric performances there would have been little here to warrant a film.  Like the 100th episode of Murder She Wrote it is no longer important who did it or who got killed.  It's just a lot of fun watching old pros ham it up.".

I wouldn't be surprised if in fact the BBC Poirot series starring David Suchet which we in America saw for many years may have killed the more expensive budgeted big screen Poirot that Ustinov did so well.This particular mystery finds Hercule Poirot on holiday and in the company both on ship and later in British mandated Palestine in the mid Thirties of an American family headed by a tyrannical stepmother played by Piper Laurie. She has one grown daughter and three stepchildren one of whom is married. All live with her and the terms of her late husband's will give her complete control of the family fortune. The power of the purse keeps the whole family under her thumb. Laurie's come a long way since she was a matron in a women's prison.Another woman along on the trip who's come along way is a character based on Lady Nancy Astor an American born woman who married a title and now has a seat in Parliament played by Lauren Bacall. She's traveling with a companion played by Hailey Mills. Also along on the trip is David Soul Laurie's family attorney and Jenny Seagrove as a young doctor. On an excursion out in the desert Laurie turns up dead and the mystery is afoot. Of course Poirot through careful questioning and a gathering of the suspects eventually finds out who the real murderer is.The film has of course an impressive cast which also includes John Gielgud as the local police inspector in Jerusalem. A young Arab boy also dies during the film killed because he witnessed the murder and can identify the culprit. That particular act robs us of any sympathy we might have had for the perpetrator.Appointment with Death also benefits from good photography shot on location in both Israel and Italy with interiors done in London. All the Peter Ustinov Poirot films are of excellent quality and are a great introduction to the work Agatha Christie.".

I've had a great time watching these with friends and family and all of Ustinov's Poirot movies are worth watching and rewatching. My deep affection for Ustinov's Poirot grows with each viewing. He's brilliant and each of his Poirot movies are fantastic fun!";

'Appointment With Death' was his return to the big screen  I remember going to the cinema on it's release. The cast is semi starry this time and unlike the TV movies Poirot is now back in period...almost  the theme music is very eighties! The basic plot in 'Appointment With Death' is not really one of Christie's strongest. The book is notable mainly for the extraordinary creation that is Mrs Boynton and the strange psychological hold she has over her family. Much as I like Piper Laurie I was disappointed that in this film the character is turned into a more obvious pantomime villain. Lauren Bacall's Lady Westholme is by far the most vivid character here overdoing it just very slightly but not too much. Jenny Seagrove has some good moments but Soul Fisher and Mills are a bit wasted. Gielgud has little to do as Colonel Carbury. The remaining Boyntons are not very convincing  some quite poor acting here I thought. Sadly I felt that much of the time even Ustinov was 'going through the motions'  there seems little of the fun from the first two movies.The locations are lovely although it was disappointing not to see Petra as in the book but perhaps they couldn't get permission to film there and the 'period' feel is generally pretty good. I enjoyed watching this movie again but it's sadly not a patch on Ustinov's earlier outings as the Belgian detective.".

This adaptation isn't terrible but it is the weakest of Peter Ustinov's outings as Poirot. Speaking of Ustinov he is excellent here I had no problem with him. And Lauren Bacall Carrie Fisher Jenny Seagrove and John Gielgud give fine support. The film does have some splendid locations even if Petra was changed to Jerusalem if I remember rightly and the music was good too. However the script isn't that polished a lot is changed from the book and some of the changes are underdeveloped the character of Hassan was unnecessary. But my main gripe with the movie was the character of Mrs Boynton. The same applies for the recent David Suchet versionwhich was more unfaithful but better musically and visually and the acting was more solid in that one too the character of Mrs Boynton was never done quite right despite the wholly hateable portrayal given by Piper Laurie. In the book she is a bit of a tyrant in the adaptation she was portrayed as nasty and cantankerous but lacked the depth of the character in the book. Overall not bad but I did think Death on the Nile and Evil Under The Sun were better. 610 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the fifth in the recent series of Agatha Christie mysteries to have shown up on film and it is the least of them. It has the usual allstar cast though perhaps not as starry as the earlier ones but it is ultimately kind of boring. The best of the series are the two earliest  Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile. They were positively marinated in local color. None of the later versions has anything resembling the shot in the introduction to Murder in which a uniformed authority figure slurps down a newly opened oyster to test its freshness before allowing the crate to be put aboard the train or the shot of the two lovers in Death racing across the desert on handsome Arabian horses to a swelling romantic score. The first two also had plots that were made crystal clear. Those sorts of things are lacking in Appointment With Death despite the quality of the cast and the colorful location shooting. The director seems to have simply not bothered with those touches that add such flavor and exhilaration to what's on screen. And the writers seem to have been unable to come up with a script that holds one's interest. Pio Donnagio's score isn't of the period. It's bouncy and current and adds no flavor to the goings on. The direction is erratic too sometimes with pointless gigantic close ups sometimes with shots from floor level of two people walking through a gate. The director uses a hoary clich that must make everyone wince a woman looks in the mirror but instead of looking at herself she's looking at an angle directly at the camera lens. Two people are seated across from one another at an outdoor table and in the foreground a violently purple stalk of flowers looms up and separates them. The extras glance at the camera and grin. What was going through the guy's mind?Part of the problem too is with the cast. Lauren Bacall and Piper Laurie stand out as memorable characters and that's about it. John Gielgud as Poirot's sidekick is fine naturally but his role is small and his friendship with Poirot lacks the historical depth of earlier sidekicks. As Poirot Peter Ustinov seems tired and older although his performance is less restrained than usual. And the poor man isn't given much of a mystery to work with. Too many of the remaining cast members seem almost interchangeable and one of them Seagrove's boyfriend looks like a preppy athlete and can't act. It's hard to tell one from another. Except for Jenny Seagrove. She is not a powerful actress perhaps not even an especially talented one but she exudes elegance  slender uniquely attractive and she runs like the wind. But nothing can keep this film from being the dullest of the series. It carries a perfunctory quality as if everyone involved had been blanched and desiccated by the need to grind out yet another version of a Christie mystery under the overpowering desert sun.".

None of the later versions has anything resembling the shot in the introduction to Murder in which a uniformed authority figure slurps down a newly opened oyster to test its freshness before allowing the crate to be put aboard the train or the shot of the two lovers in Death racing across the desert on handsome Arabian horses to a swelling romantic score. The first two also had plots that were made crystal clear. Those sorts of things are lacking in Appointment With Death despite the quality of the cast and the colorful location shooting. The director seems to have simply not bothered with those touches that add such flavor and exhilaration to what's on screen. And the writers seem to have been unable to come up with a script that holds one's interest. Pio Donnagio's score isn't of the period. It's bouncy and current and adds no flavor to the goings on. The direction is erratic too sometimes with pointless gigantic close ups sometimes with shots from floor level of two people walking through a gate. The director uses a hoary clich that must make everyone wince a woman looks in the mirror but instead of looking at herself she's looking at an angle directly at the camera lens. Two people are seated across from one another at an outdoor table and in the foreground a violently purple stalk of flowers looms up and separates them. The extras glance at the camera and grin. What was going through the guy's mind?Part of the problem too is with the cast. Lauren Bacall and Piper Laurie stand out as memorable characters and that's about it. John Gielgud as Poirot's sidekick is fine naturally but his role is small and his friendship with Poirot lacks the historical depth of earlier sidekicks. As Poirot Peter Ustinov seems tired and older although his performance is less restrained than usual. And the poor man isn't given much of a mystery to work with. Too many of the remaining cast members seem almost interchangeable and one of them Seagrove's boyfriend looks like a preppy athlete and can't act. It's hard to tell one from another. Except for Jenny Seagrove. She is not a powerful actress perhaps not even an especially talented one but she exudes elegance  slender uniquely attractive and she runs like the wind. But nothing can keep this film from being the dullest of the series. It carries a perfunctory quality as if everyone involved had been blanched and desiccated by the need to grind out yet another version of a Christie mystery under the overpowering desert sun.";

The plot itself is not among Christie's strongest though coscreenwriter Anthony Shaffer at least tries to mix it up a little with some interesting ideas Poirot assembles all the suspects for the first time we expect him to reveal the murderer....and he doesn't. Ustinov is still delightful and occasionally laughoutloud funny as Poirot he reminds me in a way of Roger Moore's James Bond purists argue that these two are not 105 accurate to the books but I'm having too much fun watching them to care. In the supporting cast the standout is clearly Jenny Seagrove who has all the beauty the elegance the spirit and the courage of the best Christie heroines.The latest 2008 David Suchet  Poirot season also produced a version of this book.

And due to her 'popularity' simply all the people who were near the scene of the crime at the time are suspicious  good that Hercule Poirot once again 'happens' to be there too and will no doubt throw light on the case.

So now it's a kind of 'contest' which clever experienced murder mystery fans will be able to find out the identity of the murderer before Poirot reveals it?? An enormously entertaining 'murder hunt' very stylish with great performances and magnificent settings  one of the great neglected modern classics of the mystery genre!";

	schema:reviewBody "When her husband dies Emily Boynton cannot accept that her husband had written a second will splitting his fortune among all his children. She blackmails their lawyer to destroy the second will and only use the original that leaves the whole estate to her. Her children are fuming but can prove nothing and accompany her on a holiday around Europe. It is during this trip that the noisy family come together with a collection of other guest on a cruise  including the famous Hercule Poirot among the passengers. During the trip she is murdered and the British Officer in the region turns to Poirot for help in identifying the killer.I generally like mystery films and as such I welcomed the chance to see this Agatha Christie film with a starry cast and the idea that it was directed by the dread Michael Winner was only a minor worry for me. At the start I thought everything would be fine because it looked polished and expensive and I knew the starry cast would help it. However what I didn't realise was that the film would be delivered in a very slow fashion with no real intrigue or mystery built up and very little to really engage the viewer. It all goes through the genre motions of course but for all his beautiful sets and lavish locations Winner has forgotten to inject tension and pace into the delivery.The cast are all fairly impressive on paper but they are surprisingly lacking on the screen. Ustinov seems a bit bored by the whole affair and he offers little to suggest a sharp mind inside  he sounds like a man reading his lines. Bacall is lively and Gielgud is a nice sidekick to Ustinov but other than that the rest of the cast are quite forgettable  indeed were it not for the fact that Fisher and Soul are so familiar then I would have likely not been able to keep track of who was who. This isn't helped by the lacklustre material but they don't really help themselves with their performances.Overall genre fans may find enough in here to satisfy their needs but I imagine many viewers will be surprised by how uninvolving the mystery is and how dull parts of it are. Winner's direction is OK but he can't get any pace into it and his choice of music doesn't help at all. There are better detective mysteries out there than this halfbaked affair.".

Everything is ordered and everyone seems to be satisfied living this kind of life. Our hero though from the beginning seems to be misplaced and feels it himself. What makes this film so important and good is the remarkable similarity to life in many large cities or even countries nowadays. You have to function you are not supposed to let your colleague know your weaknesses you show off on your wealth your car etc. and most of all you lack the true love of life that children have. Naturally in this film you see neither children nor old people  they simply do not fit in a society of strong workers.I would recommend this film to everyone  and make sure that this utopia does not come true!".

This movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way. What it is about? Estrangement I believe. Probably up to the viewer but I found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades. Don't know if I'm right. But this movie really got to me. See it. I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style. And I forgot The Casting here i superb with Trond Fausa Aurvg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man who doesn't understand where he is what he is doing and why. The acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life in the city is what makes him bothersome. All the others do as they are told and pretend ? to be happy. This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.".

	onyx:emotionText "Totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it. This movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way. What it is about? Estrangement I believe. Probably up to the viewer but I found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades. Don't know if I'm right. But this movie really got to me. See it. I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style. And I forgot The Casting here i superb with Trond Fausa Aurvg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man who doesn't understand where he is what he is doing and why. The acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life in the city is what makes him bothersome. All the others do as they are told and pretend ? to be happy. This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.";

	schema:reviewBody "I think this is the best Norwegian movie I've ever seen. It's about 40year old Andreas who gets hit by a subwaytrain and suddenly finds himself in a strange city however everything here has been made ready for him. He has got a job a house and clothes. At first this city seems perfect no death no pain and no problems. Everywhere there are men in gray suits who cleans up and fixes everything that doesn't fit into their definition of perfect. However Andreas can't really seem to fit in and starts to long back to his old world and tries with all means to get back. The thing that impresses my the most in this movie is how they way of making the city seem so surrealistic even though I have seen a lot of these places in real life they seem so distant. Another thing that contributes greatly to the is the performance from the actors. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is just the perfect guy to play the confused and bothersome Andreas. And all the other characters are also doing a great job by playing apathetic sounds like a hard job doesn't it?. The strong difference between Andreas and the others leads to very amusing situations as well. All in all this is a fabulous movie. The plot may be a little confusing but the movie has such a great atmosphere I would recommend that everyone should go see it. And I wouldn't recommend listening to ccscd212 as it seems he has seen too many commercial American movies and seems to have became too used to just getting served the moral on a silver plate. The way I see it there is not much in this film that tries to tell us about suicide being right or wrong. I consider it more of a warning of a direction our society seems to be taking. But sure everyone can see a film in their own way.".

When the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train his next conscious moment occurs on a bus riding solo the newest arrival in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere Andreas is greeted by an official man who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city if the eyeballs work is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited if memory serves him right. Andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance a man estranged from people and objects struggling to find his bearings at home or rather his assigned apartment or at work where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. HavardJohannes Joner his boss tells him You'll get used to it which covers more than just crunching numbers we suspect in this world same as the old world.If life is meaningless like French existentialist philosopher JeanPaul Satre said the same can be said for death as well. The subculture of office life might be heaven for one man but it looks like hell to us under the context that Den Brysomme Mannen operates on. To work in the afterlife in essence is to work for the rest of your life. The social intercourse among Andreas' office mates may pass as normal in the physical world but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer as heshe now recognizes the drudgery of whitecollar labor performed by whitecollar laborers who kill the hours with their inconsequential smalltalk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons each and every day seem irrational in its selfevident absurdity. To see daily life replicated in a speculative light Den Brysomme mannen makes normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy as quotidian life becomes a performance which transforms Karl Marx's meaning of the word alienation because here the men and women in the office do identify with their labor like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. But the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade. He's always aware of the cracks.From a wooden bench Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity from his own coworkers after he purposely cuts off his own finger with the hope that he'll feel the pain on a paper slicer. He doesn't. It's just another sensation in addition to being able to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man. This inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures amplifies the bothersome man's need for lovewhere simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party hosted by his boss Andreas meets Anne BrittPetonella Barker. They hit it off. He walks her home. She invites him in. They become a couple. He moves in. When they have sex however it's good for neither Andreas nor Anne who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. Love is an abstract concept another sensation that's unattainable in this world but love matters to the bothersome man so he tries again with IngeborgBirgette Lagen a girl from work. Den Brysomme mannen deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. When Ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyperromantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic but odd city with an openendedness that's solvable and offer up multiple interpretations.Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of love for her the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station stands at the same platform leers at the same couple aggressively making out and jumps. This time he can't die. How can you die when you're already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train Andreas' face turns into ground beef his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp he seeks out the man from the club who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. Which is death not life has no meaning.Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas' whereabouts drives the narrative and to the filmmaker's credit this enigma is satisfactorily addressed in a scene that recalls Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich when Andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world like a newborn baby which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas' attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that heaven is a place on Earth. But at the same time heaven is proved by the reality of a hell the place that Andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.".

Jump in and wallow with the main character who seems to have some kind of free will but within an invisible restraint. I mean taking a ride back to life for some kind of reappraisal even if you know it's all a mirage means maybe being radical and not a bit submissive.Not for this Norwegian. The humor comes and goes the logic certainly goes more than comes but the mood the charm and ease of all the characters is enjoyable almost heavenly in a weird not quite coincidental way. I would check this out. I know a lot of people will get bored in the first few minutes because the wry dry humor the lack of dialog and even the lack of anything quite happening will drive them batty. But you know if you're not like that and can get into a Paris Texas or Dead Man or lightweight Ingmar Bergman sensibility. Try it. I liked it a lot even if I got a bit restless by the last third.".

Welcome to the hell of modern consumerism in which people throw themselves from buildings and no one raises an eyebrow or spend their days reading furniture catalogues and eating food that tastes of nothing.Andreas quickly realises his predicament and spends the rest of the film trying to escape in various ways. Suicide turns out not to be an option and when he finds a new girlfriend she is just as bereft of feelings as the old one  there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to move in with him and all she can say is 'I don't mind'.In fact much of what The Bothersome Man has to say has been said before and after about 45 minutes you begin to feel that you indeed are experiencing a certain sense of deja vu. Yet its point is one that is probably worth repeating over and over again an unexamined life is one that is not worth living. Added to which it provides a decidedly modern take on the perennial theme of how capitalism is destroying our souls.

A droll and deliciously wry romp this movie features a man Andreas who gets shipped out to some Purgatory of a Brave New World city where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste nothing smells and even sex loses its appeal. Driven to the edge by his lack of common senses he feels nearly ready to kill himself.After an hilarious botched attempt at latter Andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny vaginashaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates. The two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see. But of course in fantasy allegory land desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end Andreas' attempt at freedom and sensuality.Jens Lien and crew create a simple straightforward movement to the story one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from lagging. The similarities in other similar science fiction aren't worth enumerating but still the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones. I like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie some disembowelment and flagellation that will get your heart stammering harder than The Passion of the Christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the graytoned miseenscene. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a dependably squirrelly actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings which works very well. Despite the fact that the concept itself isn't anything to write home about everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world.PolarisDiB".

	schema:headline " Really well delivered simple idea that creates a horror that is chilling while also instantly familiar as the norm";
	schema:reviewBody "A man is taken by bus to a stop in the middle of nowhere from whence he is collected and taken to the city and his job as an accountant in an office of other white collar workers happily eating together at lunchtime and sitting in front of computers during the day. Soon he gets himself a girlfriend and they move in together decorating their home and having dinner parties and smalltalk. All is wonderfully happy and modern but yet something just doesn't seem right.I was recommended this by another IMDb user who I have come to know as quite an intelligent young man and so I decided to go on his advice and give this film a shot. He also advised I come to it with as little knowledge as possible so beyond his recommendation and basic comments on content I knew very little about it. I was glad of both this advice and also the recommendation because this film is a great idea that is really well expanded and delivered. On the face of it the film comes over like it is a short film so simple and concise is its idea and so oddly does it deliver a simple concept but it is a feature and the 90 minutes goes by quickly and satisfyingly.The film is built on the feeling that there must be more to life than the safe warmth that the majority of us in the Western world are used to and it really nails it in this regard. For the majority of the film we are of course allowed to feel our main character's sense of unease and pain at the lack of passion and spark in life but this comes in the small moments  the alternative view is not over played to make this more obvious. Instead the emotionless norm is presented in a way that is entirely recognisable interior design and wall colours are the subjects of discussion bland office work pays for it all  and trust me that as a man in his mid30's this is something I know about! It isn't overplayed though  it is normal and familiar and as a result all the more chilling as part of the film.By making the horror so very normal and so familiar in its polite banality the film survives the later twists when things get more extreme and weird  because we are already with it as an idea. It does always feel like a short film though because the idea never really comes to a satisfactory conclusion and those looking for a big reveal or ending will be disappointed  however those fans of short films where the idea is the thing rather than the answer will be pleased as I was. To me the conclusion was fittingly simple because it works well with the idea as this world of the others being a happy place as long as you all go by the rules and don't be an outsider  it also kept me on board that the film made rebelling so very reasonable  Andreas was only looking for something a bit deeper more meaningful than the colour of tiles  and again this is a rebellion that many people will be able to relate to as well.The whole film reminded me very much of short films in terms of tone and content but also of some of the rather odd films that the Cohen brothers have made in the last 10 years where the tone is a lot of the story. I really liked the direction and composition here  the film always looks normal but by having everything so very clean and lacking in chaos or untidiness it does contribute to the overall feeling of this world of being passionless and only happy on a very superficial level. It is all very well done and I enjoyed its relatable oddness very much  and it is this sense of the familiar that really makes it work very well and at the same time produces the cold horror of it. A really great little film in the mould of a short very simple but also very cleverly done. Thanks Danny!".

Some scenes especially the subway scene and the finale are too overthetop for anybody to be able to still be in the protagonist's shoes.

	schema:headline " The Bothersome Man is a brilliant and twisting film that comes across as very smart and devilishly black.";
	schema:reviewBody "It would seem we should acknowledge Scandinavian cinema for more than merely the Dogma 1995 movement as cooked up by the Danish all those years ago. Den Brysomme Mannen or The Bothersome Man in English is a surreal and deeply thought through film yet deeply entertaining and rich in content both on and under the surface. As a film alone it is a scathing comedy on society and attitudes in the postmodern world we live in a world that judging by The Bothersome Man has reached the regions of Norway and the like. But along with this black comedy feel to it it would seem the film delves a little deeper and raises issues at least to me of metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct to want to uncover the truth amongst so much material in our world that perhaps seems alien to us.This was in truth a fantastic introduction to contemporary Norwegian cinema for me. The film very much falls into that category of the European art cannon with its deep themes and ambiguity shrouded atmosphere whilst maintaining an open finale and not so much a narrative as a procession of events that may mean one thing or another. So many times we've seen films that use the set up The Bothersome Man adopts and so many times it's turned into a close to predictable routine revolving around a detective story or a chase story or something along those lines but this film allows its setting and situation to act as a mere backdrop for its protagonist named Andreas Fausa Aurvaag to explore who he is where he is and what the possible mysteries behind this location really are.The set up I'm talking about involves said hero arriving at a location with no prior memory or what happened before this. I'll jump right in and say it's in my opinion he's dead and has been sent to some sort of purgatory as have all the city's inhabitants. Everybody in the city that Andreas mixes with are of the same age same mentality and same attitude suggesting to me that most of them are victims of their own suicide and have been sent to a purgatory devoid of any emotion feeling colour or most importantly pain. When we first see Andreas he gets off a bus which he later discovers is uncanny in its abilities and approaches a petrol station in the middle of rural nowhere. He is scruffy and has a huge beard but soon he will be the opposite sporting a suit and tie clean shaven face and a home of his own complete with new job in which the film makes one of the best transforming shifts between the rural and the urban that I've ever seen. But the new job as well as the new city is uneasy you can take breaks whenever you like bosses are unusually kind and there just seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything. These ideas are best put across in a cinema when Andreas still a relative newbie to the city is crying and is clearly affected by a film on show but everyone else watches in stone faced style. There is also the initial example when one man has jumped from a window and lies impaled on some spikes but everybody walks on by without fuss.To back up my idea on everyone already being dead and the city acting as a sort of purgatory death and harm in general is impossible. There is a particularly nasty scene involving an electronic paper guillotine and someone's thumb but everyone's reaction to the event is stone faced and it grows back within the hour. Similarly a suicide attempt involving trains later on comes to nothing and instead we get the point of view regarding what it's like to be dragged down tube tracks with invulnerability on your side. The city acts as a barrier a painless society in which the masochistic need to selfharm oneself is impossible a place in which sexual relations can occur and breakups equally so but both under emotionless and passionless circumstances a place in which people can attempt suicide but it is impossible to actually die. The city adopts these powers because the damage has already been done in 'real life' and thus the film says you cannot kill yourself twice indeed you cannot feel pain or emotion in an afterlife of purgatory.But the film's best part is the one that sneaks up on you. Judging by the closing five minutes of the film and the sidestory that opens up involving some music coming from another man's house it would seem there is a fine line between the spaces the film dictates as 'heaven' and 'hell'. We get to see these spaces only very very briefly  so briefly that they consist of a single shot. The 'heaven' is a colourful kitchen with music and children playing it offers life hope emotion and happiness whereas the hell is a snowy nowhere which haunts you thanks to its hopeless build up and eerie cut off point. The introduction of these two spaces at the very end of the film suddenly informs you of the reality Andreas and co. faced purgatory and everything that came with it the afterlife just was not ready for Andreas and his freethinking adventurous mind  and look where the thinkers end up.".

	onyx:emotionText "It would seem we should acknowledge Scandinavian cinema for more than merely the Dogma 1995 movement as cooked up by the Danish all those years ago. Den Brysomme Mannen or The Bothersome Man in English is a surreal and deeply thought through film yet deeply entertaining and rich in content both on and under the surface. As a film alone it is a scathing comedy on society and attitudes in the postmodern world we live in a world that judging by The Bothersome Man has reached the regions of Norway and the like. But along with this black comedy feel to it it would seem the film delves a little deeper and raises issues at least to me of metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct to want to uncover the truth amongst so much material in our world that perhaps seems alien to us.This was in truth a fantastic introduction to contemporary Norwegian cinema for me. The film very much falls into that category of the European art cannon with its deep themes and ambiguity shrouded atmosphere whilst maintaining an open finale and not so much a narrative as a procession of events that may mean one thing or another. So many times we've seen films that use the set up The Bothersome Man adopts and so many times it's turned into a close to predictable routine revolving around a detective story or a chase story or something along those lines but this film allows its setting and situation to act as a mere backdrop for its protagonist named Andreas Fausa Aurvaag to explore who he is where he is and what the possible mysteries behind this location really are.The set up I'm talking about involves said hero arriving at a location with no prior memory or what happened before this. I'll jump right in and say it's in my opinion he's dead and has been sent to some sort of purgatory as have all the city's inhabitants. Everybody in the city that Andreas mixes with are of the same age same mentality and same attitude suggesting to me that most of them are victims of their own suicide and have been sent to a purgatory devoid of any emotion feeling colour or most importantly pain. When we first see Andreas he gets off a bus which he later discovers is uncanny in its abilities and approaches a petrol station in the middle of rural nowhere. He is scruffy and has a huge beard but soon he will be the opposite sporting a suit and tie clean shaven face and a home of his own complete with new job in which the film makes one of the best transforming shifts between the rural and the urban that I've ever seen. But the new job as well as the new city is uneasy you can take breaks whenever you like bosses are unusually kind and there just seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything. These ideas are best put across in a cinema when Andreas still a relative newbie to the city is crying and is clearly affected by a film on show but everyone else watches in stone faced style.

	schema:reviewBody "This Norwegian film starts with a man jumping over the subway apparently committing suicide. But the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus into a desert. He meets a man and is shipped off to a mysterious city where he starts working in an aseptic modern office as an accountant. The coworkers seem nice if guarded he soon meets a girlfriend yet the city seems utterly strange as food has no taste alcohol doesn't make you drunk and there's nary a children around. Is this a dream or is he in paradise or in hell?. While at times the films looks as extended episode of The Twilight Zone even at ninety minutes the movie seems a bit long it is quite thought provoking. The best scenes are those in which the exaggeration is minimal as when the people engage in banal conversations about interior decoration and recoil at discussing deeper issues. I always thought there was something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies in the way they try to repress the basic urges of human nature. And this movie is best when it devastatingly critiques this life style. Unfortunately the movie ends up a big long and the director doesn't seem to know how to end it but most for of the running time this is very much worth seeing.".

In that sense Dante thought that they the were in the worse part as they would never actively try to change their situation. Nobody can die in that place but trying to certainly does hurt. I am not sure if the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript or not but the resemblance is absolutely striking.I didn't enjoy the movie when I was watching it as I was expecting a climax which never came.

Why is he the only passenger? Is he a prisoner? Is he the bothersome man referred to in the title of the movie? Has he died and gone to heaven or hell? Like our man we don't get a chance to stop and wonder. He is met by a gatekeeper of sorts and shuttled off to a nondescript city. From day one all the choices are made for him. An apartment has been rented a job has been found an office assigned. In fact his life is not entirely unlike life in the virtual reality of corporate cubicles and suburban condos. Women are heartless dinner parties are a drag office jobs suck. But some pieces don't fit the puzzle. Silently efficient grayclad goons roam the streets. Are they some sort of paramedics or the secret police? And why are there no children? Is the story even set in the real world? Whenever we think we might be getting some answers new mysteries unfold.

That's the point I don't think it stands up in the whole plot. Why if this was an ideal world couldn't you die but still you were keeping your conscience ? Either was the real world with tailored rules or was a fantastic world but in this case no accidents like people remembering how it was before can happen.It reminded me of Kafka and maybe more of Huxley's Brave New World especially in that part where sex was actually available to everyone since it was viewed like a right to pleasure. It lacked a plot but I think it was better like this since you realized and sensed the whole strange behavior of everyone the absurdity and the lack of real sensations in this happy world.I think also that the end was brilliant. true world is indeed a homo homini lupus you're eaten if you are not strong enough.".
