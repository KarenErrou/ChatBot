This movie made in the 90's took place well before this New Wave and pales in comparison to newer offerings.

This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is its how they get to it thats hilarious.Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a hasbeen exprofessional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about.".

	schema:reviewBody "I say this in a good way this film captures bowling's underbelly where even the pro stars sometimes have to supplement their income the oldfashioned way by taking it directly from obviously weaker bowlers who somehow manage to be convinced to risk their money. Just as poker games are often won with guns bowling for money has hazards all its own something I learned even as a junior bowler hustling games after the league on Saturday.Roy E. Munson Woody Harrelson is such a loser that acting like a total loser is actually called being Munsoned. The term is named after an incident where some victims of a bowling hustle relieve Roy of his right hand in a gruesome manner which involves bowling equipment. Somehow even THAT manages to be funny which speaks to the quality of this film a film smart enough to have its three main stars on screen for most of the time. The 1979 accident was the result of Roy taking the fall for the hustle engineered by legendary bowler Ernie McCracken Bill Murray.Fast forward to 1996 and Roy stumbles across an Amish bowler named Ishmael Boorg Randy Quaid the most talented bowler he's ever come across. He offers to coach Ishmael for a 1 million tournament in Reno Nevada that can save his family farm but Ishmael is conflicted the deepest emotion of the film because he has strayed from the Amish country. Ishmael's brother is the requisite family member sent to bring the stray relative back home and Vanessa Angel is extrahot as the love interest for almost every guy in the film.If you think this is a parody of bowling the joke may be on you. Hang around enough lanes in certain places and you just might see these guys or something very close to them. Just be careful if they look drunk and want to play for money.".

Just as poker games are often won with guns bowling for money has hazards all its own something I learned even as a junior bowler hustling games after the league on Saturday.Roy E. Munson Woody Harrelson is such a loser that acting like a total loser is actually called being Munsoned. The term is named after an incident where some victims of a bowling hustle relieve Roy of his right hand in a gruesome manner which involves bowling equipment. Somehow even THAT manages to be funny which speaks to the quality of this film a film smart enough to have its three main stars on screen for most of the time. The 1979 accident was the result of Roy taking the fall for the hustle engineered by legendary bowler Ernie McCracken Bill Murray.Fast forward to 1996 and Roy stumbles across an Amish bowler named Ishmael Boorg Randy Quaid the most talented bowler he's ever come across. He offers to coach Ishmael for a 1 million tournament in Reno Nevada that can save his family farm but Ishmael is conflicted the deepest emotion of the film because he has strayed from the Amish country. Ishmael's brother is the requisite family member sent to bring the stray relative back home and Vanessa Angel is extrahot as the love interest for almost every guy in the film.If you think this is a parody of bowling the joke may be on you. Hang around enough lanes in certain places and you just might see these guys or something very close to them. Just be careful if they look drunk and want to play for money.";

Expect a procession of jokes at the expensive of the main characters fused with an simple storyline and that's exactly what to expect from a Farrelly brothers film.Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson a washed bowler that had potential to be a professional Bowler but his dream comes to an end when he encounters Ernie McCracken played to perfection by Bill Murray who ends up costing Roy Munson his bowling hand. Cut to mid90's Roy is now an alcoholic in serious debt. A chance meeting with Ishamel Boorg played by Randy Quaid an naive Amish man at a bowling alley leads to the pairs cross country trip to save both their respective futures. Along the way they met Claudia played by Vanessa Angel a tough talking con woman with her own mission. Together the three form an unbreakable bond and come face to face with their adversary Ernie McCracken.I like my comedy to be intelligent and Kingpin is one of the few movies of its kind that actually makes me laugh. It made me laugh when I first saw it in 1996 it made me laugh till I was sore and now ten years on in 2006 it still makes me laugh. The cast are brilliant and it's their talents that really keep this comedy from dating. Randy Quaid is always solid Vanessa Angel is devilish sexy and cunning Woody Harrelson is suitably vexed and Bill Murray reminds us all why he has remained Hollywood's main comedy actor long since all his peers disappeared.Kingpin is definitely for an adult audience and it is worth watching some night that there is nothing on the television or at the cinema. Not for all tastes but damn it is good and it is one of the Farrelly brothers better films in my opinion. 10 out of 10".

Now there's a stable conservative trio!! This actually has some very funny moments. At first I was afraid it was going to be too irreverent to the Amish  and there definitely was some of that with Quaid's character who is made to look like a total dimwit who has no knowledge of the Bible and is easily led  NO characteristics of an Amish person BUT the film really isn't meanspirited and it does show respect for the Amish in a number of scenes. However it's still very much a sleazy film and the writers wouldn't have done this with any other nonChristian character.All the characters in here including the profane female lead played by Vanessa Angel who? are fun to watch. The most outrageous in a minor role is the female landlord who has to be seen to be believed.Bowlers will especially like this film since a good part of it centers around that. A number of PBA members put it cameo performances. One scene with the fake hand attached to the bowling ball as it returns from the ball rack had me almost in tears laughing for some reason. Murray's take on the flamboyant bowler and there have been a few over the years on the Pro Bowlers Tour is hilarious.Crude but a funny film for the most part.".

	schema:headline " Bill Murray in one of the funniest comedy scenes ever";
	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this film a great deal. There were many hilarious gags and some clever satirical sideswipes and the main performers were excellent. Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid made a superb team and both were quite moving at times.However I must mention the extraordinary comic genius of Bill Murray here as in this film he provided me with what must be one of the funniest scenes in the history of movies  a very simple gag that was really bound to happen yet I wasn't expecting it. It is the climactic scene where he and Harrelson are the finalists in the tournament and twice involves his combover ...I can't go any further. I'm laughing so much. My sister and I missed the rest of the film as we bust our guts in absolute hysterics as Murray performed little victory dances one involving his shoulderblades almost killed me while totally oblivious to the state that his hair was in ...I don't want to spoil it for you. Just rent out the film watch it with a friend forget that I mentioned this scene and when it happens it will catch you unawares and you will hopefully laugh yourself silly.Ernie McCracken really was the biggest loser in the film as he thought he was cool and suave yet he had a terrible hairstyle two actually and was a disgusting selfish and unfeeling pervert.

I just laughed as he signed an autograph for a beautiful female fan and whispered to her what room he was staying in and as he jokingly apologised for the appalling damage he had inflicted on Roy Munson Harrelson which had completely ruined his life 17 years earlier and then selfishly began to make light of the matter before avoiding a few punches from Ishmael Quaid and running off quickly while telling Claudia Vanessa Angel what room he was staying in.And all the while he has a hairstyle that is worse than Munson's and Ishmael's put together. Man that's some good tasting comedy.".

	onyx:emotionText "I enjoyed this film a great deal. There were many hilarious gags and some clever satirical sideswipes and the main performers were excellent. Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid made a superb team and both were quite moving at times.However I must mention the extraordinary comic genius of Bill Murray here as in this film he provided me with what must be one of the funniest scenes in the history of movies  a very simple gag that was really bound to happen yet I wasn't expecting it. It is the climactic scene where he and Harrelson are the finalists in the tournament and twice involves his combover ...I can't go any further. I'm laughing so much. My sister and I missed the rest of the film as we bust our guts in absolute hysterics as Murray performed little victory dances one involving his shoulderblades almost killed me while totally oblivious to the state that his hair was in ...I don't want to spoil it for you. Just rent out the film watch it with a friend forget that I mentioned this scene and when it happens it will catch you unawares and you will hopefully laugh yourself silly.Ernie McCracken really was the biggest loser in the film as he thought he was cool and suave yet he had a terrible hairstyle two actually and was a disgusting selfish and unfeeling pervert.

I agree with other users that this film has not been rated fairly.  You simply have to take it for what it's worth and I personally think it's wonderful!Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson a drunken former probowler trying with much difficulty to earn a buck.  He discovers a young Amish man who may be his ticket back to bowling prestige if that actually exists.  The two bowling hopefuls proceed on a road trip to win the grand prize in a bowling championship in Las Vegas.   This movie is truly hilarious!  Woody Harrelson does a fantastic job in the role of the sad sack exbowler with a rubber hand.  He seems to have aged ten years in his portrayal of this character.  Bill Murray is his adversary Big Ern McCracken whose bad toupee seems to have a life of its own. Murray is wonderful in this role with his cocky and pompous attitude.  There are certain scenes of his character in a television commercial that are quite literally marvelous.  Finally to finish off this stellar cast we have Randy Quaid as Ishmael the Nave Amish man who could quite possibly be the next Bowling legend. I must also mention the gorgeous Vanessa Angel as Claudia.  Her character is under developed but she still has the charisma and sex appeal to ignite her scenes.This movie must be viewed for what it is worth.  This means it is not Oscar material but it is a very funny movie.  So watch the film with this in mind and enjoy all the hilarious scenes and great performances. 710".

	schema:headline " It's produces chuckles from time to time";
	schema:reviewBody "Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly don't have much of a filmography but after they produced Dumb  Dumber 1994 they were pretty much set. Since this week was the recent release of the Farrelly brothers' long awaited sequel to Dumb  Dumber 1994 Dumb  Dumber To 2014 it seemed appropriate that we visit another early Farrelly brothers' work. I was amazed to see that this is the only time Woody Harrelson collaborated with these directors. After being in and proving in other films that he still can be a comedic actor I thought he would've made another movie with them. Guess Harrelson has had other plans since.Here Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson a bowling prodigy who worked hard at being the best. That is until one day after making a dangerous gamble he loses his best bowling hand. Feeling ashamed and embarrassed he leaves home to live a secluded life from society with poor living conditions and unkempt neighbors. Struggling to maintain any kind of order in his life especially after losing his hand he stumbles upon an Amish man named Ishmael Randy Quaid who reminds him of his youth and realizes that he has some unrecognized bowling skills and decides to take him under his wing. Along their travels the two also stumble into a abusive rich man's wife that decides it's time for her to get out. The actress playing this vixen is Vanessa Angel. This is also probably her most memorable role in her filmography to most people who recognize her.The three actors do have their moments that are funny but it's not often. Harrelson carries most of the weight because of how his character tries to be better than his current social status. Quaid's character isn't all that funny but does work occasionally too. Of course Angel's character is one that probably won't be ignored since much of the physical humor is centered around her bosom. Thankfully not all the physical comedy relies on Angel. Harrelson's character uses a rubber hand in replace of his metal hooks and watching him fiddle getting ready or doing other things people normally do with their hands brought up some laughs. However there are some gags that are more gross than comical. I'm sure that's apart of the Farrelly humor but if you're a viewer who doesn't like that kind of humor it won't be that funny.Bill Murray even has a fairly major role in the story too playing a bowler named Ernie McCracken. Man does Murray's hair get wild. In fact his personality altogether is a bit too wild. Murray is more of an actor who can play a funny role in a deadpan fashion not overthetop. Most likely Murray fans will have a fun time but he does get to be too much at times. The two gentlemen behind the screenplay have more TV series writing under their belts than acclaimed comedy blockbusters which could explain why several gags amount to very little. Also the characters for what they are aren't the most likable. Yes they're weird in their own way and have their moments but they don't come off as characters that viewers would remember easily.Shockingly a number of the less important characters are extremely blind or stupid. The character of Ernie McCracken is vulgar along with his strong hubris. McCracken gropes women in public and yet no one sees this? How is it that the women being groped is OK with this? It's not like McCracken is Elvis or something. One character even called the man a role model for future generations. Are you kidding? Of course it's supposed to make the McCracken character seem unstoppable but how do these people not see this on public television? It may baffle viewers.

	onyx:emotionText "Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly don't have much of a filmography but after they produced Dumb  Dumber 1994 they were pretty much set. Since this week was the recent release of the Farrelly brothers' long awaited sequel to Dumb  Dumber 1994 Dumb  Dumber To 2014 it seemed appropriate that we visit another early Farrelly brothers' work. I was amazed to see that this is the only time Woody Harrelson collaborated with these directors. After being in and proving in other films that he still can be a comedic actor I thought he would've made another movie with them. Guess Harrelson has had other plans since.Here Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson a bowling prodigy who worked hard at being the best. That is until one day after making a dangerous gamble he loses his best bowling hand. Feeling ashamed and embarrassed he leaves home to live a secluded life from society with poor living conditions and unkempt neighbors. Struggling to maintain any kind of order in his life especially after losing his hand he stumbles upon an Amish man named Ishmael Randy Quaid who reminds him of his youth and realizes that he has some unrecognized bowling skills and decides to take him under his wing. Along their travels the two also stumble into a abusive rich man's wife that decides it's time for her to get out. The actress playing this vixen is Vanessa Angel. This is also probably her most memorable role in her filmography to most people who recognize her.The three actors do have their moments that are funny but it's not often. Harrelson carries most of the weight because of how his character tries to be better than his current social status. Quaid's character isn't all that funny but does work occasionally too. Of course Angel's character is one that probably won't be ignored since much of the physical humor is centered around her bosom. Thankfully not all the physical comedy relies on Angel. Harrelson's character uses a rubber hand in replace of his metal hooks and watching him fiddle getting ready or doing other things people normally do with their hands brought up some laughs. However there are some gags that are more gross than comical. I'm sure that's apart of the Farrelly humor but if you're a viewer who doesn't like that kind of humor it won't be that funny.Bill Murray even has a fairly major role in the story too playing a bowler named Ernie McCracken. Man does Murray's hair get wild. In fact his personality altogether is a bit too wild. Murray is more of an actor who can play a funny role in a deadpan fashion not overthetop. Most likely Murray fans will have a fun time but he does get to be too much at times. The two gentlemen behind the screenplay have more TV series writing under their belts than acclaimed comedy blockbusters which could explain why several gags amount to very little. Also the characters for what they are aren't the most likable. Yes they're weird in their own way and have their moments but they don't come off as characters that viewers would remember easily.Shockingly a number of the less important characters are extremely blind or stupid. The character of Ernie McCracken is vulgar along with his strong hubris. McCracken gropes women in public and yet no one sees this? How is it that the women being groped is OK with this? It's not like McCracken is Elvis or something. One character even called the man a role model for future generations. Are you kidding? Of course it's supposed to make the McCracken character seem unstoppable but how do these people not see this on public television? It may baffle viewers. Editing and cinematography is OK but nothing special. One time composer Freedy Johnston's score was barely noticeable. Much of the time the music was provided by music parodying or directly paralleling the situation being displayed. It was alright at points while others not so much.The comedy is frequently hit or miss with its forgettable characters and repetitive gags.

Randy Quaid is awesome as the unwilling bowling Amish Woody Harrelson great as his conman manager and finally Bill Murray is as usual brilliant as the antagonist. Just like most of the work from the Farrellybrothers this movie constantly uses cheap tricks and nasty comedy to get laughs from the audience. Often below the belt often mean but always with a tongueincheek that makes it work.When it comes to the combination bowling and comedy this is number one next to The Big Lebowski.

The Carl Bernstein character Mark Forman is played by Jack Nicholson with his usual devilish eyebrowtwitching grinning charm but the film is carried by Meryl Streep as his longsuffering wife whose character writer Rachel Samstadt seems to age without recourse to added lines or makeup or any of the usual Hollywood trickery but purely by a change of bodylanguage and a certain implied physical heaviness. The film is wellserved by its supporting players as well as its principals notably Stockard Channing and Jeff Daniels. It's both moving and very funny and the fact that their first child Annie is played by Streep's reallife daughter makes the motherchild interaction natural and utterly charming.The acting is superb by the whole cast and what could've become an overdramatic film has wonderful moments of humor that works so well. Although the story is quite sad in parts the film is balanced out by a lot of humor. I found myself laughing out loud at this film a lot.

ActingAlright so let me start this review by stating that I'm a diehard fan of Jack Nicholson. So I might be slightly transparent about the flaws of the movie but there aren't many. This film is very hard to get a hold of actually. I stumbled upon a used DVD store and being a collector of Jack Nicholson's films and a huge fan I immediately purchased it. I hadn't ever heard of this film until then and made a quick research on IMDb and Wikipedia about the movie. This movie's story is written by Nora Ephron and is loosely based on her life and relationship with reallife journalist Carl Bernstein. On paper the story of the movie goes like this Divorced woman meets a sortof heartless playboy falls for him marries him has children with him and leaves him after figuring out that he's been cheating on her. Sounds so simple but in reality it isn't. That's the reason why we have veteran actors like Nicholson and Meryl Streep on board. Meryl Streep is brilliant. Totally. Even in totally clichd scenes she performs to her fullest. Many people might be surprised but this is actually the first film of Meryl Streep I've seen. I had always wanted to see her work ever since learning that she has the most number of Academy Award nominations for Best Actress or Supporting Actress but never really got around to doing so. I wonder what her really brilliant performances would be like if this was off the hook itself. Jack Nicholson plays the uber cool guy he always is and as we always have more often than not there is a scene of him going totally crazy. But I don't want to give away too many things. You should check out the movie for yourself. This movie also marks the featurefilm debut of Kevin Spacey whom I was quite surprised to see actually but it turned out that it was only a small cameo. Story Screenplay and Direction Enough about actors. Lets get down to the story screenplay and ultimately the execution of the overall film. This film is ultrarealistic. Except a couple of teenytiny moments in the film you'll be surprised at how super realistic that this film is. Being born in the 90s I was able to get a slight sense of how life revolved in the 80s and was superthrilled and totally upset in not being able to experience the US of that era. That is also where the film goes awry in a sense. It is so realistic that it loses itself onto you at a point where you wouldn't know what is going on. There are hints of Mark Jack Nicholson being a brilliant and a sincere reporter but we really don't get to see much of that. However we do get to see a couple of scenes of Rachel Meryl Streep working in her NY paper where she's a food journalist but it doesn't go beyond that. Basically the emphasis is so much on the character's emotions especially Streep's that the film kind of weighs down a bit when you reach the 58 minute mark. Other than this slight niggle this film is amazing. Streep showcases her character's emotions so perfectly that you actually start to feel for her and get a tight sense of what her character is going through. Jack Nicholson shines in whatever scene he's in as always but is ultimately weighed down by a superb display by Meryl Streep. I was surprised that she hadn't gotten an Oscar Nomination for this but hey Nicholson didn't either for 'The Shining 1980' which was one of his best works in the 80s. Technical Work The cinematography is topnotch too considering the fact that this was the 80s. I had initially thought that this was a Stanley Kubrick film which always has the best camera work. But it was good to know that Mike Nichols also had an affinity towards great camera work and composition to each and every scene. Lastly I had learned that this film had become even more popular because of the superb musical score by Carly Simon. 'Coming Around Again' is too good. Whoever you are whatever era you were born into you would surely have heard this song even if you might not be able to recognize it just by reading the name. Overall this is a brilliant film with a very few cons. You should definitely watch it if only for Meryl Streep's performance. This is a very very highly underrated film.".

Streep's weddingday jitters it turns out were amply justified she discovers an affair between her husband and a socialclimbing hostess.Streep is so luminous and so natural that one may not realize until the end of the film how completely insipid and devoid of any distinguishing qualities her character is. Rachel changes from a wan nervous divorcee before meeting Nicholson's character to an obsessively devoted wife and mother who keeps babbling about how happy she is.Nicholson is wellcast as the rakish but initially endearing husband. The supporting cast reflects the expert hand of Juliet Taylor Woody Allen's longtime casting director who peppered it with many familiar faces including Allen favorites Joanna Gleason Caroline Aaron and Karen Akers. Maureen Stapleton is particularly droll as Streep's shrink. Nineties audiences will enjoy seeing Kevin Spacey as a neurasthenic mugger.The comedy in the film is somewhat uneven but often extremely engaging as in a running parody of Masterpiece Theatre. And compare the spontaneous bravado of Nicholson's lopsided rendition of Soliloquy from Carousel the comic highlight to the forced quirkiness of Meg Ryan's tonedeaf Surrey with the Fringe on Top in When Harry Met Sally...".

I'm sure there are many men out there that would probably fall asleep during this due to lack of machine gun fire or kung foo fighting. But for women it is a great slice of life piece. I could watch it over and over again. It has some great comedic moments from Mark Jack Nicholson and his friend Arthur Richard Masur several times as they have profound discussions about every day things in a Woody Allen type banter. One part that always touches me is when Rachel finds out about Mark's affair and confronts him. A few minutes later she is packing up to leave and we hear Carly Simon's song Coming Around Again on the soundtrack. If you listen to the lyrics of the song it perfectly fits the action that is going on at that moment. It helps the viewer understand Rachel's despair. Her idea of the perfect marriage has been shattered.Anyway if you want to watch a movie with heart then this is it. I think many of the people who say this movie is boring or garbage are too used to today's action standards and dismiss it too quickly. By the way this is also a semi biographical account of now director Nora Ephron's marriage to a Washington journalist. The book is also a good read as well. If you think Mark treated her badly in the movie it is nothing compared to the book.In summary Heartburn is a movie for people who are emotional and intelligent.".

It's worth seeing but a hard film to love.Now some words about the Carly Simon song Coming Around Again. I heard the song before I saw the movie and it no doubt affected my viewing of it. So many movies seem to just tack on any old song at the end credits but this song really captures the essence of love and marriage and brings out all the emotions of a great film scene in merely a few minutes. I cannot believe the overblown Take My Breath Away from Top Gun also overblown won the 1986 Oscar for Best Original Song and Coming Around Again was not even nominated! Perhaps this is why Carly Simon won her Oscar for Let the River Run two years later to make up for this gross omission. She would also duet with Streep during the end credits of Marvin's Rooman even better film. The song alone is reason enough to see Heartburn.".

Supporting players Stockard Channing Maureen Stapleton Jeff Daniels and Kevin Spacey while uniformly excellent seem underutilized and distract from the main plot.Heartburn is worth watching if only for its strong cast but it's as memorable as leftover lasagna.";

	schema:reviewBody "You got the now late Mike Nichols you got Streep you got Nicholson you got Nora Ephron adapting her own semimenoir about her relationship with Carl Bernstein. Given the pedigree behind everything involved with the film  and for me I'm a sucker for a good infidelity drama  it's only a shame this isn't you know one of the top films of the 80's. It doesn't quite get there but it's not for lack of trying on anyone's part. Heartburn is an entertaining picture even as it doesn't quite move to a beat of a fast drummer nor does it have very easy solutions to its dramatic conflicts. But that's a good thing here Nichols and Ephron know this story has people who can't resolve or move on too easily despite all signs pointing in a direction the audience can read.It's basically this girl and boy meet boy marries girl  though girl doesn't really want to marry exactly and one of the funnier set pieces shows Rachel stewing about in the bedroom adjacent to the wedding as friends and family come to try and support sort of this whole union  girl and boy find a real 'fixerupper' house girl is going to have boy's baby things are happy... and then suspicion creeps in for the girl. A lot of this is not very much 'plot' driven though Nichols knows how to tell his story.If there's anything 'off' it might be that the pacing is a little lackadaisical. Not quite the same as 'slow' exactly you just have to be keyed in to the rhythm that's going on here. The filmmakers here are emphasizing character more. You get scenes sometimes very funny like when Mark just breaks out into a goofy song following the news that he's having a baby... and then breaks out into song again the next morning to wake up Rachel. A lot of the movie is more funny in a sly observational way. It's not as 'LOL' type of funny as work Ephron was to do after this and some might say like those other movies it's a little chick centric. I can't say if it can be so easily pegged albeit there are piffy bits like Rachel watching the TV and getting messages about the infidelities going on.Nichols knows this material needs the help of its actors and of course he has two of the best... ever really. The charisma and combination just works there's no doubt about that. And there's both real comedy and real drama to work on probably more drama than comedy. And sometimes things happen in the movie that seem to be more incidental than anything to push it forward  i.e. Kevin Spacey's debut as a thief  but even this ends up kind of playing a part in the story at a key moment near the end. The actors make all these beats very painfully awkwardly sadly and bittersweetlike real. When Rachel suddenly realizes that moment where things are wrong in a hair salon the way it comes to her how Nichols moves the camera and one of his gifts knowing when NOT to cut and how she looks and she goes from 0 to 60... it's wonderful stuff.Why not great? Maybe a little too loose in parts and the Carly Simon score is grating after a while and dates the movie the songs too. But all in all Heartburn is a very good movie about this relationship and its peaks and valleys but also about the nature of indecision and how something as seemingly clearcut as 'stay with your husband  or go' is a real concrete existential dilemma. Underrated really.".

I found it all very rushed and under developed and I was tempted to turn off at this point. I was glad I didn't. Once all of this is over Heartburn actually turns into a good movie. It's a very realistic and often humorous account of an everyday marriage. Baby Annie is very cute! I was wondering how they managed to get a 2 year old to cooperate in such a way but I understand that she's actually Meryl Streep's real life daughter? It definitely shows. Scenes between the two of them were really sweet and often very funny and again realistic.But then sadly the ending lets this movie down. I found it very abrupt and unexplained much like the beginning. It's a shame really the centre of the movie is very enjoyable. I cannot understand why the producers didn't see the underdevelopment of the plot at the beginning. And then nothing really happens at the end. Sure she leaves Mark again but she already did that once and went back. So what exactly was she going off to do? Hmm didn't really 'get' the ending at all. Cute scene on the plane though.END SPOILERS While all of this sounds relatively boring I can assure you it isn't. Heartburn is a very pleasant movie just don't expect any major surprises.".

I'm sure there are many men out there that would probably fall asleep during this due to lack of machine gun fire or kung foo fighting. But for women it is a great slice of life piece. I could watch it over and over again. It has some great comedic moments from Mark Jack Nicholson and his friend Arthur Richard Masur several times as they have profound discussions about every day things in a Woody Allen type banter. One part that always touches me is when Rachel finds out about Mark's affair and confronts him. A few minutes later she is packing up to leave and we hear Carly Simon's song Coming Around Again on the soundtrack. If you listen to the lyrics of the song it perfectly fits the action that is going on at that moment. It helps the viewer understand Rachel's despair. Her idea of the perfect marriage has been shattered.Anyway if you want to watch a movie with heart then this is it. I think many of the people who say this movie is boring or garbage are too used to today's action standards and dismiss it too quickly. By the way this is also a semi biographical account of now director Nora Ephron's marriage to a Washington journalist. The book is also a good read as well. If you think Mark treated her badly in the movie it is nothing compared to the book.In summary Heartburn is a movie for people who are emotional and intelligent.".

Personally I could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too.Outside of my own personal dementia the film really lacked anything worth it's time.

Personally I could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too.Outside of my own personal dementia the film really lacked anything worth it's time. There were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging. When something happens the reactions of the characters are vague and dry.Best not to look this one up.";

Think about itwould you have the courage to just get up and leave with two small children? Not to mention be able to sing about it.

Nicholson is hilarious and a lot of scenes are even funnier because people can relate i.e. while reconstructing their new house they run into a few problems with the contractor. In real life women get involved all the time with men who cheat and still go back to them. It never made sense to me but it still happens and I'm glad Meryl Streep leaves Jack Nicholson. Not only is it great in literary design which it should be as Nora Ephron had two screenwriters for parents but the visual design is incredible. For example during their wedding pay special attention to the proximic pattern where the player is in relation to other things and where the camera is in relation to other things. Specifically even in the beginning of the scene Mike Nichols uses interesting images. It starts focused on an old woman who's fallen asleep but even though she's the center and focus of the frame what really catches the eye is the couple behind her because they're moving around a lot. Then alas they are the couple in the next shot approaching Streep in the bedroom to tell her they are Nicholson's oldest friends. They start out far away as they don't know her very well but walk toward her as they try to get closer to her which I thought was good use of physical representation. Then Nichols continues to use physical closeness for the rest of the scene to show her relation to each one. Streep's held in the arms of her father because they're close her therapist is sits close to her on the bed but not as close as her father and Nicholson holds her tightly as he would seem to be the closest. But that's enough analysis for one day. But I do recommend seeing this filmI had never heard of it before but it's actually very good. And one more thing Yakov Smirnoff is always funfunny to see.".

You know they're going to fall in love eventually and they do so of course but you are left to wonder exactly why  how this happened. I actually had to rewind the movie to see if I missed a scene or two because it seems to be lacking a few steps in the standard love evolution story.

I was somewhat looking forward to it because these Korean melodramas can often be quite good if done right and I enjoy writing IMDb reviews for moviesseries that have little to no reviews at present.So I get up today and am ready to write my IMDb review and I see karluk99 has beat me to it a week ago after 4 years of no reviews whatsoever. Honestly I think hisher review is pretty accurate and to the point this is a fairly disappointing flick overall that can only be considered average at best and I did not really like it all that much It won't make you gouge your eyes out but you can easily skip this movie for something else.Karluk99 points out that this movie is better suited as TV drama and I completely agree. However I would like to posit the opinion that this seems to be designed as a KTV drama to begin with that somehow never got aired for whatever reason and was thusly haphazardly turned into a movie. There are so many momentsscenesstories that seem to beg to be fleshed out more or be cut altogether in order to make it work better as a movie. Bottom Line This story should have never been produced as a movie in its current form it's so obviously bound for a KTV melodrama that it's hard to look upon it as anything else. There are a few likable moments here and there but not enough to consider it a recommended watch overall.I'm giving it 5 out of 10 stars!".

Traditional doll maker Eun Ho meets playboy plastic surgeon Ki Baek after a minor hang gliding accident when he agrees to attend her doll making workshop. They initially can't stand each other but then abruptly decide they are in love and want to get married. That more or less ends the romantic part of the movie. The rest of the film is dedicated to an intermittently amusing attempt to get the snobbish mother of Ki Baek and the poorbutproud father of Eun Ho to agree to the match. Ki Baek's mother is a rich business woman who wants to build a golf course and needs to buy land owned by Eun Ho's father who it goes without saying doesn't want to sell. The only thing that they can agree upon it seems is their mutual desire to break up the engagement. The parents eventually discover that the other family isn't as awful as first appeared and they both want what's best for their child in any case so hey what's wrong with this marriage after all? Nothing apparently so the audience gets to enjoy a standard romantic comedy happy ending.I gave Unstoppable Marriage a 410 rating. To me that means it's a slightly below average romantic comedy. The comedy works fairly well the romance not so much. I was a little put off by all the pointless swearing. Ki Baek's mother frequently lapses into English in what seems to be an effort to show off her upper class behavior but can't string a sentence together without cussing. It was probably meant to be funny but became tiresome from overuse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I just got through watching this muchanticipated film by me and it didn't disappoint except for one thing I thought it was a true story. I didn't play close enough attention to the word inspired in the title because unlike the story of Seabiscuit this isn't what really happened.It's based on a nice comeback story a real racehorse Mariah's Storm which did make a great comeback from a serious injury but not to the extent of what happens here in this movie. This was exaggerated to the hilt for dramatic purposes but that's okay once you know that because the story is indeed inspirational. Most important this is about as nice a modernday film as you will ever find. There's nary a swear word hardly even a raised voice. There are nice characters and a sweet familyfriendly tone to it with a tearinyoureyes Seabiscuittype tale and ending.Dakota Fanning once again demonstrates why she is the greatest child actor of her generation. Kurt Russell is excellent too. Ole Kurt must be mellowing these days playing subdued nice guys like this. It's good to see. The same goes for Elisabeth Shue. This is a far cry from her role in Leaving Las Vegas. Even Kris Kristofferson holds his tongue in this film! Amazing.Like Seabiscuit this also is beautifully filmed. I wonder if any sport is filmed and is just surrounded by all this beauty in reallife too like horse racing? It IS the sport of kings. There is some spectacular scenery in here much of it in Kentucky and where better to be when filming a horse racing story?So if you and your kids  or just you  want to settle in for nice film and you're looking for a pleasing nicelooking feelgood story you absolutely cannot miss with this film. Very highly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "Well I just got through watching this muchanticipated film by me and it didn't disappoint except for one thing I thought it was a true story. I didn't play close enough attention to the word inspired in the title because unlike the story of Seabiscuit this isn't what really happened.It's based on a nice comeback story a real racehorse Mariah's Storm which did make a great comeback from a serious injury but not to the extent of what happens here in this movie. This was exaggerated to the hilt for dramatic purposes but that's okay once you know that because the story is indeed inspirational. Most important this is about as nice a modernday film as you will ever find. There's nary a swear word hardly even a raised voice. There are nice characters and a sweet familyfriendly tone to it with a tearinyoureyes Seabiscuittype tale and ending.Dakota Fanning once again demonstrates why she is the greatest child actor of her generation. Kurt Russell is excellent too. Ole Kurt must be mellowing these days playing subdued nice guys like this. It's good to see. The same goes for Elisabeth Shue. This is a far cry from her role in Leaving Las Vegas. Even Kris Kristofferson holds his tongue in this film! Amazing.Like Seabiscuit this also is beautifully filmed. I wonder if any sport is filmed and is just surrounded by all this beauty in reallife too like horse racing? It IS the sport of kings. There is some spectacular scenery in here much of it in Kentucky and where better to be when filming a horse racing story?So if you and your kids  or just you  want to settle in for nice film and you're looking for a pleasing nicelooking feelgood story you absolutely cannot miss with this film. Very highly recommended.";

It is almost frightening to see someone of her tender years with such screen presence and ability to deliver a range of emotion so convincingly. If only the film industry will refrain from corrupting her  and her support group helps to keep her real  she will undoubtedly evolve into an excellent adult performer.Kurt Russell is a perennial favorite of ours. We both commented on the joy of watching the growth of his career and ability from his child roles of Disney films through his present mature stage of career. Whether a husband and father in Dreamer or a dysfunctional husband and brother in Backdraft he is enjoyable to watch.Kris Kristofferson as a crusty old horse person with a huge warm heart was a nice addition to the film. We have long acknowledge that his acting talent far exceeds his musical prowess.Last but not least there is Elisabeth Shue. Since Adventures in Babysitting we have enjoyed her performances. She is beautiful charming adept versatile and willing to take professional risks. It is unfortunate that the film industry does not provide her more good roles for someone of her abilities.It is pleasing that Dreamer  and films of its style  are made.

	schema:reviewBody "As a long time horse racing fan and a former horse loving little girl this movie had to go on my must see list. I would definitely recommend it for all families  and the adults may be surprised how much they enjoy it also. There is one scary scene for some young kids when the filly breaks down early in the movie  but this scene is part of the commercials that already have been on TV so it should not be too much of a shock. As a racing fan I found a few points that stretched credibility but this is a dream after all and they do point out that putting a filly or mare in the Breeder's Cup Classic has hardly ever been done much less expecting she can win enough of the purse to justify the high entry fee needed. Even Azeri who was a horse of the year ran 5th when she took on male horses in the Classic. Sonador could have run in the Breeder's Cup Distaff instead paid less for the entry fees and still have astounded everyone with a win when Mariah's Storm the inspired by horse ran in the Breeder's Cup Distaff after her injury she did not win. Over all the movie does a pretty good job of representing the factual background children can't generally be licensed as race horse owners but the plot certainly works much better this way!.I do think that if they are going to make Inspired by a true story part of the title they should have provided information about this some where  perhaps as a post script at the end  but they do not. You have to find interviews with the screen writer to learn that it was inspired by Mariah's Storm who broke her leg as a 2 year old when she was expected to be a favorite in the 1993 Breeder's Cup Juvenile Fillies but later returned to racing and won several graded stakes races. She has gone on to be the dam of several stakes winners including Giants Causeway who is one of the studs they admire at Ashmore Stud when looking for a horse to breed Sonadore to. Mariah's Storm is 14 years old now and is still having babies. I suspect that on their trip to the breeding farm we may be seeing the actual retired race horses as the studs shown Fusaichi Pegasus Giant's Causeway Johannesburg Grand Slam are all actually owned by Coolmore Lexington formerly Ashmore Stud in Kentucky. While inspired by Mariah's Storm the movie is not really based on her. In fact at one point the characters talk about Mariah's Storm when saying it may be possible for Sonador to race again after her broken leg just like Mariah's Storm had. Grand Slam the horse they considered breeding Sonador to also made a comeback from an injury he suffered running in the 1997 Breeder's Cup Juvenile.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Dreamer Inspired by a True Story";
	schema:reviewBody "The premise of this movie is so similar to 2003's Seabiscuit you'd think you're watching yet another biography of a real horse in some extraordinary inspiring film that might just make you want to head down to the nearest race course and observe a real race.But Dreamer or Sonador as the horse is named takes a slightly different angle in this tale about second chances and comebacks. If compared to Seabiscuit yes we have a horse with great potential faced with the troubles of breaking a leg during a competitive race. As with all race horses this means instant death as they have no future value and are bred for the sole purpose of racing.We also have a superb trainer Ben Crane played by Kurt Russell and the doctor Holmes Osborne the writtenoff jockey Freddy Rodriguez the stablehand Luis Guzman etc. But here's where the similarities end. Dreamer is a more personal film with family friendly characters like the daughter Dakota Fanning the wife Elizabeth Shue and the grandfather Kris Kristofferson. Nursing the horse back to health had actually brought the family closer together and that in itself makes this film quite clich in its many beentheredonethat before moments to touch.Dakota Fanning has held her own against fatherfigure heavyweights like Robert De Niro Denzel Washington and Tom Cruise though many would have pointed out that she had rivaled Naomi Watts for the 2005 Scream Queen honors with her performance in War of the Worlds. Here Fanning has returned to more credible acting albeit in a safer role.Dreamer Inspired by a True Story is a heartwarming tale about believing in oneself having dreams believing that you can achieve and take action to achieve those dreams. While watching the movie I can't help but chuckle at the parallels in seeing how my team and I are sticking together just like those characters in wanting to see our dream of making a short film and entering it into competitions in this case the Breeder's Cup come to a reality.It's that kind of film an inspiring one. It might be clichd the premise might be too good to be true but hey success might come to those who dare to dream believe and more importantly do.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit that the real reason that I went to see Dreamer was because large parts of the film were filmed in and around Lexington KY my hometown. While I am a HUGE horseracing fan I cringe a little at sappy feelgood cheesy stories involving 11yearold girls. And so I almost passed on Dreamer because of the trailers with Dakota Fanning.I was pleasantly surprised though. In fact Dreamer had far far fewer moments that could be considered sappy or cloying than the much more publicized and wellregarded Seabiscuit.Dakota Fanning is a fantastic actor and she plays the part of Cale Crane beautifully only once when Dreamer is reclaimed by her father as a surprise striking a false note of overenthusiastic cheesiness. The rest of the time Fanning plays the horsecrazy idealistic and yet surprisingly levelheaded Cale to a tee.Although it is true that the story follows a fairly predictable story arc it is plainly clear that the writers and director are horseracing fans. Despite the very economical storytelling the movie almost felt too short and rushed from one scene to another the story captured many of the fabulous quirks of horseracing in Kentucky not least the reference to the Saudi prince who flies his private 737 to Lexington to see his horse run against his brother's horsethe real sheik of Dubai has flown his 737 into Lexington for years where he parks it on the tarmac at the airport across Versailles road from Keeneland...everyone knows when the sheik is in town to see or buy his horses.The cinematography captures the horse country around Lexington and Keeneland superblythey look far better and more realistic here unfussed with and pure than they did in their limited exposure in Seabiscuit.The best testimony to the film's success as a crowd pleaser was its reception on a Saturday night several weeks after the movie's release midNovember in a North Carolina theater. The majority of the audience were NOT horsecrazy adolescent girls but rather adult couples who spontaneously broke into applause at Sonya's triumph in the Breeder's Cup Classic and who lingered at the end credits clearly hoping for even more. Actually an infertile 3yearold mare has got little ahead of her except to continue racing... How about a sequel where Sonador's earnings allow the Crane's to attempt to restore the family farm to its mysterious and mythical former glory? All in all a movie that promises a story about a horse overcoming the odds and a family coming together which delivers resoundingly and convincingly on both counts.There are a handful of minor goofs in the movie in terms of accuracy but they do not detract from the overall film. More amusing than anything else is the scene in the pasture where Sonador who is supposed to be a filly is very VERY clearly played by a gelding.".

The family includes a grandfather Kris Kristofferson a son Kurt Russell his wife Elisabeth Shue and their daughter Dakota Fanning. The son is a horse trainer and loses his job abruptly and takes with him a badly injured horse to his shrunken empty rundown horse farm.Just as the horse Sonador which is Spanish for Dreamer struggles to become healthy the family also struggles to become a caring loving unit again. The indomitable spirit of the daughter as she cares for the horse forces the family to confront their problems. And ultimately they do face their problems with courage spirit and even heroism.The acting in this movie by the family members was superb. But Dakota Fanning deserves a special mention. It seems once a generation there is an outstanding child actor that is believable. She is this generation's child actor.The cinematography and music score are outstanding.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow I saw this movie last night and it was amazing! I have always had a love for horses and have been around them for over seven years but that's not the only reason why I loved Dreamer as much as I did.All the actors and actresses did such a great job in this movie. I have been a fan of Dakota Fanning for a while now and I think she does well in almost everything she does but I don't think it would be possible for her to do any better than she did in this movie. She played her character Cale Crane perfectly. It was obvious throughout the movie that she loved her horse Sonador with all of her heart. She would even sneak out at night to feed her Popsicles! In real life Dakota has her own horse named Goldie so she was already used to being around horses before she started filming this movie.Kurt Russel also did an amazing job in this movie. Honestly I don't think there is any other actor out there that deserved that part more than he did. I've seen Elisabeth Shue Lily Crane in another one of her most recent movies Hide and Seek which is a completely different genre of movie but I thought she did a great job in it and Dreamer as well. Dakota Fanning was also in Hide and Seek and did a great job too as usual.I didn't even notice one single thing in this movie that I would have changed. It was just so good and I think there should be more movies like this to be made in the future. Everyone in the theater clapped and cheered when Cale's horse Sonador crossed the finish line in first place at the Breeder's Cup. Dreamer is a movie that anyone can enjoy so if you are looking for a really really good inspirational movie I highly suggest you go see this one. 1010.".

Dakota Fanning is a very special young actress perhaps a greater talent at her age than Drew Barrymore. Kris Kristofferson play his usual gritty character. And last but not least it's great to see Elisabeth Shue on the silver screen again. She is a natural beauty and a great actress. The movie is very timely in that it involves the Breeder's Cup which at the time of this writing is coming up this weekend.

This inspired account about an injured horse the Crane family bring back to life is one of the most engaging films about the racing sport in memory. Of course this is no Seabiscuit but the film makers are not claiming it to be.John Gantins the director and writer of this picture knows what to give the public. Aside from the heart warming feeling in the film he was blessed with a cast that does justice to the material. The love of a young girl for a horse that by all accounts should have been shot because of the injured it suffered during an accident is the stuff that makes good family movies. Dreamer Inspired by a True Story is totally dominated by Dakota Fanning's presence in the film. Miss Fanning is a luminous young actress the camera adores. She is a natural as she shows in this film. Dakota Fanning has the uncanny ability of being real at all times. Her love for Sonador and her determination to take the horse to the Breeders' race consumes her as well as her family.Kurt Russell is also good as Cale's father. He is a man of principle who loves what he does best bringing horses to their full potential. Kris Kristofferson plays the grandfather who wants Cale to succeed and in the process he is reunited with his son. Elizabeth Shue is seen as a mother who has to work to help meet ends when her husband loses his job. David Morse one of the best character actors around doesn't have much to do and the same goes for the wonderful Luis Guzman playing one of the stable men.The film is recommended for families with children. Mr. Gantins created an excellent entertainment that will satisfy young and old because it shows a young girl with a firm resolution to do the right thing for the horse she loves.".

Dakota Fanning is phenomenal. That child is far too skilled for her own good. She takes on the depth of the character and brings a reality to the screen rarely found by child actors. Kurt Russell for any 80's child is a classic and has wonderful chemistry on screen with his on screen daughter. Chris Christopherson although shockingly older than he was with Barbara Streisand plays a role untouchable by other actors.

The on screen relationships have depth the plot stirs the audience and for anyone interested in good film  this movie is a must see.";

It will have a USA premiere in Indianapolis. Mr. Gatins chose a smart strategy for his first film let the pros do their thing and lead without dictating. It really is Dakotas' film and all the cast seems to accept this. Some humor some tears as the trailers show but there is so much more. It would be nice to see Elizabeth Shue do more but there is a lot of story to cover. Photography is excellent in both sweeping shots and action closeups. The mood of the film is appropriate for the narrative with just the right amount of action and conversation. It would be great to see a followup film in five years to see how Cale develops as a character. I wish the film had been 4 hours long!".

The cast was incredible each actor filled his part wonderfully there not enough good things to say Great performances by Kurt Russell Dakota Fanning and Kris Kristopherson. Robert Morse is an excellent bad guy. And Elizabeth Shue gives a lovely performance. I'm recommending this movie to everyone except EXCEPTIONALLY SENSITIVE children who in spite of a very happy ending may not be able to handle the trauma of the extreme sadness which precedes it. The cinematography was beautiful. The story was predictable but very well written and followed through without deviating. I've never cared enough to submit a written a comment on a movie but this movie moved me and I hope its a great hit!".

It's a good solid cast and Dakota Fanning can do no wrong because Fanning was involved it turned out was the only reason why a major Hollywood Studio agreed to make this movie.

This film SO exceeded my expectations that I just cannot say enough about it. I laughed I cried and when the credits rolled at the end I literally stood to my feet and cheered. This movie made me feel great. I saw three films while I was there and this was undoubtedly the best one. The story is essentially about a down and out horse farmer who is not only having trouble making ends meet but who also has difficulty relating to his daughter and his father. The horse in the story is named Dreamer but the name could just as easily apply to Cale the character played by Dakota Fanning who in my opinion is the real dreamer in the story. She dreams of what her father could be of what her farm could be of what her family could be . . . and you can see this little girl's dreams in Dakota Fanning's expressive young eyes.Every actor in this film is outstanding. Kurt Russell was the best I've seen him. It is a triumph for everyone associated with it but particularly for Dakota Fanning. This young actress is really something special. She has the ability to convey emotions with a range that actors and actresses several times her age have yet to master. One can only hope that she continues to blossom and not burn out because she promises to give us viewers our money's worth for many years to come! She is a gift to her audience in this picture.This is a film for all ages for anyone that wants not only to be entertained but to feel exultation to have your emotions go on a ride and come out feeling fantastic. It's a feel good movie and as soon as it comes to the regular theatre I'm going to go and feel good about seeing it again!".

On this first half of the movie Olsenbanden overgiver sig aldrig looks like almost any other of the 14 Olsenbanden movies. But now the similarities ends. Now the Olsenbande is going to Europaparlament to steal their money back. The second half really is good. But as all Olsenbanden film the gang gets scammed as always. They have to travel back to Denmark. There they have to steal the money from a meeting of ministers of Europa. To do this the gang steals a m41 walker bulldog tank from the Danish army and rolls it up to the meeting steals the money and gets away. Though the gang never wins in the end the finale of the movie really is good  bringing a tank into the movie really was a surprise a good surprise. That is one of the most memorable finales in all of the Olsenbanden movies. If your are Danish watch this movie. 810  Nuff said.".

The vaults of the ninth the Copenhagen City Hall Clock in the tenth... and then this one. The gang go to Bruxelles and there's no doubt that at least much of it was shot on location. They also hijack a tank. The first of those two expenses begets some hilarious scenes. The plot is quite good even if the main thing at stake is basically the same as it was last time... Denmark's fate. Brge returns though he's hardly in the film at all. Fie's pregnant and some attention is placed upon the fact that Kjeld will be a grandfather though one is left wondering what happened to the first child of the young couplethen again this is the series of the disappearing kids... just watch the transition from the first film to the second. The pacing is quite intense... not a moment is wasted though I don't think I would say that it goes too quickly. Arthur Jensen portrays the meter maidParkeringsvagt that he did in the ninth in a very brief but irresistibly funny scene. Solveig Sundborg appears for the last time in one of these films. Interestingly enough she had very small roles in exactly seven of these films... which makes up half of the entire seriesif one counts the '98 reunion film which I suppose one should as painful for us fans as that can be. Edward Fleming shows up again in a smaller role though he does have one gag. Bffen is hardly in the film at all though his scene is fairly funnythough his death trap isn't as creative as some of the others seen in the series. As a fun piece of trivia his character seems to dress slightly differently in each film... new hat different pieces of footwear and such... but he always wears a blue and white striped shirt with a black leather vest over. Peter Steen has his final role in this film and with more luck and less of a pitiful overplayed performance than that seen in the three other filmsthe first three incidentally that he appeared in. It's amusing to see Bjrn WattBoolsen  in the role of BangJohansen  criticizing Holm Hansens big mouth... the very character he played twice just a few films back. As my father pointed out while we watched this seems to have more coups than any of the other entries. The opening scene contains what for my money is the single coolest breakin ever committed to film at the very least for this franchise. The humor is still going strong in spite of this not being as funny as the former film... the running gag about the police force's view on reporters the Minister's wife who has a mania to turn out her rooms and the joke pointing out the solemnity of the profession of being a guard all spring to mind. There is poked some fun at the Danes'and perhaps that of many human beings in general? love of good food and beers. The police is parodied for the umpteenth time. Not much else to say... it's clear that the series is reaching its end at this point though there is still some creativity left in Bahs and Balling. An entertaining film in the series and worth watching for at least a few great sequences. I recommend it to any fan of OlsenBanden andor Danish comedy in general. Having seen as many of the other films as possible first is a must. 810".

While clearing the first town and industrial zone the company rescues an orphan girl from the enemy's clutches. This child becomes the company's goodluck mascot but more importantly she represents the hope and the catalyst that keeps the Marines together. In the girl's eyes each Marine in the adoptive company is an 'uncle' and she blesses each of the Marines with an endearing nickname. The little orphan girl becomes a witness of each Marine's sorrows and happy moments.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a huge fan of director Kang Woo Suk and his films such as 'Two Cops' and 'Silmido'. The 'Public Enemy' series is unique in the fact that South Korean films rarely have a franchise because even if the first film is a hit the second and third films flop.for example My Wife is a Gangster and Hi Dharma. 'Public Enemy3'is more of a direct sequel to the first moviebecause in the second one the main character's job and history is all changed and it was okay but not great like the first one. The film follows the story of our hero Kang Chul JoongSeol Kyong Gu who is brilliant as usual who is sick of being a cop because the job is dangerous and pays almost nothing not to mention his credit is way down so he can't even get a loan from the bank. He decides to quit until his old bossKang Shil Il who participated in this movie despite the fact that he has cancercalls him up for one last investigation. A high school student who murdered a local businessman was found dead in his school. As detective Kang investigates more closely he finds out that the mastermind is Lee Won SoolJeong Jae Young president of Geo Seong Enterprises which on the outside is a regular corporation owning restaurants construction firms and night clubs but on the inside trains top fighting high school students to be ruthless gangsters. As Kang delves deeper into the case Won Sool hatches a plan to stop both Kang and the case for good..........The best thing about this movie is that it points out the problems of teenagers in society who think that it's just cool to fight and beat up innocent people. It shows us that being a gangster isn't cool it's like digging your own grave. The problem is the comic parts. I understand that director Kang Woo Suk called this movie 'a mixture from the previous Public Enemy films with his early movies like TwoCops' but comedy just doesn't work with a thriller like this with such a serious topic. People might just ignore the message this movie is trying to send because there are just too many funny parts. I give this movie 8 stars because on the whole I enjoyed it and hope for another Public Enemy film in the years to come but I hope if another sequel does come out director Kang returns to the more serious version of the first and second Public Enemy films.".

Its a beautiful and charming story of two kids caught in the web of love in their early childhood and as the time progresses the strings of the web strengthens. If you look closely you will observe that these kids never grow up as they never seem to lose the innocence of their sentiments throughout the movie. Basically the story is divided into three phases childhood teenage and then the youth. It shows the subtle differences that creeps into their character at different phases. It also signifies that once you are trapped in love its near to impossible to be free and also you will trust your true love blindly. You will find yourself enchanted by the rush of emotions as the movie advances with its never changing tempo. Don't watch this movie with a practical mindset but try a philosophical one. I am sure you won't be disappointed at the end.".

Its a beautiful and charming story of two kids caught in the web of love in their early childhood and as the time progresses the strings of the web strengthens. If you look closely you will observe that these kids never grow up as they never seem to lose the innocence of their sentiments throughout the movie. Basically the story is divided into three phases childhood teenage and then the youth. It shows the subtle differences that creeps into their character at different phases. It also signifies that once you are trapped in love its near to impossible to be free and also you will trust your true love blindly. You will find yourself enchanted by the rush of emotions as the movie advances with its never changing tempo. Don't watch this movie with a practical mindset but try a philosophical one. I am sure you won't be disappointed at the end.";

By this i mean that this is not your typical love story.Cho Seung Woo Marathon and Gang Hye Jung Welcome To Dongmakgol are the stars of this movie. Cha Jo Kang one day meets a girl wearing a yellow raincoat by the name of Ari. Ari says to be not from earth and claims to be cursed which scares off all of her classmates except for Jo Kang who befriends her and ends up hitting it off with Ari. After Jo Kang becomes sick Ari blames herself and withdraws from school disappearing from Jo Kang's life.Years pass and Jo Kang now a high school student played by Cho Seung Woo gets word from Ari played by Kang Hye Jung to meet up and study together. Reguardless of the fact they have not seen each other in a couple years they end up hitting it off all over again. Ari though she has grown into a beautiful woman still stands strong on her talk of aliens and curses. Just as soon as Jo Kang starts to fall for her all over again Ari disappears once again. Heartbroken Jo Kang decides to find out once and for all the reason for Ari's sudden disappearances.As i've started before this movie really isn't your typical love story which is maybe why i was so taken in by it. The strange unexpected twists left me wanting more even after the movie was over. It's a funny cute and slightly odd movie you can watch with by yourself or with a girlfriend. Either way Domabaem lovephobia is an interesting twist on love".

It's executed extremely well with quirky bits throughout. If you like this kind of movie this is a grand slam home run. It's an interesting allegory as well but I don't want to give away too much.Love Phobia is about a girl Ari who claims she has a curse and that bad things will happen to anyone who touches her. She also claims to be an alien. The film starts off with her as an elementary school kid who befriends a young boy JoKang. After he touches her one day he comes down with the measles. Ari mysteriously disappears the next day. Ten years later she reappears just as mysteriously in JoKang's life and then disappears again. Ten years later or so she returns to JoKang again and her true story unfolds.Hyejeong Kang plays Ari as a teenager and as a young woman. She is not only cute beyond words she's one of Korea's best young actresses. This is something that sets Korean melodramas apart they use real actors and actresses instead of flavor of the month idols. From The Butterfly and Oldboy to this with a half dozen wellreceived films in between including the controversial and complicated Rules of Dating ... Hyejeong Kang at just twentysix is on a roll. Seungwoo Cho is also very good as JoKang. Both are convincing as teenagers and as young adults a testament to the Korean epidermis perhaps as much as thespian prowess.".

Naturally their love is so strong that by the end of the movie this nonsense turns out to be true conclusively demonstrating that Koreans must live in some alternate universe unknown to you and me.Luckily what Love Phobia also has is a beautifully told love story that makes it possible to suspend disbelief and let the story lead the audience wherever it wants. All of the seemingly silly talk about aliens and ghosts turns out to be deep conversations between two kindred souls who have found a way to share their deepest hopes and fears. Ari believes in these things because she needs to believe in something that's better than what the world has to offer her. Jo Kang understands Ari so he willingly follows into her fantasy.There is a tearjerker ending that I won't describe. By the time it rolls around Love Phobia has made a convincing case that these two people belong together. The fact that they might not be together for long is a tragedy but far less tragic than if they had allowed their phobia to keep them apart. It's not a particularly earthshaking discovery for a romantic movie but it's one that this particular romantic movie makes extraordinarily well.".

As soon as his gaze falls upon her Jokang feels a spark of electricity run down his body. After this fateful first meeting the two go on to become seatmates in class. Claiming she is an alien from outer space Ari explains why she must keep her raincoat on to keep her 'curse' from spreading. After this shocking piece of information. The other children devote their energies to keep as far away from her as possible however Jokang continues to remain by her side. Till now Ari had only relied upon her pet lizard for company now she has a new best friend. On a rainy day Ari slips her raincoat over Jokang's head to protect him from the sudden rain shower. Her arm brushes against his and the next day Jokang catches the measles. On the same day Ari mysteriously disappears. For the next 10 years Jokang hears no news from her. Ten years has passed. Both Ari and Jokang are now juniors in high school. Out of the blue Ari calls Jokang for the first time in years. To see her Jokang rushes to the Buddhist temple in the hills where she dwells under the pretense that he is going there to study. For the next few days they share a lovely time together. The long gap of 10 years has done nothing to affect their devotion and friendship. On the night before he must return home Jokang travels all the way to Seoul to bring back a plate of sushi for Ari. Ari is deeply touched by this gesture however she once again disappears from his sight the next day. Many years pass. Jo kang is now working as a teller in a bank. He employs a detective to look for Ari but not even a detective can find any traces of her. Then one day Ari suddenly appears before Jokang. She smiles brightly at him as if nothing had happened. Confused yet excited to see her Jo kang is crestfallen to hears she is slated to board a plane leaving for America on the same day. They've met for the first time in 8 years and they've only spent a mere 8 hours together... Disappointed and miserable Jokang takes her to the airport. Despite his feelings for her however he knows he must let her go. The next day Jokang catches a glimpse of a woman looking exactly like Ari.This is a great movie that presents a great love story.Great acting from Jo SeungWoo and Kang HyeJeongwho used to be in a relationship in real life.Although this one ends in a tragedy just like most Korean movies dothis is one fun and entertaining movie.".

	schema:headline " Beautiful";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one movie I can call beautiful. I know that that word is itself vague too general and overused but the movie has that something that makes me classify it as beautiful..simplicity. The dialogues in the story doesn't involve poetic lines but you can feel the strong emotions surrounding these lines. I mean hearing this line from someone you love I'm afraid I'll hurt you isn't that meaningful? Ugh. I was pulling my hair. The guy's childlike approach to the girl's heart their disagreeing over small things their being assertive and frank and vocal to the other..all these are qualities of natural persons. They don't just exist in the movies. That's why I like the film it doesn't involve too much drama you could sometimes choke and figure you're really just watching a movie. This one you can feel like you're watching a reallife couple. The sweetness and the chemistry was there..not too many conflicts in the story involved but there goes the beauty in itits ability to depict a touching story. Simple everyday stuff we do a cute friendship that blooms into a timeless love. The story is not farfetchedthe only thing that's a bit farfetched for me is Jokang not having a serious relationship after all these yearsbut yes true love and all that I know I know its just me and my practical self talking again. And don't even start me with the aliens thing being unrealistic or I'll give you a major kicking. And with simplicity comes cuteness. And yes that includes the cast themselves. I know everyone will agree with me that the young Ari and Jokang looked really cute..and when they got older they still maintained that cuteness the innocence that naiveness in them..physically and emotionally. Good choice of cast actually. Especially Cho Seongwoo who doesn't just look physically appealing but the way he acted in this movie you can't spot his effort of acting cute. Because he is just naturally cute. He could pull off that naive goofy childlike role without sweat. Alongside his small eyes he still looks young. Of course let's not forget Kang Hyejung who also just doesn't physically look cute but she can also play that naive innocent yet matured part well. Both of them are natural charmers. Also notice the setting of the film. It involves nature. Here's where the cuteness also comes in. It utilizes natural elements such as rain a lizard a grass field. The soundtracks were there to add to the cuteness too. Especially in the end scene I have to say that the scene was steeled because of the soundtrack. The scene itself was very emotional but with the addition of an orchestra in the background makes it a hall of famer. This is like a series incorporated into a movie I found myself believing they were really in love. I usually complain about how movies fail to portray the eventuality and transition of falling in love you know that abrupt onedayIwokeuplovinghim feeling and seeing them as just mere actors acting out because there's a movie. That wall I call the reason why I'm indifferent to romance movies. In this one it felt real. The story felt real. And the way they acted felt real. It was very believable. I have to give an hour of standing ovation for the ending though. It was just so full of emotions and symbolism I swear there'll be a river of tears from the viewers. It was so beautifully shotwith the leads crying in a field the camera revolving around the girl some spotlight to symbolize her going to heaven perhaps? with a sad background instrumental music and did I mention a very emotionfilled crying from the leads?. Picture this Jokang saying SaranghaeI love you not ordinarily mind you but it was so filled of emotions. The way he said this line exudes that mixture of longing the pain the hate and questioning why must it be this way the sadness all rolled into one scene. And Ari responding I'm Sorry. I died. Now I know why many people cried on this one Cho Seungwoo crying effectively communicates that lowest feeling of wanting to fight till the end but being left with no choice but just to give in. I felt the pain. And Kang hyejung's childlike face her soft voice that displays innocence is enough to tear hearts. And with that orchestra in the background the ending was epic. They were like kids crying..their faces get really sour and they don't mind the tears falling into their mouths. Not conscious how they look. Like kids. And you know how kids cry..they're so full of expressions. And when Ari said Goodbye. How can oneliners be that painful? I have to give it to their acting though. They were just so effective in capturing hearts. She was also left with no choice!! Screw that. Why can't they just be together till the end why still separate? Ugh. It boggles the mind.The movie has the right amount of cast. And I honestly didn't spot any irrelevant scene on this. No character was wasted. The directorwriter did very well in utilizing the story and focused only on the main characters. Everything was in order. 1010.".

We see two rival clans but both have their motives to fight for the survival of their people which means suffering for the opponents.

It sort of reminded me of Devil Beside You taiwanese TV show where the boy is tough on the outside and soft on the inside. He gets caught up with a girl who has a very unique personality and forces her to be with him. Dabin Jeong played a very good role and did put all her effort into it. If you haven't heard Dabin Jeong past away this year and when I read about it I was shocked! I can't believe it a young girl with such great talent for acting could do this to herself. I wish there was someone that could've stopped her before it was too late. All I can say is that she was too young. But all in all it was a really good film and if she were still alive today I would be looking forward to seeing more of her work.".

It sort of reminded me of Devil Beside You taiwanese TV show where the boy is tough on the outside and soft on the inside. He gets caught up with a girl who has a very unique personality and forces her to be with him. Dabin Jeong played a very good role and did put all her effort into it. If you haven't heard Dabin Jeong past away this year and when I read about it I was shocked! I can't believe it a young girl with such great talent for acting could do this to herself. I wish there was someone that could've stopped her before it was too late. All I can say is that she was too young. But all in all it was a really good film and if she were still alive today I would be looking forward to seeing more of her work.";

The ending is well....i would say a little bit unexpected esp. cuz we think seung hun's character left the girl for good. It was a very pleasant surprise...when he returned fulfilling her dream.

	schema:reviewBody "Art as vocation art as religion art as the purpose of life The Archers team of Powell and Pressburger aimed high with 'The Red Shoes'  and scored a bull'seye. The film is a feast for the senses cinematography by Archers regular Jack Cardiff music acting and ballet are combined to make a magnificent whole. Emeric Pressburger's story appears simple at first glance but is a challenging study of the value and purpose of art and of aestheticism as a creed a term not used lightly. It is given life by some of the most talented dancers of the era Leonid MyasinMassine as lovable Grisha Ludmilla Tchrina as glamorous flighty Irina Robert Helpmann  who choreographed the title ballet  as Ivan Marie Rambert as herself and Moira Shearer Ashton's 'Cinderella' highly appealing as the heroine Vicky. The nondancing cast is led by Archers regulars Anton Walbrook magnificent  why no Oscar? and Marius Goring so convincing I ended up wanting to slap him.The plot combines Andersen's fable 'The Red Shoes' with elements of Dyagilev's relationships with Nizhinskii and Myasin and the effect of the younger men's marriages. Dancer Vicky Page Shearer and composer Julian Craster Goring are taken up and encouraged by ballet impresario Boris Lermontov Walbrook. Boris is the film's dominant character an obvious portrait of Sergei Pavlovich Dyagilev 18721929 one of 20C culture's greatest figures the driving force of 'Mir Iskusstva' and the 'Ballets Russes'. However his ScotsRussian surname alludes to Mikhail Yur'evich Lermontov 181441 poet and author of 'A Hero of Our Time' Pushkin's successor as the voice of Russian Romanticism. Boris is an aesthete and perfectionist a true believer in the religion of art. All his passions and energies are channelled into bringing out the best in the company that is his 'family'. He demands equal dedication from his protgs. He believes that if you have an outstanding talent your primary duty is to give that talent its fullest expression not fritter it away through mundane distractions and dalliances. Human relationships are transitory what matters is the art. It is a stern unsentimental creed but a noble one.Vicky and Julian begin an affair during the creation of the new ballet 'The Red Shoes' which we see in full and has in its sacrificial deathbydancing echoes of Stravinskii's 'Sacre du Printemps' choreographed by Nizhinskii for Dyagilev. Their love tests their commitment to Lermontov's ethic. What makes the conflict interesting and effective is that it is not trivialised as sexual rivalry Boris is discreetly signalled as gay like Dyagilev  something reinforced by the casting of Walbrook. It is unnecessary to highlight the courage in 1948 of placing centrestage a dignified powerful noncaricatured gay character played by a gay actor who had escaped Nazi persecution. The struggle is between real Romanticism  hence Boris's sharing his name with the Byronic poet  and mere 'romance'. But the brutal climax bringing together Andersen's story with suitably Russian overtones of 'Anna Karenina' is an evasion of decision a character choosing death rather than commitment one way or the other. The final scene combines tragic lyricism with awareness of the unnecessary waste and the dance of course goes on.My understanding of and relationship with 'The Red Shoes' has changed and deepened with time. In girlhood I was inclined to be relatively indulgent to Vicky and Julian. In middle age they seem plain selfindulgent. Julian frankly isn't worth any sacrifice. Ballet is a secondrate form of expression he says in a quarrel with Boris  who of course launched his career. If Boris had punched him instead of the mirror how I'd have cheered! He regards Vicky as a muse for his own fulfilment as a composer while she frets with frustration her pointe shoes in a drawer her own artistic fulfilment denied. Their separate beds after marriage seem a revealing insight not merely '40s film censorship. On the spectrum of fictional obnoxiousness Julian's not far behind Angel Clare in 'Tess of the d'Urbervilles'. Boris's manipulations are actually less selfish  directed towards enabling Vicky to express her creativity to the maximum  not bury her talent in a drawer.Yes  Boris's passionately held vocation and values now evoke my strongest sympathies and recognitionidentification as a fellow 'true believer' in art and longtime Dyagilevite. Young sentimentalists may hate him he knows adolescent nonsense when he hears it! but he speaks hard truths and much wisdom. Personal relationships are fragile a dancer's active career can be short. If you have a gift service to it must come first it is a sacred duty. Domesticity can wait. Yes he is autocratic temperamental prophets and visionaries usually are. And what is his job? To unite other exceptionally gifted people from diverse disciplines  painting costume music dance  with their competing egos and artistic temperaments to create the multifaceted art of ballet. Herding cats is easier! And yet he is capable of generosity and forgiveness as with the prodigal Irina. A complex moving genuinely heroic figure 'The Red Shoes' is more his film than Vicky and Julian's.But what went wrong with British film? The Archers made 'The Red Shoes' in 1948 now we have vacuous romanticcomedychickflick pap or drab kitchensinkers that might as well be TV soap episodes betokening a loss of cultural and intellectual confidence. In visual flair has The Archers' torch passed to Baz Luhrmann? Time will tell! The present cultural climate treats the arts as an optional addon to civilisation rather than a defining part of what it means to be civilised. The arts are constantly called upon to justify their existence in commercial or social engineering terms not for their intrinsic worth. A film then in which the most compelling character advocates Art for Art's Sake  art as a sacred calling  flings a gauntlet in the face of a marketdriven antiintellectual antibeauty utilitarian society. Sergei PavlovichBoris Lermontov where are you now we need you?!!!".

A complex moving genuinely heroic figure 'The Red Shoes' is more his film than Vicky and Julian's.But what went wrong with British film? The Archers made 'The Red Shoes' in 1948 now we have vacuous romanticcomedychickflick pap or drab kitchensinkers that might as well be TV soap episodes betokening a loss of cultural and intellectual confidence. In visual flair has The Archers' torch passed to Baz Luhrmann? Time will tell! The present cultural climate treats the arts as an optional addon to civilisation rather than a defining part of what it means to be civilised. The arts are constantly called upon to justify their existence in commercial or social engineering terms not for their intrinsic worth. A film then in which the most compelling character advocates Art for Art's Sake  art as a sacred calling  flings a gauntlet in the face of a marketdriven antiintellectual antibeauty utilitarian society.

	schema:reviewBody "The performances are terrific with only the odd unusual line delivery partly due to english being many of the actors' second language and partly due to the fact that all of the main dancing characters are not professional actors at all but dancers  including Moira Shearer Australia's Robert Helpmann Leonida Massine and Ludmilla Tcherina  which fact considering they do marvellous jobs.The story's passion for ballet and music comes across to the audience and the story is compelling and fascinating due to the way it is told. Moira Shearer in a careerdefining role has a wonderful presence as the young dancer Victoria Page who becomes a star of the Lermontov Ballet Company and dances the lead in the ballet The Red Shoes. But Anton Walbrook is truly terrific as Lemontov. One particular moment i was very impressed with was when he begins to write a letter to Victoria and there is a closeup of his face and on his face we can read the emotions of his letter in a very subtle way. A marvellous scene. He has a germanic cold stare in this part which really brings it to life  the character of Lemontov is entirely in his eyes.The score is fantastic particularly the original ballet of the red shoes itself composed for the film by Brian Easdale. The film has such a wonderful look partly due to the fact that its production designer was a painter Hein Heckroth.But the element which really makes this movie great is how superbly it is directed. With glorious use of colour it is directed in a smooth impeccable style in the manner of Renoir  except here each frame poses not as a painting but as a moment from a ballet.A wonderful film to watch.".

This film has only strengthened my love and appreciation of it as I have grown older. I am not one to narrate a storyline as this film is great for more than and even despite it's story.The beautiful colour photography of the locations including London Paris and Monte Carlo will take you back to a fictional glamorous 1940's where everyone wore chic clothes and were perfectly mannered and groomed and make you wish you could visit there sometime.The music is a highlight for me. Brian Easdale has written such a detailed and nuanced lyrical score that does not overpower any moment in the film. There are moments where the music so perfectly conveys a character's very thought even though they are not saying a word and their face betrays not a hint of emotion.The story is a familiar one particularly today of ambition and the balance between career and personal life between a creative passion and a human one. And of course yes there is the ballet element. I have no interest in ballet and I love the film. It does play up the prima ballerinas and haughty choreographer stereotypes but as they are played by real ballet dancers I think it makes it all the funnier. Robert Helpmann and Leonide Massine are particularly hilarious and over the top so full of pathos and themselves.Anton Walbrook is the star of this film playing a Diaghilev type character and absolutely dominates any scene he is in. He is not bombastic in a showy hammy way. It is a more silent but deadly charismatic performance. It is a pity he did not receive an award for it. He is stern uncompromising cold and passionate and absolutely deadly. He is a gentleman tough guy.Moira Shearer and Marius Goring unfortunately do not fare so well in comparison but they are perfectly adequate in their roles and have some touching and funny moments. It is not altogether their fault the characters are a little bland especially in comparison to all the other larger than life characters they are paired with. Shearer really comes good as soon as she starts dancing.Which brings me to the fifteen minute ballet in the middle of the film. It is beautiful and brief. The dancing is fabulous it looks beautiful and the music is amazing. No one should fast forward this masterpiece of filmed ballet. It is cinematic not as filmed ballet usually is procenium stage bound. It is a modern ballet choreographed by Robert Helpmann and Leonide Massine and is a story perhaps even a mirror within and of the film.The Red Shoes combines every one of it's elements into a perfect whole. Some elements are a bit lacking the story is very simple and given another context a bit soap opera like but combined with the visuals the music the characters and the human comedytragedy it is a beautiful complete film and one that will keep improving with age.1010".

What a discovery!With its focus on the tangle of lives of a ballerina a composer and a dictatorial impresario who uses them both the story may have elements of a soap opera but it's a superior soap opera. What appealed to Shorter I'm sure is the film's depiction of the artists' creative process. It may have been done better elsewhere but I haven't seen it. Besides that it's beautifully directed beautifully photographed and sumptuous to look at throughout. The surreal title ballet is performed in a segment that is stunning and I'm not just using that word as a cliche.Anton Walbrook stands out as Lermontov leader of the ballet troupe. There are many reallife artists from the ballet world in the film including Leonide Massine and Robert Helpmann. Massine is particularly effective.Don't be put off by the notion that this is some effete art film it's high quality AND accessible.

For Powell and Pressburger it's no more than a diverting side issue but it's one of the things that especially interested me.  If you look at advertisements for ballet productions today you'll notice that the composer's name is NEVER printed  even if the ballet is called Cinderella' and the public has no way of working out whose score is being used.  It puts the composer in his place no doubt.  Yet musicians at the ballet are in the habit of thinking that they're the most important people there.I'm on their side.  I happen to loathe classical ballet as such.  Swan Lake' strikes me as a lovely score disfigured by people who insist on dancing to it.  Yet The Red Shoes' makes me put all of this aside.  Indeed it would be fair to say that I simply CAN'T dislike ballet while watching the film  which is especially odd considering some of the things it does to people.So yes if The Red Shoes' can have this effect on ME of all people it's surely one of the best films ever made.  I can't agree at all with the people who describe the film as melodrama' or camp'.  The latter charge I scarcely even understand.  The story is what it is and it's told at the most realistic and sincere level appropriate.  The characters who act theatrically NOT melodramatically are all creatures of the theatre and have not spent not just their days but their lives in Lermontov's troupe. If you want a more understated view of things then watch the musicians.  To put in a word for one of them Brian Easdale's source music is superb GOOD music of a kind that an English composer like Craster might well be expected to write.  It's clear that Easdale wrote Craster's compositions first and then constructed the rest of the score around them rather than vice versa.".

	schema:headline " A true masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "A great film speaks to each of us in a different way.  To me this more than a colourful piece of escapist entertainment this was  a glimpse into a world of magnificent color sumptious settings French Haute Couture the theatre music luxury hotels elegant opera houses chaffeured Rolls Royce cars travel to the South of France  in short everything that a child in the near bankrupt England in 1948 had never seen and could barely imagine. I was fascinated not only by the glimpse of an elitist life but of the time capsule which the film presented of a time and place that no longer exists as it was at that time.  The views of London in 1948 are similar to watching World War II in Color on the history channel.  When the ballet company travelled they took the train.  Rationing may still have existed back then and travellers could not take money out of the country except for a ridiculously inadequate amount therefore if you went abroad you had to know someone with whom you could stay.   I also found myself wondering how they got the money to make a technicolour film in 1947 when they began filming. Part of the film takes place in Monte Carlo only 20 years after the heyday of the famous Ballet Russe.  In fact the ballet company in the film is quite obviously based on the Diaghilev Company.  Former member Leonid Massine has a major part in the film and Marie Rambert has a cameo role. This is also a ballet film for those who do not really care for ballet.  The plot is simple  rising young ballerina falls in love with rising young composer and must choose between him and a career possessively controlled by the impressario  and acts as a frame for the ballet.   The film is as near perfection as it is possible to get and watching it in 2004 it does not seem to have dated at all.  Everyone especially Anton Walbrook is perfectly cast.  The script is witty and occasionally humorous.  The technicolour photography is superb especially capturing Moira Shearer's flaming red hair. The audio commentary on the DVD adds immensely to the enjoyment of the film which is one that can be watched over and over.  o understand how great this film really is try watching Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge travesty afterwards.".

	onyx:emotionText "A great film speaks to each of us in a different way.  To me this more than a colourful piece of escapist entertainment this was  a glimpse into a world of magnificent color sumptious settings French Haute Couture the theatre music luxury hotels elegant opera houses chaffeured Rolls Royce cars travel to the South of France  in short everything that a child in the near bankrupt England in 1948 had never seen and could barely imagine. I was fascinated not only by the glimpse of an elitist life but of the time capsule which the film presented of a time and place that no longer exists as it was at that time.  The views of London in 1948 are similar to watching World War II in Color on the history channel.  When the ballet company travelled they took the train.  Rationing may still have existed back then and travellers could not take money out of the country except for a ridiculously inadequate amount therefore if you went abroad you had to know someone with whom you could stay.

At breakfast the next morning Lermontov also meets an inspiring young composer by the name of Julian Craster Marius Goring and he too is invited to join the company. The two talented youngsters begin to work their way up through the company ranks as a romance blossoms between them. There are tough decisions to be made however when it comes to a choice between ambition and love.I bought The Red Shoes of BluRay about three or four years ago after hearing Martin Scorsese say it was one of his favourite films. Now I've finally seen it I can see why someone would enjoy it on an artistic and technical level but it left me feeling very bored.The first thing to strike me about the film was its wonderful use of colour. Everything is so bright and vivid and it's incredibly striking. Although Technicolor had been invented in 1916 it wasn't widely used in the film industry until the 1940s. After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs studios began to think of the medium as the future. The use of colour in The Red Shoes is stunning and is definitely one of the highlights of the film for me. I wondered if the colour was made to be so bright and vivid because the directors were working in a relatively new and unexplored medium just as today 3D films seem to make an extra effort to have things poking out of the screen at the audience. Unlike 3D which is in my view rarely if ever improves a film the colour in The Red Shoes most definitely enhances the viewing experience.The plot revolves around a story within a story with Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tail The Red Shoes being performed inside the film. I was never really interested in the characters and I think this is because the film was very predictable. I was always one step ahead able to anticipate what was coming next. This was true even of the shocking ending which I worked out just a couple of minutes earlier. This isn't a film with twists or surprises. Even so I thought that the ending was done very well and I loved the thirty seconds on stage after the 'surprise'. I thought it was beautiful and moving. One of the problems I had with the film was my indifference to ballet. I've tried to enjoy it a couple of times when I've been to see ballet and although I have huge admiration for the ability of the dancers I can't help but find it confusing and dull. I'd love to be able to say I can follow a ballet but I just can't. As about a third of the film is purely dancing I often found my mind wandering to other things.Although I'm no ballet fan I did find the performance of The Red Shoes ballet sometimes interesting. The fairy tail element peaked my interest a little and it felt almost surrealist at times. I was reminded of Disney's Fantasia at various moments. The prolonged dance scene half way through was also very well edited. The costumes' were also well designed and the music although not to my taste was excellent. Occasionally the film was overacted perhaps in part due to the cast been predominantly ballerinas first actors second. I let this go slightly as a lot of the cast were working in their second or third language. Both leads were very good and Anton Walbrook stood out as the charismatic but vicious impresario. Another thing I liked was to see London's Covent Garden as it was in the 1940s. It's an area I've been though many times and looks very different today. The same is true of Paris and Monte Carlo which are also interesting to see over sixty years ago.For me The Red Shoes is a lot like ballet itself. It is admirable and I wanted to enjoy it but I often felt bored and kind of couldn't wait for it to be over.www.attheback.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " More than the other films it caught on with audiences and many of us have fallen madly in love with it and treasured it for life.";
	schema:reviewBody "The team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger direct and write one of the great ballet melodramas of all time. Hans Christian Andersen's tragic fairy tale serves as the outline for a film about a backstage love story. The film's core relationship between the impresario and dancer was a take on the one between Diaghilev and Nijinsky. It's the kind of dance film that can appeal to a wide audience not just balletomane devotees.Originally Emeric Pressburger's story was commissioned by producer Alexander Korda for his wifestar Merle Oberon Oscar nominated for Wuthering Heights in 1939. One problem was Oberon could not dance. Pressburger then bought the story back and decided to codirect it with partner Michael Powell with Moira Shearer a pro dancer who could also act in the lead. Redhaired Shearer was then a ballerina at Sadler's Wells. In the film she is joined by such skillful dancers as Lonide Massine Ludmilla Tchrina and Robert Helpmann who also worked on the choreography.It begins when a talented but impoverished musical composer Julian Craster Goring attends a London performance of the Lermontov Ballet Company and recognizes his own score being performed without his authorization. Complaining to ballet impresario Boris Lermontov Walbrook  who gives the films best performance things get resolved when the composer is hired to compose the score for his next work  a ballet version of The Red Shoes. It's based on Hans Christian Anderson's story about a pair of magical shoes that permit their wearer to magically dance without ever stopping. The impresario also hires a gifted sweet young flaming redhaired dancer Victoria Page Moira Shearer the Sadler's Wells ballerina's debut as an actress to perform in the ballet.The centerpiece of the film is a stunning 20 minute ballet sequence where we see The Red Shoes performed first on traditional stages but then on increasingly expressionistic and fanciful sets until it's clear that the brilliant dance and music have taken the performance away from anything approaching reality onto a plane of pure art where such things as the laws of physics and time and space don't seem to apply. It's a heartbreaking and wonderful experience.

	onyx:emotionText "The team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger direct and write one of the great ballet melodramas of all time. Hans Christian Andersen's tragic fairy tale serves as the outline for a film about a backstage love story. The film's core relationship between the impresario and dancer was a take on the one between Diaghilev and Nijinsky. It's the kind of dance film that can appeal to a wide audience not just balletomane devotees.Originally Emeric Pressburger's story was commissioned by producer Alexander Korda for his wifestar Merle Oberon Oscar nominated for Wuthering Heights in 1939. One problem was Oberon could not dance. Pressburger then bought the story back and decided to codirect it with partner Michael Powell with Moira Shearer a pro dancer who could also act in the lead. Redhaired Shearer was then a ballerina at Sadler's Wells. In the film she is joined by such skillful dancers as Lonide Massine Ludmilla Tchrina and Robert Helpmann who also worked on the choreography.It begins when a talented but impoverished musical composer Julian Craster Goring attends a London performance of the Lermontov Ballet Company and recognizes his own score being performed without his authorization. Complaining to ballet impresario Boris Lermontov Walbrook  who gives the films best performance things get resolved when the composer is hired to compose the score for his next work  a ballet version of The Red Shoes. It's based on Hans Christian Anderson's story about a pair of magical shoes that permit their wearer to magically dance without ever stopping. The impresario also hires a gifted sweet young flaming redhaired dancer Victoria Page Moira Shearer the Sadler's Wells ballerina's debut as an actress to perform in the ballet.The centerpiece of the film is a stunning 20 minute ballet sequence where we see The Red Shoes performed first on traditional stages but then on increasingly expressionistic and fanciful sets until it's clear that the brilliant dance and music have taken the performance away from anything approaching reality onto a plane of pure art where such things as the laws of physics and time and space don't seem to apply. It's a heartbreaking and wonderful experience. Leonide Massine who plays the choreographer and who created the unforgettable character of the Shoemaker within the ballet is considered to be one of the greatest choreographers in the Western World creating over 50 ballets. It is he not Moira Shearer who makes the ballet sequence so entrancing and I can't say that I traditionally like ballet. You just can't take your eyes off him.

But after seeing the meagre amount of comments this film has received it's time to try.The Red Shoes is one of the most exquisite pieces of art I have ever seen every shot is tightly composed brimming with colour and texture there's a real feel of the hustle and bustle of the everyday world these characters inhabit. But unlike other Powell  Pressburger films The Red Shoes is very weak when it comes to characters. As many have pointed out there aren't really any likable characters most are either too meek or just not emphasized enough to get a real connection with them. No this should have been first and foremost a ballet film that sadly only features one real dance sequence the haunting production of the titular Ballet of the Red Shoes. The performances are good enough with all three principals Anton Walbrook Marius Goring and Moira Shearer delivering but the script just doesn't fit them. However the ideas of the film are so timeless that you can't help feel for all of them at the tragic conclusion. So I give The Red Shoes a rating of 810 mainly for the Red Shoes sequence and Jack Cardiff's cinematography. This is a classic that should be discovered by every generation.".

She is the subject of the film and also the creator of the show within the show. She is the focus of the motion around her and the generator of motion which illuminates all. The film can be seen as her own fairytale beginning in her dream with her in princess garb going up that marvelous stairway. And she is absolutely enchanting until the end where she has to act and can't quite pull it off. But she is photographed as a person with a loving lens.And this film is deeply deeply selfreferential. I think it springs from the similarly structured French Children of Paradise' of a couple years prior. The initial backstage scenes are strikingly similar as well. Who's in charge?' The important similarities are the focus for multiple control over a girl the nesting of performance within the performance and the mixing of the creation of the film with the creation of the performances displayed. The Hungarian producer has a surrogate in the impresario played by a Hungarian the director in the composer. The girl is an actress a character as dancer and the character within the dance. All three are cursed by the strength of the story to take over the reality in which it is placed. I love this stuff.But there's more this is the first time to my knowledge where the camera selfconsciously enters the action changes reality even creates new frames of reality The camera dances. The camera allows the dancer and magical shoes to create their own realities. The camera is never a static audience even in the framing sections that come before and after the ballet. This camera in this film changed our visual imagination forever.And it has the best DVD extras I have ever seen. The Jeremy IronsHumbert connection is delicious.Ted's Evaluation  4 of 4 Every visually literate person should experience this.".

Anton Walbrook is mesmerizing as Lermontov and we expect him to win in the end although his victory is shortlived.

Suddenly inexplicably I saw beauty where I'd never seen it before. I consider 'The Red Shoes 1948' the affirmation of this revelation. The child of writingdirecting team Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger under the banner of The Archers the film showcases the pair's talent for imbuing their work with lush colours warmth and personality displaying a faculty for capturing atmosphere that is unmatched then or since.'The Red Shoes' revolves around the production of a stage adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's eponymous fairytale in which a ballet dancer receives a pair of cursed red shoes that keep her dancing until the day she dies. However rather than being a simple story of success in show business the behindthescenes events are themselves a loose variation on Andersen's fairytale. When asked what she wants from life young British ballerina Victoria Page Moira Shearer replies I want to dance. Just as Mephisto offered Faust everything he wanted at the cost of everything he held dear Boris Lermontov Anton Walbrook of 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp 1943' offers Victoria immortality in the art of ballet but at the expense of life love and happiness. Finally torn between her two great loves  to her husband Julian Marius Goring and to ballet  she chooses to abandon both throwing herself in front of a train as though compelled to do so by the red dancing shoes that had so overwhelmingly commanded her life.As in most PowellPressburger collaborations it's not adequate to merely praise the codirectors. Hein Heckroth's costumes Arthur Lawson's art direction Jack Cardiff's lush cinematography Brian Easdale's musical score all are utterly masterful the fruits of a alliance in which every crew member understood perfectly what was required of them. The film's incredible centrepiece is a twenty minute balletic interlude in which the audience is shown the stage production itself perhaps the most breathtaking and purely cinematic musical sequence I've ever seen. As Victoria Page is swept up in the fantasy of her role she is inundated by surreal visions of Faustian tragedy and horror that deliberately recall F.W. Murnau's 1926 film. In Hollywood 'The Red Shoes' proved hugely influential noticeably inspiring the likes of Stanley Donen and Vincente Minnelli 'An American in Paris 1951' featured a similar if not so comfortably integrated ballet interlude and 'The Band Wagon 1953' feels like a sunny featurelength rebuttal to the tragedy inherent in The Archers' film.".

Finally torn between her two great loves  to her husband Julian Marius Goring and to ballet  she chooses to abandon both throwing herself in front of a train as though compelled to do so by the red dancing shoes that had so overwhelmingly commanded her life.As in most PowellPressburger collaborations it's not adequate to merely praise the codirectors. Hein Heckroth's costumes Arthur Lawson's art direction Jack Cardiff's lush cinematography Brian Easdale's musical score all are utterly masterful the fruits of a alliance in which every crew member understood perfectly what was required of them. The film's incredible centrepiece is a twenty minute balletic interlude in which the audience is shown the stage production itself perhaps the most breathtaking and purely cinematic musical sequence I've ever seen. As Victoria Page is swept up in the fantasy of her role she is inundated by surreal visions of Faustian tragedy and horror that deliberately recall F.W. Murnau's 1926 film. In Hollywood 'The Red Shoes' proved hugely influential noticeably inspiring the likes of Stanley Donen and Vincente Minnelli 'An American in Paris 1951' featured a similar if not so comfortably integrated ballet interlude and 'The Band Wagon 1953' feels like a sunny featurelength rebuttal to the tragedy inherent in The Archers' film.";

After announcing she is engaged to the company a dancer notices Boris has left and says to herself he is a cruel man. We then cut to a wide shot of Boris alone in a large dark room framed by a moonlit window. It is a stunning moment to behold. The performances are for the most part subdued and coldbut match the tone and subject of the text enough that they are not a distraction. I particularly thought Walbrook who played the producer nailed a few of his more difficult scenes. The only real problem I had with the script was the ending which felt forced and not truthful to the character of Victoria. Definitely a must for any die hard fans of lavish technicolor productions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adapted form Sunil Ganguly's story the film zooms in on the vagaries and vicissitudes of the then bourgeoisie and their disillusionment with their state of affairs. A motley quartet ventures into the woods of Palamau to spend some days in order to extricate themselves from the trammels of their ordered social and city life. Culled from the various strata in the middle class the four characters reflect completely different attitudes bound by a thread of friendship. 'Breaking the rules' they drop anchor at a government forest bungalow without the required permission consequently browbeating and finally bribing the chowkidar putting his job at stake. They remain unshaven exchange diatribes at a local arrack shop and indulge in a drunken twist causing problem to vehicles. Their behaviour with and indifference frequently found among the bourgeois people of the lower orders of the society and their suffering quite often verging on brutality may make them for the time being unlikeable but their innocent and ignorant selfesteem doing them in at last draws back our sympathy once again. Ashim as Soumitra Chatterji loses his selfconfidence finally after the memory game Sanjoy as Subhendu Chatterji finds himself hollow as a man in front of a seductive Jaya Hari himself mislays his wallet but beats the local boy Lakhai which rebounds on him at last Shekhar as Rabi Ghosh is only the man who escapes much of the humiliation because of his hilarious nature.Their unexpected spotting one morning of two ladies of their social stratum within the tribal village brings them back somewhat to their superficial selves and they try to meet them in person and try their own hands at flirting. Though a forging of relationships is on the way under the hammerblows of a set of consecutive meetings between the opposite sexes yet each of the conceited quartet is blown to bits as the women come up trumps. Each of the quartet is chastened in his own way near the end of the film and the women winners in the beginning appear to be pale gloomy and their voices plangent beneath their jocund exterior and mellifluous chatter and pithy elicitation.Like in most of Ray's films here also the characters smile but they find it rather painful to laugh. Though it is a matter of pity that a film of this momentousness received a lukewarm response form the native audience and critics when it was screened yet it then was and still is a surefire narration of epic dimensions and the film's aura doesn't seem to dim even though it is watched over and over again. Unfortunately they who search for a single and simple theme in a film like this will not be able to comprehend herein the interplay of various themes.

	onyx:emotionText "Adapted form Sunil Ganguly's story the film zooms in on the vagaries and vicissitudes of the then bourgeoisie and their disillusionment with their state of affairs. A motley quartet ventures into the woods of Palamau to spend some days in order to extricate themselves from the trammels of their ordered social and city life. Culled from the various strata in the middle class the four characters reflect completely different attitudes bound by a thread of friendship. 'Breaking the rules' they drop anchor at a government forest bungalow without the required permission consequently browbeating and finally bribing the chowkidar putting his job at stake. They remain unshaven exchange diatribes at a local arrack shop and indulge in a drunken twist causing problem to vehicles. Their behaviour with and indifference frequently found among the bourgeois people of the lower orders of the society and their suffering quite often verging on brutality may make them for the time being unlikeable but their innocent and ignorant selfesteem doing them in at last draws back our sympathy once again. Ashim as Soumitra Chatterji loses his selfconfidence finally after the memory game Sanjoy as Subhendu Chatterji finds himself hollow as a man in front of a seductive Jaya Hari himself mislays his wallet but beats the local boy Lakhai which rebounds on him at last Shekhar as Rabi Ghosh is only the man who escapes much of the humiliation because of his hilarious nature.Their unexpected spotting one morning of two ladies of their social stratum within the tribal village brings them back somewhat to their superficial selves and they try to meet them in person and try their own hands at flirting. Though a forging of relationships is on the way under the hammerblows of a set of consecutive meetings between the opposite sexes yet each of the conceited quartet is blown to bits as the women come up trumps. Each of the quartet is chastened in his own way near the end of the film and the women winners in the beginning appear to be pale gloomy and their voices plangent beneath their jocund exterior and mellifluous chatter and pithy elicitation.Like in most of Ray's films here also the characters smile but they find it rather painful to laugh. Though it is a matter of pity that a film of this momentousness received a lukewarm response form the native audience and critics when it was screened yet it then was and still is a surefire narration of epic dimensions and the film's aura doesn't seem to dim even though it is watched over and over again. Unfortunately they who search for a single and simple theme in a film like this will not be able to comprehend herein the interplay of various themes. Ray once said regretfully in a Sight  Sound interview The film is about so many things that's the trouble. People want just one theme which they can hold in their hands.

To the casual viewer it might seem like the escapades of four middle class gentlemen when they go out of their constrictive surroundings into the wilderness and meet three women. However a rigorous viewing will expose different layers some surprising and others not so surprising. With flawless and fluid direction Ray tells a story of love lost confidence regained inhibitions of a conservative society blown away overwhelming sadness and the joy and freedom of coming close to nature. Even though it is quite an old film it speaks of the human nature and its eternal characteristics so beautifully that it does not seem dated at all which is the mark of a classic.

They are friends but each coming from a separate milieu and with a different temperament Ashim Soumitra Chatterjee the lead in many of Ray's films a suave and successful executive is the unofficial leader. The neat and shy Sunjoy is a conventional penpusher tied to the mores of middleclass existence. Hari a cricketer is short tempered and impulsive while an unemployed Shekhar is the joker of the group. They halt en route at a vacant government guest house where they intend to spend a few days. The film chronicles this interval giving us an insight into the character of these men and the interaction they have with other people often provoking them into reflection or change.We get an insight into their personalities in the initial period of their holiday their sense of needing to break convention to feel some freedom from their daily routine  they bribe the caretaker to assign the guest room to them refrain from shaving launch drunken diatribes at the local arrack shopthe hedonistic lifestyle in short. These scenes are presented with a wholly observant attitude never persuading the audience to either like or dislike the characters.Things take a big turn when they run into a couple of charming ladies living at a nearby bungalow. Invited by the surprisingly trustful and hospitable patriarch of the house they meet the lovely enigmatic Aparna Sharmila Tagore and her cheerful but widowed sisterinlaw Jaya. This part of the film is a beautiful study of the mental processes of malefemale relationships in modern society The rituals of socially acceptable cordial behavior mixed with the lowkey sensuality and courtship that occurs at the outset of growing acquaintance with the opposite sex. Both Aparna and Jaya are warmnatured confident and sophisticated women and one well identifies with the sense of yearning mixed with hesitation that develops within the men when they interact with them. In the while Hari gets passionately involved with a young tribal woman Duli Simi Garewal of all people.The last phase of the film is when their interactions have proceeded just beyond the preliminary stage. Ashim learns enough about Aparna for him to regard her as more than one of the city women he meets at so many parties and observes aspects of her nature that lead him to feel guilt for his superficial selforiented thinking. Sunjoy who grows increasingly comfortable in the company of Jaya gets a jarring moment and Hari's heated pursuit of Duli ends in a rude blow. But this is not to say that the film ends on a dark notenot at all. Life for our characters goes onand who knows what the future will bring? ADR's main strength is the completely natural way it presents its characters and situations. We've seen courtship rituals and the associated comedy thousands of times on filma shipload of Bollywood films in the gaudily colored 60's and the 90's onward was devoted to increasingly bizarre and tasteless depictions of social romantic behavior. But you need to see a film like this to appreciate really how intricate and touchingly fragile the whole ritual can be and how the anticipation of the manwoman relationship relates to and affects the existing behavior and thought process of the persons involved. It takes the deftness of touch of a Ray to show it to us in this light.Which brings me to the rare sour note in my experience of ADR The 'transformation scene' of Jaya the details of which I will not spill for the benefit of those that have not yet seen the film. I understand that Ray wanted to force some kind of a confrontation of the issue of Jaya being a widow and the social constraints upon her but the way he has done it appears to me as very contrived and gauche and a huge letdown given the immense easygoing charm of Kaberi Bose's performance up to that point.On a slighter note Simi Garewal's hilariously accented Bengali makes her tribal character a hard act to digest.But on the whole ADR is a terrific movie of its type leisurely but always focused personal but never selfindulgent.".

The sexual chemistry the underlying themes such as class differentiation poverty loneliness and love are displayed with a skillful quietness. His fluid direction and the actors performances draws the viewer into this little forest of quiet enigma. It is no surprise that Ray has worked with the best actors and 'Aranyer Din Ratri' is no different in that respect. The two Chatterjees Ghosh and Bhanja are superb. It really felt as though we were watching four close friends. Garewal provides some comic relief. She may be an unusual choice for Duli but she pulls it off quite well. Sharmila Tagore excellently downplays the part of Aparna. Ray's films have a timeless quality as they never feel outdated. Needless to say the terrific 'Aranyer Din Ratri' is one such movie.".

Four friends  all young men from Calcutta go into a forest and plan to stay in a rest house there while aspiring to have sexual fun with tribal women who are presumed to be liberal in such matters. Of course this sort of plot is not standard territory for the said director but even with this unlikely template Ray directs his masterly rays of perspective to illumine the hinterlands and give larger wings to a fledgling premise.Though it is not set in the city or even a village the film is a composite shot of civilization in decline. But in Ray's world there is always hope a calm sense of being obliged to emerge from the ruins and in A.D.R we also see a beautiful example of strong but tranquil feminism.This latter aspect emerges in the form of Sharmila Tagore who registers a great performance in this movie. In Ghare Baire Ray made Victor Banerjee essay a model man and here he has Sharmila Tagore giving us a portrait of the model woman. Kohllined beautifully curving eyes luxuriant hair coiffed into a bouffant and a softly contoured figure clothed in sari all set off a face that can essay feminine mystique as smoothly as it can show childlike amusement. Aparna Tagore it is steadily revealed is gifted intellectually bears the weight of the past nurtures a humane mind and yet sequesters all these facets beneath a regally controlled visage that can hint at displeasure as beautifully as it can sport a smile.Technically too this is an accomplished film with superior camerawork by Soumendu Roy. There is a famous static shot in which the lens stands just outside the car window and looks inside through the car compartment and past the other window into the background 4 visual planes hold four different people all sporting a range of interesting expressions and emotional dynamics. The other memorable sequence is the Memory Game wherein all the players are seated in a circle and the lens flicks from one face to another as they play the game.Starting with this script countless other storytellers might have produced a work of dissipated effect but Satyajit Ray makes fine use of the novel by Sunil Gangopadhyay to present not just a sylvan jaunt enjoyed by four young men but also an elegantly presented humanist tapestry.

	schema:headline " Holiday spree by average bengali men";
	schema:reviewBody "Aranya DinRatri the days  nights spent in remote forest area Story of 4 bengali males shown beautifully by Director Mr. Satyajit Ray ! 4 friends take a break  3 of them are average looking  tall and one is short and below average to look at. They do not make proper arrangements  just barge into a Goernment Guest House and bribe the caretaker to let them in by giving him some money. The poor care taker has an ailing wife so since he could not go out to buy stuff for them the porter boy agrees to buy  carry food stuff for them.A typical life style of average common men looser men rather is shown here  how they just crib about having to butter the boss and please him by attending late night parties boozing and spending time with cheap rich girls with artificial expressions and revealing outfits.One the friends was ditched lately by an educated girl played by Aparna Sen  who was fashion conscious wore wigs to look more seducing as well as very intelligent  observant who had the sense to smell tricky  foolish people from a distance. She had written a 5 paged letter to her boyfriend who in return could barely write half a page  showing that he was not very sound as far as 'literacy in romanticism' was concerned. This the girl understood and washed her hands off the idiot ! very well done I would say  the fact that her decision was absolutely right is seen later as the movie proceeds  when the same fellow indulges in intercourse with a 'dirty smelly ugly looking maid servant category drunkard woman he meets in the forest remote area !!He does IT with her on open ground in the forest on the thorny weeds !!  so utterly frustrated and sex starved  just anyone would do for such men  therefore his girlfriend definitely made the right decision to ditch him.A looser man in all respect.Second fellow was a bit intellectual and adventurous  well read  in the game of remembering names' he said Shakespeare and Sharmila Tagore  a lady he meets there says Cleopatra  in fact each one took the name of the historical literary figure he  she either hero worshipsidentifies  or admires in one way or the other. He meets this quiet  attractive lady and gets drawn towards her  she had a traumatic childhood  the reason of her quietitude  Mother had died of fire in front of her and elder brother had committed suicide !Another looser who knows it all but cannot do anything about it.Third fellow was decent  playing it safe kinds  the widowed sisterinlaw of sharmila tries to seduce him missing her husband I guess  had said Rabindranath Tagore in the game of 'Remembering names' by the way. A decent man who could change if he wanted to  looser or winner depended on him.Fourth fellow  happy go lucky  the fact that he was ugly  short was taken very lightly by him  had no attitude problems  couldn't have any in fact  compensating on his below average looks  so he turned comical and made things appear funny. A very common Bengali man category since the average height of Bengali men is around 5'5 and also Bengali men are dark and not very good looking  so they make fun of everything and anything and spend time making merry  with or without any reason.".

	onyx:emotionText "Aranya DinRatri the days  nights spent in remote forest area Story of 4 bengali males shown beautifully by Director Mr. Satyajit Ray ! 4 friends take a break  3 of them are average looking  tall and one is short and below average to look at. They do not make proper arrangements  just barge into a Goernment Guest House and bribe the caretaker to let them in by giving him some money. The poor care taker has an ailing wife so since he could not go out to buy stuff for them the porter boy agrees to buy  carry food stuff for them.A typical life style of average common men looser men rather is shown here  how they just crib about having to butter the boss and please him by attending late night parties boozing and spending time with cheap rich girls with artificial expressions and revealing outfits.One the friends was ditched lately by an educated girl played by Aparna Sen  who was fashion conscious wore wigs to look more seducing as well as very intelligent  observant who had the sense to smell tricky  foolish people from a distance. She had written a 5 paged letter to her boyfriend who in return could barely write half a page  showing that he was not very sound as far as 'literacy in romanticism' was concerned. This the girl understood and washed her hands off the idiot ! very well done I would say  the fact that her decision was absolutely right is seen later as the movie proceeds  when the same fellow indulges in intercourse with a 'dirty smelly ugly looking maid servant category drunkard woman he meets in the forest remote area !!He does IT with her on open ground in the forest on the thorny weeds !!  so utterly frustrated and sex starved  just anyone would do for such men  therefore his girlfriend definitely made the right decision to ditch him.A looser man in all respect.Second fellow was a bit intellectual and adventurous  well read  in the game of remembering names' he said Shakespeare and Sharmila Tagore  a lady he meets there says Cleopatra  in fact each one took the name of the historical literary figure he  she either hero worshipsidentifies  or admires in one way or the other. He meets this quiet  attractive lady and gets drawn towards her  she had a traumatic childhood  the reason of her quietitude  Mother had died of fire in front of her and elder brother had committed suicide !Another looser who knows it all but cannot do anything about it.Third fellow was decent  playing it safe kinds  the widowed sisterinlaw of sharmila tries to seduce him missing her husband I guess  had said Rabindranath Tagore in the game of 'Remembering names' by the way. A decent man who could change if he wanted to  looser or winner depended on him.Fourth fellow  happy go lucky  the fact that he was ugly  short was taken very lightly by him  had no attitude problems  couldn't have any in fact  compensating on his below average looks  so he turned comical and made things appear funny. A very common Bengali man category since the average height of Bengali men is around 5'5 and also Bengali men are dark and not very good looking  so they make fun of everything and anything and spend time making merry  with or without any reason.";

That's the spirit and effect beholds one after watching this movie. The film was made in an era where the 34 friends geared up for a bumpy funride weren't invented. Thought it blended the freshness of youth and the complex relative relations between them and their surroundings. Here Ray masterfully achieved the characterizations as there are several to notice or even follow. Ashim the main male of this story rapidly changes his reactions as the story rolls. On the other hand Shekhar played by Rabi Ghosh is the only caste for the uniqueness and some comic relief His character represents the rapidly decreasing moral thoughts as the environment changed. The treatment for this kind of story needs a constant vigilance and Ray did it. Finally the spot they hung up to  Palamou was a treat for the eyes as well as the key element. Originality of these characters only burst out into the wild. Here I want to quote Ashim 'Rag koris na Kolkata r baire ele lokeder boyas ta kome jay' Don't mind people feel younger when they goes out from Kolkata... It's really a top notch yet under praised!!! 9 out of 10.".

My first difficulty was to associate the names of the characters performed by the gorgeous actresses with their faces. I repeated the first chapters three times to make this association. When Jiwon meets her mother in the end unraveling the mystery I repeated three or four times to clarify the twist. If I were in the movie theater I would not have the chance of rewinding and understanding the plot.

What Jiwon doesn't realize is that her past self was a nasty rich bitch who treated those less fortunate from a financial standpoint like dirt while her rat pack would join in on the festivities of name calling among other cruelties. Along with her boyfriend Jiwon will indeed seek out the truth behind the deaths of her former friends and who is behind them. Soon the complete mystery tucked away in her subconscious will reveal a horrifying drowning that perhaps shapes what has been taking place to her former school chums. Each of Jiwon's high school friends die by drowning shortly after the ghost appears to them in a vulnerable state unable to find help from their menacing visitor.As you've read throughout the user comment section already The Ghost is stylishly directed and rather well acted. The film looks great and the cast doesn't disappoint. There are even a few scares here and there..but it's all rather familiar. The twist at the end saves this film I believe from completely feeling been there done that. It's a mindboggling doozy of an ending I'll tell you where someone isn't who they appear to be..it's the case of identity crisis where jealousy can drive the motivations of a castaway so longing to have the life of the one they envy. It's the kind of twist that takes you right back through what you just have seen putting a new light on the story and central character. The film is designed like The Grudge as a spook film so there isn't any graphic violence the emphasis is on creeping the audience not bloodletting. The ghost as can probably be pictured in the minds of those who have seen numerous Asian horror flicks is a girl with long black hair which splits to reveal this discolored eyeball that peers at a potential victim. When her hands reach out and her feet walk across the floor water is shown soaking off foretelling to the viewer this restless spirit's fate. I felt the director skillfully crafts the story supplying the memories of a past conveying to us just the kind of loathsome person Jiwon was and how Siun was treated by her. This backstory is supplemented as the story comes to the obvious confrontation between Jiwon and the ghost. I think one can rightfully criticize how similar this film feels to others that have came before it but at least we get a back story into their lives and what motivates the horrors to those who kept a specific secret one fateful day.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tartan's new release of Ryeong A.k.a. The Ghost is not one of their better releases. In fact I found The Ghost to be one of the worst Asian ghost stories I've seen in awhile. This is not to say that Ghost is necessarily a bad film it just doesn't offer anything new to jaded horror viewers and seems like a hodgepodge of several prior successful Asian horror films Chiefly The Ring JuOn Shutter and Dark Water.The Ghost tells the story of JiWon a young student who is afflicted with amnesia. She is completely unaware of her prior life including an incident which sets up the haunting of JiWon by a longhaired ghost girl. As her friends start to die off she decides to investigate the event that led to the deaths of her friends. Peeling back the layers of her subconscious she slowly unravels clues to her past which inevitably lead to a giant plottwist which I saw coming at about 20 minutes into the film.If it sounds like something you've seen before that's because it is. The Ghost adds nothing new to the KHorror genre and heavily borrows Or steals from past K and JHorror successes. In fact even some of the score was lifted from The Shutter not to mention the plot! The sad thing is that the film isn't all that bad. The Ghost is somewhat creepy there are some decent scares the pacing is good and the story is decent. But to those of us familiar with Asia Horror it's just more of the same. If The Ghost had been made before such films as The Ring or Dark Water it would probably be regarded as a great entry into the KHorror genre. Alas it was made after and offers nothing new but retreads of familiar territory.If your a fan of KHorror and are looking for something to pass time until the next great Horror flick comes out or if you like to collect KHorror than check it out. If your the occasional Asian horror flick viewer save your time. You've seen it all before.My Rating 4.5 out of 10. The Ghost delivers nothing that I hadn't seen before. It's predictable and forgettable.".

If your the occasional Asian horror flick viewer save your time. You've seen it all before.My Rating 4.5 out of 10. The Ghost delivers nothing that I hadn't seen before. It's predictable and forgettable.";

I don't want to spoil the movie for you because it's worth watching but I'll briefly explain it. Its about a girl called JiWon who for some reason has suffered from amnesia you will find out why later in the film. She finds out three people she somehow knows are being killed off by an unforgiving ghost. But you will have to carefully watch any flashbacks that are shown during the movieto fully understand it.

I only rate it behind A Tale of Two Sisters which was more original with better cinematography and more defined characters. ATOTS was more a horrorsuspensethriller though while Ryeong is definitely dealing with the supernatural idea. Don't expect to be scared shtless or anything though. There's nothing really new here. A definite Ring rip with a little bit of Dark Water mixed in. Movie producers must really move beyond the long hair covering face wet female ghost idea. It's getting pretty played out. Seen one seen them all. The production is good though with a story that's somewhat intriguing keeping you guessing about what's going on until the finale. The end I was actually little surprised but the idea has been used before an influence I believe from ATOTS and such where there's the revelation. Overall worth watching but it won't leave you sleeping with the lights on.".

The ghost looked like a mixture of Sadako from Ring and Kayako JuOn and the water element has been used before in Ring and Dark Water. The director does manage to conjure up some atmosphere and an interesting enough story to keep the movie going but it's not enough to disguise the many stolen elements and scenes! The acting wasn't anything spectacular and the score sounded very familiar to The Grudge's. The ending was a surprise and a good one at that. It caught me unaware and it did make me think a bit after. Overall it seems the good and the bad outweighed each other and the movie for me was just average. Atmospheric and interesting enough to keep me watching but too unoriginal for my liking.25".

One of the best parts is the fact that there are so many supernatural encounters that the film is seemingly built around them. It starts off with a bang as the girls playing with an Ouija board is the usuallycreepy game and is mixed nicely with the cutaways to the restless sleep which is a perfect suspensebuilder which then segues beautifully into the twist and the final kitchen attack which is a stellar showstopping moment. A similar scene in a darkroom is almost as good with the picturescare serving nicely to start the proceedings the suddenlyblackened room lit only with a cigarettelighter is ultimately creepy and the ghost appearing out of nowhere is just utterly spectacular and ranks as another highlight. Other standout scenes include the freakout in the movie theater to a fantastic dream sequence where they play hideandseek with a ghost in a fogcovered cemetery along with a great scene where there's seemingly endless flashes of nightmareish faces appearing out of nowhere and the encounter at the waterfall that sets up the wonderful twist at the finale which is completely unexpected and definitely works well to send the film out on a high the fact that they're so much fun is a plus for the film in any regard. Also really fun is the several flashbacks used to spell out everything. The two main ones are the best as the first one is where we initially learn what she was like to the girl in the past with the group of friends bullying the girl to how they singled her out to be picked on. The second flashback that shows how they eventually grew apart after the difference in their social stature makes for a great contrast to her current state and helps sell this one even further. The last plus for the film is the fact that the ghost here manages to offer up a really fun and unique killing method that allows for more creepiness to come out of the film as well. These here are what work for the film as there wasn't a whole lot here that wasn't worthwhile. One of the few problems is the film's rather slow beginning due to several relatively small issues. One of those is the fact that the scares presented here from the hideandseek game to the encounters in the swimming pool are really just too short to mean anything coming so rapidly that it's hard to take them in as they're done without ever doing anything about it. The last big flaw to this one is the fact that the middle segments are so slowlypaced that outside of the ghost's actions it hardly has anything worthwhile. First up is the fact that the amnesia angle is dragged out way too long to really mean much of anything taking up the entire middle portion of the film and not at all doing much to keep the momentum going since the film takes an eternity to spell out what really happened. It also doesn't help much that an explanation for their behavior toward the girl is beyond lame and really shouldn't have been the cause when there are far more believable ones out there. These here are the film's few problems.Rated R Language and Violence.".

The amnesia is also an interesting gimmick since it potentially allows the protagonist to be guilty of something while still allowing sympathy for the character because she doesn't even know what she might have done and the amnesia makes her a new person. The amnesia itself naturally ties into the twist which although clever leaves all kinds of questions.

	schema:reviewBody "Dead Friend keeps the established formula of the ever popular Ringu type Asian Horror movie intact. Sadly it doesn't really offer anything particularly new to those already familiar with this type of film. The plot partially revolves around a group of friends who are one by one haunted and killed by a vengeful ghost. But the main part of the film is focused around a traumatized girl who is trying to recover parts of her lost memory. At some point both stories intervene with each other and as most horrors of this type the viewer will experience the same type of plot devices seen before. Here is in fact the disappointing part Dead Friend had a really good opportunity of elevating above the typical Ahorror movie by creating a much more personal and character centric film. That delves deep in around themes such as friendship and redemption. A good example of the way that could have been done is if the movie ended with the revelation at the lake. If so had happened the main character would have found herself transgressed into a much more grown and mature person who took responsibility for her actions. Sadly as it is that is not the choice of the filmmaker as in a few minutes later he presents us the what has become already a very overused plot device. Namely the plottwist. With it all those ideas mentioned above are destroyed and the characters find themselves the same as they were from the start. A sad way to end what could have been a very promising film.The acting is good but not anything entirely special. All of the main cast perform adequately with the given dialog and keep the movie's overall feel to a much more grounded level. For what it's worth director Taekyeong Kim is able to create a very tense and dark atmosphere through his good camera work. But again it's really nothing we haven't seen before.Even with a missed opportunity to create a much more memorable experience Dead Friend is still an entertaining movie. That could as a well easily introduce more people to this genre and also prove a nice watch to those aiming to fill their AsianHorror collection.".

I'm a huge fan of Asian Horror and I can watch unoriginality I myself enjoyed The Red Shoes and Phone but this was just poor.The movie has a lot of elements that are very highquality the photography is eyecatching the visuals are cool the directing is inspired the acting is pretty good the music is easy on the ears and the CGI is incredible. But since this is a horror film we are expected to be scared which just won't happen with this film. As with most South Korean horrors this is unoriginal almost from beginning to end there's the trademark longhaired vengeful female ghost ominous clumps of thick black hair and puddles of water and near the end a twist that almost but not quite makes sense out of the whole thing the twist is easily one of the best qualities. And to the viewer's irritation when the film isn't recycling at times so exact that it could easily be dubbed plagiarized imagery from other movies it's making you jump. A lot. And by jumps I don't mean things jumping out or anything just VERY loud noises and screeches in the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air there's even a few madeyoujump moments that are simply infuriating. And when it is not rippingoff other movies it's boring and hard to sit through.And it's a shame because Ryeong could have easily been really good and it has everything to make it good but its the annoying overuse of completely predictable loud noises and jump scares that eventually ruin the movie. A perfect example of how good it could have been there's a moment when one of out characters is looking at a corpse and without a sound the corpse looks back. It's wholly predictable but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant. And unfortunately that's as scary as the movie got for me.Admittedly Ryeong has a few good features and even a couple jumps that aren't as predictable and do work. There's a very good and sad backstory used to explain the events and the twist is pretty unpredictable. Those are the only things that separate the film from any other Asian ghosthorror film. But the problem with these is even though they do work they have been used before JHorror fans will easily realize the big reveal was inspired by A Tale of Two Sisters and it takes the backstory a good fifty minutes to get going.So in the end Ryong really seems like a truly wasted opportunity. Taekyeong Kim hoped that the plot twist and other good features act as diversions so the audience won't notice the huge flaws. But he failed and well... We noticed everything.My rating 410.".

Some aspects of the movie were dragged out but then they might have been essential to explain the relationships between the main character and others. I'd recommend this if you're new to Asian horror and the concept of a darkhaired wet girl out for revenge still scares you. Otherwise it's just good for a popcorn movie.

It has all the elements there  the creepy atmosphere the symbolism of the ghost's methods of killing its victims a plot that you have to see to the end to fully understand the past of the main character who has lost her memory and doesn't know what she has done.The story is told through Min Ji Won who has lost her memory and keeps seeing mysterious figures around her seemingly threatening her who almost resembles Samara from the Ring with that iconic hair and one eye. But she doesn't know why. Then she discovers she was friends with three other girls who seem to be falling victim to this 'ghost'. But there also lies another girl who is not in the photo of the four of them and may have had a deeper connection to Min Ji Won...a connection she will regret once she finds out....Yes this follows the formula like most horror movies  that sense of discovery when you have to know the truth about the tormenter. The twist at the end may confuse some viewers I had to think about it a few times to grasp what was happening. But in the end I think this story is also an emotional tale of loneliness and being accepted so it was quite a sad story at the same time.I just hope the Americans don't trash this story when they remake their one and put in cheap thrills over suspense.

	schema:reviewBody "To call a film boring is not something I would usually count as a valid criticism. However when a film is crassly made of spare parts from other films that weren't that good to begin with and it is slow as molasses with no real payoff I think it's fair to call a spade a spade. And The Ghost is a very boring film.A movie that is about as original as its' name The Ghost tells the story of a young girl with amnesia being haunted by a ghost that holds the secret to her past. Only it's a whole lot more complicated and less interesting than one would think.The plot line is almost incomprehensible for most of the picture and the hook the amnesia element only makes things worse. It seems that no one including the screenwriter and director have any clue what the hell is happening at any given moment. Instead they chose to do what roughly amounts to the filmic equivalent of a sitcom clip show. There are scenes taken directly from Ringu Dark Water Shutter The Grudge series and a smattering of Pulse for good measure. Making matters worse the half dozen female leads all dress and read their lines alike making them impossible to tell apart.There is just nothing to grasp onto with this film. The story isn't all that well thought out. The amnesia gimmick is lazy. The mystery element is uninvolving and handled with little grace. The characters never deduce anything all the information is just handed out through the lead remembering her past whenever it is convenient for the plot.The cinematography full of reflections and shots of water at least attempts to add to the subtext a thematic link with the amnesia and the final twist which I won't reveal is nice but often overwrought. Even the score feels borrowed and clich.Worst of all the inciting action for the curse isn't very interesting and the final twist is predictable and lame. Wait you mean that one character who has 15 minutes of screen time but appeared to have nothing to do with the plot comes back in the end? No! Audiences are too savvy for this kind of tripe. Anyone who has seen any of the films that this rips off will find very little to even keep them awake with this feature. I used to think Shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of crap remaking his grudge film no less than 5 times but even his second rate work like Reincarnation a film I couldn't even bring my self to finish is miles ahead of this.For more reviews please visit www.collider.com".

You're initial thoughts change. Never does the fractured groundwork disorient. Actually these recurring visions are more fulfilling than the jump tactics. HaNeul Kim's vulnerably sullen and confused performance infuses the right mood and empathy. The rest of the cast do a solid job also. As for the vengeful spirit.

It manages to get all the things it's got going against it work for it.Take the male lead for instance. Stephen Baldwin is not the sharpest knife in the drawer and indeed hasn't exactly starred in a lot of quality movies. So in this movie he's got no mind of his own. He's an assembly line clone used as a host or worker body for the corporate jetset. That's putting a man of Stephen Baldwin's caliber to the best possible use!The movie is about mind transfers. That's the plot and the writer takes the utmost consequence of what this means. A plot that would be an insufferably silly stuntoftheweek on an episode of Star Trek Stargate or Farscape manages here to be described disturbingly realistically and in a nearpresent day setting. Every possible twist that could possibly be imagined if this technology existed is commented on in one way or the other. No stone is left unturned. The sexual possibilities alone remain an important ongoing subplot. This is highly unusual for a runofthemill sci fiaction flick.The SFX are fairly few and integrated seamlessly and perfectly into the story. The onemoleculethick cutting wire is really cool.Like I said it works. All of it. It is engaging coherent tasteful all the four female main characters have topless scenes and no they are not gratuitous but enhance the characterization wellwritten and goes out of its way to avoid clichs. For commercial flicks of any kind this doesn't happen often. It's too bad the guy who wrote it hasn't done anything else.I'm amazed to see that most of the commentators here have such a low opinion of this movie. Don't listen to them. This movie succeeds in everything it sets out to do. For a B movie it is good. Surprisingly good. It will hold up for several viewings if you're the type of person who can appreciate it. This is going to be a cult favorite.8 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Had potential but doesn't have any tension or excitement";
	schema:reviewBody "In the near future corporate customers can save time on air travel by jumping into other bodies for short periods of time.  Despite being unwilling Toffler jumps into a body in order to attend a meeting in San Francisco.  However when it comes to returning to his old body he is told that his body has been stolen by the terrorist who had been in the body he jumped into.  Toffler jumps into a clone in order to escape and with a temporary body decomposing over 54 hours he sets out to find Fisk and reclaim his body.In the near future body switching is possible for the rich id badges tell everyone who you are High Fidelity is playing at the cinema but yet nobody has ever seen the film FaceOff.  Yes  this is the future as seen in a low budget movie.  Alarm bells rang for me when the credits revealed that this was yes a film who's main cast were Baldwin MacLachlan and Coates! Happily though it wasn't actually that bad just rather unexciting and uninspiring.  The plot has promise but it doesn't deliver it well enough. FaceOff had the same basic plot but it moved much quicker and slicker than this.  The problem is that the plot feels too baggy and ill thought out with too much that isn't fully expanded on.  This wouldn't be a major problem if the film moved slickly and with a lot of energy.Sadly it doesn't.  The film has the odd exciting moment but generally it lacks tension and is a bit too slow and talky.  Three times the film falls back on needless sex scenes in an attempt to give the audience what it came for.  The conclusion of the film is obvious and for that reason lacks punch.  It's a shame because even with a low budget and lessthanperfect effects the film could still have been exciting if the director had done a better job with the pacing of the film as it is he delivers it too slowly.The good ideas flicker up along the way  the best being near the end as Toffler's disregard for his cloned body becomes useful but generally it is quite lacklustre.  Even though the cast suggested worse they were actually reasonably good.  Coates is always watchable and don't worry after a brief spell as the good buy he soon changes to the bad guy role.  MacLachlan seems to have taken the role just as a cameo and a chance to have a sex scene. Baldwin is slumming and it shows a bit too often.  He is OK for the film but he didn't have that much in the way of charisma sure he played more than one character but he still wasn't all that hot.Overall this is not as bad a film as I have maybe put across here.  If you have rented it as a cheapy video or are watching it on a low rent cable station then you probably know what's in store.  As such it works OK but it is still hard to overlook a plot that could have been tighter and a film that really needed a lot more in the way of tension and excitement to keep it going.  Worth watching if you're in the mood.".

Toffler jumps into a clone in order to escape and with a temporary body decomposing over 54 hours he sets out to find Fisk and reclaim his body.In the near future body switching is possible for the rich id badges tell everyone who you are High Fidelity is playing at the cinema but yet nobody has ever seen the film FaceOff.  Yes  this is the future as seen in a low budget movie.  Alarm bells rang for me when the credits revealed that this was yes a film who's main cast were Baldwin MacLachlan and Coates! Happily though it wasn't actually that bad just rather unexciting and uninspiring.  The plot has promise but it doesn't deliver it well enough. FaceOff had the same basic plot but it moved much quicker and slicker than this.  The problem is that the plot feels too baggy and ill thought out with too much that isn't fully expanded on.  This wouldn't be a major problem if the film moved slickly and with a lot of energy.Sadly it doesn't.  The film has the odd exciting moment but generally it lacks tension and is a bit too slow and talky.  Three times the film falls back on needless sex scenes in an attempt to give the audience what it came for.  The conclusion of the film is obvious and for that reason lacks punch.  It's a shame because even with a low budget and lessthanperfect effects the film could still have been exciting if the director had done a better job with the pacing of the film as it is he delivers it too slowly.The good ideas flicker up along the way  the best being near the end as Toffler's disregard for his cloned body becomes useful but generally it is quite lacklustre.  Even though the cast suggested worse they were actually reasonably good.  Coates is always watchable and don't worry after a brief spell as the good buy he soon changes to the bad guy role.  MacLachlan seems to have taken the role just as a cameo and a chance to have a sex scene. Baldwin is slumming and it shows a bit too often.  He is OK for the film but he didn't have that much in the way of charisma sure he played more than one character but he still wasn't all that hot.Overall this is not as bad a film as I have maybe put across here.  If you have rented it as a cheapy video or are watching it on a low rent cable station then you probably know what's in store.  As such it works OK but it is still hard to overlook a plot that could have been tighter and a film that really needed a lot more in the way of tension and excitement to keep it going.  Worth watching if you're in the mood.";

So for the remainder of the movie Stephen Baldwin plays Toffler while Kim Coates gets to slink around as Fisk booting Kyle MacLachlan out of the picture.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a completely trivial lightweight action flick yet it succeeded in entertaining at least me. Its science fiction setting is almost entirely window dressing although a few valiant efforts have been made to illustrate the futuristic setting. Most of the time these gadgets and technological wonders look and seem familiar from other more innovative movies but here they've been done convincingly enough.The actors all do decent work maybe with the exception of Janet Kidder whose onthevergeofanervousbreakdown persona is a bit grating for my tastes. Neither am I plagued by an allergy of the Baldwin brothers that some of the other reviewers here seem to be suffering from.

Its science fiction setting is almost entirely window dressing although a few valiant efforts have been made to illustrate the futuristic setting. Most of the time these gadgets and technological wonders look and seem familiar from other more innovative movies but here they've been done convincingly enough.The actors all do decent work maybe with the exception of Janet Kidder whose onthevergeofanervousbreakdown persona is a bit grating for my tastes. Neither am I plagued by an allergy of the Baldwin brothers that some of the other reviewers here seem to be suffering from.

The movie basically comes like this A copr Exe officer with high clearance level needs to go to Cal. but is in NY so he had to XCHANGE his body with someone else in Cal. to make it the fastest travel possible. He was suppose to have his body back later that day but was told the next day. The movie goes on and calls the XCHANGE process FLOATING in which at a party many people at a club talk about having sex with floaters being very erotic and so on. He then meet this girl GLORY and had sex with her. While this is happening a terrorist some how managed to get a hold of his old body and basically it is a race to get his old body back.Good movie but lacking in some sense.";

	schema:reviewBody "The ugliness and squalor of Soweto stands in sharp contrast against the glass and concrete modern buildings of downtown Johannesburg. The disparity is captured by Gavin Hood and his cinematographer Lance Gewer in Tsotsi. The film is based on an Athol Fugard novel we haven't read but having seen most of his important plays it follows this writer's vision about his homeland.Tsotsi is a product of the slums. His father is a cruel man who doesn't even allow the young boy to be near his dying mother. She appears to be an AIDS victim and in her husband's ignorance he believes it's contagious. Tsotsi grows up fending for himself and the result is a predator who will do anything in order to survive.This young man enters a life of crime as witnessed in the opening scenes on the packed train where Tsotsi and his gang surrounds a victim that happens to have displayed his money in public. For the next victim Tsotsi chooses a woman who is returning home. After shooting her he takes her car only to discover later on a young infant has been riding in the back seat.That boy will be the only way this petty criminal's soul would soften as he begins a bonding with the baby. As he gets frustrated with the care of the infant he decides to follow a young woman the mother of a toddler Tsotsi knows she has the milk the baby needs for nourishment. Miriam who realizes Tsotsi is the man being hunted by the authorities asks him to let her keep and take care of the baby but even this hard thug can't part with the baby who has awakened in him a tender side of his character.The film shows a good director Gavin Hood under control. Mr. Hood got excellent performances all around. Presley Chweneyagae makes an impression as the title character in the movie. Mathusi Magano is Boston the man Tsotsi beats savagely after he crosses him. Terry Pheto is also memorable as the young Miriam a woman who has lost her own husband to thugs roaming the slums where they live.Another great asset is the background music heard in the film. It enhances the movie as interpreted by Zola who also plays Fela the rival boss of another gang.At times Tsotsi is hard to sit through because of the violence one sees. For a film from South Africa this film comes as a surprise because it feels true from beginning to end thanks to the excellent work of Gavin Hood.".

Even as writerdirector Gavin Hood has updated Athol Fugard's novel to the new South Africa of an integrated police force upscale blacks who can demand their attention vs. abandoned AIDS orphans the settings in Johannesburg vs. Soweto with their sharp and horrific contrasts are not something American audiences have seen and almost seem as if they are from a futuristic postapocalyptic vision. Each character is dramatically and very emotionally defined by the surroundings we see where they once or currently live.Not only is Lance Gewer's cinematography from day to night from barren openness of no man's land to the closedin dense township simply gorgeous he is particularly good at capturing the luster of dark skin tones swathed in colorful clothes. Many scenes particularly the excruciatingly violent ones are heightened with dramatic lighting.The actors grab the screen even amidst this extreme mise en scene. Presley Chweneyagae as the titularly nicknamed thug is not just physically charismatic but the changes in his voice are gripping in communicating the extreme range of feelings he experiences over the few days the film takes place. This is a road trip through his soul from flash backs to existential acts from his depths to finding his humanity and his real name. His relationship with a cruelly accidental foundling infant has no comparison to the dozens of films usually comedies made around the world about an irresponsible guy stuck with a kid and how a child can be father to man. While his picaresque physical and psychic journey is almost as theatrical in its coincidences as Crash the tension is built up as it is unpredictable in each confrontation whether he will react violently or redemptively. Just when I thought his side kicks were undifferentable even they turned out to have complicated stories that were well portrayed particularly Mothusi Magano as Boston.Terry Pheto as Miriam is the very essence of woman as bringer forth of life from her artistic talents to her nourishing milk. She is beautiful and strong. It is rare to see maternal love so powerfully portrayed on film as by the women here.The soundtrack of local South African music is wonderfully atmospheric and I'm dancing in front of the computer while listening to the CD now. Particularly outstanding are the tracks by local kwaito artist Zola which uniquely combine local and international hip hop into a new sound as well as tracks with the inspiring voice of Vasi Mahlasela over choirs which recalls Ladysmith Black Mambazo. With an attention to detail in the music the middle class family listens to soft R  B on their car radio in comparison to the township sound that surrounds the Soweto residents. Bravo for the very legible subtitles throughout and translated musical lyrics even as we can occasionally pick out some pidgin English amidst the township jive. Nice to see that an art house in Manhattan could attract a significant AfricanAmerican audience for this film even before it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.".

Directorwriter Gavin Hood offers us a tale of tragic redemption and uncommon poetry in a subculture of the most abject immorality. Truly unforgettable.The only work in recent times to which this movie can be compared is City of God. There too the viewer is brought into a world of poverty and crime he probably never knew existed. It is a world so bleak that it forces the viewer to examine his own morality and wonder how much of the civility he takes for granted in his life is merely the luxury of the well fed and comfortable. These characters live on the edge and their primary passion is survival.What makes Tsotsi in the end a finer film than City of God is that it offers a more complex sense of hope it reminds us in an honest and unsentimental way that inside even the hardest cases there is a soul which is never beyond redemption".

	schema:reviewBody "This traces a few days in the life of the teenage gang leader Tsotsi. When we first meet him he and his friends are playing dice deciding what to do that evening. And what they do is murder a man stealing his wallet and leaving him behind on the train. One of the gang Boston isn't too happy with this. He begins to drink and to talk about how they lack decency. He tries to provoke Tsotsi into revealing some sort of feeling asking him about his real name. Tsotsi means thug it isn't the name his mother gave him. That doesn't work so Boston asks has any woman hurt him. Still no reaction. Not even a dog he pleads in exasperation and his provocation bears fruit as Tsotsi punches and kicks Boston in a brutal attack before running off into the night.As he runs we get a flashback of a young boy a young Tsotsi fleeing through the night. And throughout the rest of the film Tsotsi's childhood memories are intercut with the current happenings and violence. To say anymore about the plot would be to spoil some moments of the film.There is a wonderful mixture of stillness silence and energy to this film. At times the camera lingers on faces watching for a flicker of emotion. Other scenes are full of action and movement.This is a film that does say that poverty is a driving force behind crime but that is never allowed to become an excuse. There are other characters who are just as poor but do not react in the same way. It also never glamourises the violence and while redemption may be at the heart of the film it never goes over the top in offering a happy ending.This is actually one of those films you hope may have a Hollywood ending where they can all live happily ever after even though you know that that would render the rest of the film almost pointless.".

Yes there are similarities to City of God but the story is much smaller and hence more personal maybe it's because I live in Johannesburg but I found myself so emotionally caught up in the film that more then once I had to hold back tears. Maybe there were some obvious uses of cinematic dramatic vices yet the film held together all the way to the end and packed a serious punch. The lead actor was brilliant in his role which teetered between the victim and the aggressor constantly and consequently good and evil. A great cameo performance by Presley Chweneyagae.

What's really remarkable though of a piece with Fugard's hardnosed stage work is that this is all done without sentimentality and without a conventional happy ending. The acting is outstanding in particular from Presley Chweneyagae and Nambitha Mpumlwana. The music is a revelation  I've just bought the soundtrack from iTunes and am listening to it as I write this. The political message that I derived from the film though it doesn't preach concerns the extraordinary patience of the inhabitants of Soweto. It's 16 years or so since change started happening in South Africa but so few problems seem to have been solved. One doesn't have to apportion blame for this to wonder how long it can go on without serious problems arising.".

An South AfricaGreat Britain coproduction Tsotsi made history at the 2005 Edinburgh Film festival by becoming the first film in more than seven years to win both the Standard Life Audience Award for most popular film and the Michael Powell Award for Best Film. The film directed by Gavin Hood has thus far won Audience Choice awards at five of the six international festivals it has entered.The latest triumph is the People's Choice Award at the Starz Denver International Film Festival where Tsotsi was joint winner along with Mrs Henderson Presents.This follows a win at the St. Louis International Film Festival in Washington. Previous wins were at the Los Angeles AFI Film Festival joint winner with Canada's C.R.A.Z.Y Toronto International Film Festival and Edinburgh.Ironically Tsotsi did not get the main prize at the Cape Town World Cinema Festival in November 2005 although it clinched the Critics Jury Award for Best South African Film and lead actor Presley Chweneyagae winning the Best Actor award.On 15 November Tsotsi was nominated for the European Film Academy NonEuropean Film 2005  Prix Screen International.Based on the only novel written by Athol Fugard the film brilliantly depicts the story of a young boy orphaned at the age of nine and forced to fight his way to adulthood alone in the townships of Johannesburg. In this harsh world he inhabits Tsotsi lives forever in the moment. An impromptu car jacking resulting in the accidental kidnapping of an infant and forces him to confront his own humanity. The film is an emotive and very powerful journey in which the central character learns to confront the demons of his past while also coming to terms with the reality of his own destiny. In the process director Gavin Hood looks at a large part of South African society which has been left on the margin of the new postapartheid society where class differences also between blacks are becoming more of a reality. Tsotsi has been submitted as South Africa's official entry in the foreign film category for the 2006 Academy Awards en let's hope we will finally be able to celebrate in 2006.".

At the beginning I feared that the film was too MTV like with the hip music and the camera effect when Tsotsi is running away but as it got into it I was relieved to see that the director had taken quite a subtle approach to the story and allowed the story line to speak for itself. There are many unsettling moments in this film and i found myself as it went on struggling to fight back the tears.

A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.Tsotsi is a leader of an informal black criminal gang in South Africa. They are simply awful and inhuman and cruel and uncaring. We may understand why they act this way as we see the segregated black slums they live in and through flashbacks their orphanlike upbringing but you can't bring yourself to forgive them for what they have become. They are some of the worst thugs of the earth.And then a tipping point moment comes to the leader Tsotsi. As he commits a car theft from a wealthy neighborhood he unknowingly kidnaps a baby. He can't bring himself to let the baby die.Tsotsi clumsily attends to the baby in his small tin can slum house. He becomes a hybrid human that is half good and half evil.The drama of the film is the tension of not knowing how he will turn out. And he surely can go either way. His gang of friends are a noticeable contrast to where Tsotsi's head and morality is. They are pure evil.The movie is subtitled but there is not much dialog among these uneducated almost simpleminded underclass of young men. The powerful impact on the screen is created by the sordid environment and the realism in the facial expressions of the gang. The film is also driven cleverly by the African hiphop like music.The film looks at the question whether the worst of our humans on earth can change and tip back into being civilized.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's almost unfortunate that this 2005 South African film was made after Fernando Meirelles' brutalizing 2003 City of God as the latter film really sets the cinematic standard for portraying harsh urban nihilism on screen. Instead of Rio's favelas we now have the Soweto shantytowns as the geographic focal point. And instead of the unrelenting visceral intensity of the Brazilian film directorwriter Gavin Hood presents a story that begins with a fearsome veracity but unfortunately settles for a more conventional sense of plot structure and character development.Based on a 1960 novel by Athol Fugard the story concerns the title character a teenage ruffian who heads up a gang of four in postapartheid South Africa. A robberyturnedstabbing in a subway triggers a lot of unwanted questions for Tsotsi about his past among his fellow gang members. He almost kills his best friend Boston before running away and finding a carjacking opportunity. Violence yet again erupts in this episode but the surprise is that he finds a baby in the backseat of the car he stole. From that point the baby becomes a catalyst for Tsotsi's humanistic character transformation including an initially tense relationship with Miriam a young widow and mother whom he seeks out to feed the baby.For a film that starts out with such unblinking grittiness it is surprising and a bit sad to see it evolve into an increasingly sentimental journey even with the jagged edge of violence present throughout. Some scenes especially toward the last halfhour including an unnecessary flashback come across as particularly mawkish even though the ending does generate genuine tension. In his film debut Presley Chweneyagae is impressive as Tsotsi even when the script calls for his character to go through some awfully quick changes in short order. Terry Pheto is certainly a becalming presence as Miriam though it is unclear to me whether the young woman has the welfare of Tsotsi or the baby as her priority. The other gang members are portrayed with acuity  Mothusi Magano as the cerebral Boston Kenneth Nkosi as the befuddled follower Aap and Zenzo Ngqobe as the aptly named Butcher.The one aspect that deserves unequivocal praise is Lance Brewer's stunning cinematography which captures the burnished landscape of the shantytowns in vibrant detail. There are several extras with the 2006 DVD that are worth checking out beginning with Hood's informative commentary and an intriguing 1998 short he made called The Storekeeper. There are several deleted scenes included but the most interesting are two variations on the final minutes of the film Hood chose correctly in my opinion. A lively music video of the movie's propulsive opening song Mdlwembe by Zola is also included. It's necessary to use the English subtitle option since the characters are speaking a local dialect called TsotsiTaal.".

	schema:headline " 22 Year Old Thug Goes Straight in Six Days? Yeah Right.";
	schema:reviewBody "A drama set in Johannesburg South Africa about a hardened violent young man Tsotsi a nonactor Presley Chweneyagae a street thug tsotsi in Zulu means black hooligan who leads a small gang that robs assaults and on occasion kills people for sustenance and sport. After carefully establishing Tsotsi's streetmean nature the film proceeds to show us how two chance events become transformative for Tsotsi leading him to recall memories and images from his childhood from before the time he ran away from home and reawakening positive impulses and feelings opening his heart in a way that results in acts of personal redemption a highly compressed process that takes place over a period of just six days.The first and more influential chance event is this after shooting an upper middle class woman outside her posh house and stealing her car Tsotsi discovers her infant son in the rear seat and is forced  by his own impulses  to undertake the care of the baby. He experiences a flood of recollections of his mother dying of a disease that could be AIDS or perhaps tuberculosis of her desire to have young Tsotsi close to her of his violent father forbidding him to go near her of the father kicking the family dog breaking its back killing it. In tears having witnessed this act Tsotsi runs away for good becoming a homeless street kid.The second event is this Tsotsi stalks a wheelchair bound beggar to rob him and perhaps worse. But some impulse leads Tsotsi to question the man about his disability. Tsotsi learns that the man's back had been broken in an accident in the gold mine where he worked leaving him paraplegic. Tsotsi asks the man why he wants to keep living this way like a dog like Tsotsi's own broken dog back in his childhood. Because I like to feel the sun on my face the man replies. Tsotsi seems stunned by this answer contrite almost and he puts away the pistol with which he had very likely meant to kill the beggar and he leaves.This opening of Tsotsi's memories and feelings prompts a profound turnabout in his behavior. He finds a young mother in the neighborhood to nurse the baby and experiences tender feelings toward her. He makes amends to a fellow gang member he had beaten severely. He seeks out the disabled beggar and gives him a horde of cash. Finally at the end he returns the baby to its parents the mother he shot survived though she now has lost the use of her legs and meekly surrenders to police tears streaming down his cheeks.This transformation in Tsotsi is played quite unabashedly for sentiment we are heavily exhorted toward pathos not only by the rapid sweep of Tsotsi's redemptive actions but also by an insistent musical score composed toward the end largely of chanted lamentations. Poignant though the circumstances may be I felt manipulated to accept Tsotsi's turnabout even as I reflected on how unrealistic how unlikely it would be for such a transformation to occur in a young man who was seemingly so callous so heartless just a few days earlier. The suspension of disbelief required here is for me more than a bit much.But there is another way to regard this film one that leads me to a more favorable perspective. The screenplay written by the director Gavin Hood is based on a novel of the same title by South Africa's great playwright Athol Fugard. His plays most often concern the experiences and plights of black Africans. Now 73 Fugard was one of the first white playwrights in Africa to work with black actors and theater staff. Well known in South Africa also for his essays and poetry Tsotsi is surprisingly the only novel he has ever created. Written in 195960 it was not published until 1980. It is of interest that all of the crimes and violent acts depicted in the film I have not read the novel to compare are blackonblack.The intimacy of filmed narratives is such that we tend to think only of the particular characters and circumstances at hand. Not so in the theater. On stage we expect the story to represent larger themes and the particular characters also to be proxies for others for whole groups or societies even. It is not unreasonable to presume that as in his plays Fugard intended that the story of Tsotsi to be construed allegorically. Thus he  and by extension this film adaptation  may really be conveying Fugard's vision that despite the incredible hardships that black South Africans have endured from whites they have in turn brought violence and destruction upon themselves as well and that they hold within their own hands the means of altering their collective conduct for the better.As such this can be seen as a larger story of hope of encouragement toward positive aspirations and compassion within the black community. I am keenly curious to know what South African blacks think of this film whether they possibly respond to it in the manner suggested here. In Zulu Xhosa Afrikaans and English. 2006 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film. My Grade B 610".

At first I was charmed by the studio lot setting and the curiously out of place fight sequences but eventually the poor editing and confused narrative line left me impatiently waiting for the credits to roll. The director attempts to tell a sprawling story of one man's tumultuous maturation within the context of South Korean political situation during the second half of the 20th century. And although I'm not acquainted with that history it seems the film takes a very simplistic approach to the period's temperaments. The filmmakers simply try to do too much eventually diminishing the potency latent in the sociopolitical situation as well as the engaging performance of the lead actor. The film definitely has more of a movie of the week feel to it with all its heavyhandedness and slapdash filmmaking. The fact that the film was rushed ironically much like the films being satirized within the film is most evident in a sequence where the lead and another actor sit in front of a store in the 1960s with modern NFL gear inside. Now i'm not a stickler for continuity but c'mon.".

As a history buff I had high hopes of insight into the historic context of the time the actions taken by the two sides how they viewed the situation andor why they did what they did.Instead the opportunity was squandered on a long drawn out absolutely boring melodrama involving some obscure family conflict a gratuitous if titillating sex scene some bizarre injection of homosexuality and atheism creating stress in an aging character with nothing at all to do with the history and a lot of drippy and pointless personal drama. The only history to be seen consisted of one dimensional Turks and Armenians shooting each other especially the former shooting and raping civilians of the latter.The actual historical actors were like cartoon characters. One might for example have liked to know that the American doctor was doing in the middle of Turkey. Or why the Turk commander felt he needed to do what he did. Instead the historic conflict is treated with all the depth of a Road Runner cartoon while the main focus is on some kid and his girlfriend going through an emotional life crisis. Either done well might have been interesting. Both mashed together and done poorly are like a cherry pie with asparagus filling. Boring unenlightening and patched together it was as if someone had taken some cheap footage of war from a century ago and randomly spliced in parts of various soap operas. What a waste of an opportunity.This movie just sucked. I don't usually express my opinion that way but frankly it just sucked. I can understand why either side with a political axe to grind might feel compelled to love or hate the film but having none I found it almost unwatchably boring.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have hesitated to see this film for many reasons some might be obvious but others might not. I watched it on Starz the other night. I had questioned whether to go ahead and view or instead watch All or Nothing by one of the cinema's most intriquing directors Mike Leigh on another cable network. But for better or worse I am glad I saw this film. For starters I have always been an admirer of Atom Egoyan. I feel he was snubbed and should have been a best director Oscar nominee for The Sweet Hereafter 1997. I think he is very brave for making this film for surely even within the Armenian community there are many political povs about this issue and about how they should feel about it. I will refrain from getting into the politics of the subject matter of Ararat and into my own personal view about this controversy which is very much riddled in red tape for reasons I understand all too painfully well. Sadly the rest of the world probably never will. Except I will say that the problem is twofold. One there is the Armenian conflict that Turkey and Turkish people do not accept or have outright distorted their view of history. Second there is the reality that Turkey and the Turkish culture is very much hated despised and oppressed in the West for reasons that partially stem from this issue as well as many others. I challenge any of you to go to a Blockbuster or any other video store and try to find a Turkish film. I am 99 percent you will not find one even though the list of outstanding Turkish film directors is one which includes the likes of Yilmaz Guney the director of Baba The Father Yol  who was admittedly censored considerably in Turkey until recently he died in political exile in France some 20 years ago Ali Ozgenturk who directed AtThe Horse and Sinan Cetin who directed the outstanding internationally praised political comedy Propaganda.  I could also mention Serif Goren Zeki Okten and so many others. It is a simple truth that while the West criticizes Turkey for various infractions including its' treatment of ethnic Kurds yet it continously suppresses the Turkish culture and Turkish people itself.Having grown up in the USa and being halfAmerican I can validfy that this is the way it is. It may not be intentional but all of us know that it some form or fashion 'the nrs of Europe tag applied to TurkishEuropeans applies to all of us. Now having said this one might think I am going to criticize Egoyan for making this film. But he has every artistic right to make Ararat and everyone including people in Turkey have a right to view this film and make their own decisions about this film. I do not consider Ararat a hate film as some others like Midnight Express and arguably America America are. However I do think the character of Ali played by Elias Koteas who was great in The Thin Red Line is cookiecutter stereotype of TurkishWesterners. He seems like a deliberately crude person who says things like let's just drop our 'expletive' history and he seems like a person devoid of any intellectual curiosity. Even though I have nothing against homosexuals I don't think it was appropriate to make this character homosexual either. By doing so the character plays into a stereotype that Billy Hayes utilized in his book perhaps novel would be a more accurate word Midnight Express. This is the notion that all Turks are 'secretly gay' and therefore they are 'violent towards women.' My statements may seem outright ridicilous but few of you have probably endured the subliminal hatred that each of us who live in the West know to be a true fact of life. The film in a film scenes of the film actually are not ones which bother me as much. There is clearly a dark history here and it somehow has to be approached diplomatically but until the abuse of the Turkish culture is also approached I am afraid as it was once said in Cool Hand Luke.  we will always have a failure to communicate.".

	schema:headline " Egoyan's Holocaust";
	schema:reviewBody "Who after all speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?  Adolf HitlerDuring and after World War 1 the Ottoman Empire deliberately and systematically killed one and a half million Armenians. Though this event is still denied by Turkey many modern scholars deem the Armenian Holocaust to be one of the first modern genocides predating the Jewish Holocaust by several decades the Herero and Namaqua Genocides occurred in 1904 predating the Armenian killings by a decade.The murders began in early 1915 the Ottoman authorities first targeting Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. The brains eradicated the Ottoman military then began picking off the confused Armenian populace. They were forced out of their homes deprived of food and water and made to march into the deserts of Syria where they were either shot or left to die. Directed by Atom Egoyan Ararat examines man's indifference to these crimes the problem of artistically representing genocide the historical ramifications of genocide and the elusive nature of truth. The result is a bizarre film that is less a satisfying piece of drama than an interesting whirlwind of ideas.All of Egoyan's trademarks are present in Ararat. Consider the director's earlier films all of which revolve around some traumatic past event their large casts gradually piecing together the past until some cohesive truth or revelation is revealed. These films are comprised of seemingly disconnected sequences and seemingly unrelated characters vignettes that only begin to gel during some revelatory climax. These films also switch between eras their narratives jumping from past to present to future until history is concretized and the traumatic event is resolved in the present. Virtually all of Egoyan's films adopt this narrative structure which seems to blend a modernist search for truth with a decidedly postmodern admittance that truth requires the careful sorting of both testimonials and subjectivity.Ararat follows this same pattern. We're introduced to an Armenian artist who lived during the Armenian Holocaust. He paints a picture of his mother that 8 decades later is used by an art teacher as a gateway into spreading the word of the Armenian genocide. Finding this artist to be intriguing a Hollywood director then uses the long dead artist as the central character in a big budget movie about the Armenian Holocaust. The director turns the dour artist into an action hero romanticising his life and embellishing history. The cast of this film is itself comprised of Turks and Armenians. The Turks naturally play the bad guys and see the whole film as a work of fiction. The Armenians in contrast believe the film to be factual despite the obvious embellishments. One Turkish actor an obvious homosexual has an elderly father who works at an airport security desk. He permits an Armenian boy into Turkey with both bags of cocaine and footage of the genocidal killing fields. The father's acceptance of the lawless Armenian boy mirrors his acceptance of his gay son. The Armenian boy is himself the son of a terrorist who fought against the Turks whilst the boy's lover is the daughter of a man whom she believes was killed by the boy's father.Confused? This complex web of characters is really a convoluted web of metaphors. Egoyan's points Firstly your parents may be the offspring of either the oppressors or the oppressed but this does not implicate them in evils nor does it taint their character. Secondly art is impotent unless it is aligned with a political cause and even then it is often misrepresented both as a work of art and as a piece of history. Thirdly to demonize to deem the enemy animals or homosexuals is to ignore their voice and their story. Fourthly Hollywood is incapable of representing any Holocaust film naturally seductive romanticising events and turning their characters into heroes or messiahs. Fifthly history itself is comprised of nothing but embellished stories passed down from generation to generation each side tweaking the tale to fit their own ideological viewpoints. Sixthly one can never know the past. It is lost fragmented and so forever lacking closure.What the film fails to do  what all Holocaust films never bother to do  is establish why and how such an event could take place. The Ottoman Empire which was predominantly Muslim treated Armenians who were predominantly Christians as second class citizens. They were not given equal rights and were subject to strict laws the breaking of which would lead to fines and executions.At the same time the Armenians were steadily amassing wealth and forging successful businesses. Because of economic problems and their fears that Armenians would support Russia during before and after World War 1 or even demand autonomy the Ottoman authorities thus began a propaganda campaign which demonized the Armenians and so justified their eventual eradication and expulsion freeing land for the Muslim majority and the country's wealthy rulers.But the film doesn't seek to portray these objective truths or examine the global class religious or political factors which led to the holocaust. Preoccupied with subjectivity the film never digs towards its issues roots. Ironically this is its greatest asset.7.510  Law professor Raphael Lemkin who coined the term genocide in 1943 has stated that he did so with the fate of the Armenians in mind. The birth of technogenocide is a serious issue. Egoyan's film though the director tries hard doesn't live up to the scope and complexity that such a serious story demands.".

The Turks naturally play the bad guys and see the whole film as a work of fiction. The Armenians in contrast believe the film to be factual despite the obvious embellishments. One Turkish actor an obvious homosexual has an elderly father who works at an airport security desk. He permits an Armenian boy into Turkey with both bags of cocaine and footage of the genocidal killing fields. The father's acceptance of the lawless Armenian boy mirrors his acceptance of his gay son. The Armenian boy is himself the son of a terrorist who fought against the Turks whilst the boy's lover is the daughter of a man whom she believes was killed by the boy's father.Confused? This complex web of characters is really a convoluted web of metaphors. Egoyan's points Firstly your parents may be the offspring of either the oppressors or the oppressed but this does not implicate them in evils nor does it taint their character. Secondly art is impotent unless it is aligned with a political cause and even then it is often misrepresented both as a work of art and as a piece of history. Thirdly to demonize to deem the enemy animals or homosexuals is to ignore their voice and their story. Fourthly Hollywood is incapable of representing any Holocaust film naturally seductive romanticising events and turning their characters into heroes or messiahs. Fifthly history itself is comprised of nothing but embellished stories passed down from generation to generation each side tweaking the tale to fit their own ideological viewpoints. Sixthly one can never know the past. It is lost fragmented and so forever lacking closure.What the film fails to do  what all Holocaust films never bother to do  is establish why and how such an event could take place. The Ottoman Empire which was predominantly Muslim treated Armenians who were predominantly Christians as second class citizens. They were not given equal rights and were subject to strict laws the breaking of which would lead to fines and executions.At the same time the Armenians were steadily amassing wealth and forging successful businesses. Because of economic problems and their fears that Armenians would support Russia during before and after World War 1 or even demand autonomy the Ottoman authorities thus began a propaganda campaign which demonized the Armenians and so justified their eventual eradication and expulsion freeing land for the Muslim majority and the country's wealthy rulers.But the film doesn't seek to portray these objective truths or examine the global class religious or political factors which led to the holocaust. Preoccupied with subjectivity the film never digs towards its issues roots. Ironically this is its greatest asset.7.510  Law professor Raphael Lemkin who coined the term genocide in 1943 has stated that he did so with the fate of the Armenians in mind. The birth of technogenocide is a serious issue. Egoyan's film though the director tries hard doesn't live up to the scope and complexity that such a serious story demands.";

I am even accused of betraying my own country because I'm against Turkey's governmental policy. According to this I started watching this movie with a prejudgement. I was sure I would like the movie. But things didn't go that way. There's a movie shot by Turkish which tells about 1914 just before the deportation and execution of Armenians started. I watched it and hated it. It is called 120. I hated it because it showed Armenians as traitors to the Ottoman Empire. There were also good Armenians but because of the atmosphere it seemed very weird that they are like that. It was like Armenians are evil by nature but there are some odd exceptions I voted that movie 110. Now I feel like it was unfair. Now I have to vote Ararat under that. Because Ararat doesn't even contain a slightly good Turkish character. However we know that there are many Turkish villagers who helped their Armenian neighbours during the Genocide by hiding them. There are also many people in Turkey who do not believe what their government tell them and struggle for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. There's a campaign Turkish people have started to collect signatures which apologizes to Armenians because of what happened. The campaign has already collected 28.000 signatures. Atom Egoyan strictly ignores every humanistic behaviour from the Turkish. This leads to hatred and hostility. I believe if we show this movie to an ArmenianTurkish nationalist it would increase its hatred against TurkishArmenian. An artist must be more responsible. Because what heshe creates appeals to many and their reaction to that may be crucial. This movie is very subjective and there's a high risk that it may trigger hatred and hostility. I as a person from Turkey who denies to call himself Turkish because of his repulsion against nationalism am offended.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1915 right in the midst of World War I when the eyes of the world were focused on other corners of the planet the Turks slaughtered over a million of their own Armenian citizens in a holocaust that the Turks to this day deny ever happened.  Atom Egoyan's complex though not entirely successful film Ararat' attempts to show just how long a shadow this horrific genocide still casts over the Armenian people today.Rather than simply make a film set at the time of the genocide Egoyan has chosen to set his film in the present and have his vast assortment of characters reflect on what this almost centuryold event means to them in their present lives most of them are second generation Armenians and Turks living in Canada.  One of those characters is an aged film director who in honor of his mother who endured the atrocities has come to Canada to make a film about the event.  Thus all the glimpses we get of the actual genocide are filmwithinafilm reenactments.  In a bit of irony Egoyan shows just how difficult it is for any work of art to faithfully capture the truth' of such an event for falsehoods inevitably creep into the picture the moment the artist alters even minor facts under the guise of artistic license.' This is particularly ironic given the fact that truth' and facts' are such an important part of the case the Armenians have built against the Turks. The film deals headon with what is truth' and how much of history comes down to a matter of personal perception. Egoyan has provided a veritable labyrinth of characters and events so much so that it becomes almost impossible to provide anything near a comprehensive summary of either the plot or the people who are caught in its entanglements and complexities.  Suffice it to say that the film deals with such weighty themes as the intricacies of motherchild relationships coming to terms with the ghosts from both the private and collective past and the part denial plays in assuaging our own sense of guilt and responsibility for unspeakable events in history.  This denial then allows us to live our lives in unconcerned complacency.Egoyan views his film almost as a giant canvas and he keeps throwing characters onto it often without painting the strokes in clear enough detail for us to understand fully what is going on an apt analogy given the fact that one of the characters is an actual painter and he deliberately leaves part of his artwork unfinished.  Some of the people we meet are fascinating and complex while others seem underdeveloped and too enigmatic to make much of a contribution to our comprehension of the material. Occasionally we get the nagging impression that a number of the minor characters and plot strands are left hanging in a state of unresolved limbo. Moreover the film occasionally lapses into a pedantic tone as if the writer felt it more important to provide us with a history lesson than involve us in a drama.  What promises to be an enlightening character study frequently becomes a polemic.Structurally Ararat' is very complex with the director cutting back and forth between characters in the present one character in the past and the events of the genocide as depicted in the film being made.  Egoyan deserves credit for bringing it all together even if the very artifice of the format ends up distancing the audience from the emotional immediacy of this very grim subject matter.  Ararat' is more of an intellectual exercise than an emotionally involving drama but it does serve a salutary purpose in raising the public's consciousness about a shameful tragic moment in history that has for too long gone unrecognized by the general public.".

	schema:reviewBody "I came across the movie Ararat while doing research for a paper I was writing for school. I watched it hoping that it would give me further insight into the Armenian Genocide. I can honestly say that this movie not only enforced the research I had done but also led me to new topics I had not yet researched myself. I strongly believe in knowing about the events in a movie before watching it. Otherwise you can sit through an entire film and not understand the meaning or significance that it holds. For instance if you watch a film on Gallipolli a very important battle for the Australians in the First World War you may not know what it means for the people who were involved like most people who live outside of Australia. However if you take time to do a little research before hand you can easily watch a film about it and understand its importance. That said I believe that this applies to Ararat in the same way. If you don't take the time to research the Armenian Genocide along with other aspects of the film such as the Van Resistance Arshile Gorky Clarence Ussher or even Aghtamar Island you can never fully understand this movie or any other film about the Armenian Genocide as well. I thought this movie was the perfect mix of storyline and documentation. In my opinion it presented the facts of the Armenian Genocide accurately and effectively without turning into a documentary about it. It showed how it still affects the Armenians of today even though it happened a little bit less than one hundred years ago. How there could still be such denial and hatred between the people who were involved. The fact that we know so much about the holocaust that Adolf Hitler carried out and so little about this Holocaust that started only 18 years before Hitler came to power is shocking and deeply upsetting. I recommend this film highly as not only an important piece on this historical event but also an excellent film. I must applaud Atom Egoyan for doing this event justice and bringing it to life on the screen.".

Not only is this movie simply a bad movie that is extremely difficult to sit through it's also one that goes to such great lengths to prove its message that the fabrications become utterly hilarious.The director is trying to associate the genocide that took place in Germany with what he proposes was happening in the Ottoman Empire. This desperate attempt is so apparent at some points in the movie that it becomes outrageous. There is a suggestion that the Turks decided to kill all Armenians with a planned and systematic decision a direct quote out of U.N's definition of genocide mind you!. By the way these Armenians are the same people with whom the Turks had been living side by side as neighbors friends commercial partners.. etc. peacefully in the Ottoman Empire for hundreds of years. What is completely laughable about this whole situation is the reason given for this socalled genocide The claim that Armenians got a hold of finances in the Ottoman Empire and were controlling money markets! This bold lie which lacks the backing of any kind of historical evidence shows how desperate the director's attempt is at drawing parallels between the Jews in Germany and the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire.The characters in the movie lack depth and sophistication. The Turks in the movie are either gay men who are unsure about their identity drug dealers rapists or tyrant Pashas. The extreme bias in the movie is so apparent and even the plot weakens and slows down so much at some points that watching some of the scenes is like a torture.The movie depicts Turks as possessing the latest technological weaponry armed against the poor innocent helpless Armenians. What an outrageous lie. The Turks at that point in the World War I were an extremely poor nation being attacked at all fronts by imperialist powers such as Britain France Italy and Russia who wanted to get a piece of the cake that was the Ottoman Empire. In their desperate attempt at survival a lot of Turkish soldiers could not even get hold of bayonets let alone rifles and did not even have proper clothing for fighting! This was a violent war and both Turks and Armenians were killed. Why doesn't the movie talk about what the Armenian terrorists and guerrilla did to the Turkish villages? Where are the Armenian bandits who raped and killed Turkish women? This is such a onesided story that it even justifies an abominable terrorist act such as killing an innocent Turkish diplomat. At one point one of the main characters implies that such hatred towards the Turks and what they supposedly did justifies and legitimates the assassinations of lots and lots of Turkish diplomats by Armenian terrorists in the 70s and 80s. The terrorists who committed these acts according to the movie are socalled freedom fighters.I think it's so ironic that Charles Aznavour at some point wonders I can't believe how someone could hate us so much and this hatred still continues. The imagined hatred he talks about does not exist. What exists though is the Armenian hatred that shows throughout the whole movie this movie is filled with pure hatred towards the Turks and it's not a subtle hatred either.It makes me sick to the stomach when the imperialist Western powers can so easily blame the Turks for having committed a genocide when their own hands are full of blood from the massacres they've committed both in the heart of Europe the Americas and also in their colonies. It is extremely hypocritical of them to even talk about genocide when they failed to act upon a genocide that was happening before their very eyes in the 90's the Bosnian genocide. This movie shows how easy it is to manipulate truths and focus on hatred using cinema as a tool.".

I must say that the movie only touched my beep with its love making scenes. Mr. Egoyan could choose a different way that reminds both sides of genocide that they were human beings but he did not. He put it this way since he wanted to have his revenge from Turks and wanted to gain Christian westerners support. one hand intellectual artlover Armenians on the other hand rapist murderous ignorant so on and so for Turks. Good Job! Mr. Egoyan. Did you get what you want! Maybe u did but u ll not get it from me. Do you think I care about what my ancestor did to Armenians. I haven t kill anybody my father did not kill anybody and my grandpa s did not kill anybody and i really don t care if my grandpa s father killed anybody or a rapist or a serial killer or torturer. should I care about my descendants I don t even know their names for only sharing the same bloodline. No one has a right to force me feel ashamed about my past. Mr. Egoyan have you ever heard of human rights. it clearly says that no one can be held responsible for what he or she did not. And So far no one has talked about ASALA that u justify at the end of the movie. Mr. Egoyan ASALA was internationally declared terrorist organization which assassinated Turkish diplomats assassinations were carried out in a so bloody way that sometimes ended up killing more innocent European civilians than the target himself. For those who took a history lesson from it on how to prevent a genocide. u can apply your learning to Darfur which is happening today . I hope u have the same sympathy for these black Africans too.I don t even talk about the technical aspects of the movie. Because the movie technically sucks. Very poor  pretentious acting. Poor art direction and poor directing full of long boring didactic preaching etc...I hope someday another movie is made on the same subject matter and this time he or she will give us a hope for peace.and I hope this director will be Egoyan and he ll do it right this time.".

The contest includes an appearance from New Edition an all too brief appearance from future superstars The Beastie Boys and an in studio audition from LL Cool J. The film was rated R' generally for some mild violence and usage of the F' word. Six instances where two would automatically mean an R' rating It didn't do too hot at the box office. I had stated that the film came out a year or so too early. The reason I stated this was that in 1986 one year following this film's release  Run DMC's cover of Aerosmith's Walk This Way  got heavy airplay on white radio even going to number1 on album rock radio in Aerosmith's homebase of Boston MA. This success opened the door for The Beastie Boys The Fat Boys LL Cool J Will Smith known at that time as The Fresh Prince and a large number of other hip hop and rap artists to score BIG on the Pop singles and pop album charts.".

I remember Run's rappin and how it had a hard edge to it but his character had the same hard edge to him as well. Krush Groove is a magnificent tribute to rap and the pioneers of rap. Krush Groove featured maybe half of the known rappers from that era. Run DMC didn't invent rap but they sure took it to another level. Rap is nowhere today without Run DMC. They elevated it to the stratoshpere. I remember dying to have a pair of Adidas because of them.The movie itself is more or less a 95 minute concert with some acting in it. Blair Underwood was probably the only real actor in the entire movie. Being that this was his first movie lucky for him it didn't kill his career. As poor as the acting was I loved this movie. I totally understand that my affinity towards this movie is directly linked to my growing up in the 80's and listening to the very artists in the film. Each artists' appearance was an instant trip down memory lane. We're talking The Fat Boys Kurtis Blow The Beastie Boys New Edition Sheila E. Full Force and even Donnie Simpson before he hosted BET.I could go on forever about the movie and even though the movie was low budget poorly edited complimented with sub par acting it is the memories that are evoked that makes me like it. Put this movie on my list of old school niche favorites with Beat Street Breakin' and The Last Dragon.".

	schema:headline " Cheesy and uneven mix in the plotting but great way to see so many new artists of the period";
	schema:reviewBody "Russell Walker is riding the wave of the hiphop wave with the new single from his group RunDMC getting lots of heat on the street problem is he just needs a little money to get more prints made to profit on it. With nowhere else to go he turns to a local loan shark to get the money however it coincides with tensions with his brother Run. Meanwhile on the outside looking in the Disco 3 look for a way to get signed.This film was recommended to me by a fellow user and oldschool fan on this site and I made an effort to seek it out despite having never heard of it. The film is essentially a way of getting hot new artists into a film and doubling benefiting by giving them exposure and also getting money from people wanting to see them in a film. It is perhaps of little surprise then that the plotting isn't quite all it could have been. Based very loosely on the early days of Def Jam this mostly fictionalised film can't decide quite what it wants to be. On one hand we the drama with Walker in debt in conflict with his brother Run over matters business and personal while also up to his neck in the sort of debts that get legs broken. These sections are handled seriously and contain swearing and a tough tone. By contrast we also have sections with the Fat Boys partially here as the Disco 3 where the tone is much much lighter as they mug around and play up the comedic side of their personas. These two aspects sit really uneasily beside one another  alone neither is great although neither is bad but together they just seem a very odd contrast and give the feeling of the film really not being sure what to do in terms of tone and story. Sometimes it works but too often it is a little cheesy and uneven and it makes it hard to enjoy as a storydriven film.On the plus side sitting between these two aspects is the music  lots of music. Shelia E Kurtis Blow RunDMC New Edition the Fat Boys Beastie Boys and a really impacting introduction for LL Cool J  all of them are given time to do a little bit within the context of the plot. LL makes the biggest splash with Radio but Shelia E is great throughout and the other artists all please and satisfy. While the film may not have been very steady in terms of plot with the music it totally knows what it wants to do. As actors I was pleasantly surprised to find that the majority of the cast were comfortable in front of the camera. The cast is led by Blair Underwood making his acting debut and he is pretty good with the more serious parts of the film. Run is also very natural and strong in the film. Shelia E is great on stage and great with the lighter stuff but when the love interest stuff starts the material is weak and she seems stiff  in real contrast to her being on stage making it stand out more. The Fat Boys are pretty funny throughout and really it was only Kurtis Blow that sounded like he was reading his lines off 20 foot high placards.Overall then this is not a great film in terms of tone and plot but it does enough to avoid being a bad film in the way many similar ones have been. It seems to help that although cashing in on the genre to a certain extent it is being done from the inside rather than an outsider seeking to exploit others' success. The music is what it is all about though and fans of this genre and period will get a lot of stuff to love here  ultimately this is who the film is aimed at and the target audience won't be disappointed.".

It is based on the true and personal story of Run DMC The Fat Boys Kurtis Blow Sheila E and others breaking out rap music for the first time to the mainstream audiences against convention and against those who would view rap as nonmusic and a fad. It showcases the music as a true underground phenomena fun creative positive and energetic embraced by urban youth eager to rebel. Poor fat whatever just being yourself for a change was enough for you to make a go of it and be successful. There are 12 musical productions in the film and some showstopper performances by Sheila E coached by Prince for this film especially. This movie was based on real events and the roles played by the people themselves who lived them. In that sense it may not have a Hollywood calibre cast and complicated plot but that wasn't the point of this film. This film was meant to showcase the struggles of a music the struggles of artists in an emerging genre and show people where it was at in 1985. It did just that capturing the heart and soul of hiphop where it all is rooted free from excessive profanity free from guns and gangsterism just go out and have fun stand tall express yourself forget the naysayers and throw down the creativity. And the rest is history.".

The record is selling so well the company cannot produce enough copies and they don't have the money for more until the records sellwhich they won't until the company has something to ship. The banks don't want to lend to this company because rap is something new and strange. So Russell has to deal with less than savory characters. Meanwhile the guys in RunDMC take advantage of the opportunity to make themselves famous getting involved with a major record producer.Russell is also in charge of a talent show which includes a number of famous rappers and musicians. However even though the credits say the Russell character is based on the real Russell Simmons who was a producer of the movie at the end of the credits we are told the characters are fictional. So even though a number of wellknown rappers perform in this movie using the same name as in real life and even though those who belong to groups are in groups with the same name as their reallife counterparts these are not the real stories of the performers. It would have been too much of a coincidence though for so many famous performers to have met in this way when they were unknown.I am a 44yearold white man who likes easygoing music such as Mantovani Lawrence Welk Sinatra Perry Como and Glenn Miller. Still The Fat Boys were the first rap group I ever heard if you don't count Blondie and they performed without instruments using their voices for percussion. I enjoyed hearing them do this and wish they had done it more in the movie they actually had 'real' instruments backing them up which unfortunately weren't 'real' like so much of 80s music. But I liked it when one of the guys did this in biology class and got them kicked out and when they tried doing it for the bouncer where the talent show was being held. And one of the movie's best moments came when the guys saw a sign at Sbarro's which said 'All You Can Eat' for 3.99. The Fat Boys who were The Disco 3 at first were a lot of fun.Other than The Fat Boys I liked LL Cool J the best. But the musical performances in this movie were firstrate whether they were really my taste or not and this was the reason to watchnot acting or writing. Sheila E. especially came across well on stage. She was very confident and quite talented at singing rapping dancing playing drums playing the guitar now I really liked this since it was jazzstyle rather than rock. As for her actingwell we can't be good at everything.Blair Underwood is considered a respected actor these days and I just went through the sad experience of seeing his last appearance on 'LAX' where he and Heather Locklear were so wonderful together. But I couldn't see his potential here.This movie was pretty good and highly recommended in my opinion for fans of oldschool rap.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's impossible or close to it to try and talk about Krush Groove the way that a usual movie review would go about it. I can't really speak much to the quality of the direction as it's by a hack the director Michael Schultz has such illustrious credits to him like Car Wash Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Rock 'n' Roll Mom and while the cinematographer is a man with some name recognition for buffs Ernest Dickerson of many of Spike Lee's best films it too isn't anything to write at length in detailed form save maybe for one interior bedroom scene at Sheila E's place in the middle of the night that's kind of moody. And the plot oh don't go there too fast.If I had to try and sum up the story it would have to just come down to this it's got two stories one more dramatic and one more comic more or less emphasis on that really and one is about the start of the careers of rappers RUN DMC Kurtis Blow and Dr. Jekyll  Mr. Hyde via Russell Simmons and Def Jam Records plus Sheila E and the other is about yup The Fat Boys the rappers who are up to no good at the Sbarro's AllYouCanEat buffet. But if I were to tell someone about this movie or more to the point tell them if Krush Groove is worth they're time on Netflix or to seek out on DVD then telling about the story would be third or fourth if at all on my list of things to talk about. It's got a story about as complicated as that of Burlesque only with slightly better just slightly like by a nosehair's length dialog.No no good reader see this because it's got motherbusting RUN DMC Kurtis Blow most of all for some guiltypleasure fans The Fat Boys and a slew of other memorable and notsomemorable oldschool rap acts out of the mid 1980's NYC rap scene. It's a time and place that seems so ancient now even as it was still part of the postmodern era that we're in now. It's got some layovers from the 70's a disco club that the rappers go to after a gig for example and some of the music seems to carry over from it in the beats but its really its own thing. For me it's nothing short of amazing that aside from the talent that is actually on display how effective Run and DMC and everyone else were at the time of crafting they're raps to be about things if only sometimes about having fun is that it's a rap age that had an innocence to it. This isn't to say Kurtis Blow or other rappers like Grandmaster Flash didn't rap about real st going on in the streets but the tone was different less of the Bitches and money crappola that's sunken rap into the shitter for so long.To see the rappers in this movie from the main acts to the smaller ones um LL Cool J and The Beastie Boys for brief appearances are to see acts that can stupify with the ease with which they lay their tricky rockandrhymes. Not all of the acts blow one out of the water Sheila E's first song not the Hollyrock the other one is weak and New Edition well let's not go their shall we into aluminumfoil suitville.But the ones that do make the movie a lot of fun as nostalgia and just as straight musical entertainment that flows well. And when it means to be a comedy as silly as it can be with those joyful idiot Fat Boys it's very funny the buffet I mentioned before had me cracking up laughing and I knew it was intentional comedy thankfully. It's when it's a drama that it's a little shakier since not all of the actors even the real ones like Blair Underwood playing the Simmons surrogate have much experience. They do alright but it's a storyline that is so cookie cutter it's biggest shock is how fast it goes through the motions.Krush Groove sadly didn't become bigger than E.T. like the original bet was between Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in Kevin Smith's Dogma. But in its own right for some maybe it had or could have? just as much a special place on the video shelf. It works best as a slice of a time period with some dated clothes and still funky and wicked beats and Rick Rubin ! and cool rhymes done by people who know what they're doing. Sometimes with a music movie I just want to be able to go as soon as the movie ends to check out as much of the music as possible. You can rest assured and hopefully this is the big recommendation a Fat Boys CD will be coming express mail by the end of this week.".

	schema:headline " TRON 'All that is visible'";
	schema:reviewBody "TRON. Now here's a film that seems to generate a wide spectrum of reviews.As for my take on this landmark motion picture I have to admit that I will always be able to reflect on it in its original context.In 1982 TRON along with Blade Runner was nothing short of breathtaking. And although it was originally panned by critics those who have taken the time to look closer have noticed that there is more to this film than there first seems to be.One of TRON's greatest strengths lies in its extensive use of parallelism. There is the world of the user almost a god or demigod motif contrasted with the world of the programs very much a metaphor for our world. And just to enhance this metaphor Dillinger's helicopter is shown with neonred lines and the final fade to black is preceded with a timelapse of the city  suggesting data running along traces.The obvious parallels are with the use of the same actor for each character's counterparts in the digital world. Flynn and Clu Alan and Tron Laura and Yori Gibbs and Dumont Dillinger and Sark.However we see a number of other characters show up here and there in more subtle form For example there's Sark's second in command on the bridge of the carrier. He shows up earlier in the film as Peter  the suit who was watching Dillinger's office. Then there's RAM's human counterpart asking Alan if he can have some of his popcorn. I find it surprising that many are critical of the 'unbelievable' aspect of this film. However never is the audience expected to believe that this is the way the computer world really works or that a person could ever be zapped into a computer. In fact to allude to the type of story that the audience is being presented with TRON does a nearquote of Alice In Wonderland with 'Stranger and stranger.' Perhaps Kevin Flynn fell down the rabbit hole. And  for those who think TRON is a Disney film  watch the production notes and you'll discover that this is not a Disney film although they did fund it.Of most obvious interest is the fact that TRON pushed the computer graphics technology of the time to its limits and beyond. And  despite many who have said that its graphics are primitive they're confusing resolution with texturemapping. The truth is the number of colours displayed and the resolution shown in the computergenerated components in TRON is higher than most desktop displays  even today. To output to film with the level of sharpness and smooth gradients seen in TRON you'd need at least 24 or 32bit colour with a horizontal resolution of approximately 3000 to 4000 pixels. On top of that it was the first film to use transparency in 3D CGI the solarsailor simulation. To my knowledge texturemapping didn't exist in 1982. Fortunately the lack of texture mapping works well with the stylized look of the film's 'world inside the machine.'As a film TRON is definitely both unique and entertaining. And for those who are visual in nature it's full of splendid eyecandy. The design work is toprate and is best appreciated when viewed on film. I recall watching this movie when it first came out in 1982 and have to say that it was nothing short of total immersion. Unfortunately most of the modern transfers of this film have been pretty rough with the exception of the outofprint Laserdisc boxset.The plot for TRON is actually quite simple. Despite this simplicity it is cleverly used for the purpose of  hopefully  making the audience think about our world and how it may relate to some 'higher world.' If we are programs then who are our users? Is there a level up from us and do they know all the answers? There is certainly a metaphysical angle to TRON which the audience can ether pay attention to or disregard in favour of the simple thrill of watching Light Cycles square off against each other on the Game Grid.Many elements are combined in this film the gladiatorial film the exodus the revolution the sentient AI the battle of good vs. evil and  of course  the almost prophetic depiction of the computer industry. Encom and Ed Dillinger are very much parallels to real themes that took place in the computer industry in the years that followed the release of TRON. These themes are very much repeated in more recent trilogy of films. I think the actual name for the Light Cycle game that Flynn mentions will give you a clue as to which trilogy I'm referring to.Finally there's Kevin Flynn. Some may be surprised that I left this one to the end. However I thought I'd leave the best for last. Fact is Jeff Bridges did a brilliant job with this character. Over the years I have actually known computerindustry hotshots who are remarkably similar to Flynn. He made the character believable. And this carries over to the film itself. No matter how much of a leap you're expected to make when approached with a script or screenplay be compelling. Jeff Bridges and David Warner do exactly this. TRON is a movie that really entertains. I like to think of it as a big small movie. One that was definitely ambitious and is presented in 'glossy' and vivid widescreen yet has a sort of nicelightsnack kind of feel to it. It's a movie with a great deal of replay value and one with compelling characters. In short TRON  like its video game counterpart  is fun.And for that and a host of other reasons it will remain on my list of favourite films.End of line.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hope some smart person from Disney is reading this if ever there was a movie crying out to be rereleased into movietheaters it's Tron the dazzling scifi film from Walt Disney Productions. If it were released into theaters today Tron would be a smash hit 'cause the movieaudiences of today would understand it a heckuva lot better than the movieaudiences of 1982.Tron tells the story of a young computer programmer named Flynn Jeff Bridges who gets sucked INTO a computer and must fight for his life playing lifeordeath video games run by the evil Master Control Program. With the aid of a good warrior program named Tron Bruce Boxleitner and Tron's significantother Yori Cindy Morgan Flynn must put a stop to the MCP and set things right in the computer world once again before returning to his own world.With breathtakingly beautiful computeranimation and the very first film to use computeranimation extensively and presenting an original dazzling world where energy lives and breathes inside a computer Tron was way ahead of it's time. This may explain why the film was greeted with incomprehension from critics and audience members alike back in 1982.The problem was back in 1982 there was no such thing as the Internet and apart from business types most people didn't really know diddlysquat about computers yet. As a result the computer jargon heard throughout Tron went sailing over most audience members' heads and for many the story was difficult to follow. Critics complained that Tron was all special effects and no story. And for the final insult Tron wasn't even NOMINATED for Best Visual Effects at Oscar time presumably because the Academy in 1982 didn't recognize computeranimation as genuine visual effects i.e. it's animation not visual effects they thought to themselves. The Abyss changed all that in 1989 but that was a big seven years after Tron. Obviously everyone in 1982 had missed the film's point.But the passing of time has been very kind to Tron. Today the film has a major cult following and is recognized by many as the landmark scifi film that it truly is. Looking at Tron today the movie has aged very well indeed like a fine wine. Now that timeand people's knowledge of computershas finally caught up with Tron now would be the PERFECT time for the world in general to take another look at this amazing film.Message to Disney put Tron back in theaters! Clean it up with a new remastered print  remastered sound and let the world rediscover this scifi classic. It WILL be a smash hit! In 1982 people just didn't understand Tron. Today they will. Trust me. ".

	schema:reviewBody "I was terribly excited about Tron when it came out theatrically I was all of 8 years old but was already a computer geek.  15 years later I ended up purchasing the 100 Archive Edition laserdisc box set as my very first LD. Tron definitely made an impact on me.Tron has survived the years more so than many other contemporary SF films and more than I think most critics would have guessed.  Instead of looking outdated and corny as the years have passed Tron has aged gracefully. Sure the monochromescreen terminals might look a bit old and the arcade is a distant fond memory but the SFX are still beautiful and the storyline in this era of the Internet seems shockingly modern.One of the reasons Tron's SFX have aged so well is because they did not try to simulate anything already existing.  We have no basis to determine if the architecture of the MCP's world is outdated or nothip everything is styled so uniquely that it's never going to look wrong.  Much like the design of Maria in Metropolis the look of Tron is never going to be laughable or quaint.The storyline is lacking a little bit you can see the ideas the script writers wanted to insert but there are too many ideas for only 2 hours of film.  There are quite a few points in the film that are mentioned and then ignored Grid bugs anyone? and occasionally the film digresses from the plot for no other reason than to digress the digressions being unimportant to the story at hand.  But despite the problems the philosophy of userprogram interaction and the handling of technophobia are both handled admirably.I recommend every video game computer and SF fan to watch Tron at least once.  I echo the call for it to be the widescreen version but I am disappointed with the DVD's extra features or lack thereof.  The LD is much more full featured and better for fans despite the side breaks every 30 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I still remember having seen parts of this movie when I was a very little kid and I thought it was incredibly cool I hadn't seen anything like it. Now I have bought the 20th anniversary DVD and this was the first time I watched the movie in its entirety and with a developed brain. And I still like it. Not in the same way as when I was young because now I understand the story I didn't understand English back then and I couldn't read the subtitles so it's different from what I imagined back then and now I have seen a truckload of modern movies with CGI effects.However even though the effects in this movie are somewhat 'dated' they are still unique. While listening to the audio commentary which is a must if you wonder how they managed to make a movie like this in 1982 I heard someone stating my thoughts exactly the unique thing about this movie is that while modern movies use CGI in an attempt to simulate the real world in Tron one tried to simulate a computer world with real world images. Because they did succeed in this the movie will never become 'dated' while movies trying to use limited CGI effects will become dated as soon as CGI evolves. The limitations of computer graphics at that time forced the makers of the movie to be very creative. E.g. all camera motions in the CG scenes including the swinging motions in the chase scenes had to be calculated by hand there simply was no software for it! Nowadays computer graphics are nearing perfection and that's why a movie like this will never be made again.If you haven't seen this movie yet to fully appreciate how groundbreaking it is you must be willing to imagine that you're back in a time where the most complex computer animation to be seen were the moving blocks in video arcades or the 5 seconds of wireframe models in Star Wars. You might expect that the resolution of the images will be very low and the pictures will be blocky but this is totally untrue. The images were created at film resolution often using methods which don't even involve the rasterization of images so they look perfectly smooth. Some might say too smooth due to the lack of texture mapping which hardly existed at that time but IMHO this is what gives the depicted 'digital world' its unique appearance.The story is not of great complexity but it's original and entertaining enough. Of course it's a Disney movie so there aren't many 'sharp edges' to it a scene with a mildly erotic undertone was even removed but don't expect 'Bambi' sweetness either. Grownups will probably be more amazed by the kind of effects they managed to pull off in 1982 while children will be enchanted by the strange world shown in this movie. If you want to entertain young kids during a hour and a half this movie will be perfect. They will like every bit pun intended of it!".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1982 the concept of artificial intelligence was advanced enough that a gamer could easily defeat a computer opponent if he memorised the sequence of moves that the AI followed. A computer capable of handing the intense mathematical calculations CGI entailed often took up an entire room. Video games were strictly twodimensional and often consisted of video displays that a legally blind man could make out the individual pixels in. Yet they were considerably more fun than most of the annoyances we have to bear with today. The reason for this is as simple as it is obvious. In 1982 programmers realized that graphics are not what make a game fun because graphics could not be made as real as they are now.Tron fell flat at the box office because the concepts it dealt with were not in the public consciousness. Home computers from many manufacturers were duelling for market share and the idea that the market could one day all be controlled by one monolithic corporation was far from anyone's mind. This little fact is what keeps Tron relevant nearly twentyfive years later. However as the information age grew into focus the number of films that openly steal from Tron are numerous. They try to capture the same level of excitement and intrigue but they fall down because of an inability to make the audience care about the characters.Tron begins with simple interactions between the world of the programs and the world of the humans some of which are programmers or users as they are called here. The sequence in which one user Flynn is sucked into the world of the programs well let's just say that the Wachowski brothers obviously watched it very carefully before they penned the screenplay for The Matrix. Only in this case it is done with much more credibility and impact.Many have talked about the curse that plagues film adaptations of video games. Tron was the first of many films to have a video game adapted from it the reasons for which should be clear when one watches the game sequences. During the middle act of the film Flynn is made to compete in a couple of video games the first of which while quite clearly based upon Pong was adapted more or less elementforelement into a crude tennis game. The latter is more notorious however. The concept of bicycles that create walls behind them as they move into which one tries to run an opponent is one of the simple concepts that kept old 4bit video game machines like the Atari 2600 profitable for so long.It has been said that it is difficult to understand what is going on which is hogwash. Once you learn some of the basics of computing or rather the concepts that Microsoft would like to keep hidden from the user such as inputoutput addresses and the like and learn to pay attention to dialogue it is incredibly easy to follow this story. It is in fact one of the best renderings of computer concepts on the big screen to date which is a sad indictment upon Hollywood when you consider how far technology in both areas has come since 1982.I gave Tron a ten out of ten. It entertained me immeasurably when I was a child growing up on the cusp of VHS technology. As an adult who is having endless fun with the recordable DVD technology it entertains me even more. Few things grow more relevant with time in both happy and sad ways but Tron is amongst them. If every sciencefiction film in which computers and artificial intelligence figured heavily were up to this standard film critics would have a lot less to do.".

Owing more to the human colourists than the now outdated computer effects this film is evidence  similar in a way to Kubric's preMoon landing preCGI 2001  to the creative and more sensorypleasing abilities of the human artist over soulless programmers from a time before when a box would 'parse' it all for you. It's difficult to express how highpowered computers fail to create an image that is satisfactory to the human eye there is always something that rings false about it. Tron was created in a period of wire diagrams being the best you could coax from a computer anything else was added by human hand. A film that makes you nostalgic for the time when Disney made films that were accessible for all almost Bakshilike in its disregard for the mainstream. There is struggle against adversity there is an oppressive evil regime there are two heroes who survive despite all odds and there is love conquering all a token woman is included as love interest. Ironically like the IT industry. The naive use of technical jargon merely adds to the computer program style setting and this film is ideally suited for today's retrochic society. As a Disney film this is aimed predominantly at children so if you fail to understand the plot then I would recommend sticking to the Lion King or some other pabulum. This is a great film  watch it.".

As a Disney film this is aimed predominantly at children so if you fail to understand the plot then I would recommend sticking to the Lion King or some other pabulum. This is a great film  watch it.";

A more developed story substantial dialogs and yes a director capable to do his job in a better way than Steven Lisberger master and commander of this sadly overrated movie. How in the world Disney green lighted such a good project in the hands of an amateur?I'm dazzled with the positive reviews of the many viewers of this wrecked project quoting that this was an underrated film when the time of its release. Sorry that's not just the case. The story wasn't that appealing as Matrix was. The real life sequences were far more interesting than the whole visual effects side that got overlong boring and nowadays dated. I was trying not to sleep in many parts of that long race between the characters something like a car chase scene but instead of cars running chips and programs chasing each other. Jeff Bridges holds this movie very well and David Warner plays the usual villain as he almost always does. But if you want to see these two actors in a good movie go rent The Big Lebowski in which Bridges star or Time After Time an awesome scifi movie starring Warner as villain. I only watched this movie because 1 In 2005 The Strokes one of my favorite rock bands made a video clip for the song 1251 in which TRON was used as reference to the whole thing. Very Interesting by the way. And 2 I heard that TRON Legacy is going to be released this year so I thought Let's see what this movie has of interesting. And the result came to nowhere. And I'm glad that Supertramp another of my favorite groups wasn't available to contribute to songs in this wreck. The music in the movie by the way is so strangely executed.The dated visual effects has some charming things that remind us of the 1980's with a twinkle in the eyes. After all who doesn't love the movies of that decade? I loved the visual concept of the movie along with the brilliant and themed costume designs Oscar nominated. But its slowed rhythm story and its lack of expectation lack of a better climax just ruined the movie for me. I hope that TRON Legacy became a better project. At least I know it's going to be because Lisberger is not directing the movie but his hands are in the screenplay again so let's hope he makes something good this time. 210".

	schema:reviewBody "And to think as lackluster boring and trite the year 2010 for movies has turned out I was really looking forward to Tron Legacy. Even without seeing the original. Ever.Maybe it was because one of my alltime favorite arcade games was and still is Tron. Perhaps it was the wonderful trailers? Or the fact I love Jeff Bridges and give The Dude kudos for making a wellmade decision on making a moviesequel.So naturally I have to see the first one first before venturing into the winter of 2010's only promising release. After growing up on the game the theme music and the anticipation of the almost 20 yearfollowup I must say what a letdown.I don't want to take away from what the original writersdirector created here. Surely they had something going for them in 1982 an original idea a complex action film with futuristic graphics  for its time. Does it hold up? Apparently not in my opinion since I had the privilege of watching for the first time in 2010.I'm not knocking the graphics. I simply can't  that was the technology back then. And they even showed things like the touch screens that had years left to be developed. So good for them. But my problem was that there was just too much. They wanted to be too many movies wrapped into one without focusing on the center of the plot. Or any heart. You wanted to care for some of the characters but they were so thrust onto the screen with little to no background and then yanked away to make room for more plot developments. And speaking of which there were so many plots and subplots it was hard to keep up where this movie was going.Recently I watched Disney's other big liveaction blockbuster relatively in the same era The Black Hole and as much as I rated only 35 stars at least that had a central idea and went with it. Tron is all over the place and requires several viewings to get it all straight.Let's see it's been about a week since I've seen Tron and I'm going to try to remember all that it was about or all the subplots Oust developer Kevin Flynn Bridges is recruited to thwart a supercomputer i.e. Hal from 2001 master program who is gaining a bunch of power from miniprograms to be the ultimate dominator. Years later this would be portrayed in The Lawnmower Man Terminator Salvation or The Matrix.Meanwhile there's the corporate bigwig who wants the same thing a rouge exgirlfriend bent on stopping the madness and Flynn who's inadvertently thrown into the game or program to prove himself against the computer's main competitive baddie.This is how forgettable this movie is aside from those who first viewed it in 1982. It has only been a week and I've already forgotten the dozen or so subplots and reasons for the movie. I guess suffice to say it's a heartwhelming story of the dangers of technology and despite the limitations of 1982 graphics it will be really fleshed out in decades to follow with much better products. A good idea at the time but just have patience audience and you'll have a much better movie to watch. And to follow.Will I still see the sequel? Of course. I'm still looking forward to it and hopefully will watch the progression and ironing out the problems with the original. Also I give a plus to Disney for not following the recent trend of rebooting and sticking with the timehonored tradition of simply releasing a SEQUEL.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tron reminds me of another oneword titled film that relied on special effects to bring in money Them! from 1954. Neither film's effects hold up over the years. That is where the comparison fades since Them! bizarrely is the only one of the two with a slight focus on dialogue and plot. Tron lacks all the vital elements for a good film and instead hurls us into a nonsensical world of pastel colors and cheesy effects. Dialogue and plot may not exist within the mind of a superintelligent computer but any somewhatintelligent human should be wondering where they are. With shots and ideas stolen directly from Star Wars something must have gone wrong at a fundamental level to make Tron look like Star Wars's ugly cousin.The suspension of disbelief is important for a viewer to have when watching a movie. Tron is certainly no slice of life but has characters that look very much like a slice of key lime pie. I am well aware that the possibility of Jeff Bridges being transported into a computer is fairly slim. It does not especially bother me that Tron Yori and Sark all look like people he knows in the real world. For all I know he could just be really really high. But the fact that Flynn Bridges and Tron and Yori are all wandering around in costumes that Star Wars's stormtroopers would laugh hysterically at sort of grates my nerves. The film is not the visual feast it thinks it is. Honestly the film is not remotely entertaining. The sense of urgency we are required to feel in this adventure does not seem plausible when one stops to think If a user's program took this long to contact me when I tried talking to it I would go outside and play baseball and maybe hope it would talk to me in an hour or two. There is no urgency. There is no logic in Master Control's desire to take over the world. In fact that is a subplot so desperate to draw us into the story that the movie is obviously using scare tactics to convince us we think it is cool. Yes Master Control you are so cool. You shrunk Jeff Bridges. You are making him perform tedious tasks instead of killing him when he obviously would waste no time in killing you. You know Tron's a pretty capable hero. I think he would make it OK without Jeff Bridges but never underestimate star power in a bad Disney film. He even manages to kiss Yori without making her short circuit in a proud tradition of female Disney characters who could not possibly be more onedimensional.There are no impressive twists or turns in this film and not a single catchy oneliner to be heard in a string of flat dialogue. The film lacks charm story but at least I can be glad we have come a long way since 1982... sort of.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen Tron Legacy at Christmas I've spent the week or so since then trying to track down the movie that Legacy is a sequel to 1982's Tron. If you're like me and have been doing the same then the following will come as no surprise it has become rather hard andor expensive to find thanks to it being out of print and highly in demand. So imagine my surprise when I went into a local Blockbuster with a friend and found a DVD of it sitting on the shelf. Needless to say I scooped it up and rented it! So given that I had seen the more recent sequel first what did I make of the original movie?For starters it has a pretty good cast. Leading the cast is Jeff Bridges as computer programmer turned arcadeowing hacker Kevin Flynn whose attempts to prove that his work was stolen by a rival programmer leads to him being sent into the digital world of the movie. Bridges gives Flynn an eccentric yet everyman quality that while perhaps not serving the character best in the opening part of the movie works perfectly when the character of Flynn ends up trying to make sense of the digital world he finds himself in. Bruce Boxleitner plays computer programmer Alan Bradley and his creation the heroic security program named Tron. The two are very different characters and at times it is hard to believe that are being played by the same actor. Aiding them in both the real and digital world are Cindy Morgan as Lora and Yori and Barnard Hughes as Dr. Walter Gibbs and Dumont who like Boxleitner find ways of making each of their characters different from the other. Opposing them and perhaps giving the best performances in the movie is David Warner as program stealing executive Ed Dillinger in the real world as being both the digital world menace of Sark and the electronically distorted voice of the the dictatorial Master Control Program. Put all these actors together and the result is that they give this digitally set movie a human grounding.Which brings us to perhaps the most iconic part of the movie the digital world the majority of the movie takes place in. Given that the nearly thirty years that have passed since the movie was made have seen a true revolution in special effects one might expect that the effects including some of the earliest CGI effects would look rather pass now. The truth of the matter is in fact quite different the digital world of Tron is a truly immersive and highly original one.The production design costumes and effects all go towards creating that unique world. The production design imagines a digital world that is both alien and yet familiar with its take on tanks ships and perhaps most famously cars in the form of light cycles. Then there are all of the unique costumes of the digital characters with their stark whiteness contrasted by the illuminations of the apparent circuitry on them with a truly unusual look being the result. Last but not least on this list is all of the effects work. The effects would seemingly be the most dated part of the original Tron and to some extent this is true on the surface. But if you scratch below the surface you'll discover that those seemingly dated effects are surprisingly effective. Two perfect examples can be found in the light cycle gaming sequence where there is a point of view shot that gives the viewer a true sensation of speeding along a maze of lines or during the chase sequence that follows directly on from it when the camera follows two ships that are pursuing the escaping light cycles. If you are however looking at the effects of the movie cynically from the viewpoint of today's CGI here is another way of looking at them within the logic of the movie the film is set and uses early 1980s computers and therefore it makes perfect sense that the digital world reflects the technology of the time rather the more advanced and evolved digital world seen in Legacy. Back to the main point the result of all these elements put together is that the digital world setting of the film remains both unique and immersive almost thirty years on.No review of the film though would be complete without a discussion of its script or storyline. The basic plot of Tron are quite simplistic in the real world Flynn is trying to prove that Dillinger stole his programs to further his own career while in the digital world Flynn and Tron end up on a quest to save to free that world from the tyrannical reign of Dillinger's Master Control Program and its minion Sark. The dialogue too is often as simplistic as the plot and can be at times either corny or cringeworthy. Yet Tron's script and story are full of fascinating ideas Programs acting as avatars of their programmers with deletions being their literal death or derezzing information and programs being sent along by incredible vehicles with energy or light used as paths and and even religious undertones to the relationship of programs to their users. Tron then on the script and story level is very much driven by its ideas rather then its own plot. As a result Tron on the script and story level is very much driven by its ideas rather then its own plot.While it may be lacking in plot Tron makes up for that in other ways. That includes the cast which makes the most of the duel roles that most of them have. Where it does that mainly though is in the immersive digital world it is set in and the ideas that lie behind it. Tron therefore is perhaps more a triumph of style over substance but it more then makes up for that fact.".

	schema:headline " This Is Why We Have Pixar Movies";
	schema:reviewBody "John Lasseter once said that without Tron there would be no Toy Story. While working as a Disney animator Lasseter caught a glimpse of the light cycle chase from Tron and his eyes opened up to what could be accomplished with computers and computer technology. Thus he would go onto be one of the founding fathers of Pixar which of course has spun a massive web since it's inception in the mid 80s. Of course Lasseter and the people at Pixar weren't the only ones inspired by this film. The French band Daft Punk was inspired by the film's electronic score and video game like sound effects so much so that they even assisted Hans Zimmer in composing the score for Tron's sequel. But for how groundbreaking Tron was when it first hit theaters back in 1982 is it even a good movie? Is it's story compelling and relatable and can we see ourselves as parallels to the characters of the movie? I would say so. It's all how you look at it. Tron still holds up incredibly well 31 years after it's original release and while the effects can be a bit wonky from time to time they give the movie a certain edge and stylized feel. When I think of this movie shades of blue red orange and black come to mind for those are the colors seen frequently throughout the picture and the fact that some of the effects look grainy at times really makes the film's environment look more digitized in my eyes. I also like the look of the characters particularly Tron Sark and the Master Control Program who looks like Zordon's cousin three times removed. He spins around freezes when he wants to talk to someone and his voice provided by David Warner the same guy who plays Sark is one of the most intimidating voices I've ever heard. You could take this guy's voice and put it over Darth Vader. It's just that awesome and mighty.The acting is pretty decent. Jeff Bridges is great as always playing the fun loving schmuck Kevin Flynn who plays video games better than anybody and Bruce Boxleitner is a gallant Alan BradleyTron who is determined to take out the MCP and bring balance back to the cyber world. He's the Chosen One in some ways and the most heroic out of the programs although Kevin Flynn builds up his bravery and assists Tron in the MCP's defeat. David Warner has that presence to him that really makes him a force to be reckoned with and his portrayal of Sark and the MCP stand apart from all the other film's performances. Every time this guy enters the picture you can just tell that some crap is going to hit the fan. He's plays two of Disney's most memorable adversaries and he's probably my favorite player out of the film. He also plays similar characters in Titanic Star Trek 5 and 6 and he even plays the voice of Ra's Al Ghul in Batman The Animated Series.The last thing I must talk about is the film's awesome score and sound effects. As I said before this is what inspired Daft Punk to do what they do and it's not that hard to see why they got so enraptured. The film's score composed by Wendy Carlos is an electronic feast for the ears with a very exciting blood rushing excellence only accomplished through computer chips. It's so catchy that they even used the music in the Tron arcade game just listen to the film's score and then listen to the music from the game. It's identical. And the sound effects really make this film feel like a video game movie. Every time a character walks there's this slight clink noise and the sound effects for the disk throwing the light cycles and the character deaths makes me feel like I'm standing right in front of an arcade cabinet playing a game from the golden age. They really do a good job of making you feel part of the Tron universe and adding that bit of magic that takes you out of reality and places you in the realms of a digital fantasy.Tron is an all around great thriller and would change Disney forever. Perhaps without Tron there would be no Toy Story 3 or Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo. Maybe Disney wouldn't have had their grand Renaissance. Maybe special effects wouldn't have progressed the way they did. Maybe Jeff Bridges wouldn't be the highly profitable actor he is today. It all makes you think doesn't it?".

TRON came out way before it's time and took us to a place noone had ever been before. Looking back its amazing to see where computer technology was in 1982 and where it stands in the present. David Warner is the usual english villian which he plays perfectly Jeff Bridges is a confident but likeable Kevin Flynn and Bruce Boxleitner brings out the warrior in the title role as TRON. I couldn't recommend TRON enough to anyone who hasn't seen it. Long may it stand the test of time and continue to endure for another 20 years and beyond.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lee ChangDong recently got a lot of attention when his latest movie OASIS one multiple Korean awards. OASIS is a unique movie that examines of the lives and loves of characters who normally do not get much attention from cinema or the public. It's an unusual sort of love story and was a bad choice to watch with my girlfriend on Valentine's Day. ChangDong's directorial debut GREEN FISH is a far less ambitious film but still shows the work of a talented and mature director.Makdong Han SukKyu is a naive young man who returns home after his spell in the army full of hopes and small ambitions. Now that he's a man he wants to make a lot of money and be able to look after his family. Unfortunately when he gets home he is treated to a little dose of reality. The area is economically depressed and his family are not the close loving unit he wishes them to be.Making lots of money proves to be a lot more difficult than he anticipated as jobs in the area are pretty scarce. One area that does offer employment is crime as the area is controlled by the gangs. A chance encounter with a young woman leads him to meet a gang boss who seems to be a little more respectable than most and when he's told he won't have to break the law he accepts a job.The boss takes a liking to Makdong's simplicity and straightforward character and looks after him well to the resentment of other members of the gang. Despite the promise of legitimacy he learns that gangs cannot really live by the law and he gets drawn further into the criminal life.GREEN FISH is a distinctly Korean film which is not to say that all Korean films are the same clearly not the case but there are a few styles of film that do seem especially Korean and this is one of them. It is a slowly paced and subtle film allowing the story and characters to reveal themselves indirectly through the strength of the acting. The cast are all strong actors and this allows the style of film to work. The story of an innocent young man drawn into the gangster world is not really a new one and GREEN FISH does not try to add much that is new to it. It just focusses on the characters their hopes and conflicts and their disappointments. The tone is not one of hope or happiness with economic worries making reality hard. None of the characters in the movie are angels and none are devils  instead they are much more realistic human beings full of good intentions and weaknesses. GREEN FISH is perhaps a little too subtle or perhaps the actors are not quite good enough for the director's ambitions. Either way the characters remain a little vague to us and our involvement with their stories is hence slightly diminished. It is still a movie of strong characters however and a well told story until the slightly weak ending.Korea produces some very strong dramas with a high level of art being found in much of the nation's cinematic output. GREEN FISH is an accomplished debut that fits well with recent Korean cinema though it is a little too conservative to be classed in the higher ranks. Good for a first film though and Lee ChangDong is definitely a director to keep an eye out for.".

Wanting to return the scarf Makdong discovers that the woman is being harassed by three hoodlums. His interceding allows the woman to get away but Makdong receives a beating for his efforts. It seems at first Makdong is going to let this slide but when the three men get off the train the young former soldier follows and cracks one of the three on back of the head with an award he received from the army.Makdong eventually returns to his widowed mother's home where she resides with his physically disabled older brother. Before his father died the family home had been well kept. However the following years had been unkind so the house fell into disrepair. Makdong soon learns that his mother does housekeeping work to keep herself afloat. Makdong dislikes this and tells his mother to cease working as a housekeeper. He goes on to say that he will earn lots of money to take care of her. These are big words for someone without a job.Makdong's two other older brothers are not in much better shape. One sells eggs for a living and the other is a cuckolded police officer. Things seem to be going nowhere for our hero until he encounters Miae the woman from the train in a nightclub. It turns out that Miae is the unwilling girlfriend of Bae Taegon a high ranking member of the Korean mafia. Bae is impressed by Makdong's willingness to fight and later in the film after Makdong clubs one of Bae's men on the head with a wooden post the former soldier becomes a member of Bae's family. Green Fish is an interesting film. It has its moments of family tenderness and heartbreak and is also peppered throughout with gang violence. One of the most interesting relationships within the film is the one shared between Miae and Bae. Although Bae continuously tells Miae that he loves her it seems that she is little more than a tool for him to use meaning that she sleeps with whomever Bae tells her to. In one of the saddest parts of the film Miae asks Makdong If he wants to sleep with her. She says it is okay if he wants to everyone else has slept with her.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is director Lee ChangDong's first film of three and the third that I've seen after his wellmade films Peppermint Candy and Oasis. It's a story of a young man who is recently discharged from the standard military service that young Corean men are required to serve and finds that life or the real world is a lot harsher than his idealistic self would've expected. He soon finds himself dragged into the Corean underworld out of necessity and finds his idealism and the idealism of all those around him at odds with reality.In a greater sense this film is about the constant struggle between chasing your dreams and dealing with the harsh reality. All the primary characters the mob boss the female lead and the protagonist all have their dreams and ambitions building a great property from the ashes of his youth escaping the prostitute's life and living a normal one owning a restaurant with his family but are struck by the world's reality which forms itself as an enemy mob the mob bosses' controlling nature and the young protagonist's dysfunctional family.It's a study of the nature of the relatively modern world of Corea and the inevitable clash of youthful idealism and experienced reality. And it doesn't take too many sides either although the ending does seem to show that action and sacrifice even unintended is what's necessary to keep yourself from being beaten down by reality.It's a slowlypaced art film with quiet but contemplative character development modest acting and capable directing. Directer Lee still hasn't fully gained a strong grasp of storytelling yet as a director at this point as the film as it's sometimes difficult to make out why anything's happening in the film but the potential shows as well with honest characters and patient development. A good start but you can see the Director side of Lee ChangDong really start to pick up with his later films. It's decent. 710.".

The story is about Mak Dong who has been released from the army returning back to his home village finding it a completely new place no longer a village but now a bustling town. Struggling to find his place in a different environment Mak Dong happens to fall upon a chance to work for Bae TseYong who isn't particularly running business according to the law.ChangDong Lee is really a great storyteller and he is great at portraying people that aren't exactly normal. His characters in his movies are very vibrant and full of personality and life despite them having been dealt a bad hand from life. And if you enjoyed Green Fish then you definitely need to watch Oasis as well.It never ceases to amaze me the amount of amazingly beautiful movies that come out of Asia. Green Fish will stay with you for a long time after you have seen it. And it had the most memorable death scene in a movie that I have seen since Willem Dafoe's death scene in Platoon.Green Fish is really a brutally honest movie that plays high on emotion and empathy. I enjoyed this movie quite a lot and highly recommend you to watch it if you like Asian cinema.".

Yes there are a few subplots and themes that make you want to follow the story and promise it to be an interesting one but somehow I feel the narrative does not gather the strength that it could have achieved to make it a remarkable story. At this stage and age it is very difficult to exploit the exploited and a simple change of setting does not work miracles. If there is something that works well for the film it must be the character insight however this does not make up for all of its weaknesses. In all not a bad movie but I would not really recommend it as enthusiastically as others have done. Korean cinema has much higher quality representatives than this one.".

It is very out of character for such a great dramatic actor but slides into his comedic role effortlessly and flawlessly. The comedy duo of Charles Laughton and Robert Young in this film will never rank as high as Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy or even Hope and Crosby but I see it as a brilliant discovery of comedy chemistry. Had Hollywood developed this comedy team I think we would see some Oscars from their efforts. This movie has a great plot good character development and fresh clean comedy.

He is doomed to haunt the Canterville castle until a fellow member of the family can commit an act of bravery and thus lift the cowardly stain that has besmirched the Canterville name.Doesn't sound much like a comedy does it !! but it is and a very amiable one at that. Loosely based on Oscar Wilde's story of the same name The Canterville Ghost benefits from a couple of charming performances from Charles Laughton as Simon and from a young Margaret O'Brien as Lady Jessica de Canterville. Laughton is clearly enjoying himself as the ghost heavy on the woe is me theatrics coupled with gusto comedy it's a very enjoyable performance from the big man. O'Brien is here enjoying being the center of attention and she positively lights up every scene she is in with youthful exuberance. The story follows a well trodden path to its rewarding ending but it's a fun ride getting there regardless things really pick up a pace once a platoon of American soldiers are billeted at the castle and we are introduced to Cuffy Williams Robert Young a descendant Canterville of course but he himself is showing a line in cowardice so we are then left wondering if Cuffy can indeed show bravery and thus free Simon from his ghostly duties ?.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Margaret O'Brien tries to help one of her longdead ancestors in The Canterville Ghost a 1944 film also starring Charles Laughton Robert Young and Frank Faylen. Jessica de Canterville's O'Brien family owns a castle which is being used to house soldiers during their stay in the area. The castle has a very famous ghost named Sir Simon de Canterville Charles Laughton whose father had him imprisoned inside a wall for cowardice centuries earlier. Simon roams the castle looking like the Cowardly Lion in royal costume. The only way he can rest for eternity is if a relative performs a courageous act in his name i.e. by taking his signet ring and wearing it when he does the brave thing. Alas the entire family for centuries has run the other way when danger appears so Simon isn't having any luck. When sixyearold Lady Jessica de Canterville realizes that one of the soldiers is related to her she begs him to help poor tired Simon.This is a wonderful movie buoyed by the presence of Margaret O'Brien surely one of the most adorable children to ever hit the screen. She's a fine actress too  very sincere and natural. Although Mary Astor wrote in her diary that she was terrified of O'Brian during the filming of Meet Me in St. Louis it's kind of hard to believe. Charles Laughton turns in another masterful performance as Simon who scares people because he thinks that as a ghost it's what he should do. He's a riot. As Cuffy Williams the soldier related to Jessica and Simon Robert Young is very good as a man who begins to doubt his own courage.The Canterville Ghost is loads of fun for the entire family with plenty of comedy and some nice lessons one of which is when you really want something you often need patience until you achieve it.".

What's the catch? Simon was condemned by his own father for being a coward and the Canterville line ever since has been a long line of cowards. The greatest irony of the movie is that Simon has developed a reputation as the most fearsome ghost in all of England! Finding a hero among this family won't be easy. Then along comes Cuffy Williams Young an American soldier whose platoon is billeted in the castle during the leadup to DDay. It turns out that Williams is a very distant descendant of the Cantervilles and DDay of course will provide the ultimate opportunity to show his bravery and to release Simon from his torment. The question is whether he'll be able to work up the courage to do it!Laughton and Young offer excellent performances and the very young Margaret O'Brien who would have been about 7 when this was made is convincing as Lady Jessica de Canterville. Some of the scenes as the American soldiers try to chase down the ghost to get a picture of him to prove that he exists to their commanding officer are also quite funny. 810".

Margaret O'Brien is also splendid and it is hard to believe so much talent projects out of a six year old girl. Charles Laughton is memorable in his fine delivery of both pathos and comedic skills.A highlight of the film for me is the music played by the G.I.s. at a local party. Music is classic 40's 8 to the bar visually punctuated with awesome jitterbugging by the soldiers. A proper female British spectator comments to an incredulous priest I believe they call it woogie boogie. It is unknown what what the song title or who the recording artists may have been however credits list original music for the film as provided by George Bassman.".

Out of shame and embarrassment his father bricked him up in a room in the manor and pronounced the aforementioned curse upon him.Breaking that curse is easier said than done because the cowardice was passed down several generations from Stuart England to World War II.Enter a platoon of American rangers quartered at the manor house where the current lady of the manor Margaret O'Brien is like so many in Great Britain in those years playing host to American GIs. One in that platoon is a distant cousin from America Robert Young. Will he perform the deed that frees Charles Laughton?

This is a difficult part and only an actor of real talent and skill could carry it off. The comic elements are nicely done but Laughton also has to project an air of resigned sadness at the fate he's been cursed with.

This is though a silly and entertaining movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family.This was my first introduction to Margaret O'Brien and she won me over with her sweet charm. As a platoon of U.S. soldiers hold up in the haunted Canterville castle they are excited by the news that they are to be welcomed by Lady Jessica de Canterville herself. The boys are surprised when Lady Jessica happens to be a 312' tall 6yearold. She plays hostess to the GI's and tells them of the residing ghost. Their disbelief is soon tested by the late night antics of Sir Simon Charles Laughton who has inhabited the castle in his ghostly form for over 300 years. He has been condemned to this state of purgatory for his cowardice which can only be relieved by a blood descendant performing an act of bravery in his stead.Having seen Charles Laughton in 'The Private Life of Henry VIII' 'Mutiny on the Bounty' and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' I was surprised to see him in this role as a clumsy silly ghost. As usual he is wonderful. A master thespian who can handle comedy as well as drama.I highly recommend this film to anyone young or old who just wants an hour and a half of amusement.".

Personally I never got her charm as a child actress but I am willing to say that she is at her most tolerable in THE CANTERVILLE GHOST. But still her acting always seemed stilted and selfconscious like a little girl who knew she was good at reciting lines and making them sound reasonably convincing.However nothing she can do to distract me is really worth commenting on because the film belongs almost exclusively to a mostly delightful script except for the last sequence that gives CHARLES LAUGHTON the chance to playwith his usual gustothe role of a cowardly ghost who has been haunting a castle in England for over 300 years and must keep on doing so until a distant relative can redeem him by a single act of bravery.ROBERT YOUNG is that relative and he's genuinely attractive and amusing in a role that is less bland than usual for Young. He does show a nice bit of chemistry with his little costar. A bunch of American soldiers in 1943 are well cast with RAGS RAGLAND doing most of the funny business while other soldiers like WILLIAM GARGAN and FRANK FAYLEN do their best to give the cast some class. All of the scenes involving the antics of these servicemenincluding a fun party scene featuring the jitterbug dance of two soldiersare pleasant to watch.For light entertainment with an unusual slant this is one of the better vehicles MGM found for Margaret O'Brien and her particular brand of child actress. As stated above I found her more tolerable than usual in this one.".

She was great in Meet me in St. Louis and she was great in this one. I would really desire for this movie to be released on DVD in Amazon or something because 34 weeks ago I have just finished this movie on VHS tape and I thought it was a really good movie to recommend to old movie fans. I would have to say Margaret O'Brien is probably great in all her movies although I haven't seen all of them yet but I am looking forward to checking all of her child stars movies out before checking her when she was older like The secret gardenolder. Margaret O'Brien has just been great acting like every time she cried I started tearing up and started sobbing a little like MMISL she was really great playing Tootie and her little cry at the end. Margaret O'Brien is just a great character to adore as much as little Bailee Madison or Judith Barsi. They were really close to tearing up the audience near Margaret O'Brien but if Judith Barsi was still here I would be very happy about that that she will be great as an Adult and teenanger.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Lawford's part in the beginning of the movie was unusual in that he first seems to be an effeminate young fellow picking flowers rather than joining in with the manly deer hunt and then we find he has a lady in there with him and not his lady. Conveniently he says his sword arm is sliced to the bone although it doesn't look all that bad and he passes the duel on to his unfortunate kinsman who is later walled up by his father. When we learn that the entire family line was made up of cowards it puts a different complexion on everyone's actions and makes for an adult sort of kids' movie. It seems that cowardice was either common in that region or the other party in the duel was some sort of relative too. What we and O'Brien and Young's characters learn in this movie is that courage is mind over matter not genetics and that anyone old or young can be terrified but not everyone folds like a cheap card table whether confronted by a ghost or the enemy. Young teaches it to O'Brien and she later has to remind him of it. That is good to keep in mind in any era but especially in wartime when frightening rumors could send people into hysterics rendering them not only useless but dangerous. If the poor ghost had when alive stood up to his relatives he could have avoided the dire events. Instead he ended up cowering in a corner in shame and allowing himself to be bricked in. This story and the Wizard of Oz have a common themethe way you perceive yourself alters your actions.".

The costumes and sets are simply beautiful and lovingly photographed and directed while the music is fitting with the film and story's mood. The script is on the whole delightful piling it on with the fun and charm. And I can say little wrong about the performances either. Charles Laughton plays the title role with real gusto and Margaret O'Brien is suitably cute as a button and exuberant.

Not only do the great actors of those days and the screen writing teach us what real life courtesy care concern and speech are like they can still flood our minds with hope! Not to say that good movies aren't still made because they are! And not say that everyone was rosy and good then either. But this movie still retains a way and tugs on our minds and hearts to still be good people to not give in to the epithets of the present U.S. culture of 2007. It only takes honesty care understanding concern and kindred souls to realize that we all are one on this planet and may more planets than just this one. And actors such as Charles Laughton Margaret O'Brien Robert Young Rags Ragland Una O'Connor Reginald Owen and so many more continue to teach us in ways that many of our present day actors will never be able to. And I'm not sure why!?! And isn't it interesting that 2 GIs can dance together and do it wonderfully well and it IS art!! And yet done today people would look at all of that and make lurid judgments!! And a 7 year old could act with the likes of a Charles Laughton and we don't jump to all kinds of disreputable conclusions at might happen today. I am thankful for movies and stories such as this. I am thankful for people such as Oscar Wilde Edmin Blum and Jules Dassin. Unfortunately the telling of the realities of war though although not as graphic then as now maybe that's not a bad thing are still as haunting today as back then. But rather than end on a sad note I say let us all raise a glass to the hope that is part of the movies of such as the like as Charles Laughton and to the hope that will continue in many ways in today's movies. I know they are there. I watch too many not to understand that. It's just that times were different.

As a result of this infamy he is cursed to remain a ghost until a relative can perform a brave deeda tough order to fill because the next 300 years saw coward after coward pass down the family line! Now cut to 1943 and a regiment of American soldiers in the UK is stationed in Canterville Castlethe place haunted by the sad ghost. Through some coincidences only possible in movies American soldier Robert Young discovers he's related to the nice ghost and realizes he can break the curse by performing gallantly at war.THE CANTERVILLE GHOST is an enjoyable filmthanks mostly to a rather saccharinelike yet enjoyable performance by young Margaret O'Brien. On one hand she's so adorable that the cynical out there might just dismiss the whole thing. But on the other at age 6 she was already a better actress than many adult professionals and only a true curmudgeon could hate her! When I was younger I was not a particular fan of Margaret's hence I was more of a curmudgeon but over the years I have really come to appreciate her charm and talent.O'Brien is supported by Charles Laughton as the ghost and Robert Young. Laughton was often the scene stealer in films with his acting and occasional overacting but here his blustery style was just fine for the ghost. As for Young he had a typical nice guy performance. Considering how well he worked with O'Brien in this and other films it's not surprising that he was later cast as America's Dad on television.So with some wonderful performances most of the movie is lovelytypical MGM family fare with nice directing writing and the full glossy treatment. The only problem is that towards the end the film switched gear and became a kooky filmsomething that tended to cheapen the film significantly. While only a few minutes earlier Young was off bravely fighting the Nazis and the tension was great just a bit later he was dragging a time bomb across the field in a scene that looked more at home in an Abbott and Costello film. Seeing the jeep jumping about wildly while towing a bomb through the middle of the regiment just looked dumb and by the way this is NOT the best method of bomb disposal. This scene was a sad decision because the rest of the film was delightful. Still even with this dumb finale the film is solidly entertaining and you may just find your heartstrings tugged by sweet Margaret. And if not you'll still probably enjoy the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a most accomplished movie and haunting. From the first moments of bricking in to the final absolution of the ghost it follows a poetic course and is one of the greatest of redemption movies. But it's not available as DVD in UK and I doubt it's been shown on UK TV in the last 30 years. Is there a copyright problem with it? One would have thought not. Have the producers of the later movie buried it? Surely not. Charles Laughton's role here is deeply affecting  and given knowledge of his homosexuality the portrayal of the failed knight unable to compete in the jousts and ostracised by his community and family becomes even more affecting. His equivalent is the poor lion in the Wizard of Oz.His redemption comes of course with the arrival of the unflappable American family and especially their loving daughter who sees qualities in the poor knight that were never seen before. This is a lovely film that needs to be seen more often.".

From the first moments of bricking in to the final absolution of the ghost it follows a poetic course and is one of the greatest of redemption movies. But it's not available as DVD in UK and I doubt it's been shown on UK TV in the last 30 years. Is there a copyright problem with it? One would have thought not.

Charles Laughton the ghost and Margaret O'Brien The little girl Robert Young as the distantly American nephew related to the ghost. It starts out fine with a typical MGM opening with much fanfare a steeple chase fox and hounds outing in the 1600's where a cowardly Lord of the Canterville Family bungles a duel of honor and ends up walled inside of the castle and haunts it for 300 years until an Army platoon occupies in during WWII. The special effects are sterling as the ghost tries his best to haunt the English Estate but the GI's are not scared and make great fun of him instead. Having seen this as a stageplay and read the book this change of time and conditions make for a far inferior story although Ms. O'Brien playing age 6 but probably older is fine and so are Charles Laughton. Mr. Young is only fair. Had the writers kept the war out of it this could have been much better. Fun but disappointing. Little Margaret makes this movie worth your time.

	schema:reviewBody "After writing a phd dissertation and spending months doing research on the Alamo at The DRT library and across Texas I became convinced that I might not live long enough to see a theatrical release that would finally do the history justice. The IMAX Alamo film is very good along historical lines but due to budget limitations not to mention physiological IMAX constraints it did not capture the scope and depth of the event. But make no mistake about it  this Alamo film does both. The Alamo's major participants are three dimensional flesh and blood mirror images of those one will find in their diaries letters books and first hand accounts of those who knew them. Even the Mexican dictator Antonio Lopez Miguel De Santa Anna is no longer a cardboard demon  he anticipates what Mexico will become without the stern hand that must come down to crush the American pirates. Also for the first time the Tejanos who fought against their brothers and sisters in the Texas cause are well represented. The battle sequences culled from Santa Anna's own battle plans and the accounts of those who carried them out and those who survived leave no nuance to the imagination and vividly demonstrate that even a chaotic retreat can turn into an unmanageable enemy force overwhelming the west and north walls of the Alamo. The bloodbath fury chaos and desperation pulls the viewer into the center of a swirling vortex of courage and carnage. Patrick Wilson is his superb as Colonel William Barret Travis the defacto commandante of the doomed fortress. For once the multi emotional Travis is captured with all of the guilt ridden memories of his humiliating trial in Alabama and the indecision that plagues his early confrontations with his sceptical Texan force. The ennui and angst of command did take a toll. But Travis' courage and conviction converge in a heart wrenching moment in front of his command making the case for death with purpose. Jason Patric makes one wicked Jim Bowie and the fact that the Congress of the U.S is still trying to unravel some of his land swindles initiated almost two centuries ago underscores his portrayal. Bowie's legendary prowess in brawling bilking and beating those around him is well known and Patrick's every move makes you instantly and consistently aware that Bowie was every bit the bad ass. But Bowie was also a romantic of epic proportions and flashbacks to his tragic marriage to Ursula Verimendi give a poignant underpinning to his deadliness. Billy Bob Thornton steals the show as David Crockett  but then  how could he miss? As Dennis Quaid said Billy Bob is David Crockett  A hillbilly actor playing a hillbilly actor. Thornton's performance is staggering. A self proclaimed over achiever and withering self critic Thornton understands the very human David Crockett of his autobiography and letters juxtaposed with the Davy Crockett of legends. It is a harrowing performance  particularly when Crockett realizes the Alamo is doomed. David Crockett might drop over these walls and take his chances he confides to Bowie. But Davy Crockett the legend cannot. People expect things he tells Bowie. I've been on these walls all my life. There is a palor and sadness that is worked beautifully by the modest film score. The photography paints Greek tragedy. These were and are real people. Many many fans of the John Wayne ALAMO miss the overblown but fun saintliness of the celluloid 60's epic.For some THE ALAMO 2004 is filled with defenders who were too human historical facts be damned. But when Micajah Autrey and David die I couldn't help but feel the pain of retrospection they both felt at that horrible moment. Add to this a wealth of metaphysical angst that is a subscript of this masterpiece. Tejano Catholic Voodoo guarantees the time place and purpose of Bowie's demise. Did it matter? a dying Bowie asks a doomed Travis. Buck's face is a mask of hope and despair. These men will die not knowing if giving their lives will matter to anyone but themselves. Director John Lee Hancock does a marvelous job with subtleties that encompass great portions of Travis Bowie and Crockett 's personality in particular. Did Crockett intentionally hit Santa Anna's epaulet? A second viewing revealed a gold reflection in the pupil of David's eye as he fires. How did Crockett die? He dies going down swinging inside the Alamo Church  but you never see his body. He dies a second time as one who refused to surrender. But you never see his body. ...And in the beginning of the film as you see the bodies of the defenders being carted away you see Bowie and Travis but not Crockett's. The last scene of the film is not a replay of the Crockett fiddle scene. There he is playing over a nighttime San Antonio alone  with no one in sight  and Billy Bob's David satisfied and almost bemused face in the final scene. What a gorgeous shot and a perfect way of tipping the hat to legend as well as a establishing while questioning the nature of immortality. When history is relevance and universal what more could we ask? I feel for the people who made this movie. In this climate of blind nationalism  embracing history not despite of its flaws but because of them will not garner the recognition this film so richly deserves. There are those that truly appreciate your efforts and applaud you for THE ALAMO fim I've waited to see all of my life. This one like the real battle will be remembered. Thank you so much!".

It is a sad commentary on the preferences of our society in general when a film this good and on this type of subject does so poorly. I hate to pose this question but could it be due to a Texaswar backlash due to our current administration and the Iraq situation? Or as a moviegoing public do we prefer to be dumbeddown these days?

The historical aspect was perfect. I've read up on the Alamo before and all the details were accurate the clothing guns uniformsthe way the battle unfolded and even the weather. The acting especially Billy Bob Thornton's was excellent. Almost Oscar worthy. The casting was just as good. Each actor fits their rolls with almost uncanny perfection. Although Hancock isn't quite Spielberg he is exceptional because he did a good job on the film and he put a LOT of care into it. no props stage lighting a 50 acre set not to mention historically perfectThe Alamo is no doubt a controversial film. Those who slam it seem to revert to the fact that it should have been directed by Ron Howard and been more gory glamorized and shouldn't have been so compressed the original version was over 3 hours. More Hollywood is basically what they're saying. It's these same people who compare it to John Wayne's version saying it should have focused on artistic merits rather than history. Personally I don't know if these people would know the whole PURPOSE of the Alamo if it ran over them with a steamroller. Hancock's vision was to make an Alamo that actually had some history to it. He wanted to tell the story right for once. The way I see it The Alamo has as many if not more artistic merits of John Wayne's version but adds historical accuracy and tells it true without sacrifcing the drama. The acting casting and directing are great the historical value superb and the battles especailly on widescreen are breathtaking. Sure it would have been better with more scenes and blood but this is the best Alamo movie I've ever seen and a good film anyway. Not perfect but pretty darn close. 910 Stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was definitely part of the Baby Boomer Davy Crockett phenomena. Heck I actually won a contest of Davy Crockett look alike when I was four years old in Newark NJ and as I look back I believe that wonderful and completely fictional television series by Disney helped to trigger my interest in history which has been my career now for over thirty years starting as a middle school teacher and now a college professor along with a number of books published.I eagerly looked forward to this film's release and I regret now that for one of the few times in my life I listened to critics who absolutely trashed a film so that I never went to see it on the wide screen. Made the same mistake with Blade Runner when it first came out!So it was wait until Starz picked it up and frankly I was blown away. I actually went out the next day and rented the wide screen DVD version to check it out more closely and will definitely buy it I love it that much.This is the best of all the attempts to tell the story of the Alamo. Sure I grew up on the Crockett and Alamo legend but I also got a healthy dose of cynicism about the whole thing when examining it from the Mexican perspective particularly in relationship to the slavery issue and the promises made and broken by Houston and Austin to the Mexican government. This film though it dances more than a little around those issues still at least touches on them.But what really caught me was the attention to historical accuracy in relationship to the battle itself. I'll claim that for the first time every a film captured the feel and truthful presentation of late 18th and early to mid 19th century linear warfare. Other films always make it look absurd but here you see how it did work manuevering masses of troops up to then deliver terrifying volley fire at close range then charge with the bayonet.The weapons and how they were used was dead on perfect right down to the use of canister by the artillery and regardless of what one critic said about shells they were indeed used and the incident with Travis and the spurting fuse was perfect. Formations volley fire skirmishers the awesome and terrifying Mexican pioneer troops whoever was responsible for the setting and staging of this battle did a brilliant job. The set was perfect as well down to the finest detail. The cinematography as well especially the stunning scene from a high angle shot the charges coming in from all sides at once the defenders getting overwhelmed.I'd rate this movie up with Zulu as a film about a small determined garrison standing against impossible odds which is a great archetypal story.In contrast Patriot which drew so much critical acclaim was absolutely gut tearing in a nauseating sense when it came to any semblance of historical accuracy regarding battle and every year now I have to deprogram my students regarding its retched attempt at showing what Revolutionary period warfare looked like. For that matter I'll put Gettysburg and of course Gods and Generals in the same miserable league.I do not understand why so many critics are trashing the acting and casting. Bill Bob Thorton and Jason Patric are superb. I was awed by Thorton's approach to the legendary Crockett character. Much of what was and still is believed about Crockett is all myth and yeah even admitting that breaks this Baby Boomer's heart. Crockett was a character created by American theater and the first of the nickel and dime novels of the 182030s. He was something like a Schwartznegger cult character for his time even while still alive but his exploits were all legend. Thus the stunningly truthful scene of him confessing what really happened in a fight against Indians the incredible acting when he kills almost by accident a Mexican soldier and you immediately sense that this is the FIRST man he has ever actually killed and he is horrified by it. . .and how in the end SPOILERS AHEAD he is trapped by his own legend into becoming a hero regardless of his fears. A historian that I studied under in graduate school wrote about the Alamo and was the first to tell me that Crockett according to Mexican sources survived the fall of the garrison and was executed after wards. I remember not wanting to believe it Baby Boomer here remember Davy Crockett went down swinging. The debate varies did he willingly surrender and beg for his life was he wounded overwhelmed and then executed. . .we will never know but the screenplay does address it and does it well.A fictional scene undoubtedly but still profoundly moving Crockett playing the violin during sunset of the final night of siege. A beautiful scene that is haunting.In closing my thumbs up as a historian for this work. It is not a film that many would care for no love interest no ridiculous heroics no Mel Gibson trying to do a Daniel Day Lewis then sweeping off the girl in the low cut bodice after slaughtering a plentitude of foes just a gritty straight forward war story that is profoundly moving.Only negative. The perpetual scowl of Quaid as Houston. Though his big final scene the Battle of San Jacinto is darn good as well especially when done through the POV of Sequin and the terrible dilemma faced by MexicanTexans fighting on the Anglo side.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Alamo is directed by John Lee Hancock who cowrites with Leslie Bohem and Stephen Gaghan. It stars Billy Bob Thornton Jason Patric Patrick Wilson Dennis Quaid Emilio Echevarria and Jordi Molla. Music is scored by Carter Burwell and Dean Semler is the cinematographer. Story is a recreation of The Battle of the Alamo that ran for 13 days during the Texas Revolution of 1836.On release it was met with disdain at worst indifference at best and now historically it stands as the second biggest box office failure behind Cutthroat Island. The pre release word of mouth wasn't good and with difficulties of the financial and creative kind leading to Ron Howard leaving the directors chairand Russell Crowe and Ethan Hawke bowing out of roles for two of the main characters the film has never had an equal footing from which to try and sell itself as a worthy epic. Yet if there is a western styled war film most likely to improve with age then Hancock's Alamo is it. You see in time it's hoped that people can embrace that this take on the Alamo legend thrives on humanistic depth telling it not as a hooray hero piece but as it was men doomed to die. And more pertinent men who knew that in all probability they were waiting for death to come. Now that's a hard sell. It's highly unlikely that we will ever get an Alamo film to please everyone because ultimately the story is a sombre one an unforgiving 13 days of sadness and bitter disappointments. No matter how it gets dressed up with Duke Wayne bravado or otherwise this was a futile engagement. There's no chest beating stirring of the emotions for the outcome of this battle for example such as the British being allowed to withdraw gracefully from Rorke's Drift this is bleak history. It was a bold approach by Hancock and his team to strip away the glitter and paint it in fallible humanistic greys. Heroic pop culture characters like Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie are not defined by glory rah rah rah but by being men dealing with the harsh realities of war as best they can. It's telling that when Crockett turns up at the Alamo he is genuinely stunned to learn that the fighting is not over his plans for a comfortable life in politics vanquished the moment he sets foot upon Alamo turf. Hancock should be roundly applauded for having the courage to craft such an honest depiction of the siege and it's not as if we aren't warned about it either in history as fact or during the downbeat opening five minutes of film! So a film rich with in depth characterisations then but also a picture layered over with considerable technical skill. Hancock himself only really misfires by having a tacked on coda that shows Houston defeating Santa Anna and gaining his surrender. Who made the decision for this uplift I'm not sure but it feels forced and doesn't have the impact intended. It would have been more telling and poignant to just have a title card flash up to tell us that Houston defeated Santa Ann in 18 minutes. We don't need to see a hurried recreation the sombre mood needed to be kept up right to the last end credit rolled. For that's the true pain of The Battle of the Alamo. However Hancock gets mostly great performances from his leading cast members Thornton hugely impressive as Crockett and shoots his battle scenes with brutal distinction. His overhead shots are superb especially as the Mexican army attacks for the final and telling time. The 100s of soldiers swarming over The Alamo looks like ants converging on a desert oasis the hopelessness of the defenders of Mission San Antonio de Valero is never more evident than it is here. Semler and Burwell aid the mood considerably. The former is inspired by much of the film being set at night utilising fires and candle lights to enforce the shadows of death hanging around the characters while the textured brown red and yellow hues used for the landscape gives off a parched beauty that lends one to understand why these men fight for the land they occupy. Burwell scores it evocatively where tender swirls of emotion sit neatly along side the more broad action strains of the brass variety. The lavish sets and costuming including some tremendous hats are all good on production value to round out a tip top production. It cries out for revisits by those who dismissed it so casually back on its release. Certainly I myself found it helped considerably knowing now that this was not some rousing spectacle but that it's a detailed character story leading up to a sad and inevitable conclusion. That coda and some under nourished support characters stop it from being a fully formed classic from the genre but that aside it's still one terrific and thoughtful piece of film making. 910".

	schema:headline " Excellent film that stands up to stupefying rancor";
	schema:reviewBody "Having kept an eye on this film since before it began production I have been amazed at the viciousness of the invective that has been hurled its way. Reviews both professional and amateur have tended to offer viewpoints whose stunning ignorance have been nearly matched by their astonishing arrogance. This film has suffered much at the hands of pencilneck journalists who just couldn't wait to write some endlessly clever variation on 'forget the Alamo.' Precious few Roger Ebert chief among them seem to have understood the film. Much of the vitriol is because it is a Disney film while much is because it has to do with Texas. Both largely because of their successes seem to attract critics who allow decency and fairness to fall victim to their vindictiveness. I fear however that we live in such a cynical age that the notion of men voluntarily giving up their lives in defense of freedom is so difficult to comprehend that it is met with derision. Disney did not help matters with their poor handling of this film's publicity. I attend many movies and I saw the trailer once. Where was the media blitz as Touchstone did with Ladder 49? A predatory press gleefully playing up prerelease difficulties was met largely with silence. Disney seemed to have had no faith in the film or at least no clue as to how to market it. Their loss. Literally. Fortunately their campaign for the DVD was somewhat better. As for the film itself it is the most historically accurate version of the Alamo story  though that isn't saying much. For those for whom historical accuracy is a litmus test there is still much over which to nitpick. But as is the responsibility of a popular culture interpretation of historical events director Hancock fully captures the spirit of what was going on at that particular time and in that particular place. Hancock and crew did a stellar job in lovingly recreating the world of 1836 Texians  American and European immigrants as well as native Tejanos  uniting in revolt against an oppressive regime in an effort to gain independence as well as a sovereign government attempting to enforce law and order on its frontiers. The principals the tempestuous Houston the celebrated Crockett the fearsome Bowie and the young unproven Travis are portrayed as real humans rather than as demigods. Each has his obstacles to overcome and each shows significant growth as their fates are played out. For those who make the ultimate sacrifice their heroism is made all the more real by this emphasis on their humanity. The actors particularly Thornton in an Oscarworthy role as well as Patric Wilson and the marvelous Emilio Echevarra as Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna are to be commended for their interpretations of these enigmatic characters. A major bonus of the DVD is the commentary by professional historian Stephen L. Hardin and military adviser Alan C. Huffines  particularly useful for those who cannot wrap their minds around the differences between popular culture history and art.Hancock has provided us with a thoughtful intelligent deliberate and often subtle film for adults certainly an explanation for the film's lack of boxoffice success. Even Burwell's score suffers from these 'shortcomings.' Comparisons to John Wayne's 1960 The Alamo are as inevitable as they are pointless but anyone expecting that film's heavyhandedness may be disappointed. It is like comparing 2004's The Passion of the Christ to 1961's King of Kings  they are not remakes but variations on a theme each with their unique points of view merits and shortcomings.The film's biggest fault is that even if one didn't know that it was cut by about a third by negative test audience reactions it is still apparent that it suffers from these cuts. This is a complex epic story that demands epic treatment. I abhor criticizing a film for what it is not rather than what it is but I join many others in sincerely hoping that a director's cut DVD will be forthcoming so we can see Hancock's vision as it was intended.

	schema:headline " Great Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "A truly great film. Sure it has flaws as does every film ever made but nothing worthy of such criticism. To compare it to John Wayne's version is meaningless  both are good in their own way. However this latest installment is by far the best. The pains the creators went through to be as historically accurate as possible is nothing short or great. This film was beautifully shot and had many great moments like the approach of the Mexican army during the final assault. When Billy Bob Thronton peers over the wall into the darkness and sees hundreds of Mexicans nearly at the fort's wall it's both chilling and wonderfully done  it is quite possibly one of the greatest scenes in movie history. What the real Alamo defenders really thought and felt at that moment none of us will never know but how the film was shot gives us some basic insight into the terror they felt knowing they were about to die a violent and horrible death. And how can anyone be unmoved by Crockett playing his fiddle along with the Mexican army and then saying it's amazing what a little harmony can do. Or when the spirit of Crockett plays his fiddle at the Alamo after being revenged. This movie is full of very welldone scenes and lines like this. I wasn't much interested in Billy Bob Thronton's work before this movie or even recall having seen him in anything but he earned my respect with his performance  he was that good. But while Thronton stood out in my mind each actor was great. The fact that the actors felt a strong emotional attachment to this film was obvious. Thus how anyone can find fault with this movie is beyond me. It's a great film about great men although flawed like us all and the ultimate sacrifice they made. I find it very disappointing to read some comments which say well there wasn't enough action or the characters weren't well developed or whatever all I can figure is those people saw a different film or are trying to somehow convince us they have some sort of unique insight and to that I say BS. This is a highquality film with highquality actors that I consider one of the greatest films ever made. If you didn't like it then go back to watching garbage like Dude Where's My Car or American Pie as you'll be better able to relate to that mindless crap. I guess a film that requires some thought and appreciation of great acting and production that doesn't rely so heavily on graphic violence nudity and gross filth is beyond the intellect of today's average movie goer who will by contrast readily cite the unlimited virtues of such idiotic films as Jason vs. Freddy or any of the 100s of Bgrade gardenvariety teen slasher flicks that totally rely on the bigbreasted bimbos and bloodthirsty maniacs to sell tickets  who even if by some miracle they were able to read this review still wouldn't understand what I'm saying. Thank goodness for movie makers who will risk ridicule to make a good film about something meaningful. Hats off to all of those who were involved in making the Alamo.Michael Sear".

	schema:reviewBody "I've read all the criticism associated with this film and I think some of it is a little unwarranted. As an Alamo buff my judgement of this film is definitely biased but I will offer my opinion anyway. I think The Alamo is a very good Alamo film definitely the best interpertation ever made about the epic battle. I loved John Wayne's film but this movie has a more realistic approach. Some people criticize the film about certain scenes such as the Crockett's death his fiddler on the roof scene and other tidbits that took place inside the Alamo compound.  Some people try to use those scenes as proof that the movie contains historical inaccuracies. The truth is there will never be a complete historically accurate Alamo film because we really don't know nor ever will know what really took place. Any director is going to create his view of th battle. I also think is the best movie ever made about Crockett. Billy Bob Thornton captured the personality of the real Crockett. It doesen't matter if the fiddler on the roof scene never took place. That scene by itself captures the true spirit of David Crockett. A man that is more of an entertainer than wild frontiersman an entertainer so talented that he can entertain the Mexican Army and temporarliy keep them from firing their cannons. We can see his charisma shine and we understand why he was probably elected to Congress. People make a big deal about how Crockett Bowie and Travis died at the Alamo. Does it really matter? They were there until the end. Thats what counts. I do believe the movie could have been better. It definitely suffered from editing and even a little star power to carry certain scenes.  I think the director's cut will serve the movie justice and I believe over time people will have more respect for this movie. I don't beleive it is a perfect movie by any means at all. I do believe that it has much more to offer than what people are giving it credit. Again I'm huge fan of the duke but I view his film as more of a John Wayne movie than an Alamo movie and there is nothing wrong with that. I just beleieve this Alamo is closer to the true story.".

	schema:headline " The most historically authentic film yet on this subject!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was the first one to portray the character of the Texas Revolution participants which viewers have long sought.  John Lee Hancock has build some credibility for himself over avoiding some overindulgence in using artistic license.Limited use of special effects and reliance on good scripting and acting enhanced the film to its' optimum.

Neither the folksy backwoodsman as portrayed previously by Fess Parker and Arthur Hunnicutt nor the hero answering an oppressed people's call for help John Wayne's 'take' on Crockett Thornton's Crockett is a welldressed country 'sophisticate' who plays the violin and the political game in Washington very well. As the film opens he attends a Washington production of The Lion of the West based on his fictional exploits with a leading man dressed in what we today consider the 'Official Crockett Uniform' of buckskins and a coonskin cap. The character on stage and the legends surrounding him which would ultimately incorporate the Alamo as it's final act is the 'DAVY Crockett' we all know but the 'real' David Crockett according to Hancock is an opportunist who sees political rebirth in Texas and arrives hoping the battle is already over. Thornton is masterful showing Crockett's ambition his fear of having to 'live up' to the legends surrounding him and his gradual emergence into a true hero who would defy Santa Ana with his last breath.The other leads aren't given as much screen time for character development with the exception of Dennis Quaid's Sam Houston a heavydrinking pragmatist with a political agenda and ambitions of his own. Patrick Wilson's Travis is a failure as a father and husband hoping to rebuild his life and reputation in Texas Jason Patric's Bowie is a glowering unsavory adventurerbusinessman involved in slave trafficking and terminally ill during the siege Hooker does however bow to legend allowing the dying Bowie a chance to fire his pistols at the Mexicans before being overwhelmed. Emilio Echevarra the first Mexican to ever play Santa Ana in an American film has gotten bad press for his portrayal of the leader as a loudmouthed insensitive lecherous egotist but from all accounts that WAS what the real Santa Ana was like.While the slow pacing of most of the film is a problem the film's final half hour appears rushed as the Alamo's fall jumps quickly into Sam Houston's victory over Santa Ana at San Jacinto an event that occurred after a momentous six weeks of defeat and tragedy barely touched upon by Hancock. While it is understandable that the film makers wanted an 'upbeat' ending it comes across as jarring nonetheless.If you like your heroes and history 'bigger than life' the 2004 ALAMO will disappoint and you should stick to John Wayne's version. If however you want a new perspective and are willing to dispense with the preconceptions of the past this film has a LOT to offer!".

Jason Patrick also was good as Jim Bowie and Dennis Quaid proved once more to be a versatile actor by his fine portrail of Sam Houston.  I thought this movie was better than the John Wayne Alamo of the 1960's more accurate in showing Travis death a bullet to the head early in the final siege on day 13 and also showing Crockett's capture and execution most historians believe he and a few of his men were captured and executed shortly after the Alamo fell.  I also liked how the movie continued after the Alamo fell and told how Santa Anna was finally defeated.  It is a good family movie to see very educational and historically accurate.  The critics have bashed this movie for reasons unknown.  Several people who left the theatre the same time as me said almost in unison I can't understand it the critics ripped this movie and it was really good The Alamo didn't concentrate on any one central character and didn't throw in a ridiculous love story to appeal the masses like Titanic Pearl Harbor and Enemy at the Gates.  I guess this is an essential element with today's critics because if a movie doesn't have it the movie gets ripped!! This movie deserves a much better rating than the expert critics gave it.".

	schema:reviewBody "According to a historical source 'The first casualty of war is always the truth.' Concerning this story it's amusing to learn despite best efforts the pertinent facts continue to be forgotten disregarded or simply ignored. The 2004 film is called  The Alamo  the events concerning the battle at the old mission gets a face lift and some of the actual facts are finally included in the story. In this updated version the hero of the Alamo David Crockett is very ably played by Billy Bob Thornton. Taking a more modest approach to the actual figure from Tennessee he allows the myth to dissipate and replaced with a more humble introverted and practical character. Jason Patric plays James Bowie with a sincere sympathetic and vulnerable veiner which allows the audience to recognize the famous knifefighter as a man conscious of his own mortality. Patrick Wilson is William Barret Travis the prideful boisterous and often antagonistic lawyer given command of the tiny mission. With a handful of regular soldiers he accepts the doomed post with the full knowledge his was only a holding action and without help not expected to hold. Dennis Quaid plays Sam Houston and seen as a selfdetermined leader of a republic torn from a poorly governed country. The fact of Crockett's death is as close to the literal record written by Jose Pena. The movie is structured well and when the actual facts are imposed the fiery six hour assault destruction of the crumbling adobe building and the killing of the all volunteer force of 186 men becomes a fitting tribute to the men and their cause.

	onyx:emotionText "According to a historical source 'The first casualty of war is always the truth.' Concerning this story it's amusing to learn despite best efforts the pertinent facts continue to be forgotten disregarded or simply ignored. The 2004 film is called  The Alamo  the events concerning the battle at the old mission gets a face lift and some of the actual facts are finally included in the story. In this updated version the hero of the Alamo David Crockett is very ably played by Billy Bob Thornton. Taking a more modest approach to the actual figure from Tennessee he allows the myth to dissipate and replaced with a more humble introverted and practical character. Jason Patric plays James Bowie with a sincere sympathetic and vulnerable veiner which allows the audience to recognize the famous knifefighter as a man conscious of his own mortality. Patrick Wilson is William Barret Travis the prideful boisterous and often antagonistic lawyer given command of the tiny mission. With a handful of regular soldiers he accepts the doomed post with the full knowledge his was only a holding action and without help not expected to hold. Dennis Quaid plays Sam Houston and seen as a selfdetermined leader of a republic torn from a poorly governed country. The fact of Crockett's death is as close to the literal record written by Jose Pena. The movie is structured well and when the actual facts are imposed the fiery six hour assault destruction of the crumbling adobe building and the killing of the all volunteer force of 186 men becomes a fitting tribute to the men and their cause. The reason why this movie will become a Classic will be due to the cast it's director and the fact someone tried to tell the truth and that stands of it's own accord. ";

The acting in no way lessens the impact or the bravery of these men who chose to for what ever reason stay and pay the ultimate price for their beliefs. Billy Bob Thorton's portrayal of David Crockett is nothing short of brilliant. It is by far the best portrayal of David Crockett I have ever seen. Some of the characters seem a little thin but not enough to to ruin the experience. Go with your gut on this one. I don't think you will be disappointed.

I have read every book I can find on the subject and have seen nearly every movie made concerning that epic 13day siege. Hancock's The Alamo is in my opinion the most accurate depiction of the siege and fall of the Alamo. The movie is beautifully filmed with great attention to detail and historical accuracy. I was particularly impressed with Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of David Davy Crockett. From what I have read about Crockett's life Thornton captured the true essence of the man and brought him to life. The final battle and fall of the Alamo is the highlight of the film. True to history the attack begins in the predawn darkness while the defenders are asleep in the mission. All other movies depict the final assault in broad daylight with the defenders ready and waiting. The scenes of the Mexican Army quietly approaching the walls are extremely well done and true to life. Also somewhat scary!! Granted there are some minor historical inaccuracies as in all historical movies but they do not detract from the overall story. I highly recommend this movie for any Alamo fanatic or anyone wishing to go beyond John Wayne's bloated rendition. A great film!!!".

This is about what a Texan thinks when he sees this version of the history that made Texas.  Texas is the only state in the United States that was once its own Republic its own nation. Because of this we have the only state flag that may be flown at the same heighth as the US flag all others fly below it.  That is part of the reason we feel so strongly about our state why our state is so revered from others and why we are so hated.  It is what makes this state so unique and why I love it so.This movie goes beyond what John Wayne's version told us and got to the truth about the characters involved.  It exposed Texan heroes for what they really were.  It also correctly personified Santa Anna for the highly nationalistic defender of Mexico and for the vicious dictator he was.  But ultimately he was shown as the coward who upon being defeated tried to hide disguised as a Private and then relinquished the very soil he was fighting for simply so that his own life could be spared.  For anyone who considers that comment as a spoiler you are wrong the history is written and the ending of this movie is clear known in that history.  I am reminded of a fool in line who made the comment as we were leaving an early showing I hope none of these people gives the ending away.This was a very well made epic although I would not have hesitated to recommend it had it been longer to go into further depth.  I would highly recommend it to anyone to fellow Texans for the telling of history we know and to others who wonder why we from the Lone Star State have so much pride in a small band who died fighting an army that was thousands times larger.".

The editing the use of music and the camerawork are simply incredible. Every frame fits perfectly. Also the humorous approach this movie takes to its fight scenes is something out of the ordinary. Two men fighting on a rooftop they go into a clinch noone seems to be able to wrestle the other one down so they stumble around like this and just when you think this looks almost like a dance presto the music changes to a waltz. In the next shot we see the two men hitting each other with things lying around but we only see their shadows just like in the Indonesian shadow puppet theater. This movie challenges its viewer to break up with the habitual way of perceiving action in film maybe some folks don't like that.As Sean Choi put it in his comment All style no substance? yes but what style!".

	schema:reviewBody "Nowhere to Hide is a film unlike any other I have seen and likely unlike any you have seen either. It is a film alive with the possibilities of cinema and not afraid to stretch the boundaries between pulp and art.The story centers on a detective named Woo and his partner Kim. Woo is a hardliving bulldog of a cop with not a little Popeye Doyle in himhe even wears a funny squashed cap though it is a fishing hat rather than a porkpie. Kim is a bythebook family man. Together they attempt to track down a murderer over the course of several weeks. The plot is little more than a succession of action chase and stakeout scenes as they work their way through the killer's accomplices until they find the man himself. Their investigation is accomplished through plenty of illegal beatings and searcheswithoutwarrants but somehow the characters remain likable and entertaining to watch due largely to the strong theatrical performance of Park Joonghoon in the central role. Humor is also sprinkled liberally throughout both brilliant physical gags and a few knowing verbal jokes creating a movie full of action and fun.But the film is only really about this plot to the extent that it allows the director to play around with the possibilities of filmmaking. Lee takes great joy in cutting up action sequences in new and exciting ways crafting a style somewhere between John Woo and Wong KarWai in its brilliant use of the camera. He makes potentially simple sequences new and exciting through the use of slow motion quick cuts and jump dissolves in combinations never before seen. He goes back and forth between lovingly dwelling on falling leaves and snow flakes to slicing swords and swinging fists endowing each with unique beauty and cool.The two standout sequences in the film are probably the first murder scene and the final showdown. The first murder takes place at the 40 Steps and attains a bizarre haunting beauty against the background of bright yellow leaves and falling rain all set to the BeeGee's early hit Holiday. The final showdown is again in the rain this time pouring down in steel sheets as Woo and the murderer face each other mano a mano. A strain of Holiday floats briefly through the soundtrack as the character's fists fly superfast then superslow. Incidentally this scene was clearly an influence on the final fight in The Matrix Revolutions.The film has been criticized for having an unclear plot and lacking character depth. These things are mostly missing true but it is only because the director deliberately chose not to focus on them. Here is how he describes the point of his movieIn a Monet painting Lee says the theme is not the water lily. The water lily is just the object to paint light upon. As it floats we see its reflection on the water and that is what we call painterly. My intention is the same. In this film I wanted to show the filmic. The story and the characters are not the main focus of my film. Movement is. Movement enters the other elements in this film to create kinetic action.The film then should be viewed in this spirit and not as a simple action film. If you approach this movie as an exercise in innovative style and gleeful genre pastiche the movie shows clear influence from John Woo The French Connection and Sergio Leoneincluding the harmonica line from Once Upon a Time in the West you will find yourself awed and delighted. Looking for deeper meaning however is futile the style IS the substance.".

This film doesn't bother itself much with substance e.g. richly developed characters with whom we can sympathize a serious look at the human condition etc. Instead Nowhere to Hide is all about style and the joy of making films. Lee's style is sort of an amalgamation of Wong Karwai the visuals and John Woo the action and Nowhere to Hide offers some sumptuous feasts for the eyes. To offer some salient examples There is an early assassination sequence which is so beautifully shot and creatively edited that it plays out like an impressionist music video and it also happens to be my favorite scene from any film of its year 2000 There is a fight sequence which is done completely in shadows And there is a final fist fight between a cop and robber in the rain that is wonderfully aesthetic. During many scenes of this film Lee stretches breaks and otherwise tweaks the visual grammar of film to produce a work that is consistently challenging and thoroughly original.

The main character the cop unlike his contemporaries spends less time talking a la Vincent Hannah in heat and more time beating suspects senseless a la Dirty Harry.I have seen no publicity on this film but I don't think that it takes itself to seriously a lot of it is presented tongue in cheek rather than an accurate representation of Far East police methods.Another thing you as a viewer may find strange is the fact that there is nothing to the film but its plot. The characters individual and not too cliched apart from the Jackie Chan style Goon mob are actually interesting and original but never really explored. You pick up that the main character is only a cop because it suits his temperament and that he never really goes home except to eat instant noodles.What is impressive is the sheer style and technical achievement this film is. Im not talking Matrix style effects or something I'm talking about making the best of what they have on a limited budget. As far as story goes you understand and know the bare minimum but I suppose that is realistic in police work and that you never see the master plan or crime network its all about individuals who are only responsible for themselves.Nowhere to Hide is to cop movies what Blade Runner is to Manga cartoons what Mortal Combat was and to plot what a Police Academy movie is but it is none the less good and frankly I dont regret seeing it. Not for the easily bored.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven I left the theater feeling disappointed and it wasn't until days after the movie that I began to appreciate the film.  Now it's one of my favorites.  What Eastwood did was to raise my expectation and appetite for violencethat satisfying kind of completely justified movie violence that has few if any real consequences for the perpetrators or for the viewers.  What Eastwood did was to turn the tables on us as viewers and indict us in the act of anticipating and enjoying violence which is inherently joyless.Nowhere to Hide works in a similar fashion.  What Unforgiven was to the American Western Nowhere to Hide is for Asian action films.  In the archetypal action flick the bad guy does some really bad things kills the hero's partner family friend kills innocent people especially women or children bombs a building killing civilians etc. which necessitates his deathwe accept his murder as a moral obligation.  Then the detectivecop a cool witty handsome and dangerously graceful man picture Chow Yun Fat speedily tracks down the bad guy using superhuman powers of intuition and there are a number of bloody explosionfilled confrontations leading up to a final one on one battle to the deaththe hero emerges injured but victorious.Nowhere to Hide deflates the typical plot at every turn.  The hero detective Woo is a swaggering slightly boorish thug with a comic flare and the inevitable soft spot under the rough exterior.  His lumbering shrugshouldered openmouthed strut speaks volumes about his personality. But he must be a brilliant investigator.  No Woo's investigation takes monthsa bumbling sequence of botched surveilance and raids gone bad.  The good guys are clearly outclassed . . . badly.  How many guns does he pack? Two?  Four?  Noonly one and it's a mace gun shooting essentially ineffectual puffs of pepper spray.  So so he must be a martial arts expert. No he fights clumsily easily outclassed by any opponent with an ounce of traininghe dives on people's backs kicks anything he can reach and beats people with bats clubs and pipes.  He's much better when his opponent is in handcuffs or tied down somehow.  Director Lee MyungSe even uses slow motion a la John Woo but in his hands the fights become not ballet but broad farcemore like the climactic shootout in What's Up Tiger Lily than any scene from HardBoiled or the Wild Bunch.  And before every major confrontation Woo and his men have to find somewhere to urinate because they're so scared.The end result is a darkly comic visually engaging something like Bladerunner and fairly entertaining movie that takes most if not all of the glamor out of crime and crimefighting and that like Unforgiven questions our love of a good fight.  This is a good movie to see but not if all you want is a glorious bloodbath.".

From the opening black and white scene to the ending fight set to that Holiday? song NtH is true poetry in motion creating an incredible atmosphere through motion.Unfortunately I feel that the director Myungse Lee sacrificed artistic storytelling for artistic visuals.  The film is as average storywise as it is beautiful visually with its standard cops search for killer plot that never goes beyond the standard fare.  It helps that JoonHoon Park conveys such an interesting character but I felt that the film still lagged through the middle half.In the end despite its shortcomings I enjoyed Nowhere to Hide.

The story is admitadly weak but the action and comedy more then make up for it. The performances too are great from the ensemble korean cast although most people in the states won't recognize any of them. This film got me interested in Korean cinema and I've seen some more great films out of there hopefully this trend continues and Korea continues making great films like their neighbor Japan.

However after watching it for a second time on DVD it doesn't seem as awesome as it did two years ago. It's unfortunate really because I'm all about awesome.Woo JoongHoon Park is a rather unorthodox detective paired with Detective Kim DongKun Jang investigating a murder. The main suspect is Sungmin Sungkee Ahn an apparent master of disguise. Being the unorthodox detective that he is Woo tries to track down Sungmin by abusing other suspects and sleeping in the homes of people close Sungmin. Funny how no one thought to report him.Somehow 'Nowhere to Hide' manages to drag out an incredibly thin plot to almost two hours. It really is a case of all style and little to no substance. I'll admit that it is visually stunning but why? 'Why?' is something that has not yet been explained to me and at first glance none of the IMDb comments seem to answer why either. It is almost as if director Myungse Lee decided he was going to make a copthriller that was long and filled with pretty pictures but yet had no point.As an action movie it is entertaining but nothing special. It is funny at times but the action and humour just can't seem to keep up the interest for the full 112 minutes. I hate to admit that it even becomes a bit of bore and some points. I guess I should have watched the shortened international version.Anyone who thinks 'Matrix Revolutions' borrowed from this film should really check out 'Volcano High'  the end in particular. I know 'Nowhere to Hide' borrowed music from Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West' as well as featuring Korean rock and the BeeGees.'Nowhere to Hide' is entertaining but too long for it's own good.

	schema:reviewBody "A VIRGIN STRIPPED BARE BY HER BACHELORSOne of the more colorful movie titles in history belongs to a film that was shot in black and white. However the English title is a great deal more lurid than the original Korean title Oh! SooJung! and is more suggestive of a 1960s Suzuki Seijun sex potboiler than a deliberately paced bw art film. Virgin IS ostensibly about the deflowering of a film directors young assistant but in fact its much more content to linger upon and play around with the little details that precede the big event. SooJungs bachelors are the downandout indie film director who she works for and the directors independently wealthy and seemingly nonetoobright drinking buddy. The central conceit of the film is that the same story the wooing of SooJung is told twice Hong likes to divide his films into interrelated halves from different perspectives. Although whose perspective each segment is taken from is a little unclear I assume that Part One is the rich guys view and Part Two is SooJungs but that seems to create a couple of problems. The changes range from the minor to the quite grand SooJung is pawed on in a back alley by a different suitor in each half. What it all adds up to is a kind of cosmic game of chance. Two different sets of events build inexorably to the same result. Unlike Hongs other two recent films I havent seen The Day a Pig Fell in a Well the events of the first half of the film dont in any way dictate what happens in the second. But in Virgin it is unclear what is truth and what is fiction and Im not sure that any of the characters in the film can be trusted as far as they can be thrown. But what is real and what is imagined is not of primary importance. What is important is that the scheme allows for Hong to dwell on his favorite themes chance disconnection malefemale relationships and what he seems to feel is the spiritual vacuity of modern Korea. Seems this vacuum doesnt just exist in Korea. Hong shares many of the same sympathies and stylistic traits with Taiwanese filmmaker Tsai MingLiang and the Finn Aki Kaurismaki i.e. a freefloating style that lacks what can be called a conventional plot a dislike of excess cutting muted acting a predilection for silence and sparing use of soundtrack music a subtle dark sense of humor and a rather bleak view of modern existence. Not to say that these filmmakers are the same because each is certainly distinctive in his own way but all three seem to fixate on a problem that is not endemic only to their particular locales as firmly rooted in those locales as they all may be. Hongs films are neither entertaining nor reassuring but for those who prefer substance to fireworks and cliche in their cinema his works continue to reveal why he is among the best directors working today. Its a shame he isnt better known either here in Korea or abroad.".

People tend to have different perception of the same event or they may remember different salient points or even mix up memories.For example in one kissing scene Jaewoon remembers sweeping a fork off the table while Soojung thought it was a spoon. The events and dialogue also get mixed up as memories get hazy. For instance a particular dialogue about drinking took place in two places in the different versions.I really enjoyed the movie even though I do not like the romance genre in general.

She phones however and claims to be running late and expresses some doubts about consummating their relationship. Later the scene is replayed but from Soojung's point of view with a different result. With its title derived from a surreal artwork by Marcel Duchamp titled The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors Hong Sangsoo's elliptical comedy drama A Virgin Stripped Bare by her Bachelors is a process of discovery for both the characters and the viewer. Whether the theme is viewed as the subjectivity of memory or how our perceptions change with each new event Hong strips away the illusion from romantic love and allows us to see how ambivalent we all may be beyond our idealization.The film is divided into five parts each chapter introduced by enigmatic titles such as Perhaps Intention Perhaps Coincidence and Perhaps Accident and separated by a fade to black reminiscent of Jim Jarmusch's Stranger in Paradise. The first third and fifth parts take place in the present the second and fourth parts show the history of the couple from their first encounter to the present and reflect the characters' different perceptionsmemories. The chapter Perhaps by Accident seems to describe Jaehoon as one who believes that reality is controlled by fate. Perhaps Intention describes the assumptions of Soojung who makes her decisions based on her assessment of men's true motives and values judging them by their actions not their words.From the outset the film's narrative appears to be linear as it traces a love triangle that develops between Jaehoon Soojung and Youngsoo an independent filmmaker. The characters are very real and their desires and frustrations are palpable. However halfway through the film begins to repeat episodes from earlier chapters which are dramatized from a different perspective and show slight variations in detail. The second chapter is a flashback to the couple's first meeting. Filmmaker Youngsoo Moon Seongkeun attends an exhibition at Jaehoon's art gallery with Soojung to gain some inspiration for the film they are working on. The two agree to have lunch with Jaehoon perhaps to persuade the wealthy gallery owner to provide some financial backing for the film.A few days later when Jaehoon meets Soojung at Kyongbokgoong Palace he discovers that she has a pair of gloves that he accidentally left on a bench and believes the incident to be very much a coincidence. When the incident is dramatized the second time however it appears that Soojung has intentionally scheduled the film crew to meet on the Palace grounds because she knows that Jaehoon goes there for lunch. Jaehoon becomes attracted to Soojung and asks her to have sex with him and become her lover. She tells him that she will accept his offer but only when they go out for a drink. The sex scenes are erotic but not graphic and reveal the lovers' emotional pain lying just beneath the surface.Enhanced by an exquisite original score by OK Kilsung and the striking black and white cinematography of Choi Yeongtaek Virgin Stripped Bare by her Bachelors is a beautiful and thoughtful film whose concluding epiphany left me with a lovely glow. Sadly however the glow was short lived as I soon discovered that on the night of February 22 2005 Lee Eunju committed suicide at her apartment only a few days after graduating from Dankook University. She was only 24 years old. The memory of her great performance in this outstanding film will long remain.".

	schema:headline " Odd compelling mix of formalism and humanity";
	schema:reviewBody "Hong Sangsoo really is probably the greatest director almost no one has heard of at least from Asia if not the whole world. That said I'm not sure I like this one quite as much as his earlier The Power of Kangwon Province if only because it doesn't quite have the same sense of distinct urban anomie that I love. It might be an allaround more wellconstructed film though if borderline too strictly formalist. It's too bad these are the only two films of his available on DVD because otherwise I'd make watching all of them a priority. It's funny that the film has such a rigid sense of structuralism and yet is infused with such a real intimate sense of humanism. The film is divided into two halves each with eight chapters showing roughly the same courtship between a man and a woman first from what appears to be his perspective and then from hers although the specific pointofview is never directly announced and it is possible they overlap somewhat. This sounds pretty gimmicky and in a sense it skirts that line but like I was saying it is presented in such a straightforward empathetic way that it barely seems cerebral or detached at all. It's really quite remarkable i think what a truly empathetic tone the film has. Although visually somewhat similar to the work of the great Tawainese director Hou Hsiaohsien the film has none of Hou's pronounced sense of detachment or aloofness. Instead it feels incredibly intimate and humane. Still the rigid structural devise if not quite gimmicky does create a certain repetitiveness since unlike Rashomon the two versions of events don't usually differ in very overt ways although there are some differences. I wouldn't normally call the film slow as minimalistic as the camera style is it moves along fairly briskly but the repetition does make it seem like it drags at times over the course of it's two hour length. Still it's overall a pretty great film. Some of the most honest heartfelt nofrills relationship stuff I've ever seen in a film actually. The last scene in particular is one of the nicest things I've seen in a while.".

It's too bad these are the only two films of his available on DVD because otherwise I'd make watching all of them a priority. It's funny that the film has such a rigid sense of structuralism and yet is infused with such a real intimate sense of humanism. The film is divided into two halves each with eight chapters showing roughly the same courtship between a man and a woman first from what appears to be his perspective and then from hers although the specific pointofview is never directly announced and it is possible they overlap somewhat. This sounds pretty gimmicky and in a sense it skirts that line but like I was saying it is presented in such a straightforward empathetic way that it barely seems cerebral or detached at all. It's really quite remarkable i think what a truly empathetic tone the film has. Although visually somewhat similar to the work of the great Tawainese director Hou Hsiaohsien the film has none of Hou's pronounced sense of detachment or aloofness. Instead it feels incredibly intimate and humane. Still the rigid structural devise if not quite gimmicky does create a certain repetitiveness since unlike Rashomon the two versions of events don't usually differ in very overt ways although there are some differences. I wouldn't normally call the film slow as minimalistic as the camera style is it moves along fairly briskly but the repetition does make it seem like it drags at times over the course of it's two hour length. Still it's overall a pretty great film. Some of the most honest heartfelt nofrills relationship stuff I've ever seen in a film actually. The last scene in particular is one of the nicest things I've seen in a while.";

	schema:reviewBody "I just finished reading all the previous reviews and I guess my review is going to be completely different. I am a big fan of Korean cinematography and by now I have watched approximately over one hundred Korean films. This movie is by far the most disturbing and difficult movie to watch at least from a female's point of view.The movie is divided into two different parts two stories told from two main characters two almost opposite accounts. The movie begins with the events that precede the final scene and only after that the rest of the parts are sequenced in order. The main male character is a total sleaze ball actually all the males in this movie can be categorized as such. The only thing he is interested is sex. When he finds out that the girl he was trying to have sex with is a virgin his eyes light up as bulbs on a Christmas tree.The story from the guy's perspective is quite ordinary nothing special. By the way before arranging having sex with a virgin he checks the hotel room for hidden cameras that shows you some experience! However when we watch the second part retold from the female's point of view we see the horrible reality that women have to go through in modern day Korea. The female character has to perform sexual favors for her older brother yes it is almost incest. She has to defend herself from being raped by her immediate boss. Even though she feels sick on that day and tries her hardest to avoid having sex with the newfound suitor who is a total womanizer and even calls her by some other name in bed she agrees to having sex with him and it brings her nothing but pain that she felt she had to endure.For all of you out there THIS IS NOT A ROMANTIC FILM. In fact it cannot be any farther from romance. It is a psychological drama shot as a documentary with a twist but there is no love in this movie. Sex  yes. Love  none. The final sexual scene feels like watching a girl being raped even though it is a consensual rape. It is really disturbing and appalling.On a final note the actress who played the main character Lee Eun Ju committed suicide after her last movie The Scarlet Letter. She began suffering from insomnia after performing the nude scenes in that movie. Let me tell you it all added up this movie included. If she would stay away from the movies that portray women as victims and walking sex objects she might be alive with us today. I also want to point out that it is the main goal of any art project cinematography included to purify people's souls and heal humanity to evoke best feelings in our hearts whether it is love gratitude or sympathy to pull the viewers up not down. It is much easier to go downhill than uphill and there are plenty of directors who take the easy road. I would not recommend this movie for those who want to walk away with a nice clean feeling or for those who prefer watching romance. This is a welldone movie with a disturbing message that is why I am having a difficult time to rate this one. I will probably leave the ratings blank.".

The plot is a bit convoluted at times and maybe a little TOO ambitious but there are several classic sequences that make this a must see for any De Palma fan.

Amy Irving who also appeared in 'Carrie' is beautiful and believable as Gillian a troubled teen attempting to understand and control her frightening paranormal powers. Veteran Kirk Douglas 'Spartacus' 'Saturn 3' and cult directoractor John Cassavetes 'Rosemary's Baby' 'The Killers' are both solid as friendsturnedenemies who once worked for the same nameless Government agency. Douglas' psychic son Robin Andrew Stevens is kidnapped by Cassavetes and his cronies and experimented on until he reaches the brink of madness. Douglas desperately searches for him by any means necessary a quest which inevitably means he encounters the traumatized Gillian who has an increasing psychic link with Robin.

It might not have dated that well and the premise of the film might be considered ludicrous now but it doesn't stop it from being an exciting adventure.This is a flashy and mostly fastpaced thriller by director Brian De Palma. It does have a couple of slow moments and maybe it was a tad too long but it's well compensated by superbly tense situations and blistering action sequences especially in the first opening hour involving Douglas's character when his son is kidnapped and when his hiding out from government agents. There are also some scenes that are not recommended for the squeamish. As some scenes are filled with a lot of blood and more blood. It's rather graphic violence. Not to forgot the whooping and heartingpounding conclusion. The makeup and special effects throughout the film are truly stunning. The plot basis is on psychokinetic powers and at times it's rather absurd and incoherent. With some incredibly cheesy moments within the dialogue. Though the direction is what covers the story's inconsistencies with great and simply memorable setups and some wellshot scenes. The music score is fairly effective in building up the tension and thrills but also it has an impact in the quieter moments.There are great performances from the experienced Kirk Douglas who's incredibly fit for his age and has some physical roles and Cassavetes who really boost and add some class to the film. There is such a great chemistry between them and Cassavetes is simply riveting as a conniving agent. Amy Irving was good in her role as Gillian Bellaver the girl who is having trouble coming to grips with her strong psychokinetic powers. Though the same can't be said about the rest. As Andrew Steven's as Robin Sandza is incredibly hammy and Carrie Snodgress as Hester is fairly irritating. I wouldn't class it as one of De Palma's best but still it's far away from his worst.

Robin is kidnapped by a secret government agency and Gillian is going to the Paragon Institute to learn more about her power. There's a LOT more going on but it's too confusing to get into.When I saw this on video back in the 1980s I loved it. Seeing it now I hate it. The story is very confusing with way too many characters and plot holes galore. The dialogue is terrible I kept playing back scenes on the DVD because I couldn't believe what I had just heard and this moves VERY slowly it runs two solid hours.The acting doesn't help. Irving is too weepy and whiny but she IS great in the final scene. Stevens has never been a good actor. Douglas walks through his role and John Cassavates playing the bad guy gives a onenote performance. The only good acting comes from Carrie Snodgrass Charles Durning Carol Eve Rossen and especially Fiona Lewis.It has some good thingsthe direction from Brian DePalma is excellent especially Irving's slow motion run from the Institute and there's a good score by John Williams. Also it does have a few incredibly bloody deaths. These were considered extreme back in 1978 but they aren't anymore and look incredibly fake. There's also a great final scene and I got a good laugh over the incredibly dated video games Snodgrass and Irving play at one point. Also Daryl Hannah's first film.So it DOES have some good things but the slow pace confusing story and lousy dialogue sinks it. I can only give it a 5.".

	schema:headline " Violent  exciting and bloody film  including sensationalistic scenes  but pretty well directed by Brian De Palma";
	schema:reviewBody "Suspense thrills and grisly killings by imitative director Brian De Palma . This scary triller is plenty of mystery  intrigue  suspenseful and creepy scenes . It is a potentially brilliant and ingenious chiller that concerns about a government agent  Peter Sandza  Kirk Douglas  he was aged around sixtyone years of age  Kirk was cast as the lead because director had felt that his previous picture had suffered at the boxoffice without a name drawcard determined to come to his son's first major cinema movie role of actor Andrew Stevens rescue  when a sinister official John Cassavetes kidnaps him to harbor his extremely powerful psychic abilities . As he is forced to take on a superpowerful government agency called MORG it stands for the Multiphasic Operations Research Group which has kidnapped his son with psychokinetic skills . The intrepid father is helped by a good friend called Hester Carrie Snodgress . And then things really get worse . Meanwhile  a young girl Amy Irving who married Spielberg  she attended a biofeedback clinic to learn about different levels of consciousness as she had a better sense to play who personally experiencing psychic changes is taken in a strange Institute of supernatural forces . Peter uses desperate attempts to save hid gifted son from being used or destryed . At the end takes place the ultimate revenge story . This stylish chiller contains longdrawnout tension  flash violent scenes and shock effects with the accent on gasprovoking  but on most occasion without finesse . Adding special characteristics techniques as ominous camera movements and wide screen . This flick was made and released about two years after its source novel of the same name by John Farris was first published in 1976  Farris also wrote the screenplay for the film . It is is a contemporary thrilling tale that utilizes the average man against the unknown approach that made Hitchcock 's suspense films so effective . All this said  the mechanics of suspense are worked quite well and may frighten the easily scared quite badly  but De Palma has made a habit of dwelling on their more sordid shoots . Director 'Brian de Palma''s second movie featuring Telekinesis his first had been Carrie 1976  as actress Amy Irving appears in both films . In fact  this picture has often been described as a cross between The Omen 1976 and a peculiar followup to Carrie 1976 . Very good cast plenty of familiar faces such as John Cassavetes  Charles Durning  Rutanya Alda  Fiona Lewis  Carrie Snodgres and William Finley who played for De Palma  Phantom of paradise . Being the first film for both Daryl Hannah Laura Innes and look fast James Belushi as an extra  as you can see him in a pair of dark trunks a few steps behind Irving . The film displays a great and haunting musical score by John Williams  previous his fruitful collaboration to Steven Spielberg  he composed in the style of a Bernard Herrmann score from an Alfred Hitchcock movie . Furthermore  appropriate and colorful cinematography by excellent cameraman Richard H Kline .The picture was brilliantly directed by Brian De Palma  adding special characteristics techniques and special camera movements . The movie was realized during his period when Brian made outwardly odes to Hitchcock  such as Obsession  Sisters Dresssed to Kill and Blow out . Rating  Above average  as it gets some riveting basic ideas and fascinating images. Essential and indispensable watching for Brian De Palma buffs and Kirk Douglas fans .".

Stevens believes Dad has died but Kirk doesn't swallow that so easy.Kirk's on the hunt for his son and the quest takes him to Chicago where people like Stevens with paranormal abilities are being studied and tested so the USA can have them as a weapon. Carrie Snodgrass and Charles Durning are working there as well. And so is Fiona Lewis who's been given personal charge of Stevens and develops the kid's libido as well as his telekinesis.Brian DePalma directed this film and it's a good one with outstanding performances by all the cast. Look for a good performance from Amy Irving as another young person with such abilities who literally makes Cassavetes fall apart at the end. And there's a memorable bit from a younger and thinner Dennis Franz before the gain of weight and loss of hair that we all know as Detective Andrew Sipowicz.

Brian de Palma's attempt to strike gold for the second time with a Carrie like film about telekinesis in his movie The Fury. Instead The Fury bit off far too much then it can chew and in the end it ended up chocking itself to death.The Fury has two not one like in Carrie young persons with telekinesis powers in two different places. When they finally got together at the end of the film all hell broke loose with people flying out of windows and spinning like tops on the ceiling until all their limbs flung off their body. This was very good visual effects for the time being but the very bad plot development in getting a hold of what the movie was trying to say. Peter Sandza Kirk Douglas spends the entire movie looking for his son Robin Andrew Stevens after he was kidnapped in Israel by Peter's friend Ben Childress John Cassavetes and coworker in some secret US government agency where they both worked for twenty years. Ben staging a fake terrorist attack in order to kidnap Robin and at the same time kill Peter. Peter survived and wounded Ben with a blast from a assault rifle that he took off a dead attacker on the beach that cost Ben his left arm. The reason for kidnapping Robin is that he possesses a strange and powerful telekinesis talent that the agency that Ben still works for wanted to use against the enemies of the USA.After a number of wild goose chases in Chicago and with the help of Gillian Bellaver Amy Irving who has the same telekinesis powers that Robin has both Peter  Amy track down Robin to some safehouse outside the city. he place is run by the agency that Ben works for. Robin sensing that Gillian his psychic twin is nearby and goes wild and insane feeling that he'll be killed by Ben  Co. and then be replaced by her in their telekinesis experiments. Robin ends up killing his handler and lover Susan Flona lewis by spinning her to death. Ropin also has a number of the staff who tried to restrain him lifted up off the floor and thrown out the window to their deaths. With his poor and confused father Peter flung out the window together with him only to have Peter grab Robin's arm and hold on to a ledge. Robin then fights his father off and falls to his death. With a despondent Peter after seeing this throws himself to his death landing besides Robin. Later Ben alone with Gillian trying to smooth talk her into going along with him in his plan to use her Telekinesis powers for the US. This line of total BS on Bens part has Gillian go completely insane and use those powers on him and blast him to bits like he was cooked inside a microwave oven. Gillian end up telling a startled Ben to go to the place where the sun don't shine yet where it hot all the time. The movie The Fury just never took off and seemed to go nowhere with Kirk Douglas as Peter running around Chicago like a lunatic from place to place at one point with nothing on but his underwear. Peter was such bad news to almost everyone who tried to helped him that they ended up being killed. John Cassavetes was darkly effected as the evil one armed man who was responsible for all the bad things that happened in the movie. In the end he got just what he so rightfully deserved. Both Amy Irving  Andrew Stevens were unstable as well as psychic in their roles as the twin whizkids of parapsychology causing involuntary movements in both people and objects.What really made The Fury so bad is that you could not build up any sympathy for no one in the film.

	schema:headline " Young and Restless";
	schema:reviewBody "What a culture can't assimilate it destroys!  Dr McKeever The FuryBrian De Palma's early films tend to deal with a very clear but oft overlooked set of themes homosocialized male power gender warfare voyeurism and sex whereby all gender is a performance and white male heterosexuality needs to be rigorously determinedly infinitely reenacted to be maintained with any coherence often by repeatedly destroying that which it defines itself against homosexuality femininity the Other etc. Meanwhile personal and social voyeurism pornography fantasies government surveillance national spying overlap and his characters when they're not appearing on television can often be found making their own movies doing their own prying or displaying themselves as spectacle.Along these lines we had sororicide in Sisters in which feminized and masculinized twins jostle for control and incest and matricide in Obsession in which a father usurps his wife to be with his daughter. Next came Carrie in which telekinesis becomes a metaphor for a girl's blossoming into womanhood little Carrie White fighting off various groups of monogamists nymphomaniacs romantics and repressed fundamentalists. Then we had Dressed to Kill where a transgender's anima Feminine Personality kills women to prevent her animus Masculine Personality from being aroused and Scarface which links castration to the ennui of late capitalism Tony Montana's phallic M16 swelling only as the law of the jungle encroaches on his empire. Scarface's theme  money machismo and powah! as impotency  is revisited in Body Double. But here it is cinema which simultnaeously assuages and encourages impotency man essentially acting out fantasies by entering films via body doubles. From here on De Palma's films would increasingly be about cinema as redemption of film  against any and all narrative logic  having the power to redeem. So we have the redemptions of Carlito's Way Femme Fatale's wholly illogical divine interventions and the DNA strands spirals and linked hands of Mission to Mars a filmhologram teaching us of a kind of hokey cosmic brotherhood. Regardless The Fury like Carrie traces a girl's maturity into womanhood though here her growth is parallelled to that of a young man. Her name is Gillian and his name is Robin both introduced with highly sexualised scenes he wrestles his naked father to the floor she struts about in a skimpy bikini.On the cusp of adulthood both Robin and Gillian are captured by a secret organisation which hopes to turn them into Alphas harnessing their burgeoning sexual energy so that they may become military weapons. As both Robin and Gillian are taught how to redirect their libidinal drives De Palma treats us to a series of kitschy training sequences. His body is getting stronger a government nurse says Robin eventually turning into a kind of carnal hypersexed muscle man who seeks to metaphorically hump everyone to death with his telekinetic prowess. Gillian in contrast is repelled by human contact. For Gillian telekinesis is invasive a form of mind rape disgusting and repellent she essentially sees menstrual blood after each psychic experience. While Robin embodies sex as a violent masculinized act male as dominant Gillian is repression incarnate woman as victim.Unsurprisingly Gillian is played by Amy Irving the very actress who had a nightmare at the end of Carrie. In Carrie Carrie White is horrified by her body and her entry into womanhood. To survive she eventually harnesses her femininity to great destructive effect the Repressed returning in an orgy of destruction.The monstrosity in both films is that of adolescence of potentiality and those who paid most dearly for it are the conservators of a repressive adult order. What becomes clear in Carrie's final scene though is that Irving is the guilty narrator of that film and was in her own devoutly monogamous way equally guilty of twisting Carrie. The final nightmare of Carrie's bloody hand trying to drag Amy below brings to the surface this pervasive guilt embedded into our culture.With The Fury Irving thus gets a chance to revoke all guilt. De Palma shoots the film with a kind of ridiculous vitality everything superfast and supercharged a style suggestive of permanently sexed ultra horny adolescence. The film is one big boner and Amy Irving's climax  literally the orgasmic climax of the film  is nothing less than a cinematic ejaculation in which she finally steps up to the plate and her symbolic father and brother are now dead asserts her raging femininity literally causing John Cassavetes  who plays an evil government agent who hopes to become Amy's symbolic fatherdominatorlover  to explode. She in all her glorious womanness causes him to get the most massive of erections and the most massive of selfdestructive orgasms his head quite literally exploding in a geyser of blood flesh and semen. Silly? Yup. But the whole film is so deliciously overthetop Kirk Douglas plays a hilarious grey haired muscular superman  a feverish sexcomedy dressed up as a thriller. Indeed Godard was so impressed by The Fury that he cited its giddy dynamism as the reason he returned to popular filmmaking. Beyond this De Palma's usual obsessions are here extended set pieces government conspiracies and themes of what he calls image validity abound.

	onyx:emotionText "What a culture can't assimilate it destroys!  Dr McKeever The FuryBrian De Palma's early films tend to deal with a very clear but oft overlooked set of themes homosocialized male power gender warfare voyeurism and sex whereby all gender is a performance and white male heterosexuality needs to be rigorously determinedly infinitely reenacted to be maintained with any coherence often by repeatedly destroying that which it defines itself against homosexuality femininity the Other etc. Meanwhile personal and social voyeurism pornography fantasies government surveillance national spying overlap and his characters when they're not appearing on television can often be found making their own movies doing their own prying or displaying themselves as spectacle.Along these lines we had sororicide in Sisters in which feminized and masculinized twins jostle for control and incest and matricide in Obsession in which a father usurps his wife to be with his daughter. Next came Carrie in which telekinesis becomes a metaphor for a girl's blossoming into womanhood little Carrie White fighting off various groups of monogamists nymphomaniacs romantics and repressed fundamentalists. Then we had Dressed to Kill where a transgender's anima Feminine Personality kills women to prevent her animus Masculine Personality from being aroused and Scarface which links castration to the ennui of late capitalism Tony Montana's phallic M16 swelling only as the law of the jungle encroaches on his empire. Scarface's theme  money machismo and powah! as impotency  is revisited in Body Double. But here it is cinema which simultnaeously assuages and encourages impotency man essentially acting out fantasies by entering films via body doubles. From here on De Palma's films would increasingly be about cinema as redemption of film  against any and all narrative logic  having the power to redeem. So we have the redemptions of Carlito's Way Femme Fatale's wholly illogical divine interventions and the DNA strands spirals and linked hands of Mission to Mars a filmhologram teaching us of a kind of hokey cosmic brotherhood. Regardless The Fury like Carrie traces a girl's maturity into womanhood though here her growth is parallelled to that of a young man. Her name is Gillian and his name is Robin both introduced with highly sexualised scenes he wrestles his naked father to the floor she struts about in a skimpy bikini.On the cusp of adulthood both Robin and Gillian are captured by a secret organisation which hopes to turn them into Alphas harnessing their burgeoning sexual energy so that they may become military weapons. As both Robin and Gillian are taught how to redirect their libidinal drives De Palma treats us to a series of kitschy training sequences. His body is getting stronger a government nurse says Robin eventually turning into a kind of carnal hypersexed muscle man who seeks to metaphorically hump everyone to death with his telekinetic prowess. Gillian in contrast is repelled by human contact. For Gillian telekinesis is invasive a form of mind rape disgusting and repellent she essentially sees menstrual blood after each psychic experience. While Robin embodies sex as a violent masculinized act male as dominant Gillian is repression incarnate woman as victim.Unsurprisingly Gillian is played by Amy Irving the very actress who had a nightmare at the end of Carrie. In Carrie Carrie White is horrified by her body and her entry into womanhood. To survive she eventually harnesses her femininity to great destructive effect the Repressed returning in an orgy of destruction.The monstrosity in both films is that of adolescence of potentiality and those who paid most dearly for it are the conservators of a repressive adult order. What becomes clear in Carrie's final scene though is that Irving is the guilty narrator of that film and was in her own devoutly monogamous way equally guilty of twisting Carrie. The final nightmare of Carrie's bloody hand trying to drag Amy below brings to the surface this pervasive guilt embedded into our culture.With The Fury Irving thus gets a chance to revoke all guilt. De Palma shoots the film with a kind of ridiculous vitality everything superfast and supercharged a style suggestive of permanently sexed ultra horny adolescence. The film is one big boner and Amy Irving's climax  literally the orgasmic climax of the film  is nothing less than a cinematic ejaculation in which she finally steps up to the plate and her symbolic father and brother are now dead asserts her raging femininity literally causing John Cassavetes  who plays an evil government agent who hopes to become Amy's symbolic fatherdominatorlover  to explode. She in all her glorious womanness causes him to get the most massive of erections and the most massive of selfdestructive orgasms his head quite literally exploding in a geyser of blood flesh and semen. Silly? Yup. But the whole film is so deliciously overthetop Kirk Douglas plays a hilarious grey haired muscular superman  a feverish sexcomedy dressed up as a thriller. Indeed Godard was so impressed by The Fury that he cited its giddy dynamism as the reason he returned to popular filmmaking. Beyond this De Palma's usual obsessions are here extended set pieces government conspiracies and themes of what he calls image validity abound. So we have an early battle sequence staged and passed off as truth by movie cameras. We have American kids manipulated into hating Palestinians by having fake Palestinians attacking an Israeli outpost still timely. We also have an interesting shot in which Gillian uses her powers to flash back to a past event.

	schema:reviewBody "I was never a particular fan of Kirk Douglas but I would sometimes enjoy his films just took them one by one. This one which I remember seeing when I was 19 always stood out in my mind as being impressive. Now over 30 years later I still find it a riveting film.At the time of filming Douglas was 62. While I know he didn't do all his own stunts what he did do was quite remarkable at that age. And Douglas has all the intensity here that we grew used to in his career. He rarely let us down and certainly didn't here.John Cassavetes as the bad guy who is trying to harness the psychic powers of the young man and young woman is sufficiently evil here...you'll love what happens to his character at the close of the film. Carrie Snodgress is a sortof girlfriend of Douglas' and although I'm not a particular fan she does nicely here. Charles Durning always one of my favorite supporting actors does very nicely as the head of the institute that is studying the psychic powers of the young people and he treads a fine line here as a professional with a sense of morals who has unfortunately gotten into bed with Cassavetes he does it nicely! Amy Irving is terrific as the psychic young lady. Fiona Lewis is the friend and later victim of the whole plot and one of the professionals studying the psychic phenomenon. Andrew Stevens is excellent as the young male with psychic powers it reminded me to look up where he disappeared to...and that's behind the cameras in recent years.I must give Brian DePalma director credit here. He used the story and its drama to heighten suspense not overrelying on special effects. However the special effects are done very well here...used as needed but not overwhelming. Some people have compared a couple of scenes to scenes in Carrie but since DePalma directed that film also I guess we can't criticize him for a few similarities.This film is just as good in 2013 as it was in 1978. Yes a few things look dated like typing but the story is great and handled well by DePalma and the actors. Highly recommended.".

The movie was good    but John Cassevetes and the Kirk Douglas characters were kind of boring. I always thought that john Cassevetes is a little overrated because I've never seen him display a personality that is incredibly enjoyableeven with Rosemary's baby and in this movie he was his usual negotiating boring self.   There was some cool action scenes with  Kirk Douglas but my main love of the movie was the majority of the scenes with Amy Irvingwho reallydespite the billing is the main stand out character of the film.  We watch some really cool scenes with amy involving her watching Andrew Stevens psychically as Andrew watches video tapes of his father being attacked     blood running down other people as Amy's emotions are racing with energy.       a sleepwalking scene   a show where she is escaping from the hospital   a scene where she gives a girl a bloody nose and blue glowing eyes.   Amy and Andrew were the two telekinetic teens and they were young  fresh   emotional  and attractive.  I really enjoyed their presence and their performance really made the film work. The other characters are really just there for support except Kirk Douglas who gives his usual masculine role.  Overall I thought the film was pretty good  2 12 mainly because of the acting   special effects and the way some scenes just looked so cool!  I'd recommend this.".

I have never seen a movie so devoid of a story or sensible characters or logic. It's simply a mishmash of camera angles bad acting and overblown music. There are so many unintentionally hilarious scenes in THE FURY that it's pointless to name all of them because it would take as long as the movie itself in order to do so. But here are my favorite scenes spoilers aheadThe scenes at the school with that bitchy Margot Kidder lookalike.When Gillian Amy Irving witnesses the experiments Robin is going through and Gillian is freaking out as she's watching the bad guys replaying the film footage of the kidnapping of Robin Andrew Stevens which occurred at the beginning of the movie. The kidnapping wasn't scary or remotely troubling. It's just a standard shootem up scene and yet when Gillian watches the kidnapping she is shown to be shocked and horrified beyond belief. I wasn't even close to being scared or troubled by the scene as Gillian was which makes her character look totally silly.When Gillian has a vivid ESP moment and she grabs the hand of a woman and blood starts pouring out of the woman's fingernails. Cutex overload?When Gillian leaves the building and everything happens in slow motion which results with the death of Hester Carrie Snodgress in a car accident. Cue Kirk Douglas screaming and crying and fighting all in slow motion. Very funny.When Robin attacks the Arab men on the amusement park ride. Hilarious moment.When Robin attacks his father Douglas and both of them endup on the edge of a rooftop where Robin falls to his death. The really funny thing about this moment is that Robin was levitating when his father found him. So why didn't Robin prevent himself from hitting the ground by levitating his body? That scene doesn't make any sense whatsoever. And it's incredibly funny.After Robin dies from the fall his father hanging on the rooftop kills himself in anger by letting himself fall to the ground. This scene is straight out of AIRPLANE.When Gillian blows up the bad guy Cassavetes. I was literally rolling on the floor like the dismembered head in the movie. Shake and Bake?The acting by everyone is atrocious. Amy Irving cries throughout the movie. Kirk Douglas is embarrassing. Most of the actors don't even seem to know what they're doing. The music is bombastic. It's obvious that De Palma was given loads of money to come up with a new CARRIElike flick and the result is rushed and nonsensical. THE FURY reminds me of a Philly cheese sandwich it's not good for your health but it sure taste good with all that 1970s cheese in it.".

Shake and Bake?The acting by everyone is atrocious. Amy Irving cries throughout the movie. Kirk Douglas is embarrassing. Most of the actors don't even seem to know what they're doing. The music is bombastic. It's obvious that De Palma was given loads of money to come up with a new CARRIElike flick and the result is rushed and nonsensical. THE FURY reminds me of a Philly cheese sandwich it's not good for your health but it sure taste good with all that 1970s cheese in it.";

The soldiers shot stabbed and crippled large numbers of demonstrators estimates of the dead range from an official government figure of 207 to a couple thousand sending shock waves through the Korean populace. Ultimately this event more than any other would come to shape the future political development of Korea.A Petal Director Jang Sunwoo was in jail at the time of the incident arrested for organizing student rallies in Seoul. It was shortly after his release that he entered the film industry he says I wanted to do something meaningful that wouldn't get me arrested and one of his longstanding goals was to make a film about the incident. Nonetheless more than 15 years would pass before he found a producer with the desire and resources to bring these horrific and controversial events to the screen.At the time that A Petal  a bigbudget 2.8 billion won production by the standards of time  opened production in late 1995 Korea had changed greatly but was still dealing with the aftershocks of the massacre. Now headed by its first civilian government the country was witness to a public investigation into the events of 1980 that saw former presidents Chun Doohwan and Roh Taewoo brought to trial and eventually convicted though for crimes unrelated to the massacre. With so much public attention focused on the incident Jang saw less need to shoot a documentarystyle presentation of the events themselves and instead decided to depict the massacre's lingering effects in an indirect fashion. He has since referred to the film as a kind of ssitkkimgut a shamanist ritual meant to relieve a burdened soul this is the same ritual Jang depicts at the start of his 1995 documentary on the history of Korean cinema Cinema on the Road.A Petal takes place somewhat after the massacre focusing on a young girl who obviously suffers from severe psychological damage. The girl's dirtstreaked face and wild eyes she is played brilliantly by actress Lee Jeonghyun who later went on to become a wellknown techno pop star seem not to register pain or normal emotions and she can barely communicate. She attaches herself to a callous disabled manual laborer Moon Sungkeun who sexually abuses her partly in an effort to drive her away but she refuses to go. At the same time we follow a group of four students who are searching for her  she is their deceased friend's younger sister  though they haven't any idea where to find her among the actors playing the students are a young Choo Sangmi and Sol Kyunggu.Jang's film uses flashbacks haunting music disjointed editing and even animated sequences to create a highly disturbing and initially confusing collection of scenes and impressions. We soon realize that this is not going to be a simple indictment of the government and the soldiers' actions  as guilty as they may be everyone in the film possesses the will and capacity for violence. Jang's disturbing use of rape to develop the film's themes has opened it up to attack from certain critics although it should be said in Jang's defense that its role in the film is far more complex than the standard rapedwomanassymbolofravagednation allegory that so many films fall back on.Despite the intensity of many scenes what stands out most from A Petal is a blackandwhite flashback at the film's end which has to rank as one of the most powerful heartbreaking moments contained in any Korean film. This is the ssitkkimgut of which Jang spoke a scene in which the nightmare is revisited and reexperienced in all its terror. Viewers should not expect any easy reconciliation or solutions after the massacre is replayed. Nonetheless the process may lead to recognition and a chance of loosening one's grip slightly on the horrors of the past. REVIEW WRITTEN BY DARCY PAQUET".

	schema:headline " Historical meditation on the conflict of love and politics";
	schema:reviewBody "Im satirically and brutally depicted the 1979 assassination of South Korean ruler Park Chunghee in his last film The President's Big Bang. The Old Garden is another animal soft intimate notable for its physicality and not without moments of poetry. The color is rich and small details hair a touch the munching of food as well as the splash of water on a torso or a face rain snow a policeman's club are lovingly dwelt upon or intensely felt. This film is set only a little later in time but also in another more thoughtful style. It follows the outlines of a bestselling novel by Hwang Sokyong a story about the conflict between a memorable love affair and a life of devotion to leftist politics. It opens with the release of its hero Oh Hyunwoo Ji Jinhee who has spent seventeen years in prison for leftist activism and complicity in the student antigovernment riots of May 1980 known at the Gwangju Massacre they left several hundred dead. The 1979 coup led not to democracy but military dictatorship. Public outcry against Gwangju was decisive in the runup to democratic elections in South Korea that finally happened later in the Eighties. At Oh's release which would be around 1997 times have certainly changed though oddly enough there is no reference to the new political situation. Clearly South Korea has had an economic boom and Oh's mother is now a wealthy realtor who buys him 11000 euros worth of new clothes without giving it a thought. His old political allies are either ineffectual idealists or hopeless pessimists who squabble among themselves at an evening gathering.Oh doesn't want to stay with his mother. He returns to the mountains where he was hiding out before arrest and revisits the home of art teacher Han Yoonhee. She hid him for a while after the massacre and they had an intense affair. She is gone dead of cancer ten years into his confinement without ever being able to see Oh again. He goes to her old place where her paintings and writings are starting points for flashbacks to the earlier political events and to those days in hiding with Yunhee. The editing is lovely here moving from present to past seamlessly and neatly time after time and with a minimum of confusion.As we watch Hyunwoo's troubled idyll with Yoonhee we know what's going to happen  he's going to get caught  and we wonder how. This is the portrait of a relentlessly dedicated crusader. His political duties are more important to him than his love. Though Yoonhee begs him to go with her deep into the mountains to hide  she will quit her art teaching job for that  he decides to go back to Seoul and he's quickly captured there.Yoonhee is pregnant with his child. It's a girl Eongyul.The second half of the film focuses more on Yunhee's life during Hyunwoo's time in prison and on the horrible time of the massacre. Yunhee doesn't raise Eongyul and the little girl is sometimes alienated from her mother. Yunhee remains faithful to Oh and when a cute younger leftist comes on strong to her she sends him packing.The accusation that this film will be incomprehensible to us because it's a little vague about the historical events is hard to credit. We know very well what's going on. If anything is offputting it's some odd eating habits not the politics. The emotional side anyway is very understandable. Hyunwoo's behavior is a little hard to sympathize with but that's because he is who he is someone who remains a hero by in some ways failing as a human being. But he's never made predictable. And where before we wondered how he would get caught now we wonder how the story will end.When he finally talks to Eongyul on the phone and then meets her on a busy glitzy street in Seoul and she's a sexy babe now Hyunwoo doesn't admit he's her father but she knows. Haven't we seen that somewhere before? The ending with this scene followed by a sentimental sugary song is cheesy with the shadow of Yunhee lingering none too subtly in the background the couple's palpable longing for each other has been handled beautifully up to here. Yunhee's paintings ultrarealistic sentimentalized and aged photographs of the family and personalities are also a bit cheesy. They may have worked better in the novel where you don't actually have to see them.Still the beauty of early scenes the understated depiction of the intense love affair the seamless but clear and logical ways the film shifts timeframes leave good memories that the somewhat rudderless second half can't erase. As a whole The Old Garden reads as a passionate meditation on how lives can seem in memory and in reality to revolve around a few key moments. Im has almost made us forget about the long littleness of life made us believe in the grandeur of a historical narrative where each scene seems a beautifully crafted piece in a chronological puzzle held together by fact and emotion. As Yoonhee Yum Jungah is intense without ever being weepy or melodramatic. Ji Jinhee as Oh Hyunwoo is a sexy hunk with acres of charm. He has a smugness that is unappealing but that just may be exactly right for his character. You almost wish she had lived instead of him. What is to become of him now? Will he get rich like his mother or continue to be a crusader for workers rights? The film Im's fifth is currently playing in Paris where its complex melding of love and politics has been critically well received according to Allocin. Whether Americans are as responsive to such a story with its intense historicalpersonal mix is another question. Part of the SFIFF 2007.".

This film deals with relationshipsespecially relationships between men and women can be called a comedy impov but theres not a single sweet moment that we usually see in romantic comedies.This film shows us two successive love affairs a man experience and its really amazing how the director portrays them perceiving their relationship on their own ground.  The characters are all everyday figures sometimes you feel ashamed just looking at them because they could be you in your past relations.

The reason why I say this is because such genre in film although easily recognizable and independently existent in almost every country is the embodiment of films described as acquired taste.Crafting such films is not an easy task and sometimes enjoying them is as hard but ultimately rewarding. I always look forward to them because they often reflect life in such ways that make me blush feel saddened or merely reminiscent of a similar situation from a personal experience which I never thought possible to see through someone else's eyes.This film is a fine example of that type of cinema which isn't cautious shy nor uncertain of what it wants you to see. Obviously the actors and their delivery is the stronghold of this experience because it tends to bravely strip down to sincere dialogs perceptive expressions and ordinarily enjoyable landscapes. Something that I always look forward to in Hong's films no matter how unconventional the tales sometimes tend to be.Going into the details of the film's plot would be unreasonable due to the nature of its intent or the lack of it besides other reviews here have given enough insight as it is. In a sentence this has become Hong's favorite set ups in films where a man and a woman who haven't seen each other in some time meet and share few uncomfortable and sexual situations en route of heavy drinking and eating.Watch this film on any given day under any type of a weather with whomever you desire because the unfortunate truth is that Seonyoung's unintended journey will either fascinate you with its symbolic realism or repel you with its decision not to pass through the turning gate.".

Christmas In August 1998 One Fine Spring Day 2001 Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring 2003 Asako In Ruby Shoes 2000 Rules of Dating 2005 Art Museum By the Zoo 1998 and most of Yasujiro Ozu's films were very enjoyable to me. Add another 200 or so similar films to that recommendation list and one could be forgiven to conclude that I not only like deliberatelypaced slowburning arthouse cinema but I'm actually a big fan of the genre.To date I've seen four of Sangsoo Hong's films and one thing is certain the artistic merits of Virgin Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors 2000 was a fluke of sorts within Hong's otherwise unimpressive portfolio that treads dangerously close to mirroring something you'd see on Cinemax Late Night. A half dozen sex scenes? Check. Complete absence of character development? Check. Dullasdirt filler material? Check. In all honesty there's very little if anything that distinguishes Hong's films from tummy stick fests.Take Turning Gate as an example. A guy meets a girl bangs her senseless then stops seeing her. The same guy later meets another girl bangs her senseless then stops seeing her. The film ends. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this summary adequately covers any and all content this movie has to offer. You may wonder how on earth the running time clocks in at 115 minutes. I'll tell you. The characters walk around a lot wait for cabs and participate in some of the most boring conversations to ever grace celluloid.The whole point of minimalization in filmmaking is to recreate the charming intriguing scenarios that occupy everyday life while avoiding the uninteresting staleness surrounding those moments watch an Ozu film if you can't get your head around this concept. For instance the relationship with my first girlfriend could provide enough content for an interesting film but a director is misguided if he thinks that showing me on the toilet for five minutes is going to provide any sort of entertainment value. Will someone please inform Tsai Mingliang of this? Now Hong is not quite as bad as Tsai. He's close but Turning Gate isn't quite the abhorrent masterpiece of trashiness that Viva L'Amour 1994 is. Both directors do make significant contributions to Laundry filmmaking though  which means that their focus on realism gives these hacks a free pass to make movies that are completely devoid of content or insight. For me personally watching people pick each other up and bang is the equivalent of watching someone do their laundry. Hong's only good film  Virgin Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors  kept me interested in the hunt for two hours which is something you can't say for his other lesser efforts.If the director actually gave me some content to help me understand why these people live this way and how that lifestyle affects them then I'd surely enjoy it more. One Fine Spring Day for example does a wonderful job of showing the emotional rollercoaster of a typical relationship from beginning to end. Unfortunately Turning Gate as well as most of Hong's other movies is so devoid of content that the only people that will enjoy this movie are those who say to themselves Man I yearn to remember the days when I banged a different person every week with no strings attached. Don't misunderstand me. I love films with sex but I need something interesting or intriguing to keep me engaged. Strange Circus 2005 had copious amounts of explicit sex but it had psychological concepts behind them. Ardor 2002 The Isle 2000 and a few of the positively aforementioned films all had some steamy sex in them but there was enough content that raised the experience above Playboy Channel trash. Hong ventures into that trashy realm far too often.To close I'd like to also communicate my displeasure with other reviewers who have imposed informative psychological content INTO the film when the filmmaker himself failed to do so. I read statements like It is a transposition of life with all its ambiguities its unaccomplished desires its eternal quests or Every single spoken word has a special meaning and think to myself How the hell was any of this communicated through this film? It's a doubleedged sword I'm afraid. If someone is willing to project that much meaning into Turning Gate then you surely must give a movie like Show Girls the same consideration.After watching over 2000 East Asian films I've been able to identify the types of movies that are a waste of time. The exploitation genre e.g. The Untold Story or Kichiku Dai Enkai is one example. Arthouse cinema is full of traps because amongst the many amazing films within this genre there are some truly inept flops that are so unambitious and mindnumbingly awful that one simply cannot avoid an occasional pitfall here or there. I resent directors like Hong who entice me with one good entry only to then clobber me over the head with three steaming piles of pig manure.".

This picks up exactly where the previous one left off. As to not spoil the highly entertaining end of that film I won't go into too much detail about that. The situation is the same Egon still doesn't want to go back to prison and Kjeld and Yvonne's celebration nears the date. The Gang is still chasing the suitcase and their chase takes them into a hotel where the randy old Kai Lvring works to Carlsberg breweriesfinally displaying the Latin quote which has inspired so many parody ones throughout the series probably because this is the last and even to Pariswhere Bahs and Balling wrote most of these films again possibly chosen because this was to be the last film all of which including funny situations and jokes. The morally light nature of Paris is not only joked around a lot it's a plot point. There are clever references aplenty such as in the scene involving the KBGNo not KGB KBG! Kbenhavnske Body GuardsBodyguards of Copenhagen with the nervous and slightly neurotic Claus Ryskjr at the helm. Yvonne also participates more actively this time as always helping in her own peculiar way never following what's actually going on. Paris is the setting for some very funny scenes one involving Maxim's. Dick Kays makes an appearance in a small role as a slightly tightly wound crane worker proud of his work. Poul Reichhardt has a very funny role in which Benny shows his immense humanity. The humor is all sophisticated much of it is hilarious and it always hits the mark. We can follow the reasonings understand the conclusions. The Danish sayings that are changed around are also undeniably sidesplittingsuch as the very last phrase uttered by Holm the policeman. The ending so perfectly finishes off the series. It's worth it for any fan any real fan of the franchise. I recommend this very highly to any fan of Olsen Banden as well as Danish comedy. Watch the first 11 then watch both parts of this in reasonably quick succession. You won't regret it. 810".

It is incredible that the series could survive even into the 1980s describing a sublime Copenhagen which still exists but perhaps a world which no longer exists. Moreover this is of course comedy and extremely funny characters. Yvonne is a great character and so are the three members of the gang and the two police officers of course. The locations are also very interesting and there is a function on the DVD which can list the names of the locations as the movie is shown. This is supposedly the last movie in the series. I have at the moment of writing not seen the revival from 1998 but it is hard to believe that it should be able to imitate the incredible magic and genius of the original Erik Balling Olsenbanden movies.".

Bffen pulls out two! of his best deathtraps leading to several incredibly funny scenes. The character of Hallandsen perfectly cast with Holger Juul Hansen as the executive on the verge of a nervous breakdown begets several entertaining scenes one featuring Tom McEwan as an immigrant cab driver. Tommy Kenter is born to play the small but funny role that he does. With an ending that leaves you on the edge of your seat and wanting more all I can say is watch this and be sure to have the next one handy.

	schema:reviewBody "Even in the greatest stories there are chapters that aren't quite as strong as the rest. The Olsen Gang series is no exception. After three extraordinarily ingenious films in a rowand before that ...Runs Amok which marked the start of the period of perfection for the franchise... I suppose this could be argued to mark the end of said period but if my memory serves me right the next film pulls the level up again and one particularly amazing coup in the previous film it was to be expected that the quality would fade somewhat. After a quite funny opening scene ending in a very memorable line followed by a very unusual release scene with some playful music and editing the film never begets few laughs. And the bigger issue the writing. Too many new things are thrown somewhat carelessly into the mix and few of them work or are used properly. Brge is sorely missed.

After three extraordinarily ingenious films in a rowand before that ...Runs Amok which marked the start of the period of perfection for the franchise... I suppose this could be argued to mark the end of said period but if my memory serves me right the next film pulls the level up again and one particularly amazing coup in the previous film it was to be expected that the quality would fade somewhat. After a quite funny opening scene ending in a very memorable line followed by a very unusual release scene with some playful music and editing the film never begets few laughs. And the bigger issue the writing. Too many new things are thrown somewhat carelessly into the mix and few of them work or are used properly. Brge is sorely missed.

In spite of a very silly sequence that wouldn't have looked quite so out of place in a show by Benny Hill or an old black and white silent film a la Charlie Chaplin this is one of the best of the franchise. Dealing with the future of Denmark the plot is exceptionally wellwritten. It evolves very nicely throughout the film and the pacing is perfect. The acting is of the typical high level with more or lesser known Danish actors of the time shining in the many smaller roles in the film. The humorapart from in the scene mentioned above is excellent. With the usual plays on words sophisticated jokes and funny running gags not to mention the masterful human touch that brings us so close to these charactersmain as well as supporting what grounds it all what pulls us in. As Kjeld struggles mercilessly to access a meal that he's been anticipating for a long time we can laugh at it not because he's pitiful... but because he's real. We feel his pain. We can recognize it. Anyone who's seen the film knows exactly what I'm referring to and I refuse to ruin it for anyone who hasn't. We are treated to some nice visuals in this one... the film takes us inside the Copenhagen City Hallas far as me and my father could tell shot on location and even into the tower and to the City Hall Clock... and that's all I'm saying as the scenes that take place there are too good to spoil. More fun is had with Germans specifically through the character of The Black Baron. With an unusual opening a completely differentthough understandably so Yvonne and a very funny variation on Egon being rescued and having the impassioned sentimental speech afterwards this certainly also manages to divert nicely from what has been established as normal for the films. Also Bffen is unusually witty this time around which works quite well. More machinery that would have made the nationallyfamous Dane Storm P. proud. This time around Benny shows unexpected skills and Kjeld is put on a diet. More pseudoGerman this time spoken by Benny... in a hilarious and short scene. This is the tenth in the series and it also came out exactly ten years after the first... something that the filmmakers made something of a bit of deal out of in the film. I'll leave for the viewers to find out how. I recommend this to any fan of the series andor of Danish comedy of this period. 810".

With 'Parangjuuibo' aka 'My Girl and I' he tells an intense love story of two teenagers. This film very much reminded me of 'Love Story' but the director interprets it in his own unique and sincere way. Set against the spectacular and beautiful Korean landscape with stunning cinematography and a lively background score it's indeed a treat to watch. The director pays attention to detail makes use of symbolism and tackles issues such as life death afterlife without derailing from the main story. Just like 'Love Story' 'Parangjuuibo' has some excellent dialogue that speak volumes with just a few words. While many have tagged the film as a sobfest there's just so much more to this film than mere emotional manipulation and the director deserves immense credit for his honesty and authenticity in presentation. Clearly he's put a lot of heart into it. Taehyun Cha is more restrained here and gives a wonderfully intense performance that reflects his growth as an actor. The beautiful Hyekyo Song too does an outstanding job with her balanced performance. The supporting cast make their presence felt. The entire cast and crew have done a superb job in making this magnificent little movie. Whether people will like it or not there is something the viewer will take away with them that will stay long after the closing credits have rolled and this is reason enough for anyone to watch a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Partially similar to A Walk to Remember though at the same time incredibly different the genres comedy and drama are efficaciously combined to produce My Girl and I. The film's beginning sees SooHo Cha TaeHyun attending his school's ten year anniversary this introductory component potentially having the capacity to be accused of giving too much away revealing the passing of SooEun Sing HyeKyo his first love during his final year of school. However at the same time this heightens the sympathy and appreciation we feel towards her character instantly revealing the affect her existence has had upon SooHo.His character's ignorance and immaturity does on more than one occasion get the better of him as evident in his inability to originally recognize SooEun's affection later his selfish selfcentered attitude occasionally inflicting pain on her during instances when he in fact should be continuously appreciative of her compassionate interest. Though SooHo's feelings for her are unfathomably strong as depicted throughout the narrative his inability to honestly convey this can easily make the audience become annoyed with his attitude an aspect of his character which is not helped by his friends who exhibit characteristics of jealousy and mockery in regards to romance.The continuous return to the ocean not only represents the beauty of the seaside town but compliments SooEun's admittance that SooHo in her eyes looks just like the sea this being additionally heightened at the beginning by the loss of her beeper when she rescues SooHo from drowning. Although the device is no longer in her possession its ability to retain its message storage capability plays a large role in the feature especially towards the end as the leads exchange messages to one another after SooEun provides SooHo with the number so he too may access the device.The conversations that take place between the leads often includes beautifully poetic and romantic dialogue the well written material sweeping the audience along while the impressive acting talents of the main characters furthers the legitimacy of their convictions. Some of the issues that transpire between them are representative of other similar films though the predictability rarely plagues the audience due to the uniqueness the creator's employ. A scene where SooHo throws a pebble at SooEun's window to grasp her attention one night a technique formerly used in other features hilariously leads him to cause damage to her residence.As SooHo and SooEun begin to spend time together after committing to a relationship the locations that the couple visit including a pier the beach and a gorgeous island off the coast heighten visually the beauty of their relationship. The soundtracks that accompany many of the scenes are as equally enjoyable scaffolding not only the happiest moments of their love but the saddest instances as well the audience's awareness of SooHo's loss providing a sense of tension as we question if the pleasant moment we just viewed is the last they shall experience. With this thought in mind My Girl and I reflects the traditional melodramatic material South Korea is known for producing so be prepared for an emotionally poignant narrative that becomes especially prominent upon the realization that not all is well with SooEun.Moving on perhaps the most enjoyable character of all was SooHo's grandfather ManGeum Lee SoonJae a funeral director who helps scaffold the relationship between the leads with the revelation of his own first love experience. His heartening story of love and loss is developed over the duration of the feature being as passionate as it is well developed further realizing one of the film's endeavors  to make the characters and viewers alike believe in a romance that continues long into the afterlife. Moreover SooHo's mother Kim HaeSook and SooEun's father Han MyungGoo provide an equal measure of comic relief and emotional flare Ms. HaeSook's inclusion in the story assisting in the depiction of pain felt after a lover's passing while Mr. MyungGoo admirably portrays a father who deeply cares for his daughter the helplessness and acceptance he later conveys being especially well delivered.The stories of romance that occur around the leads will potentially remind viewers of Lover's Concerto while at the same time the feature reveals an honest depiction of adolescence and adulthood and the differences that separate the two. Although a criticism could be made about the short amount of time dedicated to the relationship in actuality the plot is neither too long nor too short rewarding the viewer with a touching experience that although not entirely original is still capable of bringing a tear and a smile.".

The acting of the cast was not exemplary with the exception of Cha Tae Hyunwho was able to gain the sympathy of the viewer with his role portrayal. Song Hyekyo is very pretty but was never up to par with her leading man as far as acting is concerned. Paging Gianna JunJun JiHyun?

Most of these films start off bright and happy enough but most of the time after the first hour or so one of the lovers learns of or reveals his or her disease and the film goes on until the sick partner dies and the other lives with the memories of his or her dead lover and tries to get on with life. My Girl and I is a bit different in the fact that from the outset that Su Ho's girlfriend dies at the young age of eighteen and that even after ten years he has not come to terms with her passing. This key feature like reading a long flashback sequence in a novel in which the reader already knows tragic outcome adds a tinge of melancholy to the early parts of this film because the viewer already knows that the young couple is going to be separated. However it also makes these parts more touching as well because it was within this brief period of time that Su Ho and Su Eun came to love each other.While out for a swim with three of his friends an unconscious Su Ho is rescued by the beautiful Su Eun. However before Su Ho regains consciousness Su Eun runs off and realizes that she lost her beeper while rescuing Su Ho. At school Su Ho soon notices that for some reason or another Su Eun is making eyes at him and that she is taking every opportunity to be close to him. After a mild scuffle with the captain of the judo team Su Ho and Su Eun escape the scene and begin to become closer. Because her father is quite scary Su Eun gives Su Ho her messenger service number so they can listen to each other's messages. Through this unusual way of communication and other methods as well they are able to build a romantic love for each other that will seemingly last for years A Korean remake of Isao Yukisada's Crying Out Love in the Center of the World Jeon Yunsu's My Girl and I really does not add much to the plethora of Korean romantic tragicomedies but it does take this sometimes vapid genre and breathe some new life into it with some truly great acting by the two leads. Another thing that struck me about the film was the attention to detail. Some of the most moving scenes take place within the hospital when the viewer listens to a voice over of the couple's messages such as when Su Eun is pricked for yet another I.V. Also such attention to things like the bruises left on Su Eun's hands are heartbreaking because they are evidence of her frailty and the fleetingness of her life.".

The story is also unique its about sibling love as opposed to all the other romances about relationships and sex. Ha Jiwon was hot as always. The dude from My Sassy Girl was also great he played an idiot pretty convincingly haha. The stories intertwined well together and the ending didn't really upset either. The only gripe I had in this entire movie is how they dragged on some of the scenes. I know the fool liked to repeat stuff over and over again but when the people of normal intelligence were doing it too it seemed fake and overdramatic. Overall a great film though.".

	schema:reviewBody "BABO is a 2008 film based closely on a popular webcomic by Kang Full. While the film does contain some comedy it tells a much deeper story than any of Cha Taehyun's other films. I would even say that the film is purely an emotional drama with only mere hints of romance and slight humor. In BABO Jiho Ha Jiwon returns home after studying and playing the piano in Europe for over ten years. She left Europe because of the frustration that came with an instance of stage fright. Back in her hometown she meets her mentally challenged childhood friend Seungryong Cha Taehyun who runs a small toast shop in order to take care of his younger sister Jiin Park Hasun who unfortunately despises him. Along with Seungryong's best friend Sangsoo Park Hee soon and Heeyeong Park Grina the characters all suffer life problems of their own. It is the village idiot Seungryong who heals and saves them all.Jiho and Sangsoo's interaction with Seungryong evokes pity and nostalgic sympathy. Due to a misunderstanding Sangsoo's guilt as a child drew him close to Seungryong as a true friend. Jiho on the other hand was admired by Seungryong ever since they were little due to her piano playing that according to Seungryong would cause snow to fall and stars to appear. It is sweet and a bit sad to see Ha Jiwon's character treat Seungryong so nicely because of his innocent mind. While he genuinely likes her she finds comfort and strength when she looks after him. The film tells a story that really can only be fully understood by reading the expressions and actions of the actors. And it is those actions that can cause the viewer to get a bit teary eyed here and there throughout the film.Speaking of actors Cha Taehyun plays his role as the hardworking village idiot so convincingly. And he does so with his own style  his signature goofy smile adds so much authenticity to his character's innocence. He really is one of the best actors in Korea. Ha Jiwon impressed me as well considering that this is one of her first works that I've seen where she isn't typecasted as a cutesy love interest. The slight emotional changes that her character experiences can be seen thanks to her superb acting despite the limits that the script has for her character. All the other actors were great as well besides Park Ha sun in one scene towards the end of the film  while the scene evokes grievous emotion it appears questionably forced.It is fascinating how the individual stories of each character seem separate but all converge in the end. And it is that result that really makes the viewer sit back and think how people no matter how smart or talented can affect the lives and happiness of those nearby. BABO is a touching film that stays with the viewer well after the ending credits. I highly recommend giving it a watch especially if you're a fan of Korean dramas.".

The biggest problems arise with Romero's virtually absent budget. We have a cast of amateurs some moved on to star in other films particularly by Romero. Richard Liberty as Frankenstein in Day of the Dead being the most noteworthy. Despite not having any star power the cast for the most part does a decent job notwithstanding. But the settings although very realistic just don't create a real sense of fear for me or believability. I wonder what this film might have been with a budget double the size. If you can get past the minuscule budget you will find an interesting film here. A film I think that has some real issues at hand even now. The things Romero does do well is create suspense based on the feelings of time being an enemy and make some scathing social commentary on the nature of war science in war and apocalyptic threads concerning the way rules are all thrown out when faced with doomsday.".

	schema:reviewBody "Romero's zombie classics 'Night Of The Living Dead' and 'Dawn Of The Dead' are two of the best horror movies ever made but they really cast a huge shadow over his career. Romero made two movies in between that are seriously overlooked the fascinating character study of a vampire? 'Martin' and 'The Crazies' a paranoid thriller in a similar vein to the Dead movies. While not actually a zombie movie as such anyone who enjoys NOTLD or DOTD will find much to admire here. The budget is very low so the production values sometimes leave a bit to be desired and the acting is variable but overall I think it's a terrific movie with some interesting echoes of both NOTLD and the Vietnam war. Will MacMillan David and Lane Carroll Judy aren't familiar to me and neither is Lloyd Hollar who plays the Colonel in charge of the quarantine he's very good but cult fave Lynn Lowry 'Shivers' plays space case Kathy her Dad Richard Liberty will be recognized by anybody who has seen 'Day Of The Dead' and David's 'Nam buddy Clank Harold Wayne Jones went on to appear in Romero's 'Knightriders'. And then there's the wonderful Richard France playing a similar character to the one he would memorably play in DOTD an outraged scientist. 'The Crazies' pretty much flopped back in the 70s but looking at it now restored for DVD it's obviously one of Romero's best and a must for any horror buff. The commentary track by Romero and William 'Maniac' Lustig is also highly recommended as it offers lots of insights into the highs and lows of low budget film making.".

Once again a film stuffed with subtle criticism on society and pitch black humor. The Crazies immediately demands your full attention with a powerful precredits opening sequence and the highexcitement level is upheld throughout the entire movie. The little Pennsylvanian town of Evans City is overcome with a secret but very lethal government virus leaving the infected either dead or incurably insane. Trixie initially was developed as a chemical weapon so not one of the scientists or army officers know how to put a stop to it when innocent people are exposed to it. The simple plot and cheap elaboration are excellently camouflaged by Romero's sharp eye for detail. Right from the start he builds up a tense atmosphere of truly realistic mass hysteria that confuses even you  the viewer  in not knowing which characters are infected and which aren't. They could all simply be triggerhappy Pennsylvanian hillbillies for all we know! Although this film never really becomes disturbing there are quite a few scenes that shock and that feel strangely real. You could also state The Crazies was quite ahead of its time because chemical warfare is much more in the picture now than it was 30 years ago when this film got shot. Romero's premise is simple but efficient the malfunctioning and greed of the human race is much scarier than any fictional horror monster could ever be. Best example is the military men who become eerie and threatening in their icky white suits.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aside from Dawn of the Dead I feel that this little seen film is one of Romero's strongest vehicles.  Indeed the two films have a great deal in common in terms of pacing style and overall visual impact.  It throws the viewer into the middle of a story with little introduction and continues at a breakneck pace right until it's bleak conclusion.  The wonderful thing about Romero's works is that he manages to take situations that might just be distantly possible and make them an absolute chaotic reality.  This film is a testament to that and may even stand as one of his more realistic and plausible stories.  Performances on the part of almost all of the actors are very good particularly the main group of focus.  There are some awkward moments with David but Judy is very good and proves herself particularly in her final scenes.  Clank is interesting to watch and does a very good job of descending into a dangerous and confused haze.  Richard Liberty's Artie is a favorite though due largely to a scene where he tells why he never allowed his daughter to date.  He is truly creepy.  Those on the military side are also very good particularly Major Rider and Colonel Peckam.  I must admit that I do have a soft spot in my heart for Richard France as Dr. Watts.  He rants and relentlessly chews the scenery in a grand performance and adds a wonderful dash of color and even more insanity to this bleak film. Romero is always interesting in his use of characters and this film is no exception.  He is constantly pushing the envelope of audience expectations by having major characters die or succumb to the madness.  Nothing is safe in a Romero movie.  His use of the soldiers is wonderful in the frenzied and gritty military and chase scenes.  This film as a whole is gritty unnerving and a perfect stylistic precursor to Dawn of the Dead.  One of the better scare pictures of the 70s.".

His use of the soldiers is wonderful in the frenzied and gritty military and chase scenes.  This film as a whole is gritty unnerving and a perfect stylistic precursor to Dawn of the Dead.  One of the better scare pictures of the 70s.";

	schema:reviewBody "We're mad as hell and we're not going to take this anymore!  Howard Beale NetworkThis is a review of George Romero's The Crazies a horror film released in 1973 and 2010's The Crazies a remake directed by Breck Eisner son of media mogul Michael Eisner.The better of the two Romero's film sees the US military accidentally releasing a biological weapon into a small town's water supply. This bioagent turns the town's population into raving murderous lunatics. As a result the US government swiftly quarantines the town. Much violence ensues.Romero's film is shapeless overlong lacking in tension towards its final act and nowhere as good as his zombie movies. It's also frequently brilliant. It's a mad hilariously anarchic politically incorrect mob of a movie filled with manic energy and many strange passages some of which were deemed shocking back in the early 1970s. Kubrick's Dr Strangelove  Romero borrows Kubrick's allpercussion soundtrack  and Peter Watkins' Punishment Park seem to be the chief influences.Like Romero's zombie movies The Crazies simmers with postWatergate distrust. Our heroes are government hating Vietnam vets and much of the film observes as various social institutions the state the nuclear family the church fester implode or explode. Significantly Romero paints contemporary society as being crazy long before the bioagent was released it was already waiting to discharge. The contaminated water merely shatters civilization's last facades and brings various latent abominations andor unspoken feelings rushing to the surface. It was always going to happen. Or as Romero says in interviews what's crazy is that it hasn't already occurred.Unsurprisingly themes of incest and militarism abound. A father has sex with his daughter priests set themselves on fire echoing the famous selfimmolation photographs of the Vietnam war in which Buddhist monks set themselves alight soldiers tear down villages like the Nazis' liquidated ghettos helicopters echo Vietnam's Hueys and much of the film paints military and government figureheads as being as mad and irrational as the infected townspeople. Pretty soon it becomes clear that the state's method of treating the madness is itself madness Romero eradicating the line between infected and the uninfected they're all crazy the government mimicking the volatile violent behavioural patterns of those contaminated. You can't just push people around like this! one man yells. But no one listens. Everyone's being pushed.The film's pacing is slowed by various sequences which focus on annoying bureaucrats and fasttalking figureheads. Though grating Romero's intentions with these scenes are nevertheless correct. State bureaucracy in which men and women spend as much time fighting each other red tape and the inefficiency of procedure is itself viruslike and counterintuitive nothing gets done everyone infected with a kind of bureaucratic madness. Elsewhere scenes show rural idylls and totems of conservative America torn apart by mad patriarchs the film's opening sequence is Night of the Living Dead in microcosm. Hilariously few people are even given a chance to succumb to the virus the military kills them more efficiently and rapidly than the virus ever could. One of the film's jokes is that a perfectly functioning military apparatus is far more illogical bloated and morally messed up than the collapsed lawless hordes it battles.Fittingly the name of the film's bioagent is Trixie literally the bringer of joy. On an allegorical level it is the state's blunders its inherent violence which are directly inspiring an almost carnivalesque explosion of public mayhem. The military steps in to violently clamp down on these outbursts but they're not fast enough. Oppositional groups clash lock horns and slaughter one another in a mad incoherent festival which does nothing but destroy any form of potential sociopolitical progress. An early 70s capitalist order is assaulted but rather than enabling progressivism in the formation of a new social order things are only further debilitated and any rational functions necessary for future formations are swiftly put down. The film ends with a pregnant woman dying and with her the hope of a future and two rugged men stepping out of the conflict's wreckage. One's an African American airlifted above the carnage symbolically outside and above it all another's a fireman who embodies the adjusted immunized man of tomorrow cynical and a Vietnam vet but with a traditional love for marriage servitude and stability his first lines stress his love for moderation. The lyrics Heaven Help Us play over the film's closing credits. There are countless parallels between The Crazies and Romero's earlier and later films. Two obscure ones Richard France who looks like a cross between Orson Welles and Francis Ford Coppola plays men of reason in both The Crazies and Dawn of the Dead. His character's always warning populaces Richard's an Orson Welles scholar his character having many overlaps with Welles' War of the Worlds radioplay. Then there's The Crazies' plot itself which echoes Romero's earlier Season of the Witch in which the banalities of the bourgeois drive an oppressed housewife's to various subversions and perversions. Released in 2010 Breck Eisner's The Crazies removes the politics of Romero's film but largely tells the same tale. It's a safe clean and sanitised movie like licking an Ipod while rubbing a credit card on your crotch. Glossy overproduced expensive looking and immaculately pressed the film moves looks and feels like plastic. While some of its horror moments elicit some thrills it's mostly all very conventional and clichd. Still some of Eisner's changes are interesting. While Romero has officials talking of dropping a nuke on the infected town Eisner does it for real encapsulating the film's philosophy spectacle over politics. Elsewhere he spares the life of a government soldier who helps our band of rebels whilst the far more pessimistic Romero outright murders the very same character. 7.510  See 2009's Carriers 2011's Contagion and 1978's Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Worth one viewing.".

Our heroes are government hating Vietnam vets and much of the film observes as various social institutions the state the nuclear family the church fester implode or explode. Significantly Romero paints contemporary society as being crazy long before the bioagent was released it was already waiting to discharge. The contaminated water merely shatters civilization's last facades and brings various latent abominations andor unspoken feelings rushing to the surface. It was always going to happen. Or as Romero says in interviews what's crazy is that it hasn't already occurred.Unsurprisingly themes of incest and militarism abound. A father has sex with his daughter priests set themselves on fire echoing the famous selfimmolation photographs of the Vietnam war in which Buddhist monks set themselves alight soldiers tear down villages like the Nazis' liquidated ghettos helicopters echo Vietnam's Hueys and much of the film paints military and government figureheads as being as mad and irrational as the infected townspeople. Pretty soon it becomes clear that the state's method of treating the madness is itself madness Romero eradicating the line between infected and the uninfected they're all crazy the government mimicking the volatile violent behavioural patterns of those contaminated. You can't just push people around like this! one man yells. But no one listens. Everyone's being pushed.The film's pacing is slowed by various sequences which focus on annoying bureaucrats and fasttalking figureheads. Though grating Romero's intentions with these scenes are nevertheless correct. State bureaucracy in which men and women spend as much time fighting each other red tape and the inefficiency of procedure is itself viruslike and counterintuitive nothing gets done everyone infected with a kind of bureaucratic madness. Elsewhere scenes show rural idylls and totems of conservative America torn apart by mad patriarchs the film's opening sequence is Night of the Living Dead in microcosm. Hilariously few people are even given a chance to succumb to the virus the military kills them more efficiently and rapidly than the virus ever could. One of the film's jokes is that a perfectly functioning military apparatus is far more illogical bloated and morally messed up than the collapsed lawless hordes it battles.Fittingly the name of the film's bioagent is Trixie literally the bringer of joy. On an allegorical level it is the state's blunders its inherent violence which are directly inspiring an almost carnivalesque explosion of public mayhem. The military steps in to violently clamp down on these outbursts but they're not fast enough. Oppositional groups clash lock horns and slaughter one another in a mad incoherent festival which does nothing but destroy any form of potential sociopolitical progress. An early 70s capitalist order is assaulted but rather than enabling progressivism in the formation of a new social order things are only further debilitated and any rational functions necessary for future formations are swiftly put down. The film ends with a pregnant woman dying and with her the hope of a future and two rugged men stepping out of the conflict's wreckage. One's an African American airlifted above the carnage symbolically outside and above it all another's a fireman who embodies the adjusted immunized man of tomorrow cynical and a Vietnam vet but with a traditional love for marriage servitude and stability his first lines stress his love for moderation. The lyrics Heaven Help Us play over the film's closing credits. There are countless parallels between The Crazies and Romero's earlier and later films. Two obscure ones Richard France who looks like a cross between Orson Welles and Francis Ford Coppola plays men of reason in both The Crazies and Dawn of the Dead. His character's always warning populaces Richard's an Orson Welles scholar his character having many overlaps with Welles' War of the Worlds radioplay. Then there's The Crazies' plot itself which echoes Romero's earlier Season of the Witch in which the banalities of the bourgeois drive an oppressed housewife's to various subversions and perversions. Released in 2010 Breck Eisner's The Crazies removes the politics of Romero's film but largely tells the same tale. It's a safe clean and sanitised movie like licking an Ipod while rubbing a credit card on your crotch. Glossy overproduced expensive looking and immaculately pressed the film moves looks and feels like plastic. While some of its horror moments elicit some thrills it's mostly all very conventional and clichd. Still some of Eisner's changes are interesting. While Romero has officials talking of dropping a nuke on the infected town Eisner does it for real encapsulating the film's philosophy spectacle over politics. Elsewhere he spares the life of a government soldier who helps our band of rebels whilst the far more pessimistic Romero outright murders the very same character. 7.510  See 2009's Carriers 2011's Contagion and 1978's Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

	schema:reviewBody "Or The Stupids but that would be the movie about the writers of this film. This movie is an insult to the U.S. army and anyone who has ever served in it. I love it when those horror movie directors try to make statements and teach us about authority the military freedom and so on. Not that other directors are much more intelligent. Romero's utter contempt for the U.S. army is written all over this deluded paranoid vision of the kind of events that arise in an emergency quarantine situation.I can't believe how shoddily this whole operation is being run! shouts one army guy and I tend to agree. I agree that a military operation can be run this badly only in the mind of an idiot who hasn't got a clue how the military really handles ANY kind of emergency. The army is nobody's friend says a civilian exsoldier on the lam and then proceeds to kill about a dozen soldiers and the viewer is supposed to side with him. Even the town's police force try to rebel threatening to use force even and one cop gets shot accidentally as a result. The town's doctor is uncooperative and the town's mayor is even worse  he's in hysterics over this whole operation. Does everyone in this town hate the army so much? Does Romero really think that there iswas so much hatred of the army in the public that people at all levels from garbage man to mayor would refuse to cooperate? And in a small town? Romero must be an idiot. He must have been reading too much hippie literature if such an oxymoronic thing even exists or he must be one of those leftwing morons who think that the U.S. government is always looking forward to an opportunity to nuke its own people. Romero would have us believe that top government people are just itching to finally nuke a couple of Americans into orbit.There are MANY ultradumb actions and decisions which Romero's military undertakes. For example the town's entire populace is being dragged out of their homes and gathered into a high school gymnasium. Excuse me but if some of the inhabitants are infected and others aren't then wouldn't it make more sense to leave everyone at home so that the infected ones don't infect the rest? I mean come on. NO ARMY IN THE WORLD can be this dumb. Except Romero's army for they are imbeciles. And naturally this Romero army gathers the townsfolk in a must unpleasant and unfriendly manner. You see Romero's U.S. army hates civilians and will take any opportunity to make them suffer when they get the chance. Romero's U.S. army isn't even welltrained. They can barely handle civilians some of whom have never held semiautomatic rifles in their hands. The way they get bumped off by our duo of exberets is simply ridiculous. These two were playing Rambo before Rambo even existed. Just because they are exberets we are lead to believe that they are practically invincible. In fact it's pathetic how Romero wants us to root for the main trio of outlaws when in fact their actions were being irresponsible selfish and driven by panic. Romero would be surprised by this but I was rooting for the military even if it was Romero's military no ordinary military of course to bump off the trio of runaway idiots. One can almost sense how much Romero enjoyed having so many soldiers killed more soldiers than civilians seem to get bumped off here.There were other dumb things. For example the geniusscientist who is sent to help with the crises this guy said early on that an antidote for the virus is nowhere in sight and that the government had been looking for one in vain for three years already. But then suddenly a day or two later this same guy makes a major breakthrough with finding the antidote! What a COINCIDENCE. And to make things even more absurd he makes this breakthrough in a hastily assembled lab which lacks the necessary assistants and equipment that he normally has at his disposal he complains about the microscope for example. How idiotic! Actually the film had potential. The action is good and the premise opens a lot of exciting possibilities for a horroraction film. Unfortunately Romero's hatred for men in green uniforms has gotten in the way of making a sensible and credible martiallaw virus movie. For an intelligent approach to this idea of a virus infection being contained by the government one should look no further than for Andromeda Strain even Outbreak. For a childish paranoid and generally silly approach to this theme this film is ideal.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Crazies is set in a small Pennsylvanian town called Evans City. The film starts with with a man having killed his wife setting fire to his house for no apparent reason. Major Ryder Harry Spillman of the United States Army and his men have arrived in Evans City after a recent plane crash. The plane crashed into a river that supplies the town's water onboard the plane was a man made virus called Trixie. The military believe that the residents of Evans City may be infected with a disease that turns the sufferer into a crazie people who commit random acts of violence  are generally unpleasant to be around. Major Ryder takes over the local Doctors Dr. Brookmyer Will Disney surgery and prepares his plan of action. His men form a perimeter around Evans City no one gets in or out. His men are then ordered to round all the residents up and take them to the high school. Soon an even more high ranking officer Colonel Peckhem Lloyd Hollar arrives to take charge as well as Dr. Watts Richard France who was part of the team who originally developed Trixie to try and find a cure for the disease. The military think they have the situation under control but five people have escaped their roundup Dr. Bookmyer's nurse named Judy Lane Carroll  her fireman husband David Will MacMillan  his workmate Clank Harold Wayne Jones Artie Richard Liberty  his daughter Kathy Bolman Lynn Lowry  Frank Winson Norman Chase most of whom are convinced that they would be better off as far from Evans City as possible. Will they make it out  are they infected? Can Colonel Peckham keep the situation quiet prevent the disease from spreading outside Evans City and resolve the crisis before unthinkably drastic action is taken?Written  directed by George A. Romero I really disliked this poor excuse for a film. The script by Romero is about as dull and slow as you can imagine. The film itself is too long and just plain boring although I did like the last 10 or 15 minutes  the downbeat ending. The Crazies also has a lot of similarities with Romero's infinitely superior Dawn of the Dead 1978 the female lead being pregnant a fight against inhuman faceless enemies all the soldiers wear gas masks the lone survivors who question whether they should stay or leave  a degeneration into petty squabbling and infighting. All the characters are very unlikable too both military and civilian. The fact that the acting is poor throughout doesn't help things either. The violence  gore is nonexistent there are some gunshot wounds that's it. Overall the film is very rough on a technical level and becomes a real chore to watch. I had heard very good things about the Crazies but I just can't see anything in it even remotely enjoyable. Maybe I was expecting too much but having Romero's name on the credits as director gave me high expectations that weren't met. Anyone familiar with Romero's other horror like Dawn of the Dead Creepsow 1982 Martin 1977 Day of the Dead 1985  expect something similar then prepare to be very disappointed. Proceed with caution.".

There is no thrills or that much detail. It's basically a cross between Outbreak and Rabid and i hate to associate these movies with The Crazies because they were pretty good. Also similar to 28 Days Later but that was a great movie too so how can a highly contagious virus movie suck? Why are there a group of sane people killing army guys? Why don't the infected act crazy instead of just slightly agitated? If you like bad bland movies with very poor structure then this is unmissable but if you don't then go watch the movies i've already mentioned! 210".

The idea is goodand has been redone in later slicker and slightly better films such as Outbreak Warning Sign and Impulse the Meg Tilly movie not the Theresa Russell one.  Actually The Crazies has more in common with an Ed Wood productionthe hysterical awful acting the cardboard dated characters one character keeps using the word MAN before and after every sentencehe's a Vietnam vet you see horrible and I mean HORRIBLE sound effects the spring peeper frogs actually drown out the dialogue in many scenes overthetop direction and ketchup for blood well it was filmed in Pittsburghmaybe Romero had a deal with Heinz.  I wouldn't even watch this movie for laughs.  I will repeatthis movie is bad.";

His original 'Dead' trilogy there went on to be three additional read optional instalments beginning in 2005 'Night of the Living Dead' 1968 'Dawn of the Dead' 1978 and 'Day of the Dead' 1985 essentially created the modern zombie apocalypse template. 'The Crazies' while certainly coming from the same cocktail shaker as these movies with its mix of unthinking killers rampant destruction bloody violence and a good dose of social commentary nonetheless cuts a slightly different stride to its illustrious predecessor or the subsequent carnageridden affairs that followed.When the inhabitants of a small town in Western Pennsylvania are exposed to a virus through their local water supply and begin turning into homicidal maniacs the army duly turn up call martial law and quarantine the town. We soon learn that the army knows alltoowell the extent of the hazard they are facing as the virus known as 'Trixie' was designed by the military as an experiment in germ warfare and was accidentally released into the town when an army aircraft crashed nearby. For the alert read pedantic zombiephile this is enough to rule the movie out of deserving the zombie tag as the victims are not reanimated corpses but the very alive victims of a disease with no known cure. Nevertheless the threat the infected  zombies pose means that the soldiers have been ordered to take no chances and as panic escalates to feverpitch the soldiers fail to distinguish between psychotic symptoms of the disease and justified hysterical fear for one's uninfected lifewhich in turn unceremoniously erases the line separating the soldiers from the unthinking killers they are trying to contain.As with the 'Dead' films Romero's focus is on characters amidst the chaos and the film follows a small band of townspeople trying to escape the quarantine and the tangible threat of the military as well as the intangible threat of possible contagion from a disease they know nothing about. The cast are largely inexperienced and while the acting is competent in parts it comes across as a bit wooden and crucially detracts somewhat from the potential pathos as the movie builds to its climax. However for horror connoisseurs it's cool to spot Lynn Lowry who plays Kathy who would go on to be directed by David Cronenberg in his psychosexual parasite horror 'Shivers' two years later. In addition Kathy's father in the film is played by Richard Liberty who would go on to put in a memorable performance as Dr Frankenstein Logan in 'Day of the Dead' more than a decade later.In addition to some patchybutpassable acting the film's real Achilles heel is that it's a high budget idea trapped within the constraints of a low budget in contrast to 'Night of the Living Dead' which was a low budget idea and worked easily within such confines. As such many of the locations and action sequences seem to struggle and the film is lucky that it can rest on some interesting ideas and the talent of its director. However saying this things do seem to come together towards the end and work up to a denouement with a fair amount of pathosit's just tempting to suggest that if Romero had made the film later in his career with more money at his disposal the film would have carried a much harder punch than it does in actuality. For Romero fans its arguably a mustsee but for the less dedicated moviegoer the 2010 remake or even better '28 Days Later' or in my opinion the superior '28 Weeks Later' may be more rewarding.".

But if there is some sympathy for the individual doctors and army personnel since they are doing what needs to be done to prevent further outbreak you can only feel growing anger that this kind of situation could actually happen. If bioweapons exist it seems eventually one will be released by mistake and then what? Will it be like the Japanese nuke plant after a tsunami where evacuations and appropriations are required in the name of national security. And is the solution to bio warfare the dropping of an atomic bomb? Maybe.That's at the core of this film. There is of course a couple at the center of the struggle to evade the authorities and survive. And infighting questions of who to trust how to figure out who is infected going back to Invasion of the Body Snatchers of course and fear of infection itself pepper the film with drama and sometimes incredulity. There is also the hope of finding someone immune to the disease which turns out to be slim especially when the real cures get obscured by events.All of this would work better with better acting. Director George Romero got away with some raw and imperfect acting in his very original Night of the Living Dead in 1968 but that was partly because everyone was either panicked or behaving like a zombie there were for sure a couple great leads in that one. Here though most people are ordinary folk and between their clunky acting and the even more clunky filming in raw color it just smells too much of a throwtogether affair. Too bad because the premise is terrific. There are other movies that push this kind of idea by the way and push it better the most famous probably being The Andromeda Strain from 1971. However if this kind of roughedged production doesn't bother you I think you have a kind of lowbrow highbrow classic appealing to all kinds of sentiments.".

Romero creates a disturbing cautionary story of a virus known as Trixie which turns people from a small town into psychopathic murderers bent on killing everyone in sight whether it be their husbands wives children neighbors it quickly becomes a fight for survival if survival is even possible. Luckily a small number of people are escaping the epidemic but along the way they lose support from everyone including the military which was responsible for engineering the virus in the first place.The Crazies is exciting nonstop suspense and unlike horror movies made today in this movie you actually get attached to the characters and want them to escape the terror it definitely keeps you watching 'till the end. It has eerie soundtrack decent acting Lynn Lowry from I Drink Your Blood is actually in it as well. It has that grainy nostalgic feel to it because it was filmed back in '73 I miss that look of old films.Once again Romero has made his mark in the horror genre with a movie that is timeless and exciting and creepy all at once.

Stamp creates a portrait of sexual obsession that is every bit as unsettling in its way as the long legacy of serial killer movies in existence. Samantha Eggar as one of Stamp's specimens is used more as a catalyst for driving the plot and less as a character for whom we have any great deal of interest. Is that a flaw of the material or the intention of Wyler and novelist John Fowles on whose book this is based? If their intention was to make us sympathize with and even relate to the character with the obsession they succeed brilliantly.The ending genuinely surprised me which happens all too infrequently in movies like this.

It is an almost Hitchcockian film in that tension and suggestion are used to maximum effect keeping the viewer on the edge of their chair. This is a film that I'd love to see remade or rediscovered but again like Hitchcock's best it owes a great deal of its impact to the time in which it was made and would likely suffer at the hands of a lesser director than Wyler. Fowles work is captured like Miranda and viewed with microscopic clarity through Freddy's watchful eye.

Terence Stamp is downright creepy always trying to fit his obsessive requirements to the object of his desire. His mannerisms and slouch make his character completely believable.

He keeps her locked in his basement. Definitely not for children but this movie is a must for horror fans.  I recommend it highly.".

	schema:headline " A brilliant harrowing and realistic portrait of insanity!";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on John Fowles' influential novel of the same title The Collector is a dark and pioneering film that presents us with a character unlike most other cinematic psychopaths and a situation ripe with gripping tension. Helmed by experienced director William Wyler  man who turned his hand to and was mostly successful with a number of genres throughout his illustrious career The Collector is an exercise in classy high quality horror and is an obvious front runner to films like The Silence of the Lambs. Incidentally The Collector probably stands up better today than it did upon its release over forty years ago. The story focuses on Freddie Clegg a wealthy but lonely man who lives in solitude in an old Tudor style mansion out in the country. His hobby is collecting and mounting butterflies and one day he decides to apply what he knows about his hobby to the world of romance and proceeds to deck out his basement so that a human can live there and then goes and captures himself a 'girlfriend'. The unlucky lady is Miranda Grey a woman who isn't too happy to oblige the collector's strange purpose for kidnapping her.The book that this film was based on not only went on to influence other works of fiction but also apparently became an influence for real life serial killers. The Collector's influence has allegedly inspired at least five actual serial killers and if that isn't a harrowing fact about this story I don't know what is! The story itself never delves into the realms of impossibility and manages to stay realistic throughout which lends the film an effective edge. The main focus is always on the relationship between the collector and his captive and director William Wyler is keen to keep this at the forefront of the film. The conversations they have and the actions between the two represents compulsive viewing and that is definitely where the true greatness of this film shines through the scene involving the Catcher in the Eye and Picasso is this film at it's best. The style of the movie is very British and this is complimented by the central performers. Terence Stamp is wonderfully understated but still impressively insane while Samantha Eggar makes a mark as the unfortunate victim. Overall I guess that the reason why this film isn't too well respected today is down to the fact that it was so ahead of it's time. However if you want a thriller that offers some brilliant suspense and a realistic story  The Collector is a must see!".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this excellent blast from the past on television about three years ago and couldn't turn away from it. I was immediately enamored of Terence Stamp a very underrated actor in this very riveting performance. Freddie Clegg's obsession with the lovely quintessential 60s young lady Miranda Grey the unforgettable Samantha Eggar is one of those things that at the time may have seemed quite radical and it is obvious that both John Sayles' novel and William Wyler's film were both way ahead of the time. The violence is understated and the psychology of both the main characters subtle yet the viewer has no trouble comprehending their thoughts feelings and actions. Stamp excels in this portrayal of a withdrawn lonely young man who has an empty life with only his collection of butterflies to stimulate him. Eggar as the object of his obsession represents to him and innocent wholesome ideal someone he feels will understand him accept him and he hopes love him. After he meticulously stalks her plans her abduction and locks her in the cellar of his newly purchased country home both individuals have to come to terms with the result of his actions causing conflict an unlikely relationship and ultimately dangerous consequences. Miranda does try to understand Freddie even attempts to compromise with him but only manages to infuriate her captor and fuel his feelings of being a misfit of society. As she becomes more and more desperate to escape his anger and controlling behavior only intensifies. As a last resort she attempts to seduce him but he is obviously very sexually repressed and hey so are many of the stalkers out there today! and is temporarily tempted but becomes disgusted basically saying You're just like all the rest! After she injures him with a shovel and he leaves her locked in the cellar as he seeks medical treatment Miranda is left in a lifethreatening situation and with no escape in sight succumbs to pneumonia not long after Freddie's return. His mixed feelings of grief and blaming Miranda for her own fate shows a hint of the mental disorders that many offenders of this kind suffer from. It is also obvious that he has learned nothing from this experience and as the film concludes he is out stalking another victim.I found this film disturbing but thrilling and it's a treat to see such gifted actors bring this story to life. If you liked this movie see That Cold Day In The Park 1968 starring the late Sandy Dennis and Kiss The Girls starring Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd.I highly recommend this mod masterpiece! Don't miss it!".

Having been chosen he assumed as had most others that Julie Christie  regarded at that time as the best young actress of the era  would be given the role of Miranda but Wyler chose Eggar because he thought it would introduce the correct air of sexual tension and awkwardness between the two protagonists. Wyler also knew Eggar had turned Stamp down when they both were studying together at Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art.I think this casting is both devious and brilliant. I don't think of Wyler as one of those directors but maybe I should. Casting a woman to make Stamp uncomfortable and then torturing Eggar on the set... he may be much more of the meanspirited and exacting type than he comes across from his earlier films.Allegedly the original cut ran over an hour longer. Most of the time I don't really want movies to be longer than 90 minutes to two hours. But this is a film I could use more of.

The plot has become predictable after 40 years of so many films about psychopath serial killers and the screenplay is underdeveloped in terms of potential conflicts and twists. The music here is crucial due to the little amount of dialogue and the building of a growingly desperate atmosphere and Maurice Jarre's music simply lacks inventiveness and thrilling power it's just ineffective  the film asked for a score in the line of Bernard Herrmann to fill up the action. The cinematography of masters Krasker and Surtees is luxurious instead of stifling. The clash between Stamp's and Eggar's acting styles doesn't help their characters Stamp goes Method while Eggar stays realistic though they both look extremely attractive in their mid20s. All that said this movie will be a nice choice for a rainy evening although one has through the years been given the right to expect more from champ Wyler. My vote 6 out of 10.".

The premise of the film is intriguing and by the plot outline I could tell this wasn't going to be a film that would just aim for thrills and suspense. Of course I wouldn't have expected William Wyler to go in that direction either even if this looked to be more eerie than anything he had done before.'The collector' was no disappointment in fact it had the impact of a... shovel. The abduction takes place almost straight away and the rest of the film we observe a young man and a young woman both fighting in various manners for what they believe in and hope for. Pretty much all of this unfolds in an almost otherworldly house and cellar Gabriels Manor Edenbridge UK far from the hurly burly of London from where the girl was kidnapped.The script may seem to take its time but not one moment felt too much or out of place playing on various themes such as trust alienation sadism coming of age love and paranoia and manages to be utterly disturbing in such a subtle way. It consists of several long acts that eventually seem to take the two back to the beginning but every time it is or has to be a nw beginning. Until... the ending may not be for everyone though I think it was exactly what it needed  which is not to I say I saw it coming! Darkly humorous...? Or rather mindnumbingly sad...?The performances of Terrence Stamp and Samantha Eggar are of course key here and they delivered two characters who pulled me deep into this two hour story and made it feel like it was just a half hour or so.A very big 9 out of 10 for now but I might change my mind... sooner or later. On the market right now for almost 2 million pounds with no particular mention of the age old cellar though... outbuildings".

He just wants to be seen and heard and cared about for who he is despite his shortcomings. On the other hand it is about a twisted sick manipulative selfcentered person who uses force and coercion to try and get what he wants. The dynamics of these two opposing aspects of the protagonist's character make you alternately empathize with his lonely plight and then recoil in horror at his cold stony interior. Terence Stamp who I have known from his later roles as a villain does an admirable job as the sociopathic young man going from vulnerable and frail to keen and clever to hurtfully honest. Definitely a must see movie that will make you think and provide for some interesting after movie analysis.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Collector 1965 directed by William Wyler and based on the John Fowles' novel is a very impressive chilling and disturbing film that tells the story of a shy London bank employee Freddie Clegg Terence Stamp in a performance that won him Best Actor Award at Cannes Film Festival an avid butterfly collector who became obsessed by a young beautiful Art Student Miranda Samantha Eggar also Cannes Film Festival winner and Academy Award nominee and decided to kidnap her and keep her as a part of his collection in the basement of his secluded house in the country side. What makes the movie truly memorable  is the fact that Freddy is not a predictable villain and the girl is not always sympathetic. The Collector is more than just a thriller in the way it shows the relationship between a prisoner and her jailer. All Freddie wants from Miranda is to get to know him and to love him and he is happy to fulfill her every desire only denying returning her freedom. The most memorable scene in the movie is the dialog between Miranda and Freddy after he had read Miranda's favorite book Catcher in the Rye and they discuss it and the discussion turns into a very heated argument about the social and cultural differences between two completely different worlds they belong and why Freddie's of this world would hardly have a chance with girls like Miranda.Not widely known the film is a real treasure and I highly recommend it. My only problem is the musical score by Maurice Jarre  it simply does not work very well in this movie and that surprised me knowing how effective Jarre's score was in Les Yeux sans visage 1960 aka Eyes Without Face.I was so impressed with the movie that I checked out Fowles' novel it was his first published book from the public library and I will read it in the next few days".

The sport is constantly changed to stop him yet he continues to overcome every obstacle.John Housman is electrifying as the head of the Energy Corporation owners of the Houston Team.  He has conspired with his peers to keep the masses down and use this sport to both distract them and show them that the individual can't succeed.  He grows more desperate as Johnathan E defeats his schemes.  He tries every trick without success.The supporting cast is filled with great actors like Moses Gunn John Beck Sir Ralph Richardson not John Gielgud as one reviewer stated Maude Adams and Shane Rimmer.The film demonstrates that the individual can triumph over insurmountable odds and cautions against corporate control of society.  It uses both allegory and speculation beautifully and packages it with thrilling action. The remake was destined for failure because it couldn't see beyond the action.  The action was only window dressing for the greater themes.  If only more recent scifi films were this thoughtprovoking or other films for that matter.".

Norman Jewison created a masterpiece with Rollerball  understated misunderstood and undervalued both at the time of its release and later. Perhaps ultimately to its its greatest benefit  the release of the plebeian 2002 remake which will stand for all time as the most nauseatingly insulting and tastelessly gratuitous reminder to recall the original with perhaps more relish than might otherwise have been the case. No purpose in rehashing the plot  anyone reading this will already know it. Suffice to say James Caan's Jonathan E stood for that most basic of human principles  the rights of the individual! As John Houseman the corrupt and ubiquitous head of the allpowerful Corporation that owns and operates ROLLERBALL inc worldwide tells Jonathan at one point Rollerball was meant to demonstrate the futility of resistance no man was ever intended to become bigger than the game. This was a society set in 2018 with media censorship in place to such a degree a centralised computer stores the worlds' entire literary knowledge physical books being a thing of the past as in FAHRENHEIT 451. Marvellous interspliced sequence with Sir Michael Redgrave as keeper of the world's centralized computer to which Jonathan is drawn seeking answers to questions he was never supposed to ask. You have to really watch and LISTEN to ROLLERBALL to EXTRICATE from it what the makers are offering you in terms of reflective contemplation. So many saw the film's middle section as boring! So is looking at the sky if you have no knowledge of cloud formation atmospheric beauty or even indeed WHY there IS a sky and what it means in the grand scale of things! Caan's gradual self discovery as to his own identity and purpose is handcrafted for you during these middle scenes  THIS is what the film is about..not merely the superb action sequences which are so richly photographed and presented in that gladiatorial arena a colosseum for the new millennium no more no less! The highlight of the film if you are able to see it is the party for Jonathan E supposedly to mark his resignation but which in fact might be seen as the Energy Corporation's Last Supper! The scenes of the amphetaminefed yuppies destroying the trees with the flamegun has always made me cry not because I'm a wimp a greenie or even an anti lobbyist for hand guns but because of what those terrible scenes stand for and bring to my own emotional recognition...a directionless society that we are right now so unerringly headed for. Look at the expression on the face of Jonathan's exwife as she comes to realise where its all gone wrong  not just for herself but for them all. Now tell me this is boring!!!! As has been recognised by some fellow critics the absolute last scenes of the movie are perhaps the greatest. The point being less subtly made as we see Houseman staring through the glass at Jonathan E the last man standing his corporate outline encircled by the reflected flames on the track  hello? does anyone understand this? One of the greats! Watch this film...don't just see it!".

The view of the future is not highly original tipping its hat to the stratified societies foreseen by Orwell and Huxley amongst others but nevertheless the portrayal is engaging. Jewison astutely realised that only by filling in the image of the future society the characters and the political background against which the tournament unfolds would the game be seen as truly REAL for the characters. In the meanwhile he also has the chance to build suspense upping the stakes for both the heroic gladiatorcombateur Jonathon and his wouldbe puppet master Bartholemew. In this way when we come to watch the actual contests our enthusiasm is whetted and by making the rules progressively more dangerous with each passing game the stakes grow ever higher.The central themes of the movie are i lossofsoulnihilismsensualvsspiritualhappiness and ii individuality vs state control. Perhaps the best scenes elucidating these themes are the famous tree killing' scene and the conversation between Jonathon and Ella in the forest. The use of imagery and metaphor is widespread I will mention only the terrific concept of the roulette wheel as game arena with the players INSIDE instead of outside and the Circus Maximus parallel. You may draw many interesting conclusions from this about the director's and writer's intent.My final word is watch it once soak up the action and be bored by the rest. Then view it again feel yourself in Jonathon's dilemma experience his wrenching disappointment with the people in his life who betray him and try to tear yourself away if you can as he is pushed inexorably to his fate in the arena of ROLLERBALL.".

	schema:headline " Controlling the beast within";
	schema:reviewBody "Why some people have called this film shallow I will never understand considering it focuses on character more than most all scifi films especially those action ones made today. Not surprisingly the recent remake dwelt more on action than character and perhaps it's significant that director Norman Jewison normally avoids making sciencefiction films. Also I personally don't interpret ROLLERBALL as an antisport drama. It doesn't attack sports per se as much as violence. In his audio commentary to the DVD Jewison like many Canadians admits he's a hockey fan and once while witnessing a game get bloodily out of hand he was inspired to adapt Harrison's marvelous short story. All in all I think of the movie as a plea for all of us to find our own basic humanity and those who say the film lacks humanity really baffle me. In our present competitive world where the U.S. speed limit is 65 MPH but everyone drives 75 or faster this motion picture reminds us to control the anarchistic powerdriven beast within. To offer one example in its final scene Jonathan E is about to murder the last opposing team player...but relents. If the film were truly antisportthen I think Jonathan would drop the ball and leave he would mock the game as Mandy Patinkin's character does hockey at the end of SLAPSHOT. Instead Jonathan E still plays it he baskets the ball to earn his point because though he may have touched his humanity he still retains the drive to win and the thrill of the game. Unlike otheroften more sentimental and simplemindedantisports dramas ROLLERBALL represents the positive aspects of sports such as ethical aspiration etc. while at the same time its negative aspects such as triumphalist violence etc.. Afterwards as the crowd roars the film might have concluded with a standard comforting triumphofthehumanspirit message but instead it freezes on a deliberately distorted shot of Jonathan with Bach's portentious music indicating what awaits. Yes he may be a winner today but in this world where the corporation is everything and the individual nothing his future is dim indeed. A shallow film? Nonsense! I think this movie taps into ones humanity more than most of the sentimental tripe hyped as significant drama these days.".

	schema:headline " An Action Classic With Brains!";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie on HBO at the age of 14 and I sensed immediately that it was a classic a combination of action sports sex and social commentary. All the years of viewing other films have only made me more and more appreciative of this movie's many strengths.On one level I believe this is the best sports movie ever made. It is miles ahead of more realistic films like NORTH DALLAS FORTY or SEMI TOUGH or even critical favorites like COBB and EIGHT MEN OUT. The very fact that Rollerball is a make believe sport adds believability to the action sequences. Watch a baseball film and you can see at a glance that Robert Redford or Kevin Costner are not real athletes. But since rollerball has never been played James Caan as Jonathan E really looks like the best in the game. There are no clichs like home runs or long passes to spoil the danger and excitement  every crash and goal is new never having been seen before. And there are no clichs about the fans the athletes or win one for the Gipper or gamblers or shady ladies trying to make Our Hero throw the game. From the beginning we sense the stakes are higher  Jonathan E will either conform or die.That brings up the fact that ROLLERBALL also shares a central theme with a lot of other powerful movies like FROM HERE TO ETERNITY COOL HAND Luke and even A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS. What happens when a uniquely gifted individual refuses to participate in a corrupt system? This movie is so powerful as a drama you hardly notice the sci fi trappings. The rugged action scenes are so real you hardly notice that rollerball is a make believe game.James Caan as Jonathan E turns in a sensitive nuanced performance deliberately underplaying the tough guy side as much as possible. Michael Beck as Moonpie is the foolishly overconfident one playing Frank Sinatra's Maggio to Caan's Robert E. Lee Pruitt. But unlike the hard luck privates in this man's army these rollerball stars get to have glamor luxury and unlimited sex between vicious games of rollerball. The movie captures so much sensuality and glamor that you can see why men risk death game after game to be known as great rollerballers who bash in faces. This movie is spectacular  an action classic with brains!".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw this movie on HBO at the age of 14 and I sensed immediately that it was a classic a combination of action sports sex and social commentary. All the years of viewing other films have only made me more and more appreciative of this movie's many strengths.On one level I believe this is the best sports movie ever made. It is miles ahead of more realistic films like NORTH DALLAS FORTY or SEMI TOUGH or even critical favorites like COBB and EIGHT MEN OUT. The very fact that Rollerball is a make believe sport adds believability to the action sequences. Watch a baseball film and you can see at a glance that Robert Redford or Kevin Costner are not real athletes. But since rollerball has never been played James Caan as Jonathan E really looks like the best in the game. There are no clichs like home runs or long passes to spoil the danger and excitement  every crash and goal is new never having been seen before. And there are no clichs about the fans the athletes or win one for the Gipper or gamblers or shady ladies trying to make Our Hero throw the game. From the beginning we sense the stakes are higher  Jonathan E will either conform or die.That brings up the fact that ROLLERBALL also shares a central theme with a lot of other powerful movies like FROM HERE TO ETERNITY COOL HAND Luke and even A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS. What happens when a uniquely gifted individual refuses to participate in a corrupt system? This movie is so powerful as a drama you hardly notice the sci fi trappings. The rugged action scenes are so real you hardly notice that rollerball is a make believe game.James Caan as Jonathan E turns in a sensitive nuanced performance deliberately underplaying the tough guy side as much as possible. Michael Beck as Moonpie is the foolishly overconfident one playing Frank Sinatra's Maggio to Caan's Robert E. Lee Pruitt. But unlike the hard luck privates in this man's army these rollerball stars get to have glamor luxury and unlimited sex between vicious games of rollerball. The movie captures so much sensuality and glamor that you can see why men risk death game after game to be known as great rollerballers who bash in faces. This movie is spectacular  an action classic with brains!";

	schema:reviewBody "At first glance you'd never guess the same director who did the wonderfully charming Fiddler on the Roof would turn around 2 years later and do the dark dystopian chiller Rollerball. But he did.But in both films we see the same powerful strategy a complex philosophical braintwister beneath a deceptivly simple exterior. Fiddler on the Roof was seemingly a linear story about a struggling Jewish family's good  bad times. But the real meat of the story was about the conflict between old ways and new tradition vs. progress. Here in Rollerball we have another seemingly linear story about an athlete in a violent futuristic sport. But the real meat is the conflict of brutal human nature vs. suppression again a sort of tradition vs. progress. As with Fiddler on the Roof director Norm Jewison doesn't hit us over the head with any preachy sermon but instead leaves us to digest the situation.Rollerball has the same powerful brooding quality that we see in many of the 70s scifi masterpieces like THX 1138 Soylent Green Planet of the Apes Blade Runner yeah I know that one was 1982 and the one that started them all 2001 A Space Odyssey. Cold sterile sets disturbing situations and powerful use of silence characterize these films. By today's standards they might be considered slow but depending on how you like your scifi that might be right up your alley.In a nutshell the story is about a futuristic society that has largely done away with civilian violence. It has done this by subsidizing violence by way of a global pasttime a hyperviolent sport called Rollerball. Note as a parallel story we learn that cutthroat corporate competition has been similarly squelched by the government creating monopolies. And thus society finds peace. Or does it? You can probably see the brilliant metaphors being woven here. This isn't an ordinary scifi romp it's a powerful sociopolitical allegory. It cuts to the heart of human nature the way the great writers H.G. Welles Mary Shelley and George Orwell did. No you won't see a lot of laser battles spaceships and aliens. But here you'll see an excellent example of what scifi was designed to do comment on our current human condition by creating a fictional extreme scenario as a cautionary tale.Excellent and I mean EXCELLENT performances by James Caan The Godfather Misery John Houseman The Paper Chase The Fog Maud Adams 3 James Bond films Moses Gunn every 70s TV show from Hawaii 5O to Shaft and a particularly gripping performance by Pamela Hensley Princess Ardala in Buck Rogers homina homina make this an allstar powerhouse of 70s talent.The music deserves a special mention of its own. From the opening notes of Bach's Toccata in Dm the creepy Dracula theme to Albinoni's haunting Adagio in Gm check it out on YouTube... saddest song ever Rollerball doesn't hold back.They don't make 'em like this anymore. But there are a few modern scifi films that come close Moon District 9 and Solaris come to mind.If you liked the films I mentioned in this review if you liked the 70s classics Catch22 and Coma and Stepford Wives if you like films that are both entertaining and works of art do NOT miss Rollerball.For laughs after you watch Rollerball 1976 check out the remake done in 2002 ...and see how far we've come ".

	schema:headline " Dated Look But TopNotch Filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "Rollerball is one of those classics of scifi that I somehow managed to miss for all of my 30 years. Whilst browsing the local store I found the DVD for ten dollars and figured I had nothing to lose  to rent it if I could even find it on DVD wouldn't cost THAT much less.I had some vague notion of the storyline but I tried not to read the case or liner notes and take in the movie on a first impression. Released in the summer of 1975 there are definite and readily apparent influences of earlier films not the least of which being Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. The colors the film stock the editing style are all reminiscent of that earlier similarlythemed master work yet I don't believe it detracted from this film at all.Supposedly set in the year 2018 though this is never established in the movie that I could tell corporations have replaced governments and managed to eliminate war poverty disease and bad hair days. People don't have too much of a say in what goes on around them but they're all very physically comfortable. Of course the violent nature of the human beast must be satisfied and it is  in the gladitorial ring of the world's most popular sport Rollerball. The game consists of two teams from cities all over the world skating and motorbiking around a 18mile track trying to get a steel ball into a goal. As the course of the season progresses more and more limitations as to what constitutes fair play are removed and by the final the melee is total.James Caan plays the Michael Jordan Wayne Gretzky and Joe Montana of Rollerball Jonathan E.. He's the biggest star in the world but he's also a thinking man and when the corporation which owns his team wants him to retire he refuses wanting to know first why they'd want him to retire when he's playing at his best.The rest I leave to the viewer to find out. I can only say it is a very wellcrafted script with plenty to say about violence the spirit of the individual man and the bloodlusts that a happy and idle populace can muster. Very wellfilmed with touches of brilliance in editing and framing.A detraction which really couldn't be helped involves the portrayal of the future. Director Norman Jewison couldn't know what the world of forty years in his future would be like so he took the wise route of not making it all that different from 1975 but with subtle changes such as the interesting but impractical multivision concept in which all TV sets have a large screen and three smaller screens above it each showing different but related pictures. The result though infinitely preferable to lots of neon and superfluous antennae is that the place looks like 1975 with slightly cooler gadgets. I can't tell you what 2018 will look like but it won't look like that.Interestingly the corporate inevitability concept of the future which I believe Jewison meant earnestly plays out much more as a satire of the opposite a communist world. Much of what the coroprate culture says as personified by John Houseman's Mr. Bartholomew sounds much like the rhetoric of communism  people are fed and comfortable and happy but the individual is beholden to the group at all costs. Indeed some of the words of description of the culture seem lifted straight from Marx and Engels.The DVD leaves something to be desired though. The picture is a lot dirtier than I'd like especially in stillshot scenes. The color is muted though this may be part style and some shots seem positively muddy.The remastered 5.1 soundtrack is a disappointment. The rear speakers get very little play. One particular effect of note I must concede is one moment when you can hear the ball roll all the way around the arena and it's as though you're standing in the center.In all it's an excellent movie which I can't recommend enough but if the disc had been any pricier than it was I would have felt as though I was somewhat taken. Perhaps after the release of the upcoming remake there will be a better special edition.".

	schema:reviewBody "This much neglected futuristic film from the 70's deserves a second look. Like A Clockwork Orange the amoral violent future Rollerball showcases is in reality a projection of the amoral violent present at the time of its creation. The movie lampoons the dress fashion and look of the 70's decade spoofs the Texas cowboy ethos of the period and takes jibes at the deification of athletics in particular football which dominates American culture and to some extent world culture. Comparisons can be made between Rollerball mores and the mores of the hedonistic Romans where humans were gnawed to death by hungry animals in the arenas and gladiators fought to their deaths in the Colosseum as crazed spectators cheered and slobbered as they ate their daily bread. Rollerball even foreshadowed the political correctness of the 1990's with the generic Bachlike Corporate Anthem played before each game.When the film was produced roller derbies were hot items on TV and attended by large gatherings of bloodthirsty fans who egged on the pugilistic elements participating. Jim Croce even had a hit record parodying the game Roller Derby Queen. Add bikes spikestudded gloves the roller ball change a few rules and there's Rollerball.One of the more interesting elements of Rollerball is how it differs from the futuristic societies depicted in the two classics 1984 and Brave New World. Rather than Big Brother watching you an anonymous board of directors who run a corporate global conglomeration rule the world. No one apparently not even their spokesperson who is also the manager of the Rollerball team Bartholomew John Houseman even knows who the directors are. The vote is taken via closed circuit TV. A somalike substance is taken to induce dreams and visions but is used sparingly unlike in Brave New World. And instead of book burning utilized by traditional totalitarian governments books are hidden away. The only way to read one is to view a summarized and sanitized version  la Reader's Digest on a computer.Acting honors go to the consummate Thespian John Houseman as the corporate spokesperson. His facial expressions alone convey what few actors can communicate with all their skills. James Caan as superstar of Rollerball Jonathan E. gives one of his best performances on the big screen. John Beck incarnates a Houston redneck appropriately named Moonpie with all his pride and prejudices. The weakest part of Rollerball is the lame attempt at romance in a nondescript relationship involving husbands and lovers. Therefore the women roles are ill defined and not well written. The only important part for a woman in Rollerball is when a pistol is used to set trees ablaze making the depletion of the rain forests seem like child's play.The story concerns Rollerball idol of millions Jonathan E. who for some unknown reason the corporate ladder orders to retire at the height of his career. The big game between Jonathan's Houston and Tokyo is coming up to determine the world championship. The global conglomerate suspends the penalty rule and limits the substitutions making it a fight to the finish. Disobeying the command to leave the game Jonathan E. puts total effort into winning even causing a small riot of the Japanese fans. Will Jonathan survive his assault on city hall the Conglomeration or will he die in the quest?The dazzling camera work by Douglas Slocombe with emphasis on icy white interiors and cold shades of white exterior structures delivers the images director Norman Jewison intended. The angles and movements during the games as well as the closeup shots enhance the viewers enjoyment of the action scenes.Oh and Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor is as mesmerizing as ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rollerball is an intriguing film that makes excellent use of symbolism dialogue aesthetics and decent allround performances to convey a chilling message yet a message which ends on a high note and not a depressing one.In the future there are no wars and no crimes. The whole world is ruled by a multitude of faceless Corporations which all seem to be part of an even larger whole and apparently exists in a state of utopia  almost everyone lives in luxury without poverty disease or famine.There is a dark side to society however  both the violent tendencies and thirst for entertainment of the populace are subjugated by a violent blood sport known as Rollerball. The game takes place in a large domed stadium around a banked circular track. The players all wear skates and various items of protective clothing none of which are truly adequate for keeping them safe. Some players on each team are allowed to ride motorcycles futuristic looking mopeds which of course is extremely dangerous.Added to the mix is the heavy metal ball which is fired at high velocity from a gun at the beginning of play and nasty spiked gauntlets. This all adds up to a recipe for destruction.Indeed the game is designed to kill the players with the rosters for each team constantly changing  the game is designed by the Corporations not only to keep the masses entertained but also to make them realise that individual effort and thought is futile and so keep them suppressed.Jonathan E played convincingly and with feeling by James Caan essentially breaks the purpose of the sport by living through a ten year long career apparently the longest ever and becoming a superstar whose name everyone chants. He is loved by the people and is a shining example of the individual's triumph over the system.This obviously makes him a thorn in the Corporation's side and so they attempt to get him to retire. When he refuses they use everything in their power to force him to do so.The film has a surprising number of themes and symbols for its at first simple appearance  and has many moments that are sad and thought provoking.One of my favourites is the scene in which a group of druggedup revellers use a futuristic weapon to destroy large aged trees for no reason at all other than for a quick jolt of mindless entertainment.Somehow the scene which could have been boring or confusing manages to be a grotesque and almost horrific symbol of the excess of such a society.The 1975 imagining of the future also manages to avoid feeling dated. Even the old grey panelled computer banks are believable  many supercomputers today look very similar still.The action sequences feel believable and brutal in a way I enjoy them far more than the CGIinfested stuff in almost all films these days.My one criticism of the film is that occasionally the themes of the film are unnecessarily laboured and some scenes are a little slow as a result. This clumsiness takes a little impact out of the punch of what would otherwise be a fantastic film but ultimately the depth is there more when it isn't being obviously stressed.People over than Jonathan and his teammates are also almost universally cold and unlikable but there is a deliberate point to their characterisation.Finally there is the ending. I won't spoil it here but it is a masterpiece of tension and ends the film on a real feeling of hope. Even though we don't see it we get the impression that Jonathan may be the one individual that spurs the rest of the world into action. I highly recommend the film to anyone who fancies a film that is both viscerally exciting and yet has room to toy with deeper and darker themes.".

Even though we don't see it we get the impression that Jonathan may be the one individual that spurs the rest of the world into action. I highly recommend the film to anyone who fancies a film that is both viscerally exciting and yet has room to toy with deeper and darker themes.";

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Rollerball today provides an interesting perspective if you've been around say since the 1950's or so.

When this picture came out in the midSeventies I would never have given a thought to the threat of globalization by a handful of dominant world bodies like the U.N. or corporate entities like RCI Energy the company depicted here sponsoring the Houston rollerball team. But here we are and the threat of statism and global governance has never been more palpable.At the core of the story is Jonathan E's James Caan fierce determination to find out why he's being forced out of his starring role with the Houston team. As his team owner Bartholomew John Houseman makes clear the elites at the top make global decisions for the greater good. That greater good requires allegiance to an authority that keeps the masses subjugated by means of a classless society whose attention is diverted by a game in which the rules constantly change. Jonathan E poses a threat to a society in which individual effort must be extinguished and never rewarded. It sounds a lot like liberals versus conservatives to me.Rod Serling took up this theme in a number of his Twilight Zone episodes and those were done in the late Fiftiesearly Sixties. I'm thinking of a couple of stories that tread on similar ground  'The Obsolete Man' and 'Eye of the Beholder'. The whole idea of conformity and group think is one that just drives me crazy and yet we see it every day with stuff like reality TV which isn't and the growing chasm between the major political parties. The film that really makes the point came out a little over a decade later and if you want a real good two and a half decade sneak preview of where we are today check out 1987's The Running Man.One quick observation before I close with this film. In the opening minutes of the picture the scoreboard for the first rollerball match is shown being set up for the game between Houston and Madrid.

Director Jewison tries hard to make the game scenes spontaneous via the use of editing and sound mix and probably tries a bit too hard to make it appear spontaneous but the action scenes are exciting and it's this that makes the film a success .

	schema:headline " Far superior to any future sports film that has been made since...";
	schema:reviewBody "...and that includes its own remake. Rollerball circa 1975 chooses a much more logical starting point to begin with. The game has been in existence for a good decade or three enough so that a firm sense of its purpose in society can be created. It is here that the writers of the 2002 remake so utterly failed  they didn't realise that the game itself only existed to move the greater plot along.In this unspecified point of the future nations no longer exist. In their place are corporations that control every aspect of human society. The upside to this is that citizens have everything they need to live  food energy a place to work and so forth. The downside is that they are not allowed to seek any knowledge the corporations don't want them to have and they must accomodate every whim of the corporation's executives or risk serious consequences. Rollerball star Jonathan E as played by James Caan knows this all too well  his wife was taken from him by one of the corporation's executives.The game known as Rollerball fits in as a sort of enforcement of these rules. As Jonathan is told several times the corporation masters created the game in order to demonstrate that individual effort is futile. They also make it pretty clear that above all else no one player can become bigger than the spectacle of the game. But because these same corporate heads have given Jonathan too many reasons to not believe in them anymore he is determined to defy them regardless of the cost. He is told by the head of his team to retire or suffer the oldfashioned way. One of his star pupils gets it in the neck and yet he still persists until the grand final where almost all the rules are discarded.Unlike the 2002 production where one announcer contradicts himself in the description of the rules within three minutes the 1975 production had a clearly defined set of rules that became selfexplanatory as the game went on. So much so that the players could play the game minus the wellstaged attempts to kill one another of course in between takes. The difference this makes is obvious in every single frame. The simulated matches make sense the tactics that each team use are very distinct and they make sense and Jonathan E's story makes sense.You might wish to skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the film. Go get the DVD and watch it it is well worth it. The ending is another major point where the 1975 original shows its superiority to the 2002 remake. After all the fuss about the game being created to show individual effort as futile and how no one man is allowed to become bigger than the game Jonathan does just that. After a match in which the corporate masters do everything shy of giving Jonathan's opponents chainsaws in order to ensure he will not survive the game he not only survives but he refuses to descend to the level of the game by killing the last opponent despite the fact that this is the same belligerent idiot who was rejected from Jonathan's team for not being able to follow his instructions. Unlike the remake that had to end in a typical action film style the original ends with Jonathan putting the ball in the goal and doing his victory laps as the audience chants his name signifying that not only has he become bigger than the game but that the audience has regained their humanity as a result. A truly satisfying conclusion and not a single Hollywood clich in sight.I also like the manner in which Jonathan's thirst for knowledge is suppressed by his corporate masters. Instead of simply denying him the reading materials he seeks he goes to the one big computer that stores all the knowledge and records and asks it who makes the decisions in society. Said computer throws a hissy fit and it soon becomes clear that nobody knows who is truly in control of this society except they themselves. The party at which Jonathan is supposed to announce his retirement on a previously recorded television show is a good example of this. The guests wander off into the forests shooting down trees with what looks like a really powerful flare gun and the night rolls on with everyone drunk on their belief that there are no consequences or that they don't have to face them.The sad thing about Rollerball is the same sad thing about the real Black Sabbath's music  that it has grown more relevant to our society as time has gone on.

	onyx:emotionText "...and that includes its own remake. Rollerball circa 1975 chooses a much more logical starting point to begin with. The game has been in existence for a good decade or three enough so that a firm sense of its purpose in society can be created. It is here that the writers of the 2002 remake so utterly failed  they didn't realise that the game itself only existed to move the greater plot along.In this unspecified point of the future nations no longer exist. In their place are corporations that control every aspect of human society. The upside to this is that citizens have everything they need to live  food energy a place to work and so forth. The downside is that they are not allowed to seek any knowledge the corporations don't want them to have and they must accomodate every whim of the corporation's executives or risk serious consequences. Rollerball star Jonathan E as played by James Caan knows this all too well  his wife was taken from him by one of the corporation's executives.The game known as Rollerball fits in as a sort of enforcement of these rules. As Jonathan is told several times the corporation masters created the game in order to demonstrate that individual effort is futile. They also make it pretty clear that above all else no one player can become bigger than the spectacle of the game. But because these same corporate heads have given Jonathan too many reasons to not believe in them anymore he is determined to defy them regardless of the cost. He is told by the head of his team to retire or suffer the oldfashioned way. One of his star pupils gets it in the neck and yet he still persists until the grand final where almost all the rules are discarded.Unlike the 2002 production where one announcer contradicts himself in the description of the rules within three minutes the 1975 production had a clearly defined set of rules that became selfexplanatory as the game went on. So much so that the players could play the game minus the wellstaged attempts to kill one another of course in between takes. The difference this makes is obvious in every single frame. The simulated matches make sense the tactics that each team use are very distinct and they make sense and Jonathan E's story makes sense.You might wish to skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the film. Go get the DVD and watch it it is well worth it. The ending is another major point where the 1975 original shows its superiority to the 2002 remake. After all the fuss about the game being created to show individual effort as futile and how no one man is allowed to become bigger than the game Jonathan does just that. After a match in which the corporate masters do everything shy of giving Jonathan's opponents chainsaws in order to ensure he will not survive the game he not only survives but he refuses to descend to the level of the game by killing the last opponent despite the fact that this is the same belligerent idiot who was rejected from Jonathan's team for not being able to follow his instructions. Unlike the remake that had to end in a typical action film style the original ends with Jonathan putting the ball in the goal and doing his victory laps as the audience chants his name signifying that not only has he become bigger than the game but that the audience has regained their humanity as a result. A truly satisfying conclusion and not a single Hollywood clich in sight.I also like the manner in which Jonathan's thirst for knowledge is suppressed by his corporate masters. Instead of simply denying him the reading materials he seeks he goes to the one big computer that stores all the knowledge and records and asks it who makes the decisions in society. Said computer throws a hissy fit and it soon becomes clear that nobody knows who is truly in control of this society except they themselves. The party at which Jonathan is supposed to announce his retirement on a previously recorded television show is a good example of this. The guests wander off into the forests shooting down trees with what looks like a really powerful flare gun and the night rolls on with everyone drunk on their belief that there are no consequences or that they don't have to face them.The sad thing about Rollerball is the same sad thing about the real Black Sabbath's music  that it has grown more relevant to our society as time has gone on. We are told to recycle our packaging material so we put it in seperate bins with no idea of what actually happens to it. We are told to filter our water or install taps that restrict the amount of water we use but little or no research is done into the simple chemical process to create synthetic water. All it would take now is a sport or a game show in which the losing contestant is killed and we'll have the beginnings of a Rollerball society.

It was like the people who did the remake had to try and outdo EVERYTHING the original did with disastrous results. Had I not known the rules of the game from this movie the new version would have been even worse.My favorite scene in the entire movie is at the end where he survives everyone and then picks up the ball and stuffs it in the goal. It is totally quiet and you hear a loud CRANG the scoreboard then adds to the goal total and then he starts skating around while the crowd starts chanting  first very lowly and then louder and louder his name. He builds up a huge head of steam as he whips faster and faster around the track and then goes right for Bartholomew.In one of the most brilliant moments in cinema they don't show him actually attacking him  instead they freeze him in midflight as he leaps into the stands and they fade out and then the music starts to Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor by Bach. You undoubtedly have heard this piece on Halloween and they don't credit it so you don't know what organ player they used but it is HAUNTING. You can literally feel the creeping doom as they roll the credits and the music continues until the piece is complete which is over 8 minutes long.It's the touches like this that make this version much better than the remake. The remake reeks of badly done heavy metal and lacks any punch whatsoever and they even changed the ending.I was so taken away by the music I went out and bought a performance of Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor. And for you so called keyboard musicians out there if you can play THAT piece on a real pipe organ and play it properly then I will give you your due. It is the most technically complex organ piece ever written  try 9 simultaneous parts which each finger playing a part plus your foot playing pedals . For writing and performing this piece Bach was nearly permanently exiled from his job of music director at the church and the equivalent today would be every employer blackballing you and not giving you a job. It's amazing given what the church thought of it that it survived.I didn't sleep the rest of the night  that music haunted me until daybreak due to that movie. I thought this movie was far scarier than anything I had ever seen  it totally freaked me out and then add that music to it  they should have left this movie alone.Hopefully you can get a copy of this version as opposed to the new one don't even bother with the new one  it's not even worth the 5 cents it cost to make the disc.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kim Patricia Clarkson George Jake Weber and son Miles Erik Per Sullivan are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from Manhattan's bustling metropolis. On the way they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow. A group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along. Rather than helping at least one of the hunters Otis John Speredakos is mad because the accident cracked the buck's antlers. George Kim and Miles are disturbed by Otis and even worse we quickly learn that Otis has learned where they're staying. Meanwhile Miles is given a wendigo a kind of Indian shapeshifting spiritmonster token by an Indian whom only he has seen. Is Otis a psycho out to get our heroes? Are there wendigos in the woods? I can see where Wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers. It is a fairly low budget film with technical limitations frequently showing through. Much of the film and maybe all of it is not really about the titular creature. And perhaps the fatal blow for many people it has a very ambiguous ending with a number of questions left unanswered. If you are discouraged by such endings and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant do yourself a favor and avoid Wendigo.Personally I like films like that. I usually prefer some ambiguity. The marketing of Wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick scary creature flick where they'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for Wendigo 2 The Monster Returns but that's not what this film is. Wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people. Heck writerdirector Larry Fessenden even has a character George reciting Robert Frost. The Frost poem and George's comment that Frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things is the key to the film.One of the best things about the film is its complexity. In a way there are four different films occurring at the same time a thread from each character. In George's thread he isn't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world and he has some parenting problems. For him the film is a realistic horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse. In Patricia's thread she's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family. She's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her hoping that they'll go away and get better. In Otis' thread he's even more down on his luck than George and George's arrival into his life symbolizes the final crack in his psychological armor. And in Miles' thread which is probably the most important of the film life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world. But this is a horror story after all albeit one with a glimmer of hope and the events in the film give Miles' poetic interpretations a dark turn. Still when everything is said and done he seems to be the only one retaining his composure due to the poetic outlook.Even though the film is low budget there are a lot of wellexecuted higher budget ambitions. Fessenden and director of photography Terry Stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations and created some interesting slide show like montages such as the cards or the Indian wendigo images from the book. There are also interesting more traditional montages such as Miles' nightmare. Wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films.Other technical aspects are good for the budget. The Wendigo appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous. The lighting was usually goodthere were a few times that dark scenes weren't as clear as they could have been but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock it could have been digital instead or transfer. I thought the performances were good and far more realistic if you value that than the majority of films. Although I didn't really notice the score it must have been okay or I would have noticed it with a negative judgment.Overall Wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions as long as you don't mind having to think about the movies you watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "Kim Patricia Clarkson George Jake Weber and son Miles Erik Per Sullivan are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from Manhattan's bustling metropolis. On the way they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow. A group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along. Rather than helping at least one of the hunters Otis John Speredakos is mad because the accident cracked the buck's antlers. George Kim and Miles are disturbed by Otis and even worse we quickly learn that Otis has learned where they're staying. Meanwhile Miles is given a wendigo a kind of Indian shapeshifting spiritmonster token by an Indian whom only he has seen. Is Otis a psycho out to get our heroes? Are there wendigos in the woods? I can see where Wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers. It is a fairly low budget film with technical limitations frequently showing through. Much of the film and maybe all of it is not really about the titular creature. And perhaps the fatal blow for many people it has a very ambiguous ending with a number of questions left unanswered. If you are discouraged by such endings and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant do yourself a favor and avoid Wendigo.Personally I like films like that. I usually prefer some ambiguity. The marketing of Wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick scary creature flick where they'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for Wendigo 2 The Monster Returns but that's not what this film is. Wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people. Heck writerdirector Larry Fessenden even has a character George reciting Robert Frost.

Well the worst mistake evidently is the marketing of the movie and the way the DVD might have been targeted. Obviously this is not a true horror movie at least not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying. Wendigo is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young Miles. Things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend. It is obvious that Kim the mother is a psychologist but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son. This is also a story of alienation. It's clear that the father George is a distant figure perhaps a workaholic who seems to be living in a different world.Miles' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country. That part of New York state with its winter landscape barren trees play havoc on the little boy's imagination. It doesn't help that he encounters a strange figure in town it creates even more doubts in his young mind. Ultimately Miles' world comes crashing down on him and he can't do anything even evoking the Wendigo spirit.The film is well paced and acted. Patricia Clarkson is excellent no matter where movie she is in. Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he doesn't understand. Erik Per Sullivan as Miles conveys the inner turmoil within him. I thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is Miles own take on what's going on around him. Finally John Spredakos is perfect as the menacing Otis a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out.Instead of putting this movie down future viewers should approach it with a open mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore tons of jumpscare moments and unrelenting escalating scenes of excruciating death then look elsewhere. If you like quiet moody thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread then Wendigo is for you.Thoughtful stressed out George his psychoanalyst wife Kim and their young son Miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city. On the way up George hits a stag with his car. The hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that George has ended their chase. In particular deranged hunter Otis takes it personally. He follows the family to their vacation home making sure they see him. He spies on George and Kim as they have sex. He fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren't home letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return. When Kim takes Miles to the drugstore in town Miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag. A Native American man tells Miles that this is the Wendigo a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry. Miles takes the figure home with him already haunted by the death of the deer the day before. That afternoon when he and his father go sledding George is shot and Miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed...or is he just in shock and imagining the whole thing? Hours later George is rushed to the hospital and Miles still clutching his statue either faints dreams or goes on a vision quest in which the Wendigo returns. This time the angry flesh eating god  part tree part stag and part man  is hunting for Otis who has finally gone over the edge.Wendigo is a beautifully made film almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees. Okay so the monster itself is kind of fakeylooking but it's a small flaw more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film and the eerie backdrop of the silent snowy countryside. The performances are great particularly by Jake Weber as the moody and thoughtful George and Patricia Clarkson as his sweet but nononsense wife. They are a happy couple with their share of common problems and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful. Watching this film is often like watching someone's home videos so realistic are the performances. This movie is not for everyone. A lot of people may find themselves totally bored waiting for the hideous Lovecraftian Beast and bloody revenge that never come. We can never really be sure if the Wendigo even exists seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also later through the eyes of a madman. This is more a psychological drama than a horror film but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILERSWendigo falls squarely into the genre of what I like to call The Killer Credits.  That's where you're still waiting for something to happen when all of a sudden BAMthere are the end credits!  They hit you like a tenton runaway truck.  In fact the biggest moment of dread in Wendigo is the moment JUST before the end credits begin.  There is a moment of blackness and the musical cues tell us that something has just come to an end.  In a split second we realize this is it...it's over...the credits are going to start and I'm still waiting for something to happen!  No! STOP!  Don't do this!!  Then the first one slips across the screen and you realize all is lost.This is a real shame because up until the final third of the film Wendigo builds a delicious atmosphere of dread.  I kept waiting for something terrible to happen.  Something does but it's not the something that we've been led to expect.  In another movie this might have been intriguing even welcome.  In this one it just plain sucks.  I am still reeling over this film and trying to place the exact moment where it went wrong.The plot concerns a small family on a weekend getaway to a friend's cottage in the Catskills.  Kim and George are typical fastlane New York parents she's an analyst he's a photographer and their small son Miles is a quiet kid who seems to have attended the same private school as Haley Joel Osment.The family runs afoul of some locals when they hit a deer that runs across the road in front of their car.  The deer is being stalked by three hunters one with the ominous moniker of Otis so we know this is a bad thing.  The hunters especially Otis are angry because the buck's antlers are chipped from the impact therefore devaluing it.  Words are exchanged and once the family gets to the cottage they discover bullet holes in some of the windows.While the family is foraging for groceries in town a mysterious Indian man appears and gives Miles a weird animal statue explaining to him the legend of the Wendigoa vengeful spirit who consumes flesh and is part man part animal part tree...or whatever else happens to be around.To tell more would be to spoil the movie's one big surprise so I won't give away what really happens.  What I will tell you though is that this is the kind of movie where weird scary things happen and they turn out to be hallucinations.  For instance Miles sees a man emerge from his closet and point a gun at him.  No danger...hallucination.  There are noises in the attic and the retractable stairs bow outward ominously as if something up there wants out...hallucination.  Miles has a vision while riding his sled...hallucination.Then before we know what hit us we're in the film's final stages.  A nonsupernatural threat is revealed and the fearsome legend of the Wendigo turns out to be just a couple of vague appearances and the inability to inflict any kind of real harm on a human being.  We do see it and it looks like a giant deer walking on two legs.  It's creepy...at least I thought it was...but that's all.I think the movie's crucial misstep was the ghostly man's description of the Wendigo.  We as the audience have been tricked into thinking the Wendigo is going to cut loose on these people or at least on somebody in the film and it never really happens.  It's a letdown and by the time the events of the ending unfold we're tapping our feet nervously waiting for some Wendigo action.  And then those killer credits come signaling the death of the movie.  It was a nice try but after all the buildup the conclusion of the film feels like a cheat.  But that dramatic pause in the blackness KNOWING those credits were coming but not wanting to accept the fact that the movie was really over?  Terrifying.".

Then the first one slips across the screen and you realize all is lost.This is a real shame because up until the final third of the film Wendigo builds a delicious atmosphere of dread.  I kept waiting for something terrible to happen.  Something does but it's not the something that we've been led to expect.  In another movie this might have been intriguing even welcome.  In this one it just plain sucks.  I am still reeling over this film and trying to place the exact moment where it went wrong.The plot concerns a small family on a weekend getaway to a friend's cottage in the Catskills.  Kim and George are typical fastlane New York parents she's an analyst he's a photographer and their small son Miles is a quiet kid who seems to have attended the same private school as Haley Joel Osment.The family runs afoul of some locals when they hit a deer that runs across the road in front of their car.  The deer is being stalked by three hunters one with the ominous moniker of Otis so we know this is a bad thing.  The hunters especially Otis are angry because the buck's antlers are chipped from the impact therefore devaluing it.  Words are exchanged and once the family gets to the cottage they discover bullet holes in some of the windows.While the family is foraging for groceries in town a mysterious Indian man appears and gives Miles a weird animal statue explaining to him the legend of the Wendigoa vengeful spirit who consumes flesh and is part man part animal part tree...or whatever else happens to be around.To tell more would be to spoil the movie's one big surprise so I won't give away what really happens.  What I will tell you though is that this is the kind of movie where weird scary things happen and they turn out to be hallucinations.  For instance Miles sees a man emerge from his closet and point a gun at him.  No danger...hallucination.  There are noises in the attic and the retractable stairs bow outward ominously as if something up there wants out...hallucination.  Miles has a vision while riding his sled...hallucination.Then before we know what hit us we're in the film's final stages.  A nonsupernatural threat is revealed and the fearsome legend of the Wendigo turns out to be just a couple of vague appearances and the inability to inflict any kind of real harm on a human being.  We do see it and it looks like a giant deer walking on two legs.  It's creepy...at least I thought it was...but that's all.I think the movie's crucial misstep was the ghostly man's description of the Wendigo.  We as the audience have been tricked into thinking the Wendigo is going to cut loose on these people or at least on somebody in the film and it never really happens.  It's a letdown and by the time the events of the ending unfold we're tapping our feet nervously waiting for some Wendigo action.  And then those killer credits come signaling the death of the movie.  It was a nice try but after all the buildup the conclusion of the film feels like a cheat.  But that dramatic pause in the blackness KNOWING those credits were coming but not wanting to accept the fact that the movie was really over?  Terrifying.";

	schema:headline " A flawed attempt of making an intelligent horror movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "Larry Fessenden is an independent director who has focused his career in making horror movies with philosophical and existential subtexts. Despite his sparse production four movies in 16 years his original approach to the genre and the quality of his work has given him recognition and praise in festivals and in the independent scene. Wendigo the third of his horrorthemed films is probably the weakest of them but it has many of the unique characteristics of Fessenden's filmmaking that make it stand out among the genre.A young family of three heads to upstate New York hoping to spend a time relaxing hoping to relieve from the stress from the city. However they find problems as they find an angry local named Otis John Speredakos who is not very happy with having them as neighbors. His strong and intimidating presence serves as catalyst for the family's inner conflicts and fears specially those of little Miles Erik Per Sullivan whose feelings of loneliness are increased due to the fear Otis creates in him. As he learns about the legend of the Wendigo Miles will learn to face the harsh world that is out there.Very loosely based on the Anishinaabe legend of the Wendigo the movie is a haunting drama mixed with horror that perfectly combines a lucid visual style with a clever storyline. Told from Miles' point of view the film is genuinely creepy and the snowy landscapes together with the feeling of isolation Miles feels increase the haunting atmosphere of the film. Basing its scares on mood and atmosphere makes the film a rare species among modern horror movies and the excellent camerawork makes the film look a lot better than other lowbudget independent films.Fessenden visual approach may seem a bit style over substance at first but he takes a good time in developing the characters and their relationships. In fact the relationships between them are probably the most important thing in Wendigo. From Miles' distant relationship with his parents George Jake Webber and Kim Patricia Clarkson to both parents' struggle to keep a balance between job and family's responsibilities. The impact Otis has in the family and the Wendigo's legend work perfectly as plot devices to make the film move.The lead cast is superb with Erik Per Sullivan being an excellent actor despite his young age. Jake Webber and Patricia Clarkson show their talent and the three of them have very good chemistry as a family. The rest of the cast is average but their work is fine considering that the center of the film are our three main characters. The Wendigo spirit an important part of the plot is very well recreated and despite its cheap lowbudget look Fessenden camerawork make it work very good.Sadly the movie is not perfect and despite having a very strong start the movie loses steam and by the end it falls short to the expectations built. Larry Fessenden offers a creative and actually haunting film that is severely hurt by the lack of a competent conclusion a shame if one considers that the characters are very well developed and the plot has lots of potential. The fact that the use of atmosphere visuals and audio is superb makes the weak ending the more disappointing. It feels as if Fessenden had not cared about how to finish the tale as the movie feels incomplete.Wendigo has been hailed as both a masterpiece and as a failure. While the movie has enough good things to be called a great film it's disappointing payoff and lack of conclusion are a big stain. In this case the best thing to do is to watch and judge for yourself just don't expect a typical horror film. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Important to know straight off  this isn't a horror film or a creature feature. This is a film about that twoheaded coin fear and faith. It's about what our minds conjure up when we let our fears get the better of us and it's about what our minds conjure up when we hope or pray. As many people have said this film takes its time in bringing on 'the monster'. Seemingly that is so but if you put away the usual limited way of looking at horror movies you will realize that the 'monster' appears fairly early on in the film. You can't see it you only feel its presence. If you were paying attention you'll know that the Wendigo isn't a monster it's a spirit and it can change its size and shape at will. The catch is. the will does not belong to the Wendigo it belongs to those who conjure the Wendigo. If the imagination holds on to fear the Wendigo will take the shape of that fear like a chimera. It may appear as drops of blood or as a sudden gust of snow or as a giant deer with dragon breath notice that the reason the 'monster' image of the Wendigo looks rather cheesy is because that is all a very young boy can muster in his mind. Chances are the little boy's parents haven't let him watch Alien yet!. If it is hope you need to conjure the Wendigo will go where you want it to go and be what you want it to be the father's description of how easily he got to the house after he'd been shot sounds like he had a little help there!. The Wendigo will also create havoc for those who deserve a nasty fate. It cannot kill but it can create enough fear in a person to drive himself in one case literally to his own demise. In other words what devours us isn't a boogie man with sharp teeth it is our fear that devours us.There is a reason that this film spends most of its first hour in the presence of the family as it goes through everyday rituals and discussions. There is a tension that is penetrating that normalcy. We  and the characters at different times  are aware of the bullet holes in the walls of the menacing presence of the creepy neighbor and of the resonating grisly demise of that deer on the road. The father's feeling of helplessness gets triggered against his wife and son. The Wendigo takes the form of that aggression too. Before the father goes on the sled we see him playacting murdering his son. It is a game and his son is never realistically threatened but the father needed to do this in order to vent out his aggression subconsciously of course. The film smartly tells its story from the viewpoint of the young boy. Smartly for one reason because it is the core of fear that really scares us and that core began at a very young age. Remember the shadows in the corner of your room that seemed to swallow up the furniture with their darkness? Remember the overcoat that limply hung on the closet door looking like a hanging dead man? Or how about the breeze outside your house that whistled through the branches as they clawed at your window? They're all innocent and harmless things yet we practically scared ourselves to death as kids by letting our imaginations our little Wendigos run wild. The film also is smart to tell its story through the little boy because he is going to learn something that he will take with him into adulthood. He will face death and embrace it and let it go the scene in the hospital where his father is in surgery and then after the father dies. It is a rite of passage. The little boy will now be able to fill his father's shoes metaphorically despite the literal image!.This movie is the stuff of myths. It is what horror originally was in the movies. Today with terrorists and serial killers it's easy to get lost in horror as 'reality'. Slasher movies have championed the literal with realistic special effects offering little to feed our need for fantasy. If you look back into your childhood you will find what you yourself planted there long ago. Your imagination. Your appreciation for this movie will depend on how much of that you have retained.".

The movie has a slow buildup filled with mundane drama which some have criticized. Yet this is reminiscent of films like The Birds where the main characters and a sense of realism are well established before things get going.Wendigo is a mood piece more than anything else. The mysteriousness of the lonely Catskill woods is evoked along with a sense of wonder and fear of the unknown. It's a vibe more akin to The Mothman Prophecies than Ogre. Like The Mothman Prophecies Wendigo is somehow a pleasure just to watch as long as you're not psychedup for a monsterslasher flick. There's a quiet style and expertise to the filmmaking that smacks of professionalism.Patricia Clarkson is effective as the wifemother and little Erik Per Sullivan is excellent as the son Miles.Interestingly none of the special effects were done with CGI but rather cinematic techniques costumes makeup and creative editing. It works for me.The film leaves the viewer somewhat scratching hisher head with its ambiguity. What conjured up the Wendigo? What's its purpose? How exactly does it devour people with its unquenchable hunger? Etc. Obviously if you like everything spelled out for you and don't like banging your head this is not the film for you.The film was shot in the Catskills NY and runs 91 minutes.GRADE B or A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION SPOILER Don't read further if you haven't seen the film Children are more sensitive to the spiritual realm because they haven't yet built up years of intellectual blockades along with social conditioning. It's clear that Miles senses malevolent creatures or spirits around him which is why he and his mother check the closet and underneath the bed before he goes to sleep.The Wendigo is a spirit and can only manifest in the physical realm through an agent who releases the spirit through BELIEF. The Wendigo souvenir plays a role in the Wendigo's manifestation because it was created by someone who BELIEVED in the Wendigo it's in essence an article of worship and in a sense an idol. Hence the Wendigo is attracted to the figure which can inspire BELIEF in certain individuals like Miles.The ghostly Native American in the souvenir shop is obviously the Wendigo in human form. He's attracted to Miles because he senses belief and therefore guides the boy to the Wendigo figure and explains the legend. He says No one believes in spirits anymore but after sharing the story of the Wendigo he asks the boy if he believes to which Miles responds I guess so. This wasn't much but it was all the Wendigo needed. The boy gets his mother to purchase the statue and thus the Wendigo is released into the physical realm to devour human prey.The Wendigo is an evil spirit and therefore a liar. In Indian form he claims that such spirits are not bad just angry. In other words he makes excuses for his malevolent actions. Our prisons are full of people who do the same thing.Once released the Wendigo immediately inspires Otis to shoot the husband and later kill the cop. The Wendigo then goes after the very person he used Otis which shows that evil spirits will readily use you if you're willing and then lose you. Why didn't the Wendigo provoke someone else? Because evil spirits can only utilize those who are ALREADY given over to the dark side of their natures. The film shows that Otis was already an arrogant SOB and potential psycho. He doesn't go over the edge until AFTER the Wendigo is released.If you're wondering why the Wendigo required belief to manifest in the physical realm just think about it It's the same way with God. The bible says that without faith it is impossible to please God. Faith is the key that activates God on our behalf answers prayer heals and moves mountains. Why would we think it's any different with spirit beings who aren't benign? The difference is that when they are released through belief they cause havoc and destruction rather than blessing.".

And if Wendigo doesn't quite display that films polished visuals it certainly borrows the themes of isolation and familial tension especially patriarchal that Kubrick examined so well. Cult director Larry Fessenden has gone back to horror movie basics to achieve a palpable tension in his film black shadows in every corner of a veryunderlit rural house creaky floorboards shrieking nighttime winds. His film starts to unravel when he pushes to far  the appearance of the Wendigo an Indian spirit that travels on the wind is at first frightening but ultimately overplayed Fessenden feels compelled to reveal the monster in an extended attack sequence on the films hillbilly badguy and in doing so belies the slyness with which we had so successfully frightened us up to that point. The ending is particularly murky both visually and narratively feeling rushed and a little selfconsciously obscure. The cast is uniformly solid Jake Weber and Patricia Clarkson as the yuppiesinperil are very real and 'Malcolm In The Middle' youngster Erik Per Sullivan provides the perfect conduit for audience fear and apprehension. The print I viewed at the recent AFM conference was particularly grainy and I am unsure as to whether this was due to the transfer from HDVtofilm or whether Fessenden shot it like that. Regardless it proved very effective in creating a sense of dread and foreboding especially in the early twilight scenes. Also nice to see a film that revels in its ability to scare not always winking at the audience in a selfmocking Scream sortof way. More often than not lately irony and revisionism have gotten in the way of a good fright which Wendigo certainly provides.".

However just remember this film starts off sloooow. And it pretty much stays that way for the majority of the picture. The film is very well thought out and thoroughly wellwritten. Larry Fessenden seems to have executed his ideas perfectly in his eyes and it seems like he took his time get it right and that's fine with me. There is a psychological aspect to the whole thing but I wouldn't really say it is a psychological thriller or whatever you would call it I would just call it horror interspersed with drama.The typical Bigfoot geek might walk away from this endeavor disappointed this isn't your 70's style camp classic we have here. However they might walk away feeling good about this one as well like I did if they can appreciate some solid filmmaking. It starts off with our broken family trying to spend some quality time together kind of thing for a good 45 minutes of the film a la 'The Shining' and won't really satisfy the horror fan until the second half of the film really. The film is sloooowww like I said. Patricia Clarkson and Jake Weber's characters are both very wellwritten. John Speredakos plays his role naturally well although I had never heard of him until this film. The dialogue is well written and the most unimportant lines will end up meaningful in the end. The climax of the film is truly the most impressive and by the end 'Wendigo' manages to work up a bit of creepiness. The images are nice lots of dead sticks and st. If you're looking for some ridiculously bloody slasher type flick look elsewhere because that isn't what you'll be getting from this one. The legend of the 'Wendigo' isn't really discussed a whole lot and someone seeking a ton of information of the folklore of this myth and other Indian myths should probably look elsewhere also but if you can handle a wellmade unconventional and original horror story then this could be for you. But be weary if you look to this hoping for it to be 'Urban Legend' or something.WENDIGO 710.".

What a marvelous actor.I think that many people take issue with this film because it is a bit slow moving. It takes it's time developing the dynamic between George and his son Miles. It never seems forced it always seems real.I still haven't figured out the ending completely but it's nowhere near as bad as some would have you believe.Check it out and decide for yourself. Even if you hate it you'll end up loving Jake Weber Patricia Clarkson and Eric Per Sullivan.";

It had nothing to do with all the other activity that was going on between his parents and the hunters or anything else along that line. It was the fact that he was trying to use his positive preoccupation with Indians as an outlet to escape the problems he was having while growing up. Of course its very tough being a kid and I think he just needed something to get interested in to try and escape the problems his parents were having.Well......anyway....... this is why I gave this film a 4 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "My friends and I rented this movie as we were looking for a horror film to either laugh at or be impressed by.  With this film we couldn't do either since it was so dull. The cover is a bit misleading and the movie told no story whatsoever.  There's a lot of irrelevant boring dialogue and even when it sticks to the plot nothing enhances it or helps it grow. There isn't enough suspense for it to be considered a horror film.  The basic story follows a family vacationing in the wintry mountains who bump into irate hunter Otis.  After the family gets settled the little boy Miles has strange visions and meets a mysterious Native American.  This is where you learn the conflicting information about the Wendigo.  Is it good is it bad? What does it want? You'll never know.  Maybe this is to help you make your own opinion but the movie doesn't even give you enough criteria to base one on! If you do decide to rent this they should be paying you to rent it and feel gypped by the movie you may try looking at the director's interview to learn more about the Wendigo.  Well you'll be disappointed there too. Toothless Larry Fessenden stands in front of a graffiti wall on a city street to share all his knowledge which turns out to be very little.  He'll speak of hearing his teacher tell the story of the dreaded Wendigo when he was in third grade and that it haunted him ever since.  He doesn't divulge the actual story because he conveniently forgets.  Nice supporting back story there buddy.  You can't even remember what inspired you to make this stupid movie? The only ONLY good thing about this movie was the Wendigo itself. They put in a lot of effort and detail to make the Wendigo lifelike.  However you only get to see that in the 'making of' DVD extra.  In the actual movie the lighting is dark or the shots are too quick for you to appreciate it. Obviously lighting issues are for atmosphere but it didn't seem to make sense to give that much full body detail to the creature if we weren't gonna see all of it. My advice is to skip over this one unless you enjoy being confused or laughing at the beginning of the Searching for the Wendigo extra.".

One of the charms of the story is that it doesn't have a bad guy the meanest man in town merely has a bad temper and a cantankerous father to look after. The English title Late Bloomers plays on a double meaning the little old ladies are late bloomers in the sense of realizing their dreams in retirement age and bloomers in the sense of ladies' underwear. The original title also plays on a double meaning people on the last lap of life and yet timelessly young.While ostensibly a microscopic look at Swiss village life and mentality what allows it to reach out and speak to a wider audience is that it is a parable about kneejerk conservatism versus the irrepressible need for change. The Swiss dialect while contributing enormously to the film's charm and believability will also regrettably limit its reach. As with Bienvenue Chez les Ch'tis France 2008 aka Willkomen Bei Den Ch'tis it will have to be suitably subtitled or dubbed in an appropriately rural dialect to attain the recognition it deserves.

	schema:reviewBody "Die Herbstzeitlosen is a Swiss film from almost 10 years ago that deals with a bunch of old ladies and their unusual business enterprise in the lingerie industry. These 90 minute were also Switzerland's submission to the Academy Awards that year but the film did not even make it to the shortlist of the 9 best movies. And I can see why. Bettina Oberli who wrote and directed this does not succeed in including credible character development in here. Instead she goes for easy jokes that add nothing to the movie in a credible way. The worst example was probably when some young women randomly took of their clothes near the end to display that they were wearing the old ladies' underwear brand. Now that was truly embarrassing moment and totally cringeworthy. Like taken straight out of one of these horrible romantic movies for television that keep getting made so frequently here in Germany.The whole premise is already only partially working. All the anger and annoyance in the town was too far over the top to be realistic. They were opening a lingerie store and not a brothel. The whole travelling to America story was intended to make an emotional impact but it wasn't working for me at all. The drama was pretty forgettable as well and that includes even a death of one of the central characters. One of the few good things in this film was Stephanie Glaser's nomination. She plays her part well and certainly elevates the mediocre material most of the time. Good for her that she got the Swiss Film Award nomination and she may have won the category if there had been one for males and one for females. However apart from her turn there is really not too much to praise. Basically all the characters were written uninterestingly in a way that you do not really care for their fate. And the inclusion of the son's troubles with his mother's new business while he himself has an affair going is completely generic and not smart at all. The ways in which we are supposed to really like nobody except the main characters are examples of pretty poor writing I have to say. Not recommended and it's a sad state of affairs if a film like this is considered among the best films from Switzerland in recent years.".

It would've been perfect if D'Angelo and Me'shell Ndegeocello were playing too. Then I'd be in heaven. It made me fall in love with Hip Hop and good soul music all over again.

While it does have his amazing comic brilliance in it it is MOSTLY filled with great music. Still I loved this movie for all its aspects the Music the jokes the stories and the entertainment. With Musical talent including Mos Deff Kanye West The Roots Dead Prez the Commons a reunion of The Fugees and much much more this is a must see. So many of the movies that are put into theaters are not worth your 810 dollars this one is. BUT go see it knowing that its not the Chappelle Show.".

Well man I'd like to meet your grandfather.For those of you who don't know When We Were Kings it's time to watch it. Because both this documentaries are about the same thing. Of course I wouldn't say Block Party is as good nor as powerful as when we were kings. But the purpose is the same try to unite black people on one event try to make them realise that even when you're black and coming from a poor neighbourhood you can do something of your life without only blaming the white man for your condition. Of course at the time When We Were Kings was shot Mobutu was Zaire's Dictator and the movie was financed by Liberian producers who mostly owned their money from selling diamonds coming from Sierra Leone exchanged against AK47's and other weapons. Therefore the omnipotent contradiction hidden behind the Black condition and even mankind in general but it has hurt black people much more people trying to do good and others getting money out of it with no rules or respect for anything or anyone.So for once here in Block Party it's something done for fun not for money but also for ideas with representatives of this movement we don't see enough Not only people AGAINST something or someone but FOR a change using the power that is present in this population. And Michel Gondry who is a GREAT director filmed this in the same way When We Were Kings was shot. Camera in hand closeups rough cuts interviews over the music same kind of music same kind of people. Showing the poverty and showing there's hope. It's not a masterpiece to me but a good documentary. And of course if you don't like hiphop it's hard to like it. I'm a huge fan of ALL the artist on this movie I would have made exactly the same programmation if I had been in control!".

	schema:reviewBody "...However as a rapconcert movie it's one of the better ones I've seen in quite a while. It works for a few reasons though for some it may not work as well as for others. Basically if you're coming into this expecting Chappelle doing more of his standup or sketches you'll wonder how you could've been misled not that his moments on screen don't elicit enough laughs for satisfaction at least for a Chappelle admirer like myself in fact many white audience members going into the film walked out of screenings. If this is due to the filmmaking style or something wrong on the end of director Michel Gondry or just not caring for the rap and hiphop is up for debate. But considering the kind of mix of betterthanusual rap music solid cinema verier style camerawork by Gondry and his small crew and the fine bits of interview footage it's actually not a bad film if you go into it knowing what you'll get. For some it may be one of the film events of the season or year.One reason it worked is that and this is of course a subjective part of seeing Block Party the musical acts are better than most of the rap and hiphop currently heard on radio and seen on the music channels. Led by an actual band playing music as opposed to all beat machines the groups of which are Chappelle's own favorites and some of which already appeared on the hit or miss musical segments of his show bring out solid beats and the rappers or singers are not offputting or ridiculous. The highlights for me were with Kanye West with a cool powerful mix of himself and a school band for 'Jesus Walks' The Roots and the Fugee's 'Killing Me Softly'. There are also some cool loose moments with Chappelle and some people backstage where he jams and riffs and jokes funny jokes too albeit for the musician's expense more than for the audience. For someone like myself losing interest in more of the ultraviolent idiotic and overindulgent rap music of the day it was not unpleasant at all to get dropped back into it with acts that were fresh and interesting not that there aren't some missteps Dead Prez and Common not being some of the highlights for me.The other thing that made the film work though is Gondry's natural eye with his lens as he just stands by getting down the attitudes the emotions and little bits of life in the midst of this huge spectacle. There isn't anything outstanding in his style like with the Maysles brothers or DA Pennebaker in terms of capturing the music in action and sometimes his focus strays to people on camera who take up a little too much time. But for the most part with some exceptions of little moments that just don't work his attention to the rhythm of a film and the rhythm of film led by music he is one of the most artistically dominant forces in music videos of the past ten or so years is focused just right. This style also compliments Chappelle who has a laid back kind of way of talking to people but with a sense of humor that cuts the chase. Some of the best parts though of his moments on screen aren't expected improvised like the James Brown bit on stage or his obscure ability to play two specific jazz songs on piano or even his more juvenile jokes in jamming.In short it's a side of Chappelle you might not usually see at times or with Gondry and it all gels together for the sake of the audience that showed up for the show. Nothing too pretentious and entertaining enough to keep those interested in their seats.".

	schema:headline " fans and the artists and Chappelle forged a culture at this party and this culture is infectious";
	schema:reviewBody "Block Party reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com rating 3.5 out of 4For a comeback Dave Chappelle's got it right with Block Party. It isn't a concert film but features a hefty amount of highlight performances. It also isn't a standup comedy but Chappelle certainly spouts some smileturning kickers. And Block Party isn't a documentary but we're left with a sense of culture from the footage of interviews throughout. In truth Block Party really isn't much of anything but it's enough to mount dizzying entertainment with the flick of Michel Gondry's handheld DV camera. It surrounds the conception preproduction production and postproduction of Dave Chappelle's 2005 Brooklyn Block Party. The word production is used loosely here not to connote images of agents frantically finding the rights to singers and their songs and the construction of the set and all the hoohah that goes into a major concert. No. By PreProduction I mean Dave Chappelle traveling back to hometown Dayton Ohio to hand out the golden tickets to his fellow citizens. By Production I mean watching some excellent musical performances on the corner of Downing and Quincy in front of the Broken Angel warehouse to the sound of 5000 screaming fans. And by PostProduction I mean watching Chappelle and his fellow performers speculate about the show afterwards.But for all the linearity described here Block Party doesn't have mind for structure. The film doesn't roll chronologically instead Block Party jumps around itself sometimes going to Ohio then back to rehearsal jumping forward to a highlight performance and then back to Brooklyn at a children's day care where the kids bounce frantically around Chappelle. Gondry worries less about documenting the actual party opting instead to find an accessible method for the audience's entertainment. If the film was said to be trying hard at any one thing it would be that Block Party really tries to keep from bogging itself down.Chappelle himself does well to not hog the screen. In fact if there was any one complaint it would be that we don't see Chappelle enough. This is not Chappelle's Show after all. There are no skits and only a few planned scenes of comedy. Mostly we follow Chappelle around with a couple DV cameras and a boom mic as he explores Dayton and Brooklyn speaking to their inhabitants and hearing their stories. But this isn't to say that Chappelle avoids humor. We all know Dave Chappelle's a funny man when he's not even trying. Believe me there are many laughs to be had. The style digs down to why we loved Dave Chappelle in the first place. Seeing him walk around his hometown in a state of relative normalcywithout spotlights or producers and writersoffers Block Party a homegrown attitude. The music reflects this showcasing artists that inhabit the quality of music instead of the financial returns that go along with it.And the music's great too. Gondry does well not to overdose on it aware that that the beats may grow tiresome for the antirap audience. He only showcases one or two songs at a time jumping back to another Chappelle experience in between. But whether or not you're a regular fan of rap I'm not Block Party's music is sure to rouse some sort of reaction. The attitude and community behind the music is what makes it great. The fans and the artists and Chappelle forged a culture at this party and this culture is infectious. At the theatre much of the audience started dancing and moving to the music in their seats some even raising their arms at the musicians' demand. And at it's heart it's just about everyonethe fans the artists the theatre audience and Chappellejust having a good time. www.samseescinema.com".

Now i almost fell asleep in this movie and if it wasn't for a hilarious joke about a stripper and The Fugies i would have. Critics and people alike liked this movie and would like to ask why? I mean it's a block party. It would be more interesting if you were there then watching it on the big screen. Now i originally didn't want to go see this movie. But my friends wanted to go because they are big Chappelle fans and they thought this would be funny and a good trip to the movies. I still can't believe how naive they were. About ten minutes into the film i said to my friend this better get better and then twenty minutes into the film i sighed and m friend asked Why do you hate this movie so much? and later he would be complaining about this movie almost as much as i was. Thirty minutes in there is a scene where a bus is driving people to the block party and it shows a shot of the road through the wind shield and the audience saw a rain soaked twisted road. I leaned over to my friend and said if this shot is the rest of the movie I'll be happy unfortunately it wasn't. Bottom line This movie is crap and it's a DVD Special Feature that no one will watch. And i swear this is the last time I listen to critics If you want funny see Date Movie that at least tries to make you laugh.Grade 12".

	schema:reviewBody "www.kajatm.com To say that Block Party was a little disappointing is an understatement. Block Party is Chappelle's most recent work since going crazy and maybe it would have been a good idea if he had stayed that way. This movie I use that term loosely because it really isn't a movie but more of home movie taken by your drunk uncle looks at Dave's attempt to throw a block party in Brooklyn NY and the three days leading up to the Block Party. The movie includes a Rap star studded cast including Mos Def Kanye West The Fugees Big Daddy Kane and Common.This movie was just terrible. Words cannot describe how bad it actually was. First off for those of you expecting The Chappelle show will be highly disappointed. The entire movie contains about a total of 10 minutes of Chappelle's material which may result in the new release of The Edited Dave Chappelle's Block Party presented by Jim the 10 minute version. Second the movie really has no point whatsoever. I've tried to sit and think about this movie and what the exact point of it was and the only thing that I can come up with is that Dave Chappelle is stupid rich now and this was his way of giving back to the community or he just really likes block parties. But besides that it is pretty much just a party in Brooklyn that he decided to tape. Finally unless you are really up on the Hip Hop scene you will not recognize a lot of the performers outside Mos Def Kanye West and The Fugees.I was so disappointed with this movie that I had to go home and watch the entire first season of The Chappelle show just to remind myself that once upon a time there was a world where Dave Chappelle was funny. This was followed up by watching Pulp Fiction just so I could wipe my memory of this piece of garbage.Like I mentioned before if you are expecting to see a full movie version of The Chappelle show do not go to see this movie. Instead I would recommend going home getting into the most uncomfortable chair in your home then pull that chair over to the ugliest wall in your humble abode and sit there for 2 hours just staring at that wall. I am willing to bet that this would be more entertaining than this movie. If this movie did not have the 10 minutes of Chappelle being funny I would have to seriously consider discussing with my friend Ken renaming The Thin Red Line rating. Do not waste your money to see this don't rent it don't borrow it from a friend don't watch the advertisement don't look at it when you go the rental store and don't even use the words Block Party or Chappelle in the same sentence. Let's all just pretend that this movie was never even made your life will be better for it but then again what do I know?".

Since I was not interested or made interested by either this film didn't connect for me.As a comedian I find that Dave Chappelle is a hit or miss. Some things he sketches out and performs are as funny as heck some things he does are rather mean spirited blatantly racist and let me clarify that by saying  just because he's an African American it does not give him license to be racist against African Americans while others are condemned for doing so and just plain unthoughtful.Here his comedic stylesocial commentary really doesn't matter for nothing he did even cracked a smile on my face or left me with an afterthought.The alleged philanthropy angle of the film was what most disgusted me  there really wasn't one of merit. I was not impressed nor did I find it funny. I found it pandering and selfserving and that is not the intention behind philanthropy although that is what it may have turned into. While it's a nice idea to stage an outdoor concert in this day and time all I have to do is turn on the New York bases morning shows Today or Good Morning America et al to see one so this was not unique there wasn't anyone cast I would remotely be interested in watching n film  but for those who do like these folks this film may be an enjoyable venture depending on who got more film time than others and why.And rather than walking Dave Chappelle through the neighborhood giving out golden tickets to the show yes it was more of a show than a block party why not walk him through the Brooklyn neighborhood giving out real golden tickets Educational College Grantsscholarships under his name. But that would not make an interesting film  in the same way this doesn't make an interesting film. For how much this cost to do that would have been a better idea and would have yielded better long term rewards for that area. Let me just add here that one of the reasons why this act left me sour is that I am tired of seeing African Americans who have some kind of recognition do nothing more but stage concerts and think they're improving neighborhoods and the poor within them by doing so. This is just one more example of missing an opportunity to do something long lasting really worth a darn. This film was a waste of celluloid and the showcasing of musical talent for me but hey Chappelle and his production folks made money to keep him comfortably numb for a few more years and the 'hip hop' or whatever you may call them now musicians of the minute chosen to appear got an opportunity to be seen and heard to the fans that support them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dave Chappelle's comedy on TV has been good although lower  middle class whites who are also oppressed by greasy fat fascist neocons may question the moral validity of having comedy which uses too broad of a brush relative to assigning guilt to lighter skin colors. The In Living Color TV series did that pervasively where they often lumped all Caucasians into the same boat of being the man and yet as a left leaning antiauthoritarian in the same political camp as Gandhi and the Dali Llama I find myself somewhat offended at being lumped in with the modern right wing fascists of today just because of my skin color and genetics.In any case I still found Mr. Chappelle's comedy on TV to be funny. But make no mistake about it this movie is not that's not a Dave Chappelle comedy movie. For the most part here's what it is instead a. rather pedantic and boring clips of him organizing his 'party' and b. way too long bouts of annoying lower grade rap music.One of the rap songs had some strong put downs for all the crackers in city hall. The poor in America may agree as they find that the war on drugs is really a war on the poor  the poor who have no good job prospects and who cannot afford to pay big drug companies for pain meds.But even so even if you agree that the war on drugs is evil  does more harm than good what you're getting from this film if you're a Dave Chappelle fan is not what you would expect to get for your 8. There's simply not enough comedy. The ratio of rap songs to comedy is way off. Mr. Chappelle apparently felt it should be about 95 to 5 whereas the common Chappelle fan would have rightly expected it to be at least 5050 and more properly about 2080.So yes I think there's some use in getting music of the rebels out there into the movie houses of the US but we need a bit more sauce with dry meat.Also there's something to be said against a glorification of gangsterism. One can advocate for the poor and for the rights of everyone to be free without advocating gangsterism. And rap music tends unfortunately to sometimes glorify more negative  crass aspects of human nature. There is in it a certain brutishness and crassness and blunt aggression and the rap music serves to transit blunt aggressiveness to future generations.If the ghetto is to be brought up so as to fight against oppression it needs to do some internal deghettoification. Don't drop rap but maybe kick it up a notch more toward egalitarianism and more toward an advocacy for kindness and respect and a higher level of education.So I suppose the film was interesting but it was also boring and not worth the price I paid. I went expecting to see much more comedy. But what I got instead was to see what the ghetto looks  feels like. And there is some use in that I suppose but ideally it would have been easier to swallow the dry meat if there would have been more sugar filled jam added on top. I would still get the meat of the rap down but I can personally only do so happily if it's more interspersed with some good comedy.Sadly therefore I recommend holding off on seeing this film. There is value in learning about how the other side lives if you're a middle America person  whatnot. But to tell you the truth it would be easier for the middle Americans to do learning on this level if we can at least every five minutes or so do some laughing. That's what we went to see a movie with Mr. Chappelle's name on it to do. And there were a few funny spots. But after a while I got bored and wanted to leave even though I fully agree with the common goals of left leaning antiauthoritarians.Is it really useful to crassly gain comedic points by pervasively pointing out whites who happen to show up to a black comedian's show? I don't think so. Humans of all colors are capable of great evil and great compassion. All of us have lovers and rapists and abusers in our heritage. I don't particularly want to be blamed for the sins of my mothers  fathers unless I today am acting as an enabler for continued abuse of the planet  of fellow humans. The no sense of humor modern fascists deserve to be fully excoriated via comedy and I encourage all comedians of all colors to do as much. Mr. Chappelle and all modern comedians who purport to advocate for the common man should realize that everyone is being oppressed by the right wing modern fascists of today and that the common man comes in all colors including the color of the oppressor  and there are darker colored people amongst the oppressor's ranks here. Also in Africa there are a lot of dark skinned people doing a great amount of harm through wars and ethnic cleansing. So let's just admit to each other that humans can be good or evil regardless of skin color.The above text is the type of dialogue which needs to take place amongst us and movies like Mr. Chappelle's could have some value to that end. But if a movie is boring or not what a person expects they sadly may loose interest in the topic  walk out. The movie either needed more comedy and less rap or perhaps a third each of rap comedy and a dialogue which would serve to convey to middle America how voting fascist hurts the all American children and puts all of us at risk.".

I don't particularly want to be blamed for the sins of my mothers  fathers unless I today am acting as an enabler for continued abuse of the planet  of fellow humans. The no sense of humor modern fascists deserve to be fully excoriated via comedy and I encourage all comedians of all colors to do as much. Mr. Chappelle and all modern comedians who purport to advocate for the common man should realize that everyone is being oppressed by the right wing modern fascists of today and that the common man comes in all colors including the color of the oppressor  and there are darker colored people amongst the oppressor's ranks here. Also in Africa there are a lot of dark skinned people doing a great amount of harm through wars and ethnic cleansing. So let's just admit to each other that humans can be good or evil regardless of skin color.The above text is the type of dialogue which needs to take place amongst us and movies like Mr. Chappelle's could have some value to that end. But if a movie is boring or not what a person expects they sadly may loose interest in the topic  walk out. The movie either needed more comedy and less rap or perhaps a third each of rap comedy and a dialogue which would serve to convey to middle America how voting fascist hurts the all American children and puts all of us at risk.";

Maybe critics are afraid of earning a racist label for panning this movie but I was astonished at how bad this movie was. For those thinking of seeing it it's about 15 minutes of Chapelle and the entire rest of the movie is footage of the block party where rappers are performing. That's it! That's the movie...about 70 minutes of rappers singing...nothing extra no humorous interactions no quirky likable characters. The movie is funny when Chappelle is onsreen improvising his humor on people he meets. Howver there is not nearly enough of that interaction to make this film watchable and much less enjoyable. Chappelle invites some odd characters to the party at the beginning and we are excited to see how they will interact with the rest of the audience BUT WE NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN IN THE MOVIE until it's almost over and they just say it was nice. I laughed about three times during the whole movie...when Chappelle was on screen. The rest was a bunch of crappy rap music Yeaaaayah!!! What? Ugh! Ugh! and people jumping around on stage. There was a racist slur used over and over in one song and I was made very uncomofortable by it's use. Very dispapointing and not even a good concert flick at that. Unless you are a gigantic fan of rap stay home and pop in Chapelle Show season 2 and laugh your butt off. I'm not sure what is being presented here...a music concert movie? Not even as a concert movie is this worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "This 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writerdirector Steve Gordon and stars Dudley Moore and John Gielgud. Sadly Gordon only in his early forties died soon after completing this his only feature film. It's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at characterdriven farce that makes the whole film irresistible. It plays almost like a 1930'sstyle screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes. The plot centers on Arthur Bach a drunken diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his 750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring Susan Johnson an heiress handpicked by his oldmoney father and dotty grandmother. Of course he doesn't love her and by chance runs into Linda Marolla a workingclass waitress and of course aspiring actress after she pilfers a Bergdorf Goodman tie for her father.The standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcoholfueled slapstick executed with classic lan by Moore. That he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to Gielgud's feisty acidic turn as Hobson Arthur's devoted but realitygrounded valet. It's the type of role he could play in his sleep but Gielgud makes Hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings. In probably her most likable film role Liza Minnelli hands the picture to her male costars by toning down her usual razzledazzle personality and making Linda quite genuine in motivation.A preLA Law Jill Eikenberry plays Susan just at the right passiveaggressive note while Barney Martin Jerry's dad on Seinfeld steals all his scenes as Linda's slovenly father Ralph. The one fly in the ointment is veteran actress Geraldine Fitzgerald who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother. And I have to admit that I still can't stand the very dated overplayed Christopher Cross song that inevitably won the Oscar for that year's best song. Unfortunately the 1997 DVD certainly in need of remastering has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes.".

	schema:reviewBody "The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his tooshort career in 1981's ARTHUR a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles big bellylaughs and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood. Moore received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach a drunken playboy who races cars plays tennis fondles women but he has weekends off and he's his own boss. Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston Jill Eikenberrywho is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla Liza Minnelli a waitressstruggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawless turn as Arthur's acidtongued butler and best friend Hobson whose outward disdain for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon who sadly died the following the year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later but this instant classic is not to be missed.".

This isn't pushed very far and the end is pretty inevitable but the journey is great fun mostly because Moore is relentlessly funny. Minnelli plays a great strong woman foil to him and is obviously what he needs in life. The romance between them is never very convincing because it remains a bit practicalthey don't have that great scene where we expect them to truly fall in love and that's just fine. The closest is the scene in the horse barn which has one of the funnies lines in the movie which almost feels like a Moore ad lib you'll see.The aging butler played by Gielgud is more nuanced and funny than the clich of the English butler in so many movies. It's weird to see him play this kind of role when his repertoire ranges more to Shakespeare he's one of England's great 20th Century stage actors.So love this not for the story which is lovable but plain but for the three actors and their ongoing wit and verve.

And the song albeit corny now worked perfectly in 1981 when Chris Cross type music was the other norm after the hair bands of course. It's a sweet funny fairytale with a sad element involved watching Arthur live loud  inappropriately thru the over indulgence of alcohol. Sad state of affairs even today for some of the unhappy rich. I just watched it again tonight having not seen it in a dozen years or more. I laughed throughout. Dudley Moore was at his comedic best. But John Gielgud steals the show with his lines said dryly as a proper butler would but hysterical! He won the Academy Award for his role. This was also one of Liza Minnelli's finest moments. Sad all but 2 of the main characters are dead today. All the more reason to see this movie for the first time or again. Add it to your library of Films that Left an Impact on a Generation. And watch it with 1981 eyes even if you were just a twinkle in your mom's eyes at that time! PS the 2011 version is NOTHING like the original and it's a disgrace to this film and the memory of all involved that this hackjob of a film even carried the same title.".

As much as we love Russell Brand I don't think he could do as good of a job as Dudley Moore did. Moore and whoever plays his butler are delightful and this is a classic motion picture that should not have been touched.

The relationship that Arthur and Hobsonthe butler is wonderful. This is just truly a wonderful film. Flawless. If you haven't seen it you must. Before the remake comes out.

Arthur falls in love with Liza Minnelli's character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her Oscar winning role in Cabaret. No Liza doesn't get to sing. She plays a diner waitress.

A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away. If you look fast you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are in conversation. Frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him.Secondly though I actually knew a real life Arthur Bach. He was not quite as wealthy as Arthur but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid. His parents tightly controlled his purse strings but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village. He spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself just like Dudley Moore does. The wonder with Arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not. But that's the other half of the equation. My friend was a most charming person when you got to know him. In fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming. He couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor. He spent his life being a perfect party guest. The term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him.And that's what Dudley Moore is a wastrel. Unlike my friend Moore has John Gielgud to clean up after him. That's a full time job as we see demonstrated in Arthur. My friend also never found a Liza Minnelli a male Liza Minnelli in fact because he was gay. Still Moore's portrayal of Arthur Bach is deadly accurate and so real for me.Arthur 20th century wastrel is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in Jill Eikenberry. Since he won't work for a living the threat of being cut off is quite real for him. He only has his butler Hobson played by John Gielgud and chauffeur Bitterman played by Ted Post to pour his troubles out to. We should all have such troubles.John Gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in Arthur on film and in fact Gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances. Yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at Oscar time. The Academy gave Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn Oscars for On Golden Pond and Gielgud the Best Supporting Actor Award essentially for the work of a lifetime. That man was amazing still at his craft almost to the end.So to Frank Graham who worked in the film and to Jackie Weiss a genuine real life Arthur I dedicate this review.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you consider that Arthur is basically a character study of an eccentric alcoholic and lacks much by way of a third act plot structure it's a wonderfully successful movie. It's fairly easy to ignore the fact that even at 97 minutes the film is running on pure charm for more than half that time. Wonderfully performances and a uniquely droll script in 1939 it wouldn't have seemed unique but in the past few decades it has very little competition in its screwball genre make Arthur well worth returning to.Arthur Bach Dudley Moore is a funny alcoholic. As such we'd hardly care about him. He wouldn't get into the finest restaurants. He wouldn't go on elaborate shopping sprees. And we wouldn't get the girls. However Arthur is also the heir to a fortune approaching a billion dollars. He's never worked a day in his life and he has two servants Hobson and Bitterman who have been with him forever. But his father finally makes an ultimatum  either Arthur marries the devoted and rich Susan Johnson well preLA Law Jill Eikenberry or he'll be cut off. And wouldn't you know it? This happens just as Arthur is falling in love perhaps for the very first time with waitressaspiring actress Linda Liza Minnelli. Will Arthur choose the money or the girl? You've seen this kind of movie before so you know where it's going.Steve Gordon's script is so wonderful that you forget that as a director he's basically standing as far back as possible and letting the cast kick the great dialogue up a notch.Arthur is about Dudley Moore's laugh. It's the first thing we hear and it rings through the whole film. It's a manic uncontrollable thing and probably if your neighbor laughed like that you'd get sick of him within an hour. For some reason Moore makes sure that we never get sick of Arthur. We don't get sick of his life of privilege of his demands of his embarrassing himself and the people who love him. We don't get sick of his silly rationalizing for his drunken state. And these are remarkable facts. Moore also gets to play the piano a brilliant skill fall over things one of Moore's best and kiss a horse no comment required. Moore also has terrific chemistry with Minnelli who certainly hasn't been better since. Minnelli's character's major flaw is that you never really get the minute she stops liking Arthur for his money and starts loving the man. I don't blame her for that.The first two thirds of the movie though completely belong to John Gielgud. One of the three greatest Shakespearean actors of his generation and this is what most filmgoers remember him for. Playing a butler! And yet the amazement of his performance is that you never feel that he's slumming even when he's sitting in bed wearing a cowboy hat. Beyond just being the moral center of the film nobody does better service to Gordon's dialogue. Gielgud's Hobson may be quick to tell people off but you never doubt he cares.As I said earlier the film doesn't really make it all the way to the end. It's not a spoiler to observe that the ending feels arbitrary and unmotivated. You would also be correct in wondering if this film's depiction of alcoholics is troublingly frivolous even for a light comedy. But honestly see how long you're troubled for. I suspect it won't last through Arthur's first dinner date with  hooker in stretch pants.This is a 7.510 I think. And I'll alert the media.".

	onyx:emotionText "If you consider that Arthur is basically a character study of an eccentric alcoholic and lacks much by way of a third act plot structure it's a wonderfully successful movie. It's fairly easy to ignore the fact that even at 97 minutes the film is running on pure charm for more than half that time. Wonderfully performances and a uniquely droll script in 1939 it wouldn't have seemed unique but in the past few decades it has very little competition in its screwball genre make Arthur well worth returning to.Arthur Bach Dudley Moore is a funny alcoholic.

The spoiled guy must choose between going with the woman he loves or marrying for money.  Film with fine acting and good fable like stuff and of course more laughs than most films today can deliver.  Oscars went to Burt Bacharach for his song and Sir John Gielgud for his performance as the sly butler.  One of the few films where the funniest part isn't a line but rather Arthur just laughing in his sleep.  A".

What will Arthur do?Arthur is an overrated romantic comedy from the early 80's. The problem is that there is no worthwhile character or message in the story. Arthur is an alcoholic reckless man.

	schema:reviewBody "I missed the beginning of the movie but what I saw of it was quite enough. The supporting cast especially Shakespearean actor John Gielgud as Arthur's sarcastic butler did a good job but the main characters unfortunately brought the movie down.Arthur the star is a rich happy drunk with no ambition and his family arranges him to marry a rich woman whom he does not love but he must go through with it or lose his chance of inheriting the family fortune. Along the way he meets a waitressstruggling actress whom he does fall in love with. What to do? The movie's major problem is that we're supposed to find a man with a drinking problem humorous. Trouble is drunkards are not happy peoplesee Leaving Las Vegas to show how having a drinking problem is really like. Not fun at all. Arthur's butler shows real concern for him and Arthur redeems himself by his showing concern for him as he diesbut the redemption is temporary. In the end he shows up drunk at his wedding and publicly humiliates his bride. Ha ha. Of course he will get his fortune anyway in the end.The other problem is Liza Minelli as the girlfriend. Her career only existed because her father director Vincent Minelli pushed her into her acting career as she looks ugly and is a weak actress. Seeing her is as appealing as eating an average worm sandwich. Though admittedly the movie would have been a turkey no matter who played the girlfriend.".
