This fantasy dreamlike tale is based on the famous book by the same name by Thophile Gautier the French author. This is actually the 5th movie adaptation of this novel which must tell you something about its force to attract generations of film makers.Vincent Prez plays Baron of Sigognac a young royal whose quest for material wealth brings him true love and revelations on the nature of this world. The plot themes are somewhat related to Stoppard's excellent Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead  both uses the traveling players to explore the nature of the human condition. One might also recall Bergman's Seventh Seal but Fracassa is more akin of Stoppard's light hearted witty approach to those grave subjects.A truly exceptional beautiful and entertaining film a long standing achievement for all involved surely better than Il Postino though sadly much less known. Surely overdue for rerelease?".

Although our tastes in film are very different we were all greatly impressed and moved by this captivating fantasy.The film is beautiful to look at with its special mixture of theatrical scenography and bitter realism among its very playful elegant and entertaining script is also great amounts of subtle wisdom. The characters seem simple at first but develop great depths as the film moves along. The Journey of Captain Fracassa is also superbly acted each of the performances is memorable the beautiful expressive faces of the actors and actresses stay with you for a long time. If anyone should be mentioned though it must be Massimo Troisi's moving blend of navet and wisdom as the classical fool Pulcinella and Vincent Perez' impressive transformation as the insecure Baron de Sigognac who becomes a lover and a performer of the theatre. Perez starts out looking all wideeyed and trembling and finishes with the confident air of an Italian football player. A lovely performance.I go to film clubs regularly and have had many great film experiences in the last years. However I can hardly remember leaving the cinema more profoundly entranced and touched than after having seen The Journey of Captain Fracassa. Do not miss the opportunity to see it. I ardently hope it will be rereleased soon I will be the first in line to secure the dvd.".

My vote is ten.P.S. I had this film on VHS and last week I bought the shameful DVD released by the Brazilian Distributor Lume Films.

Think Cyrano de Bergerac but with a more even and varied cast of characters and a big twist of a happy ending. It's particularly fun for anyone who does amateur theater as the plot involves a nobleman down on his luck in the south who swallows his pride long enough to join a troup of travelling actors at the time denied the right of burial for a trip to Paris.

The young shattered woman is immediately befriended by the experienced criminal Magnanni. Several intriguing characters are introduced and sideplots spun out. Masina eventually is exhaunorated but returns for a visit with shocking results.This film like other Italian PostWar masterpieces La Strada The Biscycle Thief focuses on the lingering poverty a direct result of a lost war and the deep gaps between the haves and the have nots. The little guy in that place and time had very few laughs as the betteroff will exploit the desperate.

Women in prison may act rough and tough but they were all innocent once. Those who break the cycle and escape the life of smalltime delinquency are few. Their triumph over adversity is the hope for everyone else. One character who has found her hope in a new love said it best. Now I know that when I get out of here I will never come back.

No. Could I have written this script in half an hour while stoned? Yes. Can I remember the last time I laughed this hard? No.The key to enjoying a Scary Movie is to see it as a series of sketches based on popular movies rather than a standalone film. The spoofs are extremely obvious and require as little thought to understand as it must have taken to write them. But as far as juvenile humour and crude visual jokes go David Zucker does it right. You might question Zucker's actual skills as a director but I dare you to call any of his movies unfunny. Another reviewer mentioned that he missed the Wayans' style of comedy and brought up the scene where a blind Carmen Electra mistakes a church seat for a toilet as one of the funny scenes. Funny how I thought that was the only scene in the entire movie where the comedy fell on its face. The Wayans' relied far too much on lame sexual humour and grossout jokes and I enjoy slapstick far more than that.Not that Scary Movie 4 doesn't have its fair share of hilarious crude jokes. I won't spoil all the fun for you so I'll just mention my favourite Charlie Sheen haunted by his past tries to commit suicide unfortunately the sleeping pills he swallowed turn out to be Viagra. That's the level of the humour in this movie and if you are entertained by violent slapstick people getting hit by cars sexual jokes and brilliant dialogue such asI saw this face... With a nose? Yes. Hmm. Sounds like a face....then this movie is worth buying a ticket for. But if you can't stand lowbrow dirty and obvious comedy you better stay away. Personally I thought 4 was the funniest in the entire series after 3. If a movie can make me laugh for an hour and 22 minutes I can't hate it. While Scary Movie 4 definitely isn't a good movie it's hard to put down comedy this funny. Craig Bierko does a very good Tom Cruise impression as well. If you liked the other movies especially 3 this is a must see.Dirty juvenile comedy is rarely this funny. Strongly recommended if you're in the mood.r16".

Its not hilarious by any means but it does pass an amusingly enjoyable 80 minutes of time. The gags are mostly clichd and predictable there's lots of tired old slapstick but when there's nothing else on TV which is why I watched this it certainly fits the bill. As for the appearance of 'Michael Jackson' in the film I'm still laughing every time I think about it  heaven knows how they got away with it but its certainly a funny moment!! Im' glad that I had seen all the films that this tries to spoof and the recreation of the sets for War of the Worlds is fantastic. Its so close to the original.".

Anna Faris Cindi as always is still on top form as is Regina Hall Brenda and together they deliver some fantastic comedy. If you're looking for a new original comedy perhaps this isn't for you.

This turned out to be an extremely funny movie which does an extremely good job at parodying movies such as Saw Saw II The Village The Grudge and War of the Worlds.This movie has a plot but it is all over the place. It starts off with Dr. Phil and Shaq chained in a bathroom for anyone thats seen Saw they cram the bathroom scenes into a 2 minutes. We then go to our hero from the first three Cindy Campbell Anna Faris who has taken a job looking after an old lady in an old mansion. She meets Tom Ryan Craig Bierko and they bond pretty quickly. A few days later the world is under attack by TrIpods. Cindy and an old friend Brenda Meeks Regina Hall go on a quest to try and defeat the aliens.As I said before I was VERY surprised by this movie. I found myself cracking up at most of the jokes some of which were very clever take offs. The acting is OK Leslie Nielson particularly funny as the whack President of America for this type of movie and we shall be expecting a fifth installment shortly. I would rank this second out of the series just under the first one.35.".

Meanwhile the teenager son Robbie and the young daughter Rachel of his next door neighbor and crane operator Tom Ryan Craig Bierko are spending the weekend with their loser father. Cindy and Tom meet and fall in love for each other but when Giant Tripods invade Earth Tom escapes with Robbie and Rachel Cindy travels to a village trying to find the answer to a riddle to save the world and the president of USA organizes the defense of the planet in UN under his intelligence and leadership.As I have previously wrote parody movies are always of the type 'love or hate' it. I am not intellectual I love cinema as culture but also as entertainment so I like this genre. Further when I see this type of movie I know exactly what I am going to see scatological jokes funny and surrealistic references to other films and definitely a movie that will never be indicated for an Oscar.I found this Scary Movie 4 also very funny. The screenplay is a big joke with the remake of War of the Worlds entwined with The Grudge and The Village. It also satirizes Saw and Saw 2 Brokeback Mountain and Million Dollar Baby. There are also references to the American pop culture that I unfortunately have not understood like for example Dr. Phil the Oprah talk show in the end see Obs. or Bruce the Bed King. Leslie Nielsen is hilarious in the role of the smart president.This is the type of movie that you must shut down your brain and start laughing. What I do not understand and really irritates me are the reviews of persons that should never watch this type of movie. What do they expect to see when they go to the movie theaters or buy  rent a DVD called Scary Movie 4 the last part of a trilogy directed by David Zucker and with Leslie Nielsen and Anna Farris in the cast? An art movie with hidden messages an epic a classic or a film with politically correct jokes? Honestly if I did not like this genre I would never spend my time watching it. My vote is seven.Title Brazil 'Todo Mundo em Pnico 4' 'Everybody in Panic 4'Obs My son has just forwarded Tom Cruise Freakin Out On Oprah in Youtube httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vM08PfuPNXs".

With a better throughline connecting all the stories than its predecessor Scary Movie 4 is a refreshing albeit rank addition to the series.

The sets and set design especially for The Grudge and Saw are flawless and even the costumes are perfectly fitted to the characters for each skit.The only bet they really missed was a zombie movie spoof when Brenda returns from the dead  The Ring curse killed her in Scary Movie 3  it's just glossed over.Despite too much scatological humor just a personal bias of mine Scary Movie 4 is a laughoutloud funny welldirected and wellacted comedy that's a perfect kickoff to the summer popcorn season. To say much more would spoil the surprises so all I'll say is If you like the Scary Movie franchise be sure and catch this one on the big screen.".

For this one the required viewing or basic knowledge of a movie that you need for this one is mainly Saw The Grudge The Village Million Dollar Baby and for me the best one War of the Worlds a movie that needed some fun poked at it. There is also something in there making a bit of fun of a movie pretty much you don't need to have seen are know all that much about...you will get it as long as you watch a bit of television. The War of the Worlds to me seems to be the main film parodied however the other films get their fair share of the jokes as well. The opening is rather funny with Shaq and Dr. Phil doing a Saw recreation and there are other celebrities who make short visits as well however it is still the same group who forms the core of the cast.

The Dubya scenes nicely done by Leslie Nielson were the highlights of the film for me. I'm not a fan of brainless comedy but this nonformula material made the film tolerable for me. SM4 spends a lot of time with The Village Saw and War of the Worlds  plus a couple of films I only vaguely recognized... blending the plots cleverly but without adding much to the comedic value in the blending technique. Brokeback Mountain is also parodied though I do not understand why this was considered a scary movie. The film is funny at times but browbeats its parody of Tom Cruise's character in War of the Worlds. Nevertheless it's a fun little romp and much less grotesque than some of the previous entries in the series. Acting  good for what it is. Directing  good for what it is. Script  OK but could have been more intellectually challenging and funnier Cinematography  good for what it is. Recommended for fans of the series but don't expect it to be the funniest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scary Movie 4 is a movie that had me laughing consistently the whole way through. It is a great comedy one that will surely make you nearly split your sides in laughter. However it is lacking in character development a consistent plot and an overall good storyline. In comparison with the 3rd which I absolutely loved it is about on par maybe even surpassing it. If you liked the 3rd you pretty much are guaranteed to like this one.We begin by being introduced to a Saw parody and then dive right into a Grudge parody immediately following which we are treated to a War of the Worlds parody. Not long after that the movie lampoons everything from Brokeback Mountain to the Village. Scary Movie 4 is rich with hilarious parody and comedy  I loved it. However the plot lines constantly overlap with one another  and there is a part at the beginning with Charlie Sheen that doesn't even make sense. I mean it doesn't even have a real reason to be there. As I mentioned there are many other flaws in the movie as well. The characters go through predictable lines and such never breaking out of the characters that they are parodying. Anna Faris once again plays the token woman who gets caught up in all this tragedy  in this movie she basically takes the place of Sarah Michelle Gellar in the Grudge part of the movie. Craig Bierko becomes Tom Cruise and Anthony Anderson becomes Heath Ledger or Jake Gyllenhall. The comedy in Scary Movie 4 is rich and rife with hilarious puns oneliners and so much slapstick you'll wonder how much more you can take until the writers throw one more clever spin on the idea. However as a good quality solid movie I have to admit that Scary Movie 4 fails miserably. I knew going into it that this was the case. I was not expecting satire on the level of Airplane! or character development on the level of SpiderMan 2. What I was expecting was a movie that consistently delivered solid belly laughs  In my book Scary Movie 4 deserves the trophy of the funniest movie of the year. Much of the humor is based on crudity or sexual antics though and Scary Movie 4 degrades itself with predictable uses of these.As a solid laugh giver I give Scary Movie 4 a 910. As a solid good quality movie I give it a 310. On the whole 710. If you choose to go see Scary Movie 4 whether it is now or on DVD do not attempt to analyze the death out of a movie whose sole purpose is to make you laugh. If you just sit back and enjoy it this movie will give you exactly that.".

Anna Farris sp? can be funny but she doesn't need to try very hard in this  there's not much for her to work with. It was interesting to see Dr. Phil willingly take selfdeprecating humor and Debra Wilson is a comedy goddess I miss her on MadTV but other than that the laughs ran so thin that sometimes it was hard to tell if they were making fun of other movies or just getting some more use out of leftover sets. I want my 9.50 back! This isn't even a popcorn I can just sit back and laugh movie. It is a total waste with in jokes casually mentioning myspace and lovely lady lumps but without any substance or even the faintest hint of a plot.".

Anna Farris sp? can be funny but she doesn't need to try very hard in this  there's not much for her to work with. It was interesting to see Dr. Phil willingly take selfdeprecating humor and Debra Wilson is a comedy goddess I miss her on MadTV but other than that the laughs ran so thin that sometimes it was hard to tell if they were making fun of other movies or just getting some more use out of leftover sets. I want my 9.50 back! This isn't even a popcorn I can just sit back and laugh movie. It is a total waste with in jokes casually mentioning myspace and lovely lady lumps but without any substance or even the faintest hint of a plot.";

I FEEL RIPPED OFF!!!!!!!!!!! This movie is most likely suited for children under 12 that think poop jokes are funny.12 were much more funny but I don't know what they did to this series they just made it more disgusting and retarded. My advice to you don't spend 8 dollars like me on this and wait for the DVD release.".

I've been watching the franchise since it began and I was indeed worried with where it was heading. These doubts began shortly after Scary Movie 3 and then multiplied after the disaster that was Date Movie. Needless to say I wasn't expecting to be wowed whenever I entered the theater but I have to say that I left pleasantly surprised. If you have seen any of the movies that are spoofed you're sure to chuckle throughout the movie. If you haven't seen any of the movies you'll probably laugh all the same. That alone makes it worth watching because it is something that anyone can enjoy. Unfortunately there are still some people in the world that absolutely DO NOT enjoy these types of movies. Those people either A. Take themselves WAAAAY too seriously or B. Have lost the ability to laughthe will to live. If you don't find yourself under either of those categories then I believe that you'll find Scary Movie 4 an enjoyable endeavor from the average mundane weighted down with heavy issues movies that peoples A and B call entertaining.".

I just went out to see this with a friend cause it's Friday night.With that out of the way I can say this movie was definitely enjoyable. It's not a down right riot it's not totally pathetic it's right in between. It was better than Date Movie by a long shot that's for sure.I would tell you what I thought of the story but I honestly wasn't paying attention. Something about a Japanese kid's dad's heart stopping aliens. I don't remember I was to busy watching and waiting for the next joke. The jokes indeed come fast and frequent some better than others obviously. My favorite scene of the whole thing was easily the final one with Oprah...that was just crazy. The Saw scenes were also quite enjoyable. Some of the jokes do fall flat on their face for instance the constant usage of a butt with all the aliens butt spouting lightning in the sky a butt sucking people into the tripod. Others however we're bust your gut funny. Jigsaw was probably the funniest character in the whole damn thing. I've never seen the Village so that part confused the hell out of me but I think I got the jist of it.Most of the jokes however were pretty unoriginal and predictable. You could easily tell when a joke was coming seconds before it happened and most of the time you could probably predict exactly what it was going to be. For example when the grudge kid begins crawling down those stairs in his creepy way you know he's going to fall down it. Low and behold he does. When Leslie Nielsen started talking to the UN about reversing the polarity of a laser that takes people out of their clothes you know he's going to take the clothes off the whole place. Bingo. It should be noted that before seeing the movie I hadn't seen the trailer or any of the TV spots my friend informed me afterword that both these scenes were shown in them.Leslie Nielsen by the way was hilarious in this. Sure his character has been done a thousand times but it worked fine for me. I too wanted to know what happened to the duck. However just about every single girl and a few guys screamed....when he lost his clothes...I almost did as well....that's....just.....shudder.All in all the movie is enjoyable. I recommend folks see it but it probably is one you can wait for on DVD. I only urge folks to not over analyse it it was a simple parody movie and nothing more.".

All these actors went on to fame but the whole movie the performances the writing were trashed.I thought the cinematography was exceptionally lovely. The Nothing Gold Can Stay sunrise scene was gorgeous. The camera angles during the hair cutting scenes were creative and intimate. The music was epic sounding yeah but this film had a huge tie in with Gone With The Wind remember. I thought the soft lighting and the creamy edging made the film look very much like IT was filmed in 1939!!!I don't know. I thought the chracters were very engaging and the performances excellent.

I thought the soft lighting and the creamy edging made the film look very much like IT was filmed in 1939!!!I don't know. I thought the chracters were very engaging and the performances excellent. Lots of people loved this film regular people like myself that is.";

I thought the acting was great and the plot was good for teenagers which is the movie's as well as the book's target audience. I was surprised on how many stars were in this movie seven and it was much better than I thought it would be. It didn't seem cheesy and small but you felt like you were watching a real film. Even though the Greasers seem to be born into undesirable lives watching this movie makes you want to go back to 1967 in the Southwest and be a Greaser too.

Set in a small town in 1963 Oklahoma two groups of teenagers from opposite sides of the tracks defend their turf and rival for girls. The Greasers are tired of being shownup by the Soashes who drive around in fancy cars and wear expensive clothes and when someone calls for a rumble both sides are in for the fight.The main plot line centers around two of the younger Greasers who are on the run after one of them kills a Soash even though it was clearly self defense. Later the boys are celebrated as heroes when they rescue children from a burning building. The dying words of the alleged killer sum up the entire story The fighting must stop there are better ways to communicate other than kill one another. The Stevie Wonder song Stay Gold is a nice finishing touch. I especially recommend this film for teenagers or young adults the message is a powerful one and it hasn't aged over the decades.".

It's got a good solid story beautiful photography convincing acting by the leading actors and a nice score.It's a starpacked film with appearances by Tom Cruise Rob Lowe Patrick Swayze among others. Not to mention it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola!    But I was most amazed by C. Thomas Howell's portrayal of Ponyboy Curtis the central character of the novel and film who did a great job carrying the story. There are many scenes in the film that are exactly like the book even following the same dialogue. Usually I don't think that's a good thing since I like to see someone else's interpretation another one's point of view instead of a copy of the book.  But Coppola masters everything beautifully anyway so it never gets boring and C. Thomas Howell's interpretation of his role is what makes the film stand on its own.Thanks to Howell there are many memorable Ponyboy moments. One of those is Ponyboy's recital of Robert Frost's 'Nothing Gold can stay' which is a scene that stays with you forever. Another actor who caught my attention in this film was Emilio Estevez who plays TwoBit Mathews friend of the Curtis brothers and a greaser. Estevez lights up every scene he's in and the film wouldn't be as great without him. There are only two things I don't like about the film The greasers are too wellgroomed and clean and the socs are a too onedimensional.".

I immediately became obsessed with it as all of my friends can tell you. I love the whole story of it. The friendships like Pony and Johnny and the relationship between Sodapop and Ponyboy as brothers. There were many touching scenes and the new version has many new and improved ones. My favorites include the scene when Soda runs away. I thought it was brilliantly acted and I'm very glad they put it back in the movie. Dally's death scene was also improved and is more dramatic now and the last scene when Pony is reading Johnny's letter always gets to me. The all star cast was a great asset to this film and I would recommend it to anyone in a heart beat.Jess".

It leaves such a bitter taste  especially for fans of the acclaimed YA novel I believe because it starts so well with Francis Ford Coppola's masterful staging of ensemble scenes and a seemingly unstoppable fast pace. It's unfortunately fitting that the film starts with bouncy rock and roll  with the song Gloria used to fantastic effect and then once the plot takes a turn for the dark it seems like Coppola has entrusted his direction with Carmine Coppola's unwieldy and manipulative music score. It's not all bad once you reach the third way point the scenes with the boys just talking in Ponyboys house really flow but Coppola rely's a lot on uncharacteristic framing devices like poorly placed jump cuts shifting aspect ratios fade ins and a whole lot of corn. While the dialog is corny during the whole movie it sticks out like a sore thumb for most of the movie while in the opening it kind of fades away with Coppola's playful direction. As far as the acting goes curiosity value makes some of it more bearable then it must have been when the movie was originally released. I shall go one by one.C.Thomas Howell Ponyboy Curtis Has a very limited range of expressions and actions though he was hot stuff for a maybe 3 more years suffice to say he is no longer hot stuff. Though he never really has to carry the film except during the sequences at the church where the movie falls apart.Matt Dillon Dallas While he is occasionally over the top he is an extremely commanding screen presence and the best actor in the film by far.Ralph Macchio Johnny Simply annoying he manages to make most of his dialog irritating.Patrick Swayze Darry Look tough take off shirt Say three word line repeat.

Unfourtunely Lowe who tries his best has about 30 seconds of screen time. His part is extremely cut down from the book.Tom Cruise Steve Simply insane.

Some of Dally's lines bothered me like at the movie theater when Johnny told him to stop harassing Cherry he said What'd you say to me you little sht what'd you say to me? I thought that was untrue to the book as no one spoke that way to Johnny because he was so sensitive. And also the line Fight it for Johnny. It just seemed weak to me.The only other things that really bothered me was the scene when Darry hit Ponyboy and the scene in which they Darry and Ponyboy are reunited in the hospital. When Darry hit Ponyboy Ponyboy got right up and ran away and immediately afterward Darry says I didn't mean to. There was no moment of shock at the action from both of them as described in the book. The hospital scene is very similar in my opinion. I saw very little awkwardness between Darry and Ponyboy I didn't see any hesitation in Ponyboy as he ran to greet him. Moments like these were pretty vital in the book.Overall it was a pretty good movie I just don't find it as great as other people do.".

You feel for the characters as they take you on an emotional rollercoaster. You laugh along with them and share in the anguish and feel the pain they all go through just to survive. It is hard not to watch the film now without comparing other films the cast have made since this film. But for many of the cast it is up there with the finest performances of their career.The film is an adaption of a classic novel by S.E.

	schema:reviewBody "I studied the 1967 novel The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton back in middle school. It has been years since then but it's a very powerful story and rather hard to forget! I was shown this movie a couple years later in my first high school English class. I can't remember exactly what I thought at the time I guess I thought it was soso but I have seen it twice since then and can't say it reached its full potential but overall it's still a reasonable adaptation.Ponyboy Curtis and Johnny Cade are two teenagers who are members of the greaser gang. Their rivals are the socs. One night Ponyboy and Johnny fall asleep in a vacant lot. When they wake up it is still dark and they are clueless as to what time it is. Ponyboy goes home where his eldest brother Darry who has looked after his two younger brothers Ponyboy and Sodapop since their parents' tragic death has been worrying about his absence. Darry ends up hitting Ponyboy and although he then says he didn't mean it Ponyboy runs away. Pony wakes up Johnny who is still in the lot and they go to the park. Unfortunately they are attacked by a group of Socs who nearly drown Ponyboy but Johnny comes to the rescue by killing one of them and causing the others to run off! To try and avoid arrest the two leave town after getting directions from fellow greaser Dallas Dally Winston who tells them to go to an abandoned church in Windrixville. What does the future hold for these two?! One problem with this movie is that some scenes seem a bit rushed such as the scene where Darry hits Ponyboy and he runs away. Also the acting isn't that great at least not from C. Thomas Howell who plays Ponyboy and Ralph Macchio who plays Johnny. Mainly for those two reasons some parts of the film are not as gripping as they should be. Fortunately this adaptation of The Outsiders also has its merits. It's a faithful adaptation it probably helped that S.E. Hinton was a consultant despite not including certain parts of the book which some would be disappointed by. It also includes at least some of the tension and poignancy from the book and gets more gripping towards the end.Overall Francis Ford Coppola and Kathleen Rowell did a good job bringing S.E. Hinton's highly acclaimed story to the motion picture format. Far from a perfect job but a good one nonetheless. For those who have been blown away by the book I wouldn't expect this movie to be all you could possibly hope for or else you could easily end up sorely disappointed. However if you watch the film with moderate expectations it will probably have a better chance of pleasing you at least to a certain extent.".

Perhaps the movie is better appreciated after one reads the book but I can't understand what so many people see in this film.I'd always heard about the allstar cast in this film but never got a chance to see it. Was it all Coppolla's fault that so many great actor's didn't shine in this film? Tom Cruise Emilio Estevez and Rob Lowe are all underused. Thankfully Patrick Swayze's terrible performance is kept to a minimum.The major problem I had with the performances is that most of them just didn't ring true as 50's era outsiders. These kids seemed to be what they were  1980's kids acting out 1950's caricatures while paradoxically trying to portray a human side to these characters.The Soc's are shown as being almost completely onedimensional except for a hearttoheart talk with PonyBoy where PonyBoy recognizes that the Soc is just another guy although he doesn't have many qualms about getting into a brawl with them later.Were we supposed to sympathize with Johnny for murder after he became a hero saving those kids from the fire Even though it was apparent that the kids could've saved themselves had the building not been completely boarded up? One moral of the movie seems to be that murder is okay as long as you kill a bully and later save some school kids.And the whole Greaser tough guy thing was laughable especially when followed by readings of Gone With The Wind and watching the sunset. I know that was supposed to be touching but I couldn't tell if I should cringe or laugh.I realize that all this criticism of the storyline will probably fall flat with those who have read the book. Still I believe that if the book is that good Coppolla could have been more selective with the story and made a more believable film out of it.If this is a movie that you have never gotten a chance to see and wondered what all the hoopla was about then watch it and you may still wonder.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read S.E Hintons The Outsiders in school and I loved it and then we were told we were going to watch the movie adaptation of the book. I found out it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola so obviously my expectations couldn't of been higher. Sadly the film turned out to be a huge disappointment.The films biggest problem is the acting the acting problem is almost universal throughout the cast and although some aren't as bad as others the ones that count are the ones that are the worst. The only lead actor that has some good moments is Matt Dillon who plays Dallas not to say that he doesn't have some bad parts too. The actors drag down scenes that are supposed to have an impact and I often found myself bursting out in laughter at how cringe worthy it gets in some scenes. Also when a character isn't well portrayed it isn't as easy to resonate with them or want to root for them when they are either being so wooden about everything or being completely over the top.The main reason why I had high expectations for this film was because of Francis Coppola who directed some of the best films ever made. Disappointingly he doesn't bring much to the film. What should be standout scenes just feel mundane and when something is added to a scene for impactfor example an overlay of a characters face on top of a scene whilst their narrating a letter they wrote just feel silly and out of place like they belong in a cheesy romance movie.In terms of comparison to the book I thought that the film also never really captured the themes presented in the book as well as it could of and the film is also lacking something that the made the book so captivating and that's Ponyboys thoughts throughout the story I felt that was a really important thing in the book without it you never really get to know the character as much. I'm aware that most voice over in films is incredibly cheesy and something as cheesy as that is the last thing this film needs it's just something that only adds to how inferior the film is to the book. I will say that the film is definitely faithful to the book and it still has the same story that the book has the problem is that the story is presented so poorly.Overall I wouldn't recommend this film at all. Perhaps if Copolla put more effort into the film or if the acting wasn't so mediocre the film would be fine. This isn't the case though. Key scenes that are supposed to be emotional are nearly impossible to take seriously the characters are so poorly portrayed that they're hard to sympathize with and the direction just lacks style and personality.".

Deep down is that solitude and a a sense of rejection what throws them together. Magnani as a blonde film extra that has Kim Novak as her model Tot as a pathetic old petty conman and Ben Gazzara as a young good looking and relatively inept thief will join forces at cross purposes in a film that is simultaneously outrageously funny and deeply moving. Anna Magnani had already won an Oscar for The Rose Tattoo and this was a return home and a a new chapter in her collaboration with her old friend Antonio De Curtis known as Tot.

	onyx:emotionText "New Year's Eve in Rome. Three lonely character who lie about their solitude to everyone even to themselves. Deep down is that solitude and a a sense of rejection what throws them together. Magnani as a blonde film extra that has Kim Novak as her model Tot as a pathetic old petty conman and Ben Gazzara as a young good looking and relatively inept thief will join forces at cross purposes in a film that is simultaneously outrageously funny and deeply moving. Anna Magnani had already won an Oscar for The Rose Tattoo and this was a return home and a a new chapter in her collaboration with her old friend Antonio De Curtis known as Tot. They are magic together and Mario Monicelli knows how to choreograph the sequences for this two amazing artists. The crowded scenes inside a Hotel Restaurant during the party leading to midnight and a new year are absolutely sensational. Not to be missed.";

However our heroine constantly seems to be messing up the best laid plans of our  two criminal friends.This film uses the timehonored technique of having the audience identify with some real sympathy with our characters but we must laugh as everything goes wrong with everyone's plans for both the New Year's eve celebration the robbery plans and life in general.I do not know if this film is on video or if any of the classic films with Toto are on video. However anyone who values great comedic filmmaking should make the effort to see this film. It simply does not get better than this.".

Monicelli's intricate story line is a rarity in the world of comedies. Intelligent entertaining and hilarious the film contains the only example on camera of what Anna Magnani and Toto' would do in Rome during the 1930's Avanspettacolo. The two sing on a small stage at one of Rome's fashionable parties all done with immense presence and class the result is a magnificent theatrical moment between improvisation and highly refined performing skills.

Ben Gazzara's con manthief is juicy and sexy enough to make any woman his accomplice willing or accidental and the tragiccomic tension between Ms. Magnani and the thief is pure comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "The film reveals how and why a supposedly revolutionary Italian girl has in fact fallen prey to bourgeois ideology. By this plot synopsis I was expecting a film where Godard and his friends in Maoism call into question the conceit of being a revolutionary from a safe distance in a complacent society.That's not quite so probably because at this point Godard saw no conceit in his chosen political milieu. It wouldn't be until a few years later in Ici et Ailleurs when he'd begin to reexamine that belief and his involvement in it.In Lotte in Italia it's not the conceit of being revolutionary from a safe distance that is analyzed but the problem of it the conundrum of how the two can be combined in one social position. In the first part of the film we see the girl trying to formulate or conform to the political rhetoric expected from a communist as capitalist society around her provides for her. In the second part the problem is outlined then Godard offers solutions thinking for example not in terms of food or clothes but the production of them not in terms of money but labour.What worries Godard here as with other films of the period what he's preoccupied with is deeply esoteric for communism. He simply devises in film ways to express the concerns of every other communist of the time. The liberation for him in this Maoist phase as it were is that he has a reason to keep making his art. He finds a cause not in some inner personal turmoil but in the greater turmoil of the world. As such I sense very little personal attachment no expression that comes from the soul.In my ongoing Godard quest what fascinates me the most is not any individual film but the struggle for expression being able to chart the creative ebbs and lows and the evolution of an artistic voice and does a chronicle unfold. Here I find a talented film mind working beneath his abilities operating under the assumption that he's lending those talents in the service of those important imminent changes in the world he presaged in Week End.The thing that intrigues me the most then is this sense of dichotomy I get from Godard between a feverish intellectual who places too much importance in cinema to completely abandon it and a satisfied bourgeois who really has little incentive to keep making it. At this point at least he had found a cause now I'm setting my eyes on the time when he abandoned it.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Overheard";
	schema:reviewBody "The key deal in the film is about information and how it is King and can be used as a tradable commodity from making money to saving lives. Everyone has a price especially when you're in possession of vital lifemaking or breaking juicy insider news from stock tips to who's banging who and MakChong had imbued their characters with shades of grey rather than the usual boring black and white type where on one hand you may not condone what they have done and yet on the other you would wonder if given the same set of circumstances whether you will succumb to temptation when the same opportunity presents itself. Which of course leads us to the perennial question of who watches the watchmen. It is always easy to say like the chief villain in the film played by Michael Wong that an organization is built upon honesty and integrity but face it it is a human face that's running the operations and with human failings and trappings there's the inherent potential that some hankypanky could be done behind the scenes. Cases of corporate scandals overseas and locally would already be a case in point and the story in Overheard pushes all the right buttons in gelling such material all together into one solid edge of your seat movie.Lau Cheng Wan fan here and good to see him back on the big screen! plays Johnny who heads an electronic eavesdropping oops I mean surveillance team with buddies and direct reports Gene Louis Koo and Max Daniel Wu. Together the trio is responsible for bugging the office of a conglomerate suspected of insider trading and shady businesses. As the story goes Gene and Max happen to exploit their newly gained knowledge for personal gain and unfortunately as supervisor with a sympathetic heart Johnny chooses to play along to protect his subordinates rather than to bust them wide open to their superiors.The film moves at breakneck speed and it also managed to provide that little bit of detail toward the personal lives of the main characters. With Gene his pressure comes from a critically ill son with insurmountable hospital bills to settle. Max on the other hand wants a personal fortune in order to stand up to his future wealthy fatherinlaw who looks down on him and his social stature. Johnny too is not squeaky clean morally too as he's having affair with his best friend Alex Fong and colleague's wife Mandy Zhang Jingchu. And in one key scene late in the film we see how deeply corrupt he can be through the shift of blame especially when required to save his own skin. So the stage is set for the devil to whisper inside their ears to take the bait and go for the kill participating in the insider trading and throwing away their moral authority as cops sworn to uphold the law.Which of course means even bigger lies created to cover original fibs and watching them sweat bucketloads each time things go awry and they have to do deeper down into the rabbit hole. It made me recall a saying my old principal gave one day at the school assembly that only the truth will set you free. In this case you'd wonder at which point the characters would decide to make a clean break and own up and therein lies part of the fun in watching the film getting equally frustrated with some of them as they go further down the slippery slope. The casting is something that deserves a mention as it's one of the chief ingredients in holding the movie together and engaging the audience's attention throughout. Lau Cheng Wan is evergreen and has so much charisma on screen that he could have been just sweeping the road for all that matter and still has this steely surety that with him at your side nothing could go wrong. His big brother role to the other younger actors in Daniel Wu and Louis Koo spoke volumes as it got translated down to the story playing the leader of the pack who decides to haul his flock out of trouble. And all three male leads were extremely believable as buddies who'd stick to one another through thick and thin and in one scene where they were congregating in a flat when Mandy returns was just about the best scene to demonstrate this camaraderie. The other scene which had me in chuckles also related to Lau was that stock market scene. Lau had propelled too fame through an old television series about stock broking as well and I thought that was a scene with a well placed insider homage to his roots.Cinematography was excellent as well with Hong Kong put under the romantic spotlight at times and one of my favourites involved a montage sequence which MakChong used to perfection in showing the drudgery monotony and cyclic fashion of a round the clock surveillance with fatigue and shift changes all rolled nicely into one. Some may take offense at the way the film ended but I thought it was quiet poetic justice and almost brought a tear in my eye considering how the villains will stop at nothing not even if you're a cop at ensuring those who take an illegal cut of their ill gotten gains will get dished some just desserts.While I would have placed this under the highly recommended watch list by virtue of this film being badly butchered at one point would mean that I would advise if you prefer your movies uncut to wait for the DVD which of course has the additional bonus of the original Cantonese language track as well. And this theatrical presentation here is just another case in point that for the same PG rating scenes of gore are more tolerated than a make out session in the office. Go figure.".

This spoiled the film. Someone having an affair with a colleague's wife another needs money because the son needs an operation and need even more when discovered he needs an operation too while the 3rd one need more money so that he don't need to depend on his rich future fatherinlaw. Then 2 other polices having a secret affair. A stock market scene with someone paying hard to her Lord. Then suddenly all went into further trouble just because someone recognized some's face and all towards the end a fairytale like ending that is unconvincingly unbelievable especially on the part of Lau Ching Wan Louis Koo and Micheal Wong. The overall cast acted well except for Micheal Wong his speech and actingas usualwas disgusting.I am very surprised an experienced reviewer could give it a 910.".

The plot while not really unique is executed well. The main focus of the story however is the trio of Lau ChingWan who plays the head of the 3 Louis Koo and Daniel Wu whose character development and the interaction among them makes the story interesting at all times. Their acting was great and realistic and the movie direction really brings out their best. Another screen presence that really makes an impact is Michael Wong who plays the part of a corrupt financial mogul really well. The combination of witty and brutal in his performance and dialogues are very well crafted and add a lot of depth to the movieWithout spoiling too much I would really recommend you try out this movie if you like the crimethriller genre and like movies with more to it than all the mediocre stuff that Hollywood has been mass producing for a while. Hong Kong really knows how to make great movies and this one's no exception".

Sadly it fails to live up to it's own aspirations and ends up defaulting on precisely what it needs to distance itself from.The story revolves around three members of a police surveillance squad conducting an investigation into a financial investment group involved in criminal fraud. The focus of the plot however is actually on the three officers themselves who stumble upon an opportunity to capitalize on the information they gathered during their surveillance. The audience is given insights into the personal issues they are grappling with the relationship between them and why the temptation to breach their moral duty and professional obligations is so powerful. The temptation they confront and the attendant reasons that compel them to succumb to it become the very device that turns them into the film's antagonists.Sadly the script then makes a wrong turn. Instead of allowing this plot to unfold it is shelved halfway through the film and becomes a sideplot to a criminal conspiracy involving murder kidnapping and revenge rendering the film from an interesting exploration into a runofthemill crimedrama action flick. None of the actors seemed particularly interested in their roles after that with perhaps the exception of Michael Wong who plays the head of the investment group with his usual steelcold glare and villainous flair. He actually makes an entertaining performance in the latter half of the film when he receives more screen time because no one else seemed nearly as excited to be involved in this project anymore.I don't know why the film's name was translated to English as Overheard since the electronic surveillance devices they used were also visual and not just audio. Perhaps something got lost in translation like the intention to produce a complex and interesting film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ghost of a Chance aka Once in a Blue Moon is a Japanese ghostly courtroom comedy. It's hardly great but there's not much to dislike about it.SPOILERS AHEAD!Eri Fukatsu stars as Emi Hosho an ambitious and hard working defense attorney trying to make a name for herself in her late father's shadow. Unfortunately she's not very good at her job as she continually bungles cases and fails to win acquittals for her clients. Her boss played by the ubiquitous Hiroshi Abe gives her one last chance to prove herself with a case no one else wants. Her task defending a murder suspect who claims he was held down by a ghostly presence at a haunted inn during the time of the crime he's accused of.This is a pretty straight forward comedy with some minor sub themes dealing with family and life  death. Eri Fukatsu is terrific as always as the plucky young attorney. She's effective and likable and this is a role for which she is well suited for. The rest of the cast is rounded out by a bunch of veteran Japanese actors and actresses and they all play their parts quite well.As the story unfolds Emi sets out to investigate her client's alibi and ends up spending the night at the same haunted inn as the suspect himself. She too receives a visit from the same ghost who haunted her client in the form of a grumpy 400 yr old samurai warrior who was betrayed by his clan. Instead of being overly frightened by a sword wielding ghostly presence Emi tries to convince this dead wandering warrior to testify in court on behalf of her client. He reluctantly agrees to do so in exchange for her clearing his good name and receiving a proper memorial to send him on to the afterlife.This plot is obviously quite ludicrous but that doesn't prevent the movie from being an enjoyable watch anyway. This is a comedy after all and the end product is satisfactorily entertaining. Emi and the Wandering Warrior quickly form a bond and understanding others belonging to the afterlife chip in along the way various scientific and supernatural methods are employed to convince the non believers and as a result the most fantastical murder trial in the history of Japan is underway. I found this movie to be quite enjoyable. I can't whole heartedly say that is a MUST SEE but it does work quite well overall. My biggest complaint as is the case with many Asian films is that it is simply too long there is no reason or excuse for this movie to clock in at 2.25 hours. They could have easily cut a few scenes here or there or deleted the mostly irrelevant boyfriendlive in actor sub plot in order to better streamline this flick into a more economical production. That being said written I do recommend it as a decent and worthwhile diversion!Hmmmm. I'm giving it 7 out of 10 stars. I probably would have rated it approx 6575 under a different format but here on IMDb it's either 6 or 7 so 7 it is IMO!".

Her client Goro Yabe KAN is accused of killing his wife Fuko Yuko Takeuchi but it's really a plot by Fuko's sister Suzuko to kill her sister and put the blame on Goro. Goro's only defense is that he couldn't move at the time of the murder because he was pinned by the samurai ghost at the hotel. Emi decides to check if the ghost really exists and heads for the hotel Shikabaneso. There she meets Rokubei Sarashina Toshiyuki Nishida who's a 400 year old ghost of the Hojo clan. She asks Rokubei to be the witness and Rokubei accepts. The problem is Rokubei can only be seen by a select group of people. These includes the court artist Tamaru Himura Sen Yamamoto the prosecutor Tooru Osano Kiichi Nakai the truck driver Isetani Zen Kajiwara and the call girl Ryoko Shinohara. Emi must figure out the common denominator between them to figure out why only they can see Rokubei. Then she needs to convince the judge and the prosecutor that Rokubei's testimonial is legitimate.Kiichi Nakai puts in a stellar performance as the prosecutor. His straight laced acting actually adds humor to the scenes. Toshiyuki Nishida and Eri Fukatsu also puts in good performance as the Witness and the lawyer. Zen Kajihara were really funny at the restaurant as the truck driver who can see the ghost.I think this movie is worth seeing for the performance of Kiichi Nakai alone. There are other funny scenes but the battle between the defense and the prosecution is the highlight of this movie. Osano knows that Rokubei is real but pretends that he doesn't know. He insists that a testimony by a ghost that is not proved by science cannot be accepted in the court of law.Good movie that's a delight to watch for all the funny scenes.".

Flanking them are Hiroshi Abe as the young defense lawyer's boss and Kiichi Nakai as the prosecutor very different in the nature of the characters equally brilliant portrayals. There are so many others that I can't possibly mention them all.I realize I haven't gone very much into the plot but this is a movie that really needs to be watched to be fully appreciated. Suffices to say that the main plot is on calling up the said dead samurai who is invisible to all but a few to be the main defense witness. Just imagine the possibilities.

	schema:reviewBody "When thinking back over the decades of British gangtser films The Long Good Friday stands out in memory. This is due to the way the story is executed and the way a certain degree of suspense is held throughout.Everything starts off well in this film. We're shown a rather perplexing confusing but well shot sequence involving several people and a couple of deaths over what seems to be a case of money. We hear nothing of these events until much later in the film keeping it at the back of our minds and creating a certain shock element when we eventually realise everything that's come together.After the dramatic introduction everything is toned down slightly as Harold Shand Hoskins the man of the film is introduced to a rather catchy theme tune. His world is also introduced to us through very good use of London iconography as we realise he's rich got plenty of friends and also has a good looking girl with his biggest problem seeming to be what nationality to make the chef for his next gettogether. With so many faces being introduced and so much pleasurable interaction the events that follow fuelled by great hate for Harold are rather shocking as they are surprising and that's what really kicks this film off on a good path.What's also good about the film as well as fascinating is that it takes a certain detective route. So many crime and gangster films often use a revenge plot or a hierarchy technique whereas this one the enemy is unknown and the hierarchy has already been climbed. He's on his own with two or three of his most trusted accomplices attempting to discover what the hell's going on and this is very interesting as we find out what they find out and at the same time as they do creating a nice steady plodding feeling of consistency.As the battles and discoveries occur whilst the film wears on numerous desperate situations are dragged out in a gritty and entertaining way such as Harold's relationship with his girl that is starting to fall apart amongst the terror and confusion the personal battle with the American businessmen who foil Harold on several occasions and the question marks that arise over loyalties within his own organisation as well as disagreements with his crooked policeman colleague and rival gangs. Not only are these scenes and plot points gripping amusing dialogue and good oneliners from Harold himself help move them along.As the film reaches its final third and Harold gets closer to the truth the film reminded me of the original 'Get Carter' when Jack realises who's behind it all. Our antihero gets more and more angry and each scene gets more and more intense culminating in pure chaos at a race car track and a monologue of insults at the American's who up to this point have had Harold and his outfit rolling over for them.With strong acting performances all round and an impressive well paced plot The Long Good Friday has managed to sneak into my personal favourites list and definitely withstands the test of time.".

Not only are these scenes and plot points gripping amusing dialogue and good oneliners from Harold himself help move them along.As the film reaches its final third and Harold gets closer to the truth the film reminded me of the original 'Get Carter' when Jack realises who's behind it all. Our antihero gets more and more angry and each scene gets more and more intense culminating in pure chaos at a race car track and a monologue of insults at the American's who up to this point have had Harold and his outfit rolling over for them.With strong acting performances all round and an impressive well paced plot The Long Good Friday has managed to sneak into my personal favourites list and definitely withstands the test of time.";

Her cool tough performance putting her in good stead for the 'Prime Suspect' mini series which followed in the early nineties in the UK where she played Lynda Le Plante's tough female detective Jane Tennyson.The usual seventies film actors who play crooks turn up in this film as do some fine character actors including Dave King who plays a bent copper on Hoskin's pay roll and Bryan Marshall as the crooked councillor. One of the most memorable of the support cast is Derek Thompson who would later go on to play Charlie Fairhead in BBC's long running 'Casualty' drama who takes the 'Introducing' credit.Also look out for the actor who played 'Denzel' in Only fools and Horses and a mute role for Pierce Brosnan before he went to the States to play Remington Steele.A fine film thats quick in pace and excellently directed by John McKenzie who will probably be always most remembered for this film.".

It is also very interesting to observe him as his grip upon his gangster empire on brink of creating a partnership across the Atlantic slips through his fingers because of a mistake.

	schema:headline " The 1980s begins with a bang";
	schema:reviewBody "WARNING  THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES THE ENDING OF THE FILM AT LENGTH.Portraying Britain at the dawn of Thatcherism The Long Good Friday presents its central character and itself like a spinning coin looking towards the future but always about to slip back into the past about to go one way or the other. Harold Shand Bob Hoskins tells nostalgic and emotional stories about his National Service which had been abolished for almost two decades when this film was made and how he began his career as a street urchin An hour earlier he had been proclaiming his glorious vision of 1980s Britain while  in a rather unsubtle piece of direction  framed by Tower Bridge. This world of opposites is expressed most clearly in Francis Monkman's zesty score blending traditional classical instruments with Moroderstyle synthpop. It is ultimately hubris the kind of overconfidence normally associated with '80s excess that delivers Shand helplessly into the maw of a truly monstrous enemy that had existed for decades.Not as complex as I've heard it made out admittedly the DVD age means I can zip straight to the exposition scenes without effort which helps The Long Good Friday is still a breathtakingly audacious film and one that at times runs a real risk of alienating its audience while still retaining mass appeal. It blends together elements of various crime subgenres it takes the criminalturnsdetective idea from Get Carter and marries it to the sickly sleazy decadence that Scarface would portray so unflinchingly three years later while the outlandish ostentatious tactics Shand employs to intimidate his enemies come straight from The Godfather. Harold Shand is essentially a Tony Montanastyle character someone not very bright who has gone from poor to rich very quickly and doesn't know what to do with his loot who thinks that money somehow equals invincibility. As his enemies continue to undermine his modernman fantasy he refers to himself as a businessman not a criminal he becomes steadily more delusional to the point where he eventually expresses an intent to wipe out the entire IRA. This is a selfevidently absurd statement that Shand takes totally seriously immediately before slashing his most trusted lieutenant's jugular with a broken bottle as Hoskins's incandescent performance charts the erosion of the character's veneer of sophistication. As the first two members of his gang are assassinated he asks himself who could make him and his associates a target a legitimate question in the circumstances but the emotional burst with which Hoskins delivers the sentiment suggests less a rational question and more a little child screaming that IT'S NOT FAIR!.Now the IRA.

Keeping this question unanswered for so long rather than giving hints occasionally requires a predictably huge scene of exposition which is totally subverted when it turns out that Shand hasn't actually done anything at all. The IRA mistakenly believe he is responsible for the murder of some of their agents and once fanatics get an idea in their heads that idea stays there. I can't think of another film that has its central premise turn to fairydust so spectacularly  not even The Maltese Falcon. This I think is where it risks losing its audience because everything turns out to be so pointless. Is that dramatically satisfying? In the event yes because rather than going into hiding like Michael Corleone in the first Godfather Shand's feathers get ruffled even more and the irony apparently lost on him he kills two IRA agents for real and is tracked down and captured within minutes.

	onyx:emotionText "WARNING  THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES THE ENDING OF THE FILM AT LENGTH.Portraying Britain at the dawn of Thatcherism The Long Good Friday presents its central character and itself like a spinning coin looking towards the future but always about to slip back into the past about to go one way or the other. Harold Shand Bob Hoskins tells nostalgic and emotional stories about his National Service which had been abolished for almost two decades when this film was made and how he began his career as a street urchin An hour earlier he had been proclaiming his glorious vision of 1980s Britain while  in a rather unsubtle piece of direction  framed by Tower Bridge. This world of opposites is expressed most clearly in Francis Monkman's zesty score blending traditional classical instruments with Moroderstyle synthpop. It is ultimately hubris the kind of overconfidence normally associated with '80s excess that delivers Shand helplessly into the maw of a truly monstrous enemy that had existed for decades.Not as complex as I've heard it made out admittedly the DVD age means I can zip straight to the exposition scenes without effort which helps The Long Good Friday is still a breathtakingly audacious film and one that at times runs a real risk of alienating its audience while still retaining mass appeal. It blends together elements of various crime subgenres it takes the criminalturnsdetective idea from Get Carter and marries it to the sickly sleazy decadence that Scarface would portray so unflinchingly three years later while the outlandish ostentatious tactics Shand employs to intimidate his enemies come straight from The Godfather. Harold Shand is essentially a Tony Montanastyle character someone not very bright who has gone from poor to rich very quickly and doesn't know what to do with his loot who thinks that money somehow equals invincibility. As his enemies continue to undermine his modernman fantasy he refers to himself as a businessman not a criminal he becomes steadily more delusional to the point where he eventually expresses an intent to wipe out the entire IRA. This is a selfevidently absurd statement that Shand takes totally seriously immediately before slashing his most trusted lieutenant's jugular with a broken bottle as Hoskins's incandescent performance charts the erosion of the character's veneer of sophistication. As the first two members of his gang are assassinated he asks himself who could make him and his associates a target a legitimate question in the circumstances but the emotional burst with which Hoskins delivers the sentiment suggests less a rational question and more a little child screaming that IT'S NOT FAIR!.Now the IRA.

Trouble is that going international requires as much political savvy as it does financial something Harold Hoskins just doesn't understand.That wordlessly disjointed opening sequence is somewhat offputting.

It's a subtle masterpiece of suppressed emotion that keeps threatening to disrupt the big plans. Then too you can't help wondering what the little Napoleon is thinking during those wordless final minutes of run time. That too is like nothing I've seen and was someone's special inspiration.

	schema:reviewBody "The Long Good Friday is about a London crime boss Harold Shand Bob Hoskins who on the brink of his greatest triumph runs into a series of hostile actions by unknown enemies which bring down his enterprise and at the end seem likely to cost him his life. The story is brilliantly laid out and told with considerable cinematic skill. But its outstanding feature is the acting both by Hoskins and by Helen Mirren as Victoria Shand's consort and collaborator. Hoskins has always been able to express suppressed rage capable of being released into earthshaking violence better than any other actor of recent times. Shand on the verge of becoming a respectable businessman leaving behind his gangster past is preparing to enter into an agreement with leaders of the New Jersey mafia when things suddenly come apart. One member of his gang a homosexual is murdered at a swimming pool when he makes overtures to a beautiful young man played by an unknown Pierce Brosnan. Another member of his mob dies when the vehicle in which he has driven Shand's mother to church for Good Friday services blows up. Then an unexploded bomb is found in one of his casinos. And shortly afterwards a luxurious pub he has bought and renovated is destroyed in a ball of flame as Shand himself drives toward with his prospective Mafia partners at his side. Through all of this as Shand seethes and occasionally explodes the beautiful Victoria is by his side as a calming and rational influence. I won't spoil the story by telling any more  only that Shand and Victoria become more like themselves as the plot hurtles towards its conclusion. Viewers have no doubt seen Hoskins in this kind of role before or since The Long Good Friday but  as far as I know  they've never seen Helen Mirren in anything like the role she plays here. And yes despite her disclaimers she really was a young beauty at the time this film was made.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Gangster film is certainly a genre that has brought forth more than a few great films and John MacKenzie's breathtaking British Gangland Thriller The Long Good Friday 1980 must be one of the grittiest exciting most outstandingly acted and greatest specimen of alltime. In one of the most charismatic criminal performances ever the great Bob Hoskins plays Harold Shand a rich and powerful London crime boss who is about to make a lucrative deal with the American mafia when he and his associates are suddenly victims to brutal attacks by phantom enemies starting on Good Friday. Harold is desperate to find out who is behind the mysterious and bloody attacks and take action without scaring away his new business partners.The Long Good Friday has everything one might wish for in a Gangland thriller and more. Bob Hoskins delivers one of the most charismatic performances I have ever seen in the role of gangster Harold Shand. Harold isn't the typical laid back mob boss  la Don Corleone but a former poor Cockney kid who fought his way to the top an irascible bulldog always ready to explode into uncontrolled violent outbursts. And while he is certainly a very dark protagonist one can't help but have some sympathy for the tough guy with the mean Cockney accent. Equally great is Helen Mirren in the role of Harold's smart and efficient wife Victoria. Mirren's Victoria is more than your usual gun moll ravishing and sexy cunning and utterly supportive of her husband's businesses Victoria is both Harold's lover and dearest associate. There is no doubt that Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren are two of Britain's finest actors and their performances here are utterly brilliant. In spite of the fact that Hoskins' Harold Shand must be one of the most charismatic Gangster characters in motion picture history the film unlike many mafiagangster films does never glorify gangsterism. On the contrary it shows gangland life at its ugliest.The film is extremely violent at times and the violent outbursts are always unrestrained and ugly uncompromising and sometimes painful to look at. The entire film is uncompromising from start to finish an incredibly gritty and probably very realistic experience which simply cannot be missed by a lover of cult cinema. Hoskins and Mirren alone are pure brilliance and the cast includes many other notable appearances. P.H. Moriarty shines as Harold's scarylooking righthand man 'Razors' Eddie Constantine plays an American mob boss and the young Pierce Brosnan appears as a silent Irish hitman. The film is greatly photographed in London locations and Francis Monkman's brilliant score is incredibly imposing and unforgettable.The film has been advertised as 'the toughest gangster movie ever made' quote on the German DVD cover which I cannot say it is this title would doubtlessly go to either one of the many Italian 70s gangster flicks or to one of the countless brutal Japanese Yakuza films. However The Long Good Friday is a truly gritty and toughminded one and one of the best there is. The Long Good Friday is a Gangster film as they should be gritty violent and uncompromising incredibly stylish without being glorifying brutal and sometimes disturbing a masterpiece. At the moment they are making an American remake which of course is going to be total crap. This original British classic is nothing short of brilliance and has to be seen by everyone interested in gritty cinema.".

This was at a time when the Irish troubles were reaching new and terrifying heights and here in this film the government sensed a fall out that could have sent wrong message shock waves across the British Isles. This is one of the chief reasons that lifts The Long Good Friday high above many of its contemporaries it may be a simple story but it's not merely about two gangs striving for power on one manor!.Barrie Keeffe's script positively bristles with a hard bastard edge some of the set pieces play out as true Brirtish greats once viewed they are not to be forgotten.

Hoskins is on fire seemingly revelling in the role and fusing menace with a genuine sense of earthiness one moment Harold is the bloke you want to have a pint of beer with the next he's one step from rage induced retribution. Helen Mirren is fabulous as Harold's wife Victoria loyal and unerringly calm in the face of the madness unfolding the supporting cast are also highly effective with a cameo from Pierce Brosnan that is icy cold in making its point.Perhaps now it feels like The Long Good Friday is only of its time and it may well be that it's only British viewers of a certain age that can readily embrace the all encompassing thread of gangland London at risk from insurgents. But i'll be damned if i ever choose to love this film less with each passing year because to me it only just stops shy of being a British masterpiece bristling with realism at a troubled time and cheesing off Margaret Thatcher in the process hell it works for me always. 910".

I rest my case in point regarding the silly 60s. This IMDb was written on a Friday a long hot sweltering one wait a minute there's a knock on the door! Oh hello Harold! Long time no see.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film opens with several disjointed scenes that leaves the viewer a little breathless and confused A chauffeur murdered in his car two men counting cash in a suitcase who are subsequently murdered a man being knifed in a swimming club and a car bomb exploding outside of a church. We are able to catch up as the story slowly reveals itself but this one does require some viewer participation. While a very intelligent and well scripted film the action is intense the body count high and the violence more graphic than is usual for a British film of its era.The central character in this crime drama is Harold Shand a highly successful East End gangster who has just returned to London after a business trip to the U.S. Upon his return he finds his mob under attack several of his employees killed and his organization the target of an unknown foe. Meanwhile he's trying to put together a semilegit real estate deal with American Mafia participation. Harold has to keep his American friends from getting nervous with an all out war going on and get to the bottom of whatever has gone wrong while he was away.Harold is aided in all of this by the classiest moll ever Victoria. She's beautiful educated wellmannered and high class she brags that she went to school with Princess Anne. Her cool as ice exterior is quit the contrast to the crude thug Harold who fancies himself a businessman and hobnobs with politicians and legitimate entrepreneurs but is really only a tough Cockney hood or 'ood as they say. Victoria tries to handle the Americans while Harold and his mob round up the usual suspects in an attempt to find out where the heat is coming from. Harold is at once a ruthless brute and a lovable and vulnerable little man and by the end of the movie it's easy to find yourself falling for him. He actually has real affection for his crew and treats them as family. This may leave him exposed as like most movie gangsters his arrogance and belief in his own invincibility are what will bring him down.Bob Hoskins in his first starring role plays Harold in a performance that conjures up images of other little big men of the silver screen like Edward G. Robinson or James Cagney in some of their great gangster roles. While not as well known as his award winning role in the under appreciated Mona Lisa it is the one that put Hoskins on the map. Victoria is played by Helen Mirren and it's hard to take your eye off of her in all of her scenes. Helen was a very good looking girl in her day and was already an established star having survived her role in Caligula. Eddie Constantine Europe's favorite American plays the American mafioso and a young Pierce Brosnan in his first movie plays an IRA killer. The plot is a bit complex with a lot of characters to keep track of and the almost incomprehensible Cockney accents and slang are hard to follow subtitles are helpful for nonBrits. But the story moves along smartly the direction is very good and the lighting and photography excellent. This film is well done from its start to its memorable conclusion and is highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Underworld thriller bordering on espionage";
	schema:reviewBody "As Britain enters the Thatcher era Harold Shand London's most powerful criminal businessman is on the verge of turning his underworldempire into a legitimate corporation. As much as being a metaphor for the era Harold is a genuinely believable force to be reckoned with having Scotland Yard Detectives and London Councillors deep in his pockets as well as influential members of society and his 'firm' of gangland henchmen forming his innercircle. Played with complete conviction by the wonderful Bob Hoskins as Harold supported by the great Helen Mirren as his upperclass wife Victoria The Long Good Friday is a first rate underworldset movie which edges to the boundary of espionage thriller. It has a narrative which reaches far beyond the excellent Get Carter which preceded it and Mona Lisa which came after it two powerful bench mark films which focused solely on the underworld. The LGF has two distinct subplots running side by side which have dire consequences for Harold both of which are directly linked to his growing power. Directed seamlessly it is only a matter of time before the two threads come together somewhere before the film's middle and then Harold goes about dealing with the 'problem' the only way he knows how with unshakable belief in himself and in his abilities.

	onyx:emotionText "As Britain enters the Thatcher era Harold Shand London's most powerful criminal businessman is on the verge of turning his underworldempire into a legitimate corporation. As much as being a metaphor for the era Harold is a genuinely believable force to be reckoned with having Scotland Yard Detectives and London Councillors deep in his pockets as well as influential members of society and his 'firm' of gangland henchmen forming his innercircle. Played with complete conviction by the wonderful Bob Hoskins as Harold supported by the great Helen Mirren as his upperclass wife Victoria The Long Good Friday is a first rate underworldset movie which edges to the boundary of espionage thriller. It has a narrative which reaches far beyond the excellent Get Carter which preceded it and Mona Lisa which came after it two powerful bench mark films which focused solely on the underworld. The LGF has two distinct subplots running side by side which have dire consequences for Harold both of which are directly linked to his growing power. Directed seamlessly it is only a matter of time before the two threads come together somewhere before the film's middle and then Harold goes about dealing with the 'problem' the only way he knows how with unshakable belief in himself and in his abilities. If the movie poses any question for thought then it must be one which concerns the debate over brute force Vs ideology.Spoiler Alert!

In 1957 a ragtag shoeless poor group of kids from Monterrey Mexico shocked the world by winning 13 games in a row and the Little League World Series in the only perfect game ever pitched in the Championship. These kids led by their priest and a downandout former major leaguer embark on a journey through the southern US and up into Williamsport PA for the Championship game. They encountered many adversities including nearly being deported and the bigotry that wouldn't allow them into certain restaurants or travel on certain buses. They never lost their faith and eventually captured the hearts of both nations. This is a heartwarming inspirational story in the tradition of Rudy Hoosiers Coach Carter or Friday Night Lights.";

It is indeed based on a true story but the fictional elements are so heavy and full of stereotypes that they become a burden for the viewer and for the movie itself. The odd thing about it all is that some of the things that seem the most incredible are true. Yet still a key character in the story a Gringo is left out of it. Why?Here come the spoilers.Something true. The basic line of the story is true. The 13 straight games won by the kids from Monterrey. The perfect game pitched by ngel Macas I watched him play as an outfielder for Poza Rica 7 years later some key plays. Things that may ring as an exaggeration are also true. Coach Csar Faz had been a batboy for the St.Louis Browns the kids did cross the US Mexico line walking in their baseball uniformsit was a bridge though they ran against some racist behavior there was an attempt to deport them in Biloxi as their visas had expired they were given discounts and even a free meal in local restaurants as their legend grew they ran out of money and depended on a fund raising effort in Monterrey the uniforms they were offered for the final game were way too big for them most of them were working class kids and even the relationship between coach Csar Faz and Mara is true. The little players did meet President Eisenhower and the Brooklyn Dodgers. This was more than enough to make a sound film.Something false. You don't make a baseball team in four weeks. The Liga Pequea Industrial had been set four years prior to the championship. It was a proper Little League with a proper field and stadium and they of course knew what a baseball looked like. The team had been playing together so long that they wore in 1957 the same uniform they had used in 1956 when they beat other leagues in Monterrey. Monterrey was an industrial city of half a million people not a semirural town with a steel mill in the middle of nowhere and baseball was the main sport played over there in 1957 it had a strong team in the Mexican Baseball League but not a first division soccer team. Csar Faz was a USborn after being deemed too short for MLB decided to make a career as a manager. He coached Nuevo Len State team to the National finals the year before and was hired nominally as a worker in FAMA machinery factory to take the 12 year olds to the World Championship. There were 14 players not 9 and there was no priest with them even though it is said that they were religious children. And at their arrival from the US they were received by thousands of admirers both in Mexico City and in Monterrey. Something missing. One of the key men behind the Mexican kids' victory was an American Harold Lucky Haskins a former warhero who helped fund with his personal money the Liga Pequea Industrial the workingclass Little League where the champions came from. It was Haskins who gave them gloves bats and uniforms it was him who intervened to clear the visa problem for the children. It was him the manager of FAMA machinery factory who paid Faz. Why is he left out? Probably because he was a bigamist not good for a religion oriented movie or probably because his intervention would prevent a couple of Hollywood clichs from appearing. Anyway I felt it was an injustice done to a good man.".

	schema:headline " They've never seen real grassThe Perfect Game";
	schema:reviewBody "The film The Perfect Game is a great story of the underdog defeating adversity at home and in public. This young team of Mexicans band together against all odds to form a Little League team in Monterey to be entered into the 1957 competition against the powerhouses of 12year old baseball Americans. Not only must they overcome a novice at best skill at the gamehelped enormously by their exMajor League towel boy turned coachbut also the bigotry and racism of a segregated America not yet ready to see foreigners from below the southern border hand their precious kids a lesson in humility. Standing on its own the story is quite the tale and intriguing at every turn. However this is not a book it is a visual medium and in that respect doesn't live up to the quality of its plot. A madeforTV movie at best this film is very heavyhanded and way too feelgood for anyone with a brain hoping to find something that may stimulate a cell up there in his skull. Laughable in its saccharine drenched contrivances and score's orchestral swells just begging to elicit sentimental tears the Lifetime movie of the week quality definitely distracted this viewer one who was intent on learning a story and seeing it all play out not just to watch closeups of pouting boys and cheesy smiles.Don't get me wrong people looking for the uplifting story of success when no one gave them a chance will be very pleased. The amount of applause DURING the screening proves that point as viewers definitely get invested in these types of tales. For me however I need a little more some real stakes that at times showed facethe coach's drunken misstep that risks deporting them all due to expired visasbut mostly just bridge us to the next heartfelt moment. Stereotypes and clichs abound leading me to tell you all to make sure you check your mind at the door it will not be needed. I don't want to fault any of the acting except of course Emilie de Ravin's atrocious accent that made me want to wring her neck because it isn't bad considering the script and material. Clifton Collins Jr. is a favorite of mine and while at times is very out of his element playing off of a troupe of children brings some of his standard brood and contemplative thinking. Used to playing psychotics whether extreme as in Rules of Attraction or introverted as in Capote casting him as the coach finding his heart again is a bold choice. For the most part it is a gamble that pays off.As for the rest of the cast I was completely thrown off by the amount of familiar faces being that I truly had not even heard of the film before being given the preview pass. Stalwarts like Bruce McGill John Cothran Jr. Frances Fisher and Chris Mulkey all make appearances alongside Louis Gossett Jr. talk about a blast from the past. Even David Koechner reins in his annoyance for a decent cameo that brings a couple laughs. However the kids definitely become the heart of the tale. Headshaking for the fact that Heroes star Hayden Panettiere's younger brother Jansen is playing a Mexican aside the kids are very cute and fun to spend time with. You have your common traits for each to overcome and be friends despite of them as well as the fatherson dynamic needed to bring the heavy emotion. Unfortunately the chasm between Papa Macias and his last living son is so huge and so front and center the inevitable reconciliation is so obvious that it loses all impact it might have had.A warning must be said as well concerning the makeup of the film. Yes there are many montages and time lapses to save time however you experience a ton of baseball. Whether an inning or abridged games in their entirety director William Dear shows a little piece of each stop to the championship. The cuts are quick and often so I wouldn't be surprised if much of the actual baseball action was faked but they do their job to portray what was being done. A family film from start to finish I was the least bit surprised to find that Dear also helmed Angels in the Outfield. More lifeaffirming tale then sports flick don't be afraid to take your young ones to a movie even though it stars Cheech Marin. Long gone are his Cheech and Chong days playing the priest that starts the seed of baseball in the small Mexican town Marin brings some subtle chuckles but mostly plays the rock opposite Collins Jr.'s conflicted hero. Never surprising at any moment The Perfect Game may not be brilliance at the movies but for what it is you could do much worse than partake in a courageous true story while sitting through the candycoated exuberance of it all.".

This is especially true now since baseball has moved from becoming a wonderful and meaningful sport to a business and profit making venture. The movie will serve has a true motivator for kids and will inspire all viewers alike. Based a a true story the movie truly shows how a poor group of Mexican kids went from being no bodies to a team that changed a county and the city of Monterrey Mexico. Having played on the team that Angel Macias Barba threw the perfect game against I can truly say how unique the story is how it still affects both teams to this day and what it meant to each one of the Monterrey team members. Both the La Mesa and Monterrey teams have been privileged to see the movie and read the book. We all can attest to the hard work that William Winocur put into both the book and movie script.He definitely brought the four years of research writing and movie work to life. Compared to most of what Liongate is now releasing this would be a fun inspiringwholesome family and clean movie for all.It's time for something really worth seeing and walking away from with a sense a appreciation.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you liked movies like The Blind Side Hoosiers or League of Their Own then you will like this movie. Quick description this movie is a based on the true story of a little league baseball team from Monterey Mexico that came to the USA to play in the little league tournament. The movie is set in 1957 when prejudice was healthy in America. I am pleased to say that they did not overdo the part of the struggle. These boys were underdogs in every sense of the definition they were poor smaller and foreign. This is a powerful beautiful movie of the power of children's love for the game and their desire to overcome obstacles. I do not want to give too much of the story away but I will touch on a few points. The movies color lighting and sets are very well done for a very low budget film which is not easy to recreate 1957 Mexico and America. I really liked the actors and their roles Cheech Marin put a nice zip in being a priest and Clifton Collins is a great little known actor as the coach. There were a lot of great actors in smaller parts David Koechner Frances Fisher Emilie DeRavin John Cothran Tracy Walter and it was really nice to see Louis Gossett Jr again. I was a little disappointed that the child actors were not Mexican decent mainly because the accents were way off. Other than that there were only minimal complaints of over acting clichs and tempo that did NOT rob from the spirit of the movie. Fantastic movie that is more than a movie for anyone who has ever been an underdog.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to the movies last night and I saw the preview for this film. I have heard about this story all my life and I am glad someone is making a modern version of it. There is an much older Mexican film version but it doesn't get much airtime. But I must say that I was Appalled by what I saw in the preview.First of all let me say that I am sucker for a good underdog sports story. I come form a region where baseball is the top sport as opposed to soccer which is king in most of Mexico. One of our native sons is Fernando Valenzuela who helped the Dodgers win the 1981 World Series. Among my favorites I can name Major League Hoosiers Glory Road and the great German film Das Wunder Von Bern. But I am also a stickler for accuracy.The film portrays the players as coming from an impoverished background which is true. However My jaw fell to the floor when I saw Monterrey depicted as a twoburro village where the children played ball in the dirt choked streets with pigs and chickens serving as bases. I went to college in Monterrey and I lived there for four and a half years. Monterrey has been one of the leading industrial centers and largest cities in Mexico for over 100 years well within the time frame of this story. An impoverished URBAN setting would have been more appropriate.The scene that showed the players crossing into Texas from Mexico at a nearlyforgotten outinthemiddleofnowhere border crossing also made me gag. As anyone with basic elementary school geographical knowledge would know there is a big river smack in between Texas and its neighboring Mexican States. It is called the Rio Grande which coincidentally means big river in Spanish. There are a great number of automotive pedestrian and rail bridges spanning this river.The scenes in Texas seem to be something that would have take place in the 1940's rather than the 1950's. Texas was still very rural in the 50's granted but the clothing styles and hairdo's on the women seem a decade out of place. There was plenty of bigotry in Texas at the time and that seemed well depicted.I normally do not take offense when my country is misrepresented like this in a film mainly because some people just can't help being ignorant. I do admit that there are severe poverty issues here and yes there are still many places that don't have pavement. But... COME ON!!!! Do your research!!!! Does anyone remember Ross Perot's claim that a Mexican's biggest ambition in life was to own an outhouse? Yours Truly Arturo Wagner Navojoa Sonora Mexico".

	schema:headline " A Wonderful Family Film";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie with a church group recently and I found it to be a really great family friendly movie.The film chronicles the story of a Little League team from Monterrey Mexico in the 1950's that improbably makes it to the Little League World Series and plays against teams from the United States. It features a strong faith component is rated PG and is very family oriented and kid friendly. One of the especially good aspects of the film is its strong promotion of equal rights as the film does a good job presenting topics of race and racism in a constructive way. This movie is a great film to introduce your children to this tough topic especially if your family is white. The movie provides ample opportunity for discussion about topics such as the history of segregation and the treatment of immigrants and people of color and introduces those topics in a way that is at one and the same time poignant and yet also kid friendly.I found the film to also be well made from the standpoint of filmmaking itselfthe script plot acting and cinematography are all very well done. All in all I find this movie to be top notch and as such I've given it 810 starsmy goto designation for a film that is well made and enjoyable but just a shade below the near perfect scores of 9 or 10 that I tend to reserve for my all time favorites. Despite it not quite meeting that criteria it's nevertheless a wonderful movie that the whole family is sure to enjoy. And if nothing else it's funny to see Cheech Marin play the role of a Catholic priest for two hours!".

	schema:headline " Great Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "In this film William Dear brings the miraculous heartwarming story of a team from Monterrey and their journey through the country as they take on the Little League in the U.S.The film begins when Cesar Faz Clifton Collins Jr. is fired from his job with the St. Louis Cardinals where he worked as a clubhouse attendant. He then moves to Monterrey and there he meets a young baseballloving boy named Angel Macias Jake T. Austin. He takes Angel under his wing more or less and Angel rounds up his friends to help make a baseball field in an empty lot. They are persistent with trying to join the Little League and with the blessing of Father Esteban Cheech Marin they start their own team with Cesar Faz as their coach. The team consisted of Angel Macias Enrique Suarez Jansen Panettiere Mario Ontiveros Moises Arias Norberto Villarreal Ryan Ochoa Baltazar Charles Carlos Padilla Ricardo Trevino Gabriel Morales Jose 'Pepe' Maiz Alfredo Rodriguez Gerardo Gonzalez Mario Quinonez Jr. and Fidel Ruiz Anthony Quinonez. They were given threeday visas to play in Texas Cesar had planned on playing then sight seeing and going home he did not expect them to win and continue to play games. While they are in the U.S. they find a lot of racism and are seen as the underdogs. The scrawny team from Monterrey shocks everyone by moving up each game and becoming unstoppable. Along their journey they become friends with a sports reporter Frankie Emilie de Ravin and groundskeeper Cool Papa Bell Louis Gossett Jr. who help them in any way they can. The team goes on to play in the World Series where Enrique Suarez hits a grand slam and Angel Macias pitches a perfect game which still remains the only to be the only one pitched in a World Series Little League Championship game. The story of these boys made for a great film. I really liked this movie because it made sense to me even though I don't know much about baseball. It was a family movie and I could see myself watching it again with my girlfriend and my family because it's heartwarming. The team is Mexican and the director was able to capture that without making them too stereotypical. It was inspiring to watch those little boys go so far with their team and stay modest through it all. They all had strong faith and I liked that they needed a blessing before each game it was something that I could relate too since I do the sign of the cross before I step in to play. I was surprised to have liked it as much as I did because baseball movies usually don't interest me but this one really stands out to me. I'm not sure if it's because of the setting or the funny scenes where they overcome racism and language barriers but I really enjoyed this movie. It still amazes me how these kids had never seen a real baseball in the beginning of the movie and had only listened to games on the radio and they went on to accomplish so much. I would definitely recommend this movie to my family and some of my cousins because I know they'd like it too. It has a great story behind it and the team really is inspiring regardless if you like baseball or not.".

His nuances of effect and strength of personality are superbly matched to this role.  You can almost taste the turmoil roiling within him as you watch the splendid emotional battle waged on his wonderfully expressive face.  Walt Disney once said First you begin with a story.  It is true.  The story here is classic.  A man searching the world for the key he holds within his own heart.  Preston Foster so disillusioned in his flight from poverty that he fails to see the significance of events around him Flavius as the boy grown to manhood touched by a higher calling and Basil Rathbone as Pontius Pilate probably the second most reviled figure living at that time.

Acting honors however go to marvelous Basil Rathbone who gives a most sophisticated performance as Pontius Pilate by turns rogue fate's victim  moral philosopher.Movie mavens should recognize Ward Bond as a boastful gladiator elderly Zeffie Tilbury as a soothsayer Edward Van Sloan as Pilate's clerk  Edwin Maxwell as a Pompeii official all uncredited.The film makes rather a mishmash of historical chronology.

	schema:headline " A Very UnderAppreciated Film";
	schema:reviewBody "The Last Days of Pompeii was a film that captivated me during childhood and still intrigues me today albeit on a different level. As viewers' comments have noted Last Days is a little heavy handed with its moral theme and the character development of Marcus the Blacksmithturned Gladiatorturned head of the Arena. Marcus Preston Foster is an innately good man blessed with a loving wife baby son and a career until an outofcontrol chariot shatters his existence. With his wife Gloria Shea nearing death Marcus must turn to the Arena against his earlier values now faced with the reality that money is the key to everything. Marcus becomes a killing machine progressing up the gladiator billing to the top spot but then adopts the son Flavius David Holt of a slain adversary resulting in another change. Acquiring a Greek slave Wyrley Birch to tutor his son Marcus eventually heads for the Holy Land to make his fortune meets Pontius Pilate Basil Rathbone and encounters Christ. Pilate uses Marcus in a symbiotic way that benefits them both but it is the Lord who heals Holt when he lies near death. Marcus turns his back on the Lord despite the protests of Simon Murray Kinnell in order to get his money back to Pompeii. The scene shifts with Flavius John Wood now a young man appalled by the events in the Arena and struggling to remember the man who healed him in his youth. The conflict between father and son arrival of Pilate to take Flavius to Rome the corrupt Prefect Louis Calhern who demands gore for the Games and Flavius' romance with a slave Dorothy Wilson all intertwine and lead to the climatic eruption of Vesuvius. Marcus redeems himself in the emotional conclusion.As a child I loved Marcus' spiritual journey from innocent joy to sorrow to hardhearted bitterness to mercenary greed and finally to redemption. As an adult I still like the tale but have focused more on the acting and production values. I disagree with the commentators who call the acting wooden. Foster gives one of the best performances of his career as Marcus. As many note Rathbone renders a sympathetic sensitive delineation of Pilate. And the supporting players are superb Edward Van Sloan as a kindly neighbor Frank Conroy as a kind but condescending noble Gloria Shea as the young wife Dorothy Wilson as the son's love interest Calhern as the despicable Prefect Zeffie Tilbury as an old Greek soothsayer etc. Even the minor roles are welletched Ward Bond as a bragging opponent of Marcus Jason Robards Sr. as the tax gatherer Reginald Barlow as the slave market proprietor Kinnell as the Judean peasant and many more. One can even spot Jim Thorpe throwing coins after a gladiator battle. A few players did very underrated work in The Last Days of Pompeii. Alan Hale Sr. as Burbix captures the rough edges of a criminal and then the fierce loyalty to his understanding friend Marcus. William V. Mong as the growlingattimes coweringwithfear at others slave dealer Cleon gives a wonderful colorful performance that is anything but wooden. But it is Wyrley Birch as Leaster the kindly Greek scholarslave who provides the moral compass for the film counseling Marcus tolerating his greed and seeming imperviousness to the suffering of others while educating his son Flavius that there is a better way and far superior values than those his father seems to endorse. Birch walks the tightrope and never becomes overly sentimental. Truly Leaster represents the apex of Birch's career.The Last Days of Pompeii is an enjoyable film on many levels including as a morality tale. It is much more than that however. And for lovers of old character actors it is a treasure trove!".

The film is a spectacle from the middle thirties after the De Mille manner which is to say it tries to look big but is actually upon closer examination at best midsized. RKO didn't really have the bucks to make a film on as lavish a scale as they surely would have wished. The film has many flaws but also virtues. It was made by the King Kong team of Ernest Schoedsak and Merian Cooper who were very resourceful gentlemen highly creative and not at all like other Hollywood filmmakers and therefore the movie has a unique style that's difficult to put into words. The best way I can describe their approach is to say that it's highly individual its makers had their own way of doing things and therefore told their their story or more properly showed it so that the movie doesn't resemble other films with similar themes. Also on the plus side is its cast not of thousands maybe of hundreds more likely of dozens. In the leading role Preston Foster's anchors the film in a kind of emotional reality. He may not have been the most versatile of actors but he was a most sincere one and he is excellent in the lead. Also good is Basil Rathbone as Pontius Pilate surprisingly unhammy. It's a very good movie overall hokey as hell but always watchable and in the end while the spectacle of Mount Vesuvius erupting isn't all it might be the movie as whole at least holds firm and I for one was moved by it not to tears maybe but in a more modest way by the smaller more intimate tale of a good man who comes to his senses too late at least for redemption in this world.".

Basil imbues Pilate with a sense of duty and conscience that fills the screen with its irony and pain at his dilemma. Marvelous! Preston Foster is often forced and hammy...but it did not distract from the enjoyment of the movie..in fact it was a style of acting in the thirties that many leads presented..actors like Fredrick March etc had the same style...a leftover from the silent age when actors in order to convey their sentiment used their body more to propel their feelings to the screen. An exaggeration of movement that lasted for a number of years until the realization hit that on the big screen with sound actors could be more subtle with their gestures. The story is  in content wonderful...holds my attention even after all these years of viewing. It is a fascinating  story...a progression from a happy hard working  man with everything he could ever want who loses it all in a very few days for lack of money. Bitter and lost after having lost not only those he loved but losing his principles too to try to save them he decides the only thing worth having is money..because it is the only thing that PROTECTS you. In the backround to all of this is the story of the Christ...not meant to be in the foreground but a backdrop to everything that happens to this man struggling with the heavy burden of his reality and his decisions. This is a beautiful film worthy of repeated viewing for its amazing messages...and there are many. This is a thinking man's film a philosopher's film a spiritualist's film and a film for every man and woman searching for answers to the question why? What it ultimately leaves you with is HOPE.

This is a KEEPER.";

Normally I can't stand classical actors but the performances in Pompeii are so energetic that I got sucked in anyway. The moral underpinning of the movie does include a couple of appearances by Jesus Christ complete with awed crowds of followers and the obligatory boys choir but compared with some of the later Jesus epics that Hollywood produced King of Kings and The Greatest Story Ever Told Pompeii handles the material with considerable flair. The only major nitpick I have for this movie is its freewheeling use of history. At most the story only covers 20 years but Jesus died around 35 AD and Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. But then when has Hollywood let the truth get in the way of a good story?".

	schema:reviewBody "I wonder how many of you read any of these novels THE CAXTONS THE LAST OF THE BARONS MY NOVEL PAUL CLIFFORD EUGENE ARAM THE COMING RACE. Any takers out there? Well how about PELHAM which has nothing to do with an 18th Century British Prime Minister nor an area of the Bronx near the Connecticut Border? No? Well how about THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII? Bet you heard that title somewhere? It has been the subject of about seven or eight major productions in the movies from the silent period a major full length version by the Italians in 1913 or so  which was a flop to a television version in 1985 that remains something of a critical joke to this day  all 240 odd minutes of it. Most people agree that of all the versions of the story the 1935 version starring Preston Forster and Basil Rathbone as a sad philosophical Pontius Pilate is the best. That it is basically entertaining is true. That it jettisoned the novel by Edward BulwerLytton is equally true. That the novel is unreadable today is also true.BulwerLytton has become in a small way a literary immortal from Victorian England  actually from late Regency through Victorian England. He was a wealthy landowner and aristocrat who would be in the British cabinet as Secretary of State for the Colonies in the middle 1850s. He was the father of a wouldbe poet who rose to be Viceroy of India. Lytton was a baronet when he started writing in 1825 and would eventually be an Earl First Earl Lytton. He wrote all the titles including THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII which I mentioned. Only PELHAM his novel of Regency England's aristocracy which he knew well and THE LAST DAYS are still reprinted. That's because as his own contemporaries  especially the greatly amused Thackeray noticed Lord Lytton's ideas out paced his abilities. He wrote bad prose. A BulwerLytton prize is now presented every year to those writers who write the worst clichfull opening paragraph for a novel. It is named for him because of the start of his novel EUGENE ARAM It was a dark and stormy night.... He tried to be original in his concepts. EUGENE ARAM was based on the 18th Century schoolteacher linguist and murderer hanged in 1759. Lytton tried to make a case that Aram's philosophical beliefs allowed him to take the blame for the murder he was hung for. The story sold well in the 1830s but it met with mostly critical rejection. In MY NOVEL his villain Baron Levy actually has a very human reason for his improbably complicated vengeance on two men he's angry of their attentions to a woman he loves. Levy is Jewish so it was a curious thing to make his motivation so mundane as love for a woman  but Bulwer spoiled it shortly after by adding the image of a vengeful Jew who had been insulted. That was always the problem with BulwerLytton. He's a literary Ed Wood in that his concepts outstrip his abilities and in comparison Wood is more bearable  one of his movies lasts about an hour or so while Bulwer can write a novel of over 700 pages!. The reason THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII happened to have a long shelf life is that the subject the small town near Naples that was buried in a sea of ash and lava by Vesuvius and rediscovered preserved 1700 years afterward fascinates us and to his credit Bulwer did his classical history homework. But as a piece of fiction his characters are dry as dust. One of the more interesting is a wealthy Egyptian who plans to take over the Roman Empire. He's the villain in the plot. The events that destroyed Pompeii are clearly revealed to us including the earthquake that hit the town a decade before the volcanic eruption.So when the movie was made they wisely jettisoned the actual story line which I plowed through when I read the boring novel about 1985. Foster is a blacksmith who becomes a successful gladiator and then a wealthy land owner near Pompeii. Early he lived in Judea and met Christ and he like his old patron Pilate are aware of an alternative to the materialist and corrupt empire. The film is old fashioned but bearably so and gave Foster one of his best screen performances his retired police captain in KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL is it's closest rival. Never a leading man in major productions Foster demonstrated here that he could handle lead roles. Except for an occasional film though he usually was in supporting parts. For his performance and Rathbone's Pilate and for jettisoning Bulwer's idiot writing and plot I'll give this an 8.By the way if you want to see an interesting literary view of the later life of Pilate  by a Nobel Prize Winner no less  read the short story THE PROCURATOR OF JUDEA by Anatole France. Far from being so thoughtful and sad as Rathbone's Pilate acts France's version of the Procurator seems more realistic regarding his memories.".

	schema:headline " The Last Days of Pompeii 1935 is early disaster movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The spectacular ending of the 1935 version of The Last Days of Pompeii is an early example of Hollywood's fixation with the concept of disaster movies. The plot involves a blacksmith in Pompeii named Marcus a very believable Preston Foster who is forced to enter the gladiator ring after his wife and child die from injuries sustained in a tragic accident. Because he lacked the fiscal means to give them proper care Marcus soon decides that money is everything and becomes the star of the arena. He adopts a small boy who's father he killed and retires from his brutal profession after suffering a severe wound. He ends up in Judea with his kid and in short succession meets Jesus who miraculously cures his son from a sudden illness has an interview with Pontius Pilate an excellent and pensive Basil Rathbone bumps into Alan Hale a professional horse thief and even later watches Jesus being crucified. That would be enough for any one man but Marcus' career is just beginning. He relocates himself back to Pompeii and with his newfound wealth from rounding up stray horses is able to become the head honcho at the local coliseum. Years pass and his son is still fixated on that nice guy who cured him back in the old days. He meets up with some Christians who are hiding from the authorities and falls in love with the best looking gal in the bunch. There he finds out the truth about that nice guy and decides to throw his lot in with these wonderful folks.

	onyx:emotionText "The spectacular ending of the 1935 version of The Last Days of Pompeii is an early example of Hollywood's fixation with the concept of disaster movies. The plot involves a blacksmith in Pompeii named Marcus a very believable Preston Foster who is forced to enter the gladiator ring after his wife and child die from injuries sustained in a tragic accident. Because he lacked the fiscal means to give them proper care Marcus soon decides that money is everything and becomes the star of the arena. He adopts a small boy who's father he killed and retires from his brutal profession after suffering a severe wound. He ends up in Judea with his kid and in short succession meets Jesus who miraculously cures his son from a sudden illness has an interview with Pontius Pilate an excellent and pensive Basil Rathbone bumps into Alan Hale a professional horse thief and even later watches Jesus being crucified. That would be enough for any one man but Marcus' career is just beginning. He relocates himself back to Pompeii and with his newfound wealth from rounding up stray horses is able to become the head honcho at the local coliseum. Years pass and his son is still fixated on that nice guy who cured him back in the old days. He meets up with some Christians who are hiding from the authorities and falls in love with the best looking gal in the bunch. There he finds out the truth about that nice guy and decides to throw his lot in with these wonderful folks. It doesn't take long before he and his friends are captured by the Romans and condemned to death as they are summarily tossed into the arena to be butchered by barbarian captives. Seeing his son about to be slaughtered Marcus pleads for his release with the local Prefect a cold and patrician Louis Calhern but it's all for naught. Just as this desperate battle begins....Mt.

	schema:reviewBody "The team that produced King Kong for RKO Pictures writer Meriam C. Cooper and director Ernest B. Schoedsack decided to emulate Cecil B. DeMille in giving us The Last Days Of Pompeii. It's not a bad film but it nearly bankrupted RKO so prohibitive was the cost for that small studio. The film bears a distinct resemblance to DeMille's eye filling but now incredibly campy The Sign Of The Cross. Our protagonist here is Preston Foster who plays Marcus the Blacksmith but before the film is done goes through more reinventions of character than you would find in good and bad Russian literature. As a content but happy blacksmith a bit of good fortune has him and wife celebrating. But she's accidentally injured and dies for lack of medical care not that medical care was all that good back in those days to begin with. Foster decides that all that matters in life is the money you can accumulate for a rainy day. Foster is constantly reassessing life throughout the film.Foster gets to go to Judea and is on the scene of the crucifixion and before that has Jesus heal his adopted son David Holt who grows up to be John Wood. Foster also meets Basil Rathbone as Pontius Pilate who also does some major reassessing after presiding over the trial of Jesus.If the Oscar for Special Effects was in existence in 1935 it would have been interesting to see either The Last Days Of Pompeii or Mutiny On The Bounty would have won the award. Those scenes of the volcanic eruption of Versuvius are what guaranteed this film would not show a profit. They do rival what DeMille was capable of but DeMille had a far bigger studio and more financial security in Paramount.Also in the cast are Louis Calhern as the Roman consul and Alan Hale as Foster's number two man. They give their usual good performances.As for RKO Studios and Preston Foster they got some Oscar recognition for another film that Foster did for them that year. It was the low budget but incredibly powerful Irish story The Informer where Victor McLaglen won for Best Actor. A much better film than The Last Days Of Pompeii. Still the spectacle of this film can still awe you even on the small screen.".

Please enjoy the final scene where the spirit of Preston Foster communes with a doubleexposure of the Master while a heavenly choir sings. Basil Rathbone is a pleasant figure but it cannot be said that there's anything subtle about his Pontius Pilate with his heavy shrugs and sighs and his I wonder and What is truth? his style is just as big as Preston Foster but he carries it off better because he's a more attractive presence. Anyway we should point out two things. First this is NOT based on BulwerLytton's novel not that it's better or worse for it but even BL didn't claim that the eruption in 79 A.D. happened only about 10 years after the Crufixion. Second Willis O'Brien's special effects are not terribly impressive even for the time. The recently released video of the 1913 Italian version is at least as convincing and maybe more so. This 1935 version is content to mostly have a lot of flying debris as people run for their lives. There is one carefully stiff transparently processed lava shot as people jump into the sea. The major visual spectacle during the disasterthe collapse of a giant statueis marred by a glaring continuity error. First we see the statue crack in two across the abdomen well above the discreetly place sword and begin to fall and then we cut to a closeup of the falling torso now completely intact but with the head coming off. There was no reason for that mistake. So the longawaited spectacle is not what it's cracked up to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Marcus the Blacksmith Preston Foster is a content Roman He has a lovely wife Gloria Shea and infant son. One day a reckless chariot runs down his small family and changes his life for good as Marcus lacked the funds for immediate medical attention. But one does wonder where the Roman police were as there was an effective courtjustice system. Anyway the embittered Marcus decides that making money has become allimportant character change number one. As he has good size and quickness he becomes a gladiator and earns much money. Upon discovering that one of his dead opponents left a young son now an orphan Flavius  David Holt Marcus decides to adopt the handsome and helpless lad. Now adoption was not unusual in ancient Rome but another character change for Marcus. Later after being wounded in gladiatorial combat Marcus can no longer compete in the arena. He becomes a trader in slaves and horses and becomes wealthy. Meanwhile an old woman an oracle tells him to go to Judaea to meet the greatest man in the world. Believing in a special prophesy Marcus takes his young son to the Levant where he catches glimpses of Christ's Crucifixion. Marcus though meets with the local procurator Pontius Pilate Basil Rathbone whom he believes is the great man even though Christ had cured the ailing Flavius. When he is back at Pompeii an older Marcus becomes the administrator of the arena spectacles. But by now his grown up son Flavius  John Wood has heeded the Christian message. Flavius aids runaway slaves to gain their freedom in far away locales like Britain. A complication arises when the Romans conquer the island. Eventually Flavius is caught imprisoned and sent into the arena for his crime. The helpless Marcus is unable to free his son. During one of the arena spectacles Mt. Vesuvius erupts sending the population into a general panic. It is up to Marcus to make a right decision another character change and redeem himself.Preston Foster's performance is adequate. Basil Rathbone a fine actor performs the role of Pontius Pilate nicely especially the procurator's quandary. Pilate knew that Jesus was innocent of the trumpedup charges but was afraid of the people's reaction. He washed his hands in front of the mob who by the way demanded that the criminal Barabbas be freed instead. Despite the bad decision Pilate's philosophical and sensitive treatment is closer to reality than realized. The movie has a few flaws especially the dating problem. My own research places Christ's Crucifixion on 5 April 33 AD experts overwhelmingly place the year between 30 and 34 AD. Now it is an historical fact that the volcanic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius and destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum occurred on 24 August 79 AD or 46 years later. But the movie treats these two events as if they occurred just a few years apart from each other! Furthermore Pontius Pilate died around 38 AD long before the eruption. There is also a difficulty with some of the Roman costume designs of Aline Bernstein. Furthermore the Romans never wore those globestyle caps although the Montefortino type of helmet did have a conical shape like the Gallic model but with a raised central node. Also Gaius Tanno's name is pronounced like GUYUSS not GAYUS Fabius is FABIUSS not FAYBIUS. Nevertheless the historical inaccuracies do not detract from the entertainment value of the film. For the 1930s period the sets are goodlooking and the script is acceptable. Also the special effects of Harry Redmond and Vernon L. Walker of the destruction of Pompeii are fine and expensive for 1935. The picture is accurate in showing that defeated gladiators did not always die in the arena as their upkeep and training cost much money. Finally it was most interesting to see western celebrity Yakima Canutt's name as one of the stuntmen.".

	onyx:emotionText "Marcus the Blacksmith Preston Foster is a content Roman He has a lovely wife Gloria Shea and infant son. One day a reckless chariot runs down his small family and changes his life for good as Marcus lacked the funds for immediate medical attention. But one does wonder where the Roman police were as there was an effective courtjustice system. Anyway the embittered Marcus decides that making money has become allimportant character change number one. As he has good size and quickness he becomes a gladiator and earns much money. Upon discovering that one of his dead opponents left a young son now an orphan Flavius  David Holt Marcus decides to adopt the handsome and helpless lad. Now adoption was not unusual in ancient Rome but another character change for Marcus. Later after being wounded in gladiatorial combat Marcus can no longer compete in the arena. He becomes a trader in slaves and horses and becomes wealthy. Meanwhile an old woman an oracle tells him to go to Judaea to meet the greatest man in the world. Believing in a special prophesy Marcus takes his young son to the Levant where he catches glimpses of Christ's Crucifixion. Marcus though meets with the local procurator Pontius Pilate Basil Rathbone whom he believes is the great man even though Christ had cured the ailing Flavius. When he is back at Pompeii an older Marcus becomes the administrator of the arena spectacles. But by now his grown up son Flavius  John Wood has heeded the Christian message. Flavius aids runaway slaves to gain their freedom in far away locales like Britain. A complication arises when the Romans conquer the island. Eventually Flavius is caught imprisoned and sent into the arena for his crime. The helpless Marcus is unable to free his son. During one of the arena spectacles Mt. Vesuvius erupts sending the population into a general panic. It is up to Marcus to make a right decision another character change and redeem himself.Preston Foster's performance is adequate. Basil Rathbone a fine actor performs the role of Pontius Pilate nicely especially the procurator's quandary. Pilate knew that Jesus was innocent of the trumpedup charges but was afraid of the people's reaction. He washed his hands in front of the mob who by the way demanded that the criminal Barabbas be freed instead. Despite the bad decision Pilate's philosophical and sensitive treatment is closer to reality than realized. The movie has a few flaws especially the dating problem.

If it's good in the past it's still good as Sly  The Family Stone commented at 1969's famous Woodstock concert.To me the biggest attraction of the film is the involving story. From early on you really care about Marcus Preston Foster and then his adopted son Flavius DavidHoltJohn Wood. Foster is good in his lead role and very convincing as the hardluck and bitter man who turns into a gladiator and then rich entrepreneur so to speak. As hard a man as he is he has a really soft spot for his family and will do anything for them either wife or kids depending on where you are in the story.All the characters are interesting. The only one who was a little bizarre to me was Basil Rathbone's Pontius Pilate. I've never seen Pilate portrayed in such a sympathetic friendly light as he was here as Marcus's boss and then friend. Now Pilate may not have been the totally evil man many people perceive him to be but he's no good guy that's for sure and yet he was portrayed as such.Regardless the film is a good one with a dramatic ending and good specialeffects for the mid 1930s. The most important special effect though was not the eruption of Mount Vesuvius but the transformation of Marcus's' hard heart. This was truly a man who saw the light near the end of his life thanks to one Man.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film in both the colorized version with awful garish colors and in black and white and was disappointed both times.  The story is partially a religious one involving the crucifixion of Jesus Christ who earlier in the film cured Preston Foster's adopted son of the coma he was in when he fell from a horse.  That story is always in the background and you never see Christ except in extreme longshot on the cross with the two thieves on the hill.  I felt I had to sit through a lot of verbose preaching before I got what I was waiting for the eruption of Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii.  The special effects were not all that good.  One short scene of lava flowing a couple of bursts of fire from a volcano and lots of earthquake damage. The thrust of the story involves Foster's rise from a poor blacksmith to a wealthy head of the arena in Pompeii.  He first becomes a gladiator to get quick money for a doctor when his wife and son were trampled by horses.  It was too late as both died.  He vowed never to be in need of money again and became wealthy as a champion gladiator.  There is a touching scene after a victory where he meets the young son David Holt of the gladiator he just killed explaining to him that his father has crossed the River Styx.  He adopts the boy and thereafter does everything with the boy's interest in mind.  When he is finally defeated in a match by Ward Bond in an uncredited role he turns to help rounding up slaves to stealing horses for Pontius Pilate Basil Rathbone in an excellent performance and finally to being head of the arena where gladiators fight. But his son now played by John Wood is a gentle sort who helps runaway slaves a capital crime.  When he is caught and put in the arena for a certain death Vesuvius erupts.  Foster helps him and some of the slaves get in a boat to escape but the Prefect and his men order him to stop the boat from leaving and open the gate to let them get to the boat.  Foster with every ounce of strength he has tries to keep them from getting through the gate.".

It should make modern sword and sandal film makers very jealous.The imagery is perhaps even better than de Mille. The hunky statue of the gladiator in the final scenes is almost as striking as de Mille's use of female beauty and even reminds us of the beautiful femme fatale of Northwest Mounted Police.Great acting and most people will probably be most acquainted with the charismatic Basil as Pontius. His Pontius is a modern caring man. Indeed the original Pontius was somewhere between the thinker and the monster and it seems no one wants to go in between the extremes. He savagely saw the Hebrews as a people not his own. However odds are he did want to release Jesus. That doesn't make him less savage. It just means he was a strict lawman and Jesus wasn't the punk sort he felt needed to be crucified.The effects were astounding and the extras should have gotten an all time Academy Award for best extras. They worked their butts off and emoted better than most modern day stars.Crisp brisk full of art. With added comic relief and a brisker beginning it would've easily been 1010. This was a clever well designed film with characters we could care about.".

By all means this film can certainly compete with the best westerns and should be given a chance to touch the actual generation by means of video DVD etc. Although since then we have larger screens and color this kind of picture in black and white proves if necessary that masterpieces exists without that.";

Foremost here is the ballad Mulher Rendeira The Lacemaker especially in the unforgettable scene when the gang rides in a duck line along a ridge which is set against the dusk sky and the gloomy grandeur of the Brazilian Sertao. In their leather garments pepped up by the symbolism of amulets and talismans the bandidos in this movie resemble an archaic tribe living in this land of dust and thorns for eons already. The movie is filmed in black and white which is lending it a certain kind of credibility reminding of a documentary. Although presenting a different plot Barreto's movie was obviously inspired by the fate of the most famous couple of Brazilian cangaceiros Lampiao and his wife Maria Bonita who were killed in 1938 with seven others of their gang by the police.".

It also falls into that clich of the better looking an actor is the better human being his character is. Certainly that's common in this genre but it doesn't mean I have to like it. The story is nothing that new. Yet it's presented with a fierceness and focus that makes it very watchable. These bandit antiheroes are hard men with hard hearts. Their violence is still disturbing even by modern standards.The much discussed music fell on both sides of the fence to me. The score which includes a lot of songs is sometimes quite a haunting partner to the striking images. But at other times when the group of bandits whose story this is fall into singing and dancing in ways that feel more akin to a musical than a gritty violent western the effect was odd and disconcerting almost unintentionally comic. But that might just be a cultural bias  it took me a while to get used to the musical numbers in Bollywood films for example.Overall this was a film I was glad I got to see and would like to see again for its imagery.

	schema:reviewBody "This film manages to be relatively nonformulaic and even more nonhistorical though the real Black Bart was indeed named Charles E. Boles as portrayed. Britishborn Boles however did not conduct his outlaw career as a Zorroesque blackclad horseman but hiked to all his holdups and wore a long linen duster with a flour sack over his head. He was also pushing 50 when he started robbing the stage. So much for a romantic image! If the intention was to make BartBoles a dashing figure I think another actor would have been a better choice than Dan Duryea who after all pretty much built his career on playing creeps. But it's always interesting to see a departure and the script is more clever than that of the routine horse opera of the day.As Lola Montez Yvonne De Carlo makes no effort at a real characterization of the famous Countess former mistress to Ludwig I of Bavaria but acts well like Yvonne De Carlo delivering her lines in her usual flat New World tones. The witty volatile and multilingual Lola nee Eliza Gilbert though Irish by birth affected a sort of Spanish accent to go with her assumed Sevillian identity. De Carlo's dancing I fear bears little resemblance to Lola's but it's always a pleasure to watch Yvonne in her early roles this film came only three years after her dazzling debut in 1945's Salome Where She Danced in which she played a quasi Lola Montez thereby confusing the record considerably.In reference to this the real Lola never danced as Salome nor visited Arizona and the town there called Salome Where She Danced was named in 1904 and for quite another lady. To play Lola or a quasiLola De Carlo does certainly fit the bill visually as a stunning blueeyed brunette with a memorable figure. As to Lola ever encountering Black Bart well when he began his career as a highway robber in 1875 Lola had been in her grave for fourteen years. So much for romance!".

Reviewer lorenellroy is rightthe amorality of Lynn and Duryea is unusual for the period 1948. It's hard at times to know where their loyalties lie making the script somewhatand refreshingly difficult to predict. Add a luscious De Carlo who looks ravishing in Technicolor while turning in a surprisingly artful performance.So with these positives why doesn't the movie impact more strongly than I believe it does. Now I'm as big a Duryea fan as anyone. In fact that's why I tuned in. But for some reason he looks less motivated than usual draining Bart of needed character color. There's not the usual relish of his better performances. Add to that the other lead Jeffrey Lynn who's just naturally colorless and there's not the needed drive at the movie's center. At the same time director Sherman has to work in the romantic angle without sagging the tempo which he does pretty well. But the staging of the final ambush scene is clumsily donehow could the ambushers miss their shots at such close range as Bart and Lance race for the cabin.Anyway there's real offbeat potential in the various ambiguities that the script doesn't develop adequately until the end. Nonetheless the compensations are enough to make this a generally entertaining 80minutes of cowboy intrigue.".

However it does have plenty of things that make it entertaining to watch.  The story is a mix of mystery with some nice twists before the tragic but witty finale. The film never really sags and manages to mix action with romance with humour with western.  It's not the best film ever made but it is a gentle bit of entertainment.Dan Duryea is not great as Charlie  he feels too wooden and as Black Bart he is totally covered by a mask and can't manage to bring his character to life.  Jeffrey Lynn is good as Lance and benefits from having a double act with Percy Kilbride's Jersey.  Yvonne DeCarlo is stunning as Lola but she doesn't have much to do and is just part of the studio's habit of adding feisty female roles to westerns of the time.Overall this is nowhere near a classic but it is well shot and is quite fun.".

In many cases their lives other than their criminal proclivities were rather boring so to make a good movie elements had to be added to make their lives seem more exciting other than the chase of the law that usually ended up with a shootout and the criminal's violent death. Dan Duryea one of the great movie scoundrels of the 1940's is very credible as the titled character a nobleman who turned to crime and during one of his stagecoach robberies came across the elegant Lola Montez the famous Spanish dancer.The camera loves Yvonne de Carlo seen here wearing tons of makeup and ruby red lipstick but looking gorgeous as Lola knowing his true identity but keeping his secret after he returns one of her valuable jewels to her. Duryea's rival for her affections happens to be his old friend Jeffrey Lynn who is on the stagecoach when Duryea makes his attempts. Percy Kilbride offers amusing sidekick comedy relief and is a step above the silliness of such old grizzled character actors such as Fuzzy Knight and Gabby Hayes. Gorgeous Technicolor photography adds well to the many outdoor scenes although it seems odd that De Carlo didn't recognize Duryea as the man who robbed her. In spite of a few minor shortcomings this is still very entertaining and fast moving. So take it as legend rather than truth I could not locate any proof that Black Bart ever met Lola Montez and simply enjoy the beautiful Yvonne great in the dance sequences and the wonderful adventure.".

All that I can say is that Black Bart did go by the real name of Charles Bolles and they did do his crime thing in California in the 19th century. Other than that this film has nothing to do with Black Bart's real story.Among other things Black Bart was always a gentleman and left a bit of poetic verse at the scene of each robbery. Not a line of poetry comes from Dan Duryea's lips. As Black Bart died in 1888 and Lola Montez died in 1861 it's highly unlikely they ever even met.Yvonne DeCarlo plays the exotic dancer who had King Ludwig of Bavaria panting for more. But that's all done with Lola's in America on a tour and she's now in San Francisco. On the way there she meets up with Black Bart when he holds up the stagecoach. Also along are a pair of Duryea's associates from his past Jeffrey Lynn and Percy Kilbride. They know Duryea even behind the mask and want in on the set up. Lynn also wants in on Lola Montez.Black Bart despite its gross historical inaccuracies is an interesting and unique film. No happy endings for anyone here as Duryea and Lynn go out like Butch and Sundance. Yvonne DeCarlo is properly fetching as Lola though I think the one who should have played Lola in a better film of her life should have been Greta Garbo.".

Although they get their due in the grand finale themes like that are not frequent in the westerns of the classic era but associated usually to westerns in the late 60's and 70's.";

	schema:reviewBody "Before he directed Black Bart George Sherman had helmed over 40 Bwesterns. Despite his prolific output Sherman challenged John Ford for artistry mastery of the genre. Nevertheless Black Bart qualifies as an entertaining but formulaic tongueincheek oater. Three scenaristsLuci Ward Jack Natteford and William Bowersknew something about writing horse operas. Ward  Natteford collaborated together on 11 westerns including The Last Bandit Return of the Badman Blackjack Ketchum Desperado and Badman's Territory. William Bowers wrote The Law and Jake Wade The Sheepman Support Your Local Sheriff The Gunfighter and Advance to the Rear. Ostensibly about a real life character who used the alias Black Bart this colorful western takes place in California and concerns a clever bandit who dresses like Zorro and skillfully wields doublebarrel sawedoff shotgun. He robs stagecoaches and his legend spreads across the southwest much to the chagrin of the Wells Fargo Company. Unlike the remake Black Bart unfolds in flashback narrated by outlaw Jersey Brady Percy Kilbride of the Ma  Pa Kettle series at Universal. According to Brady our notorious protagonists Charles E. Boles Dan Duryea of Winchester 73 and Lance Hardeen Jeffrey Lynn of Underground are being taken to the hanging tree by the authorities because they robbed two banks rode out on stolen horses and took the mayor's wife with them in the same day. Meantime Jersey has planted explosives at the base of the tree and he blasts the tree gets the drop on the lawman with his rifle. Afterward the three outlaws split up with Boles decides to ride to California while Lance talks about heading to Texas. Boles prefers to be done with reckless Lance. Lance was the one who brought along the mayor's wife during their twinbill bank robbery. You're bad news Lance Boles complains you're not interested in growing old. There ain't no permanence in this business Jersey observes. Just begin to like somebody and he turns up dead. Lance points out You lose a lot of people you don't like that way too. Unlike Jersey and Lance Boles aims to make a stake and then turn respectable. Lance laughs at Boles' ambition You don't have a respectable bone in your body. You've got larceny pumping through your bones the same as me. You'll never make it. The three have 3thousand buried nearby but Lance and Jersey doublecross Boles and leave him afoot so he cannot claim his share. They ride off while he pulls that 3thousand wad out of his pocket. Indeed Boles has the last laugh on Lance. Sherman makes a clever transition to California. As Boles rides into another standardissue western town a covered wagon passes in front of the camera and stenciled on the canopy is Sacramento. Typically a set of graphic titles would have been superimposed on the screen to identify the setting but this organic introduction looks far better. Boles drifts into a bar and encounters an old friend Clark John McIntire of Backlash who invites him to sit down. Clark had been participating in a conversation with a Wells Fargo representative. Clark informs Boles that he has become a legitimate lawyer because there are no records to condemn him as a criminal. Clark concocts an audacious scheme based on the widespread discovery of gold in the state. Indeed Clark is referring to the Sutter's Fort gold rush. Clark poses a sarcastic question to BolesHow would you like to be in the banking business? Multiple newspaper headlines appear about the celebrated gold rush. Afterward we catch our first glimpse of Boles dressed up in black riding a galloping black horse and wearing a black bag over his face. He robs his first stagecoach. Before long Wells Fargo has placed a 10thousand bounty on Black Bart's head. You see Boles and Clark have gone into business. Inevitably Lance and Jersey show up and they persuade the stagecoach company to hire them as drivers. Things get even livelier as dance hall girl Lola Montez Yvonne De Carlo of Brute Force arrives via Wells Fargo in Sacramento. She is riding on the same coach that Lance and Jersey have taken and they admire her diamonds worth over 100thousand dollars. Naturally Black Bart strikes.Bend of the River lenser Irving Glassberg's Technicolor cinematography is vivid and some of the scenery looks imposing. The other natural beauty is not mountainous. De Carlo performs a dance number that shows a lot of leg. The dialogue is aboveaverage and leavened with humor. Duryea makes a good outlaw but Lynn seems distinctively out of place. Percy Kilbride serves as comic relief and there is a surprise ending. In some ways Black Bart surpasses Ride to the Hangman's Tree. The amazing thing is that Universal Pictures was able to insert some of the action footage from this 1948 movie into the 1967 remake.".

Masked main characters at those times 1948 used to be heroes like the Zorro and the Durango Kid. They wore their masks to defend poor people's rights or the law. In Black Bart Duryea's mask is for pure self interest but in the film he is not quite the bad guy the spectator will sympathize with him. In those westerns where the outlaw was the hero he either had to die at the end or go to jail for a number of years with his woman waiting for him.

Needless to say their lives become intertwined from this moment on. Now rather than reveal any more of the film and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a watchable Western movie for the most part. Although I liked the performances of Yvonne De Carlo and Percy Kilbride to a certain extent to be quite honest I didn't think Dan Duryea possessed the necessary screen presence to handle the starring role. Likewise I also thought some of the scenarios were a bit too fanciful and unrealistic for my tastes. Again though it's certainly watchable and worth the time spent if one is inclined to movies of this type. I rate it as average.".

The daily walks looked very innocent but we were obviously led to believe that there was more to it. In the mean time we witnessed several small events in the personal life of the photographer evenly spread out in time. None of these offered a clue what the film was all about. But a lot can happen in the 2 hours that this film was planned to take.Even after 1 hour halfway still nothing like a plot emerged. But I saw no significant walkouts from a venue with 250 booked seats. I assumed to have missed something important that was obvious to everyone else otherwise not so many people could be that patient for that length of time.The series of small events continued introducing a dead brother a hospitalized mother a possible love affair with a step sister and a pattern in the locations where the shadowed woman took her walks. Still hoping that some plot was to be grown out of all these openings I stayed until the end. It proved a disappointment after all. I can merely wonder what the director of this film had thought to show us with all this emptiness. The only thing left for me was giving a 1 lowest mark for the public prize competition when leaving the theater.".

Up to this time Power's films were mostly either costume period dramas or screen comedies. For the first time Ty is in modern dress and in a drama.Power fits the title role of Johnny Apollo rather well. The name is a spur of the moment creation for Robert Cain Jr. who would be called a trust fund baby today. His widower father Edward Arnold's indictment for some white collar securities violations has put Power's rather well ordered and soft universe to a sudden end.Power tries to play it straight but can't make a go of it. Circumstances put him and gangster Lloyd Nolan together. And Power discovers he's got a talent for the rackets. He also attracts the attention of Nolan's girl friend Dorothy Lamour. Johnny Apollo is a good film with crackerjack performances by the cast that Henry Hathaway directed. It's probably best compared to MGM's Johnny Eager where Louis B. Mayer was also trying to broaden their studio's heartthrob Robert Taylor's appeal. Johnny Eager is the better film but no one in Johnny Apollo need be ashamed of anything.Best performances in the film are from Nolan as gangster Mickey Dwyer. Nolan was never bad in any film he was ever in. Second best is alcoholic mob attorney Charley Grapewin.Dorothy Lamour was brought over from Paramount for this film playing a part that Alice Faye or Betty Grable might normally have been assigned to. She gets two of her best movie songs to sing This Is The Beginning Of The End by Mack Gordon and Your Kiss by Frank Loesser and Lionel Newman.Johnny Apollo is a fine gangster film from a studio that normally did not do that particular genre.

The song was a 1952 hit for singer Don Cornell but his version pales beside Lamour's soulful rendition here.

At the time Johnny Apollo was made Power was the 2 box office in the world.There's not much to this movie  it's fairly typical of its genre similar to what was produced in the '30s. There are however some very good performances including those of Lloyd Nolan and Edward Arnold. Dorothy Lamour wearing very exotic makeup plays a streetwise singer involved with Nolan. Naturally she falls for the handsome welleducated Power who falls in with crooks and renames himself Johnny Apollo after his father goes to prison for embezzlement. Lamour has two good numbers This is the Beginning of the End and Dancin' for Nickels and Dimes. Johnny Apollo isn't one of Power's best roles by any stretch but he's adorable and his presence made it an enormous hit. This film spawned a lot of Johnny movies Johnny Eager Johnny Angel Johnny Doughboy etc.. It was rereleased in 1949.".

Oddly however they never really show or talk about Power doing anything especially illegal!Soon after beginning work with Nolan Power has a reconciliation with Dad when he visits the prison. However when Arnold learns that his son is working for the underworld he vows once again to have nothing to do with Power. Again this makes little sense. The first time he disowns him for not being for accepting of his evil ways and now that Power too is a crook the father can't accept him once again! There's a lot more to the plot than this and Power even eventually is imprisoned in the same place as his dad! Along for the ride is Dorothy Lamour as a lounge singer with a heart of gold and Charlie Grapewin in one of his best roles as the crooked attorney. All in all the acting especially Nolan and Arnold is very good and the film has so many plot elements and twists that it is a decent example of early Film Noir.

It is a terrific plot with those phenomenal performances. Lamour so aptly sings Beginning of the End. How appropriate that was.A grand story dealing with high collar crime and thugs in general. Interesting to note the deals that can be worked out. The best deal is to capture this worthy 1940 film.".

Lloyd Nolan plays a lowkey gangster and Tyrone Power plays a guy who exhibits good and bad. Dorothy Lamour Edward Arnold Charley Grapewin and Lionel Atwill all add to this talented cast. Lamour's toughtalking dame character and good cinematography helped this movie be characterized as a very early entry into the film noir genre.The problem with the movie was the believability of the story. There were too many unanswered questions in here. Why was this person arrested? How and why could this happen and that? There are lots of holes in here and sometimes they were so prevalent they broke up the continuity of the story.

So Tyrone decides Pop was right and that the only way to make it ahead in the world is by being a crook. So he hooks up with gangster Lloyd Nolan and falls for Nolan's girl Dorothy Lamour. When Arnold finds out what his son is up to he's none too pleased.Enjoyable gangster drama with a fine cast. Some have said Power is miscast. I think he's okay for the part. It's not really a gritty movie despite the plot. Maybe if it had been a tough film noir I could see the point that Power was wrong for the role. But it's not and he isn't. Edward Arnold is good. I doubt the man ever did a bad acting job in his career. His character is somewhat poorly written and hard to relate to but it's difficult to dislike him due to Arnold's sympathetic performance. Nice to see Charley Grapewin playing something besides a grizzled oldtimer without most of his marbles. Beautiful Dorothy Lamour is always a plus and it's good to see her in a serious role. Lloyd Nolan pretty much steals the movie as the gangster Mickey Dwyer. Lionel Atwill is largely wasted as Arnold's attorney.The biggest flaw with the movie is that its plot isn't always consistent. Arnold's character is a crook who first treats his son like crap for not being okay with his crookedness. Then later he treats his son like crap for becoming a criminal like Dad. Still it's an enjoyable movie. The script's got some nice dialogue. Watch for the scene where Power chases tackles and beats Marc Lawrence's head against the ground! Yikes!".

'Noir' is an elusive term and means different things to different viewers but Johnny Apollo doesn't fill the bill in any case. No aura of menace no expressionist lighting effects no ambiguity of purpose in the hero's intent to name a few qualifications. But those are some of my own prerequisites.Having said that Johnny Apollo is a good prewar crime drama with an attractive cast and an excellent script. The film works on its own terms and the players are so competent you can almost overlook the hastilycontrived ending which strains the viewers credulity. Edward Arnold Dorothy Lamour and Tyrone Power are firstrate although Arnold is the workhorse here and Power was a questionable choice for the title role try as he might and he did try. But as with Gary Cooper in City Streets Power is not a gangster. There are lots of familiar character actors and Dorothy Lamour gets to sing a few songs in her husky voice and Beginning Of The End is a gorgeous song hardly heard at all these days.But what was the big rush to end the picture? As it was there was an awful lot to swallow with multiple plot holes and loose ends. And the lighthearted last scene didn't fit. I still give it a rating of 7 as I just went with it as an enjoyable example of preWWII escapist entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the early 1940s Hollywood must have been running out of titles about shady gangster types. Among other titles there were Johnny Allegro Johnny Eager Johnny O'Clock and some others I forget. By the 1950s they had pretty much run out of Johnnys no one willing to essay a project called Johnny Aardvark and they'd switched to other characters with everyday first names but unique last names. In Legend of the Lost John Wayne was Joe January.Johnny Apollo is apt enough as far as that goes. In 1940 Tyrone Power was one of TwentiethCentury Fox's most handsome leading men. He melts the tarty heart of Dorothy Lamour minutes after their first meeting. She tells him to make a wish then adds after a pause I'll bet that wish was about a woman. I waited for him to say No a man. It's often described as a gangster movie but the core theme is the relationship between father Arnold and son Power. Arnold is a wealthy man who is convicted of some kind of shenanigans in the stock market and spends time in jail where he redeems himself by becoming a model prisoner and enthusiastic welder in the boiler shop.Disillusioned by the discovery of his father's illegal activities and denied any responsible job because of the stain on the family name Power drops the Robert Cain Jr. moniker and becomes Johnny Apollo. He rejects his sadder but wiser father saying I know thee not old man. Well not that exactly.He also barges ahead recklessly in the pelf department by becoming mixed up with the notorious racketeer Mickey Dwyer Nolan. Power becomes one of the brains in Nolan's gang but not a soldier. He's never involved in violence. In fact there's very little violence in the movie. An icepick murder takes place in a steam room. Kids An ice pick is this long thin round instrument with a sharp point used for chipping ice from big blocks in order to make alcoholic drinks called highballs. Almost all the action takes place during a jail break at the end not particularly exciting or well staged though directed efficiently by Henry Hathaway.I found the movie a little flat although as usual I hoped for a happy ending which arrived apace. I don't know exactly what it's missing. If there had been more physical movement it might have added some momentum and the movie would have been a fastpaced and unpretentious gangster flick. If the writers had decided to go in a different direction it might have been an interesting drama about family relations and the heritability of criminal tendencies. You know nature versus nurture? Instead it seems like a Lamarckian mistake like Soviet agriculture. It's a little dull though it's always good to see Edward Arnold playing something other than a moneymad and powerdriven blowhard. You ought to see him register disappointment when Power tells him off.".

Early on they have a very heated exchange and I've never seen Tyrone give such an understated and sincere performance as in that scene and in this whole movie. I was very impressed with Tyrone in this movie and with the movie itself too. I already knew Edward Arnold was a great character actor before I rewatched this film. I had not seen this in over 10 years. Dorothy Lamour is good too but her songs in this movie were really unnecessary. I hate to say anything negative about sweet Dorothy but she doesn't have much of a singing voice. Or maybe those songs just got on my nerves. If it weren't for those songs I'd give this more than an 8.Back to Ty. He tries to get a job with his real name. No go! No one will hire him. So he changes it to something else not Apollo and in the process gets fired for lying about it. By the by he meets Lloyd Nolan who is an excon who makes him wise to getting ahead.

Australian release 13 June 1940. 8686 feet. 96 minutes.SYNOPSIS Bob Cain Power leaves college when he learns that his dad Arnold has been arrested for embezzlement. Bob vows to work for his release and eventually finds a shyster lawyer Brennan Grapewin who agrees to take the case.OVERVIEW In the first of his five films with director Henry Hathaway Power surprised his fans by playing a gangster Originally titled Dance with the Devil the film was to have reteamed Power with Linda Darnell as Lucky DuBarry. But then Zanuck loaned Don Ameche to Paramount in exchange for Dorothy Lamour. Guess who got the better of that deal! COMMENT The film is so beautifully photographed it's always a pleasure to watch and it's enacted by one of the greatest and largest casts ever assembled for a film of this type. There are so many excellent cameo portrayals each making such a positive unified yet unobtrusively realistic contribution. Power gives an ingratiating and convincing performance in the title role while Nolan is charmingly and fascinatingly reptilian and Charley Grapewin is a standout as the alcoholic shyster. Lionel Atwill is exactly right for the part of a lawyer with a double standard whilst Marc Lawrence looks and acts the part of a cheap hood perfectly.Also seen to advantage in this lineup of principals is Dorothy Lamour who even has a couple of rightinthemood songs including a little production number with a wow of a chorus. Pleasingly she is not always photographed from the most flattering angles so she looks the part as well as she acts it out.However Edward Arnold is forced to battle valiantly with a role that is not as wellwritten as the others. It's a key role but one occasionally has the impression that it's being built up in order to put Arnold on camera for longer than the dramatic potential of his scenes warrants. On TV the long boring extraneous scene in which Power returns home from college and has a long confrontation with his father is usually cut as there is no essential information in this scene that is not repeated later on. And for all Arnold's mannerisms Cain is not nearly as interesting a character as Apollo or Dwyer or Brennan  or even Lucky.Hathaway makes imaginative use of natural locations the camera panning up to catch Power looking over the gallery at the railway station and the shot through the glass door framing Power and Atwill  a characteristic Hathaway touch  as they walk to the entrance and drives the film along at a fast clip. There are also some characteristic touches of violence Power bringing down Lawrence with a flying tackle Nolan slapping Lamour around  this sequence was too much for the Australian censor Brennan's murder in the steamroom the more chillingly effective for not being shown directly on camera the climactic prison break.Hathaway's approach is varied. Occasionally he employs long takes and has an excellent eye for composition in his establishing long shots  sometimes he holds these for most of the sequence sometimes he breaks them up with medium closeups. Usually he eschews reverse angles though there are a couple of examples in the film and he can use mirror shots with dramatic effectiveness. In short his style is admirably varied and shows his usual deftness and skill.In all this is vintage Henry Hathaway. The best scenes are those filmed on actual locations and the two action scenes the murder and the prison break. AVAILABLE on an excellent 20th Century Fox DVD.".

OK. Today combining a young male romantic lead with an opera singer seems strange. In the mid 20th Century classical music wasn't viewed suspiciously by most people as it is now.

	schema:reviewBody "I Dream Too Much nicknamed I Scream Too Much is a 1935 film starring opera singer Lily Pons and Henry Fonda who at this point in his life resembled Jane Fonda in a man's haircut. He was really at the height of his most adorableness. Fonda plays a composer named Johnny Street who marries a young woman Annette only to discover that she has an operatic voice. In attempting to push his opera she sings some of it for the head of the opera company in Paris. He makes her a huge star and Johnny is stuck on the sidelines. When he finds out that she is paying for a production of his opera he leaves her.This is a slight story no doubt prompted by the success of Jeanette MacDonald and Grace Moore that relies on the voice and personality of Lily Pons and the cuteness of Fonda. Eric Blore plays a neighbor who has a trained seal he's there for comic relief and he was always funny.Pons was a huge opera star who actually sang for the last time in 1972 when she was 74 years of age! She was tiny at a time when opera stars ran very big she was very glamorous and her timing was impeccable  she arrived in America during the Depression and saved the Metropolitan Opera from bankruptcy. Her signature aria was the Bell Song from Lakme an opera done infrequently today if at all. In it she wore a bare midriff costume and showed off her F above high C and her coloratura technique. She was an ideal Rosina Gilda Lucia Linda di Chamonix etc. Women singers in those days were trained a little differently than they are today with back placement of the high notes. Pons' middle voice and extension above high C were lovely but the notes from F to high C had a shrillness to them at least in recording. Her speaking voice records shrilly as well.This is actually a sweet film that the actors make enjoyable. I could have done without the long dragging number at the end but it's a chance to see one of opera's legends and a very young Fonda.".

Wouldn't you know it Fonda turns out to be a budding composer and after a night on the town they wind up married.But while she gains acclaim for her singing Fonda just can't get any notice for his music. The same plot was used in the MGM Jeanette MacDonaldLew Ayres film Broadway Serenade so if you've seen that you know how this one goes. That one however was more dramatic and this was played more for comedy.What I Dream Too Much does have going for it are four Jerome Kern Dorothy Fields songs to go with the operatic arias that Ms. Pons does. The best known of these is The Jockey On The Carousel which Lily sings while on a carousel to little Scotty Beckett.Fonda in a comic role has little to do but display a kind of oafish charm. The film is clearly a vehicle for Lily Pons and he knows it.As for the film it still retains a lot of charm. I wish opera and operetta were still done on the big screen but that day as come and gone. And we sure don't have composers like Jerome Kern writing for the screen either.".

But no after helping to make his show a hit the little woman must retire and sing nothing but lullabies for their kids. Guess his fragile little ego can't stand to share the spotlight.

And I just love the part where he regrets marrying Pons the morning after tells her that she's too skinny and he'll probably beat her but relents when he discovers what a good cook she is. Haw! Now that's comedy! Um yeah. There's just no escaping the sexism is there?There's really not much to recommend about this film except the always amusing Eric Blore delightful in his toofew scenes. He talks to a seal he talks about a seal he refuses to serve drinks as a waiter  it's all good. Lily Pons isn't the best actress  very limited range of facial expressions.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the type of film that might have appealed to audiences in 1935 but today you have to watch almost in secret because it could drive your neighbors to call the police on you for Lily Pon's voice disturbing the peace. It's loud and shrill certainly like no voice you'd hear on what remains of the radio. She's a runaway Parisian girl who meets American songwriter Henry Fonda wakes up married to him and accidentally becomes a successful opera star with a score that Fonda wrote but didn't get credit for while he stews over masculine pride. Fonda in his first year in films shows a potential for comedic timing and Pons is humorous in small doses. That voice though might get dogs yowling because that voice doesn't exist anymore outside indoor opera companies particularly European ones. One song about a jockey on a carousel expresses my sentiment about classic style music mixed with popular music it doesn't always work. Pons starts singing the song to a fidgety kid who is whaling yet immediately stops and looks up at her with a Cheshire cat grin as she starts her own yowling. Pretty soon everybody in this busy Paris district is joining in some for individual choruses and I cringed both in annoyance and amusement. When she tries to sing a bluesy number in a cafe it's totally out of place. Voices like hers are not made for musical comedy and even in the choral numbers it's far more high brow than operetta. The finale includes a fashion show that is camp now even if female audiences went gaga over it in 1935. Today it's a visual delight for drag queens who couldn't find what they were looking for in the color fashion show in The Women. Eric Blore and his barking seal Duchess get a few laughs but a scene revealing that Duchess has passed on dampens the light atmosphere. Lucille Ball unrecognizable pretty much as a platinum line gets prominent billing in the credits probably a rerelease after she was leading lady in B films but really has only one line. I keep forgetting about her and Fonda in this reunited 7 years later for The Big Street and 33 years later in Yours Mine and Ours. Pons tried to break into Jeanette MacDonald and Grace Moore territory in film but only made a small handful before returning to live performance. As for Fonda it would take a little time but a few years down the road he was the one writing his own ticket. This film has him way up sadly in the rear mezzanine.".

However I don't think it is that bad. It certainly isn't particularly good but it carries a certain fascination in the way that it unpeels a multilayered plot in a gleefully playful way. The main shortcoming is that some plot points are dealt with unclearly making it a bit tricky to figure out exactly what is going on. The ending in particular seems to be a bit confusing. However on the plus side there are some powerful visuals. There are also strong leading performances from Michael Caine and Anthony Quinn as well as a memorable turn from Anna Karina as one of Caine's exlovers. Candice Bergen gives a terrible performance but perhaps the character she is given to work with was unplayable anyway. Don't listen to the critics.

If you have a deep connection with the print you have to be able to temporarily wipe the preconceptions from your brain and deal with it as a distinct presentation of material or you're not going to like it.I'm pretty sure this is what happened amongst the literati who were expecting to see the book version of The Magus on screen. So they did a snobbish hatchet job via criticism.IMHO this is one of Anthony Quinn's best screen appearances. I can't think of anyone else who could have filled the role as well. Green's direction keeps the film moving right along. The location settings are wonderful. Got no problems with the script. Michael Caine plays a terrific selfserving exploiter of women and relationships but in fairness Anne is a gutless wimp asking to be exploited incapable of making her own decisions at least as rendered in the film. Candice Bergen does a very credible job in the schizo role of Lily.This movie deserves restoration into its original aspect ratio and rereleasing on DVD. And maybe like Eliot said in the bit from Little Gidding used in the flick you might arrive where you started and know the place for the first time.".

Quinn looking like Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt is actually pretty good but Caine looks like he's ready to explode. Bergen although stunning should NOT put on a British accent EVER. She's not very good at that type of thing. Guy Green's direction is fine but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the film you will not enjoy it. A real sour note is the casting of the effervescent Anna Karina in the completely joyless role of Caine's girlfriend.

Still what must have seemed like the turkey of the year when new has with time acquired a certain charm all its own! On the surface the film is certainly goodlooking shot by Billy Williams in numerous European locations mainly a sunny Greek island and boasts a fine score by Johnny Dankworth which in keeping with the film's theme seems oddly unsuited to what's going on the star cast responds competently to the mystifying plot structured like a Chinese box  where past events are constantly reenacted identities exchanged and of course nothing is what it seems. Still while Anthony Quinn may be everybody's idea of a Greek largerthanlife character here he is saddled with an unbecoming Picasso hairstyle and underneath it all Michael Caine may well have been mirroring the bewilderment felt by his character since in his autobiography he singles out THE MAGUS as his worst film ever though I personally would beg to differ and choose THE ISLAND 1980 for that unenviable spot! Actually it all reminded me of L'INVENZIONE DI MOREL 1974  another obscure islandset drama where a man intrudes upon a remote community sharing an exclusive fantasy existence incidentally that film was partly shot in my native country and also featured Anna Karina who in THE MAGUS has the rather thankless role of Caine's jilted girlfriend  though her performance is quite good and his callous treatment of Karina has a strong bearing on the main character's ultimate personal growth as the mystery woman who captivates the hero with this in mind as I lay watching the film under review I wondered at the possibilities had Karina exchanged her role with that of Candice Bergen who's too young for her role but great to look at nonetheless.Then again the subject matter was far more congenial to a Joseph Losey rather than the journeyman Guy Green...and one can only surmise how different  and more significant  the film would have been in the former's hands! As it stands there are some undeniably compelling passages but also a lot of shallow modishness the skinflick with Bergen and Julian Glover! at the climax is plain risible and lame moralizing the WWII flashback scenes featuring a bizarrely but effectively cast Corin Redgrave as the Nazi Commandant being especially maudlin.At several points towards the end it feels like the story is coming to some sort of conclusion but it just goes on and on peeling off yet another layer to the meandering enigma to get an inkling of what the film is like just imagine watching two of the more cerebral episodes of the cult TV series The Prisoner 196768 backtoback! In hindsight the film's epitaph may have been delivered by none other than Woody Allen who once remarked that if he had to live his life all over again he would do everything exactly the same...except watch THE MAGUS. As for myself I wouldn't mind taking another look at it in future by then I'd be over the initial shock and could perhaps appreciate it better...".

It fit a handy niche of layered narratives connected in ways that emulated the emergence of secret cosmologies. By itself it created a little stir because of the way it was folded by a certain kabbalistic technique while including reference to that technique. The history of this makes it essential viewing. Its Fowles' first novel partially autobiographical taking over a decade to write. Its grand risky sloppy. It is perfect in its way being as confusing in how it is written as the narrator within is. Its a happy accident that its deficiencies increase the effect.The screenplay is quite a bit more incompetent and at the same time leaving out most of the ambiguities in the story. So the film is a disaster. Fowles would later straighten up the narrative in the novel and issue what in the film world would be a director's cut which tries to keep the ambiguities in the story but reduce them in the narration. Its far less effective than the original.So why should you see this? Because it is a historical document that changed things significantly. Its based on two sources one was a then littleknown set of Kabbalistic lessons on Tarot ambiguities. The other is a piece of literary theory from the thirties Seven Types of Ambiguity. Don't search it out it is far less interesting than the title implies.Fowles simply conflated his own life and remorse over handling a romance into these two notions deliberately trying to capture the seven types  which incidentally inform my study of narrative folding.In September of 1966 while in Spain for the filming of How I Won the War John Lennon who hardly read anything read this twice once heavily rugged and it changed his life the direction of The Beatles and hence enfranchised a new form of narrative. He called and later visited Fowles while this script was in development. There is no artifact of that in the script. Its not Joyce but it is the child of what he envisioned dumbed down but still raising the bar for narrative structure and affecting  I assert  nearly everything.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Agreeably The Magus was confusing and many critics hated it. However very few novels can be condensed into a movie with all of the novel's major details. I do feel the movie captured the 'feel' of John Fowles book. It was mysterious beautiful Greek Isle scenery and a great cast especially a young and sexy Candice Bergen. I found it to be an excellent cautionary tale. When the movie was released I was a young college student aspiring to become a high school teacher. This created a strong sense of identity within me for the Michael Caine character and his punishment for bad behavior and later redemption. Warning watching The Magus on TV is a waste because of commercial interruptions and the editing massacred the script's flow leaving a very confusing plot. Unfortunately I do not think the flick is available on DVD?Postscript Good news. Cinema Classics Collection is schedule to release The Magus DVD on October 17 2006. Hopefully it will be an unedited release version?".

Sex violence and horror were equally balanced by beauty love courage and integrity. You know how there are scenes in movies that stick with you long after the film is over like Sixth Sense with Im ready tell you my secret...? There is one scene on the Veranda of the Greek Estate where Anthony Quinn summarizes the meaning of life with one sweep of his hand. During the past thirtyeight years I have thought of that scene frequently and it helps transcend cynicism from feeling defeated. Several weeks after my first viewing I went to see The Magus again with a woman who was experienced with Tarot and had studied Greek and Egyptian mythology. It seemed even more interesting when she explained the meaning of the symbolism as it related to the flow of the story and added a great deal to the meaning and the fun. People who often wonder What would God want me to do? may find this film troubling. A previous commenter mentioned the TV version with ads and I couldn't agree more.

When I wasn't confused there were certain scenes that grabbed my attention. Oddly enough I have a copy of the novel which I haven't read I say oddly because there are very few books that enter my sphere that go unread so I'm sure I'll get around to it eventually. As the movie was playing I'd pick up the novel and think Boy this sure is a thick book. I bet there are all sorts of thoughts and ideas the characters have in it that aren't finding their way into the film. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and I don't think movies based on literature have to be a dedicated recreation of their source material but the film had an overall vague feeling to it. I'm guessing that many people who detest The Magus probably don't care for the ending. I know it left me feeling less than satisfied in relation to all the scenes that preceded it. It seemed like what with all that Michael Caine experienced during the course of the movie that a more profound conclusion was in order.".

Users see hear and feel things that seem real to them but don't really exist. So this movie is like a big LSD trip. Or it's plot if one can call it that is imaginary but it isn't. Or is it real and not imaginary? I've never read any of John Fowles works. He was writing around the time I graduated from high school served in the Army and went to college. I've heard and read about him but his writing style and topics never appealed to me. So I wouldn't be able to compare this film to his novel by the same name. But I've always thought that a movie should stand on its own  no matter how faithful it is to its source material. That closeness or diversion from source material of course is one area of criticism. But a film or play is based on a plot or so we're taught in traditional theater and much more. It's the story the sets and scenery the technical works and most importantly the directing and the acting. The Magus seems to be plotless. Unless one considers that the message or conclusion is that Nicholas Urfe played by Michael Caine is a selfcentered selfish uncaring pleasureseeking and otherwise heartless waste of a human being. But I got that much in the first few minutes of the film  before all the machinations in the Mediterranean materialize or do they?. I can't really say much about the acting because the roles are multifaceted parts in a segmented plot that doesn't really exist. I know  it really doesn't make sense does it? But it's called art. I chuckle and hope you do too. So Fowles wrote in the 1960s. That was the time of the hippies the socalled sexual revolution and the emerging drug culture. Timothy Leary was expounding on the merits of LSD. He taught at Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley. He surely had considerable influence with the young generation of that time many of us excluded of course. Perhaps he influenced Fowles in his writing. Or was it the other way around? Or perhaps mutual?Whatever influences there were in the time of this film also made in the 1960s you will note one today might choose between watching this movie or taking some LSD is that the correct term? to achieve the same effect. That is minus any euphoria if there is such associated with LSD. But of course I recommend neither. My three stars are for the beautiful scenery and camera work. I would have given one more but the musical score was so bad and out of place that it even detracted from the scenery. Incidentally the movie is misleading on the meaning of the title. Anthony Quinn or Michael Caine's character explains that it is Latin for magic. That's a very minor definition. A Magus was a hereditary member of a pagan priestly class in ancient Media and Persia. The word is more commonly applied in modern times to sorcery. That's quite different from the tricks and illusions associated with modern magicians.".

He watched the movie against his will at school. But if you do enjoy opera and realise that in the time this movie is shot or represents the ladies didn't shave there armpits this is a pretty good movie. Good sets deep classic story and the camera work is okay but what can you aspect from an opera that is written to be watched from just 1 angle the audience in front of the stage. This movie is a French classic with all the good singing of an opera good sets average camerawork and good stage acting. An opera is always more body language because of the fact it used to be in a hard language to be understanded from the normal people.. So enjoy this movie!".

His work has long been a favorite of opera lovers that see in it an exciting time because of its magnificent music. Who hasn't been enchanted in hearing some of the famous arias from this work? The quality of the music is the main asset for its popularity.Francesco Rosi a talented Italian director and his collaborator Tonino Guerra a distinguished writer long involved with his country's cinema seemed the natural choices for translating Bizet's opera to the screen. Both succeeded in the way the adapted the material and took it to real locations for this extraordinary production.Carmen was a sultry woman who enchanted men with her beauty and with her passion for life. It's easy to see how she charms Don Jose the military man who loses his head because he has not met another woman like this beautiful Andalucian beauty. Their love will consume them both not before allowing them to bring all their fire into a doomed relationship.Placido Domingo perhaps the best rounded tenor of his generation makes a great Don Jose. Besides his virile presence Mr. Domingo has a treasured voice that even age doesn't seem to put a dent to it. He is a prodigy of endurance in a long career in which Don Jose has been one of his best roles. Julia Migenes projects such fire and passion she smolders the screen with her mere presence as Carmen. It's no wonder Don Jose loses his head over her. Ruggiero Raimondi another excellent singer plays Escamillo with his usual elegant style. Faith Esham is seen as Micaela Don Jose's loyal fiance who has no chance with him as he loses his soul to Carmen.Pasqualino DeSantis' camera work enhances the vision of Mr. Rosi. The editing by Renzo Mastroianni and Collette Samprum makes one appreciate the way they blended the music and the acting into seamless performance. The music was conducted by Lorin Maazel and the Paris Opera orchestra and chorus.Francesco Rosi deserves credit for this lovely opera film.".

The music by Bizet is just wonderful from its overture the Habernera the Toreador's Song the Card Triio to the explosive finale it is utterly gripping from beginning to end. The performances were brilliantno overacting as far as I could see. Julia MignesJohnson was everything Carmen should be flirtatious beautiful and sexy with a fine timbre to her voice. If you forgive the fact that Placido Domingo was a tad too old for Don Jose he still looked handsome and sang beautifully as we come to expect from him. Ruggero Raimondi was great as Escamillo what an amazing voice and Faith Esham was heartbreaking as Michaela. The entire chorus were fabulous the subtitles were easy to follow and so was the plot.

I tried streaming it. I even bought the DVD. But this film adaptation keeps boring me to tears and interjecting unnecessary dialogue coupled with scenery that is in sharp contrast to every operatic presentation I've ever seen of Carmen.In short Carmen is about a social climbing cigar making female worker who gains an admirer from a local constable but Carmen has her sights set much higher. Such is life. She flaunts her sexuality to get what she wants end of story.It's a pretty thin plot but it's considered a classic and has a singing narrative to hold the whole thing together. Regrettably Francesco Rosi's version is hampered by the fact that Carmen on stage is usually presented as being a very colorful opera but here we get a very drab and uninspired and perhaps even borderline vulgar production replete with sand dust earth tones everywhere uninspired camera angles but some decent performances from the leads.I've never much liked opera to begin with so perhaps I'm not the right person to review this title in spite of my understanding of the medium and with that in mind I have to say that opera is an old school entertainment vehicle that uses song to convey a story. My major beef one of many is that the reason the song is important on stage is that it conveys the narrative of the play being performed. When you take that away you lose the story. When you put it on location you're essentially doing what screenwriters call on the nose dialogue where in the thing you're describing is actually there. Therefore the singing becomes redundant but the singing was part of the whole reason you went to see an opera in the first place. On stage you can't show an airport or a stable full of horses. Therefore you sing about it to convey to the audience where you are and what you are doing.When you sing about the thing that's on screen in an opera you're almost insulting the intelligence of the audience.But the opera aficionado will disagree. Well it is just my opinion. But all that aside I always recall Carmen as being full of color as well as intrigue. I'm not a big fan of the opera but the colors and performances did add needed zing to a stage performance that is essentially about an easy goodlooking woman who wants more in life and is willing to trade in on her wiles to get it.The music of Carmen is actually pretty good which is what I think people keep coming back for as well as the choral pieces. But the story is fairly plain even if set against an Iberian backdrop.If you're a fan of opera and of this particular opera then you might want to give it a shot.Otherwise watch at your own risk.".

He uses cinema in a unique way to examine how the past shapes the present and how we in the present reshape the past in our memories. And while this is all quite serious the film also has a bleak sense of humor that shows its head now and again. A difficult but tremendously rewarding film. Note There seem to be two versions of the film in existence both supposedly 'approved' by the director.

It gives an excellent picture of how life must have been like in 16th century Mediterranean Europe. Although most of the characters speech and actions must necessarily be fictitious and some of the lesser plot devices are surely contrived just to carry forward the story the main events are actually true and because of this they give some insight into possible sources for some aspects of the great author's works. Cervantes actually did fight at the battle of Lepanto a critical confrontation with the Ottoman Turks who intended to continue their policy of overrunning Europe until this major defeat curbed them. Cervantes was captured and spent some years in captivity until finally ransomed. This film is fascinating in it's subtle foreshadowing of some of the immortal creations of literature such as Sancho Panza and Dulcineawhether they actually occurred in the fashion presented or no. Also the important central fact of the entire story is the gradual transition from zeal and idealism to disillusionment and resignation. The contrast of culturesfreedom and slavery is sensitively portrayed. Usually in an international epic with so many notable stars there are some who just don't fit..but in this case they are all wellacted to the degree that they inhabit the story and the period just as do the lesser players who are all very convincing. Cervantes the young rebel will entertain as well as educate and provide much food for thought.".

It also heralded the arrival of the Italian movie industry as a force to be reckoned with however briefly in the halcyon days before World War One.Produced by prolific director Mario Caserini 18741920 it features a completely static camera which has the effect of turning each shot into a living tableau.

After more than an hour of silver toned film the abrupt switch to red tints at the instant of the eruption is a definite attention grabber.Much of the acting is very theatrical  overripe but that was the style back then and was probably much affected by grand opera.

	schema:reviewBody "Lots of Foolish People Review Movies...I hope I don't number among them or any of those who reviewed this film and only saw it through their perverted spoiled vapid and jaded eyes and minds.This is an important film.  It happens to be one of the very first epics ever filmed.  And of the very first movies to have used special effects of this magnitude.In fact this movie predates BIRTH OF A NATION by two years.  Before POMPEII and CABIRIA movies were much shorter in length.  The fact that this movie became wildly popular even though it was the unheard length of over 90 minutes is a testament to its power then and now.It is pathetic to read reviews where people admit to laughing at this movie. It can only come from the uninformed and unsophisticated.Complaints that the movie is static stagy and uncinematic do not take into consideration that this was the way movies were made.  The medium was brand new.  The tradition of dramatic arts had no other precedence than the stage and the picture frame of the plastic arts as they had been until then. It was only until BIRTH OF THE NATION that the camerawork began to become interesting and creative.  Trial and error sparked these marvelous innovations which made BIRTH OF THE NATION the more famous landmark film.But back to POMPEII...I must admit that development of the story appeared to move at a stately pace and that the real action didn't begin to unfold until the final 20 minutes of the film.Yet I believe that this was done for several reasons.  The act of bringing us INTO the heart of one slave woman was motivated NOT just to fill in the screen time.  It was done so that we would care about her and those around her.  What worth is there in seeing a disaster for the disaster's sake  if we do not care about the lives of those involved in the tragedy?The other reason that it unfolded slowly at the beginning to create a contrast to the escalation that occurred at the end  which began within the germ of the slave girl's plight and literally exploded when Mt. Vesuvius blew up.The use of the red filter was a stroke of genius that truly emphasized the calamity which the damned residents of Pompeii suffered.  What is truly odd and I thought was a welltimed coincidence was the immediate and marked destruction of the film quality at the start of the devastation scene.  Had it been planned that way it would not have gone so well.  It was jarring and painful to watch.  When the film's quality improved we were offered a long series of different shots of the populace running in every direction and in an uncontrollable panic. Having been at the top of a local government building at the moment of the 911 tragedies I can well attest to the panic that can ensue when a great number of people feel their lives are being threatened at once. Hundreds of us ran down a dozen or so flights of stairs without even thinking our legs very nervously shaking our minds reeling with a panic unimaginable.I have visited Pompeii the remains of which demonstrates quite narrow streets that conclude at various piazzas.  To have been there and witnessed the scores of people attempting to escape the devastation with their lives must have been a most horrific and mindjarring experience.  I am sure many were trampled and many unintended mishaps occurred along the way.  To laugh at this depiction in this movie reflects a mindset which cannot conceive of the gravity of this situation.For me it was riveting to witness this spectacle.  It's obvious that I admire this film for its many virtues.  I will close with only one whimsical observation.  I was taken by the remarkable resemblance at least with what camera distance we were afforded of the slave girl to Miss Lillian Gish and her legendary waiflike countenance.  It added a bit of relish to the whole  even though I am sure that this sort of look and demeanor was quite the rage back then.  It turned my head in admiration and wonderment.The vast...and I mean vast crowds at the arena scene were breathtaking in scope though the limits of the artistic palette back then does not afford us the optimal view.I recommend this movie to the thoughtful film lover who will not protest to the idiosyncratic shortcomings that were so prevalent during the dawn of films and can be magnanimously forgiving for these minor peccadillos.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite its oldfashioned format and performances this early fulllength feature is still of some interest at least historically and it is probably a little better as a movie than many give it credit for. It was quite an ambitious attempt to tell a relatively involved story with some largescale settings and a few special visual effects.It follows a formula that may be even more popular now than it was in the 1910's take a tumultuous historical event introduce a set of fictional characters and show what was going on in their lives when the event took place. In this respect The Last Days of Pompeii may to some degree have established the formula that is still being used for films such as Titanic Pearl Harbor and many others. If you adjust for the limitations of its era The Last Days of Pompeii is at least as good as those films as well as many others of the genre.The story though sometimes too melodramatic and implausible is interesting enough most of the time and while the settings aren't going to impress anyone now they do display a fair amount of creative effort. None of the cast give particularly strong performances but their acting styles are not inherently any worse than the acting styles of the present. Some of the present day's most popular performers use affected artificial styles that are trendy now but that won't look any better in 90 years than the histrionics of this Italian cast look today.There's no denying the weaknesses many of which come from the tableau format andor from inexperience with telling a fulllength story on the silent screen. There are some stretches especially in the first half which move very slowly. Some of the characters especially Nidia could have been much more compelling with more creative filming and acting.Within just a few years the stereotyped tableau format would be largely abandoned better ways of telling a story would be developed and better ways of integrating the camera and the performers would be devised. While that might not make this film any better in itself it was the first few ambitious attempts like The Last Days of Pompeii that helped lead to such improvements. While it's only an average film in itself it deserves also to be remembered as a pioneering effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "This silent Italian melodrama may be a challenge for modern viewers but it's a must for real fans of the silent era. Along with other early Italian epics now available in great DVD editions such as Cabiria from 1914 these movies remind Americans that before World War I European filmmakers were creative pioneers who stretched the medium and the imaginations of American directors. This film version of the Pompeii story was shot with static cameras and looks a bit like a broadly acted stage production transfered to film. But the production is elaborate featuring stage sets as well as some location shooting. Just watching the images unfold in this twisted tale of love and jealousy on the eve of the disastrous eruption of Mt. Vesuvius can be fascinating as we peer back across the century at this 1913 release. To current sensibilities the film does reflect some prejudices of its era including the casting of an Egyptian priest as the mysterious evil force in Pompeii  an early example of a centurylong demonization of Arab figures in movies. However for viewers exploring early cinema who are familiar mainly with slapstick comedies and D.W. Griffith watching a preWWI Italian epic like this can be a fascinating experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "A young blind woman and her general misery provide the focus for this 1913 silent film. Her story is set against everyday life in Pompeii just before the eruption of the famous volcano.Visually the film consists of staged sets rather like modern stage plays. There is no camera movement. Actors mouth words we can't hear. The only sound is the music of a piano provided on behalf of DVD viewers. The music varies in tone with tonal variations in the story. Alternating with the play and to assist the visuals title cards convey a verbal sense of what will happen in the next scene.Acting is very very theatrical. When they move the players don't walk so much as they tiptoe across the stage in a selfconscious and stagy manner. When there's conflict the players overact exaggerating both body movements and facial expressions. But that was how it was done back then. Costumes are elaborate and at times ornate.Vesuvius erupts in the final few minutes of the film. Lots of smoke some soot a change in the film's tint to reddish falling pillars and predictable histrionics of the players comprise the special effects.Even aside from the simplicity of the special effects and the absence of sound the film is not likely to appeal to modern audiences if their purpose in watching films is to be entertained. For one thing the film's pacing is very slow. Also there's lots of filler material like scenes wherein characters sit around feeding pigeons. And I found it hard to identify with any of the characters. They seem too thinly drawn and remote.In its time The Last Days Of Pompeii must have seemed like a grand spectacle. We are fortunate to have the film now as a benchmark from which to compare contemporary films. Ergo for those interested in the history of the cinema and for those who want some perspective on modern filmmaking this film is a fine choice.".

All I can say is I'm glad I finally got it because this is a truly truly great motion picture. The lead actress is absolutely brilliant one of the greatest performances that I've ever seen why she didn't go on to megasuccess is beyond me although she likely was popular in her native Italy but it seems very little is known about her today and director Mario Caserini is every bit the artist that the much more celebrated America filmmakers of the time were  and actually more talented than most.

	schema:reviewBody "I love silent films. Not just the later polished ones of the 1920s but even the early and very early ones. So because I have seen any where from 10002000 silents I can see the context for films like The Last Days of Pompeii. And so while some might say 'wowthat movie was boring' I actually marvel at what a HUGE accomplishment the film was when it debuted. You see lengthy films like this one were pretty much unheard of and a long film might be 1520 minutes long like The Great Train Robbery or The Voyage To The Moon. So at almost an hour and a half in length this WAS a radical departure for films. I have seen documentaries that have proclaimed that Birth of a Nation was THE first fulllength film but The Last Days of Pompeii debuted two years earlier. As for the sets while the backgrounds were often giant paintings often they were not and the realism was great for 1913. There were real live lions and a nice crowd scene. The costuming was also GENERALLY good for its time but what's with including all these ridiculously attired Egyptians in Italy?! It's as if someone said We're running short on costumesquick dress some of the extras up as Egyptians!. Another problem with the film is that plot. While the story of the blind girl and the lovers is mildly interestingit's only mildly interesting. The narrative isn't enthralling though the sad ending was...well...sad.Rating this film is tough. When seen today its deficiencies are obvious. But in 1913 it created quite a stirand rightfully so. There also is the historical importance of the film to think about...so coming up with a numerical score is problematic. I'd give it an 8 simply because of its originality and scope.By the way if you are looking to see the best film about Pompeii see the made for TV movie Pompeii The Last Day 2003. It's simply outstanding in every way and quite touching as it dramatizes in a very realistic way the final moments of some of the volcano's victims.".

Only one character in the film has a Roman name despite it taking place in Pompeii and the name that that one man has is of a family that had been extinct for a couple of decades by the time that the film takes place in the last few days before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE. To this film anyone wearing a bedsheet counts as a Roman. In this melodrama prominent man falls in love with one woman on the same day as he buys a blind female slave away from an abusive mistress. The blind slave is so grateful that she quickly falls in love with him stumbling after him with arms outstretched as he takes his fiance for a walk. The blind girl goes to the priest of Isis who gives her a potion purported to be a love potion but really a potion that causes insanity I don't recall why he particularly hates the guy. The blind girl poisons the guy the priest frames the guy for murder. The priest locks the blind girl in a dungeon and the guy is sentenced to be eaten by lions. In the film's only decent sequence the blind girl fools the slave left behind to protect her by performing a bogus magic trick and then stealing his keys when he is unaware. She goes to save the guy but then right before the soldiers can feed him to the lions there is a very angry deus ex machina as Vesuvius begins to erupt. The citizens of Pompeii run around in circles flailing their arms not even attempting to escape. The blind girl leads the insane guy to a boat ?! but he and the other people leaving in the boat just leave her behind to be engulfed in lava. The film is worthless although nearer the end it does start to become unintentionally funny. However it's not near funny enough to warrent any sort of recommendation. This should have been lost with the multitude of other silents that were being made at the time. 210.".

	schema:headline " Guiliano Gemma in a sinister Western";
	schema:reviewBody "No wonder that California isn't as popular as so many other SpaghettiWestern. It is entertaining but not funny like My Name is Nobody or violent like Four of the Apocalypse. IMO California is one of the last real Spaghetti Western but the filmmakers didn't want to do a typical Western. Somehow it reminds of one of the many 50's Western flicks but with a darker a more sinister story. Maybe you can compare California with Keoma or The great Silence. Also like in these Movies it isn't so easy to say who really the hero is. Is it Guiliano Gemma as California who hates his old name and has enough from all that Killing and Shooting? His opponent is Raimund Harmsdorf a German actor and is best known in supporting roles in so many BMovies or German TV Shows. In California Harmsdorf has a fairly good role and he did some fine acting. He is a ruthless Bounty Hunter who kills Confederates Soldiers for Money. Unfortunately politics changes and he is getting an Outlaw. For a SW there are interesting characters and not just a faceless Hero and his Villain. Sorry but the figures aren't simply Black and White in this drama and there are no funny jokes of Guiliano.I wasn't quite happy with this melodramatic Organ 70's like Music. In some way it fits in some not. The photography is bleach and the environment looks dirty. Towns and people seemed to be destroyed by the war and this world has nothing to do with the beauty as you can see in Once Upon a Time in the West. Some Scenes are taking place in a Ghost Town. These Scenes are very climatic and give the audience more of the Apocalyptic Feeling. The Storyline has two parts. A travel at the end of the American Civil War and then a Vendetta as it we have already seen in so many contributions to the Genre. But it wouldn't be a typical Spaghetti Western if this Vendetta wouldn't be different. California 1977 hasn't a lot in common with Gemma's first western A Pistol for Ringo 1964.For me this melodramatic western was a big surprise. The storyline and the figures are fine written. It's not a Feel Good Movie or just another action loaded Hero Tale of the West. Of course it has some flaws and there are some weak points in the second part but overall it's an interesting flick. Director Michelle Lupo did a good job and it was his last serious western too. Buddy goes West 1981is more a Comedy than a Western. One year later Lucio Fulci master of Giallo and Horror directed a Spaghetti Western with a similar look Silver Saddle 1978. Guiliano Gemma is the main cast again but Fulci's Movie isn't so sinister and dark than this one. IMO these two Movies were the last Highlights of the Spaghetti Western Genre and then this fascinating Genre ended.".

Meantime  Michael falls in love for a beautiful woman  Helen Preston Paola Bose . But she is captured and later on  California sets out in pursuit the kidnappers and seeks vendetta against the cutthroats . Charming ChorizoSpaghetti Western coproduced by Spain  Italy and follows the American models regarding the twilight Western  as well as Sergio Leone style . This Western is a superior outing because it displays violence  thrills  emotion  shoot'em up  brawls  intrigue  riding pursuits and many other things . There is plenty of action and violent events in the movie  guaranteeing some shots or stunts every few minutes . This sinister picture is a tale of justice and revenge  as a soldier carries out a hard mission to execute a merciless vengeance when his friend is hanged and his girlfriend is kidnapped . The basic plot is typical spaghetti western fare  but what makes this movie stand out is its style . The lightingpaced storyline slows down at times  but frenetic fightaction sequences make up for it . The starring called Michael California is stunningly played by Giuliano Gemma . Giuliano is very fine  he ravages the screen  he jumps  bounds and leaps  hit and run . Gemma as a brave and twofisted Confederate military is terrific . Gemma  along with Anthony Steffen and Gianni Garco  results to be one of the greatest stars of the Spaghetti genre . Gemma in his beginning worked as stuntman  practiced many sports in his life boxing  gymnastics such as is well proved at the movie . Then the director  Duccio Tessari gave him the first role as protagonist in the film  The Titani and the first spaghetti western films where he often worked under the name of Montgomery Wood  playing Western as A pistol for Ringo subsequently the would play similar role in other Spaghettis  as The return of Ringo and others as Adios Gringo Arizona Colt The price of power  Day of anger and later California. However his first big opportunity came with the important Italian director Luchino Visconti in El Gatopardo this was followed by important roles in Angelica  Tenebre  Young Lions and The master touch. Then he played his most significant roles in Il Deserto Dei Tartari and Il Prefetto Di Ferro . In the movie appears habitual support actors as Spanish people  Miguel Bose  Paola Bose  Diana Lorys  as Italian secondaries  Chris Avram  Enzo Fiermonte  Franco Fantasia  Alfio Catabiano  Alberto Dell'Acqua  Ottaviano Dell'Acqua  Roberto Dell'Acqua  Tom Felleghy  and  of course  the ordinary Robert Hundar . They are a lot of secondaries from B Italian series seen in several genres as Spaghetti Western and Peplum . It's a coproduction SpanishItalian and shot on location in Almeria  Spain  and Lazio  Rome . There are many fine technicians  as nice assistant direction  excellent production design by Carlo Simi  Sergio Leone's regular  and atmospheric cinematography by Alejandro Ulloa  he creates a magnificent scenario on the interior ranch and barren outdoors  scrawny villages as well as dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun . Adequate and sad music original by Gianni Ferrio in Spaghetti style . The musician composes a nice Spaghetti soundtrack and well conducted and including splendid leitmotif  it's full of enjoyable sounds and emotive score .This is one of the last and best Spaghettis and was compellingly directed by Michele Lupo who made all kinds of genres . Lupo directed various Bud Spencer vehicles as Bulldozer  The Supersheriff Buddy go west and E.T. and the Supersheriff . Lupo directed Giuliano Gemma  his fetish actor  in several films as Master touch with Kirk Douglas  Stay away with Amidou  Arizona Colt with Fernando Sancho and Nello Pazzafini and California  with William Berger and Romano Puppo. This is an acceptable entertaining juvenile that will appeal to Western buffs . Rating  essential and fundamental watching for for Giuliano Gemma fans. Rating  Above average Pasta Western .

I have the feeling that the makers of this movie knew the end was drawing near and decided to make something really memorable. It has an offbeat storyline for one thing. It starts off as a tale of two Civil War vets struggling across the countryside then changes to a tale of one of the vets finding peace and love on a farm then in the last half hour turns into a quest for revenge and the recovery of a kidnapped love. These changes helped keep the story from being unpredictable and kept me interested at every point. Additional interest is with the production values with eyecatching ghost towns and a ton of rain and filth in the movie's first third that help make what we see feel authentic. If there is a problem with the movie it's that the musical score is greatly uneven sometimes sounding okay but other times sounding lame and cheap.

The man becomes an outlaw when released from a prison camp on account of the end of the civil war tough break!

	schema:reviewBody "If you want a generalized account of the Bronte Family DEVOTION is not bad  but it is not really good history. Basically in the 1810s to 1830s Reverend Patrick Brunte which he changed to Bronte was in charge of the parsonage of Haworth in Yorkshire. He and his wife had six children five girls and a son. Most people forget there were two older sisters than Charlotte Emily and Anne and their brother Bramwell but the two older daughters died prematurely of lung problems which would bedevil all the Brontes.In that isolated parsonage the Bronte children entertained themselves by making up stories about a fabulous place called Great Glass Town that was ruled by England's superhero of the day the Duke of Wellington. As they grew older they would write down their stories about this wonderful place  and soon they were also writing down poetry. All that is but Bramwell. He was very bright and promising and it was hoped he would develop his considerable talents as a draftsman and artist. He was even sent to a boarding school. But Bramwell developed a love for drinking and the early promise of his brilliance eventually dissipated. He would also be the first of the better remembered children to die.Before Bramwell died he would live to see the success of his three sisters. Charlotte Emily and Anne joined together to publish a volume of poetry called POEMS BY CURRER ELLIS  ACTON BELL. The reason for the pseudonyms was that in 1839 it was very unusual for woman to write fiction or poetry. So the girls figured it would not hurt to pretend they were men. The poetry worked well and soon Charlotte and Emily sent into London the manuscripts of their two novels JANE EYRE and WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Again both were under the pseudonyms. The two novels were acclaimed as was a novel by Anne called THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL published as Acton Bell. The novels gained the attention of William Thackeray and he wrote a glowing review of them  especially of JANE EYRE. Charlotte wrote to Thackeray and arranged a trip to meet him in London. Then he learned that these three novelists and poets were women.Thackeray became their greatest booster. It's nice to know that Emily was aware of this because she died shortly after Bramwell did  after nursing him. Anne wrote a novel AGNES GRAY and then her health failed too and she died. Now Reverend Bronte found only one child of his six was still alive. Charlotte wrote her problem of England novel called SHIRLEY. In 1853 a third novel VILLETTE which most critics consider better than JANE EYRE was published. Charlotte married the Reverend Arthur Bell Nichols in 1854 and within a year she died giving birth to a still born child. A posthumous novel actually an early version of VILLETTE called THE PROFESSOR was published. So was a small fragment called EMMA. Reverend Bronte died in 1861 having survived his six children but knowing that at least three were remembered as writers. Charlotte's husband Reverend Nichols died in 1901.For a family that has maintained popular interest from their heyday to today the total literary output of seven novels and a book of poetry is small. But eventually their fans would also have the dozens of surviving notebooks of their childhood fantasies of Great Glass Town as well and even Bramwell's etchings and attempts at painting retain interest. For all it's tragedy of early death the Brontes retain our fascination as an unexpected blossoming of genius that was cut too short.DEVOTION as I said earlier was close to an outline of the story. It showed some of the biographical background that would shape Charlotte's Olivia de Haviland's and Emily's Ida Lupino's fiction Emily's love for the wild moors which would translate into her imagery for Heathcliff and Cathy Earnshaw in HEIGHTS and Charlotte's infatuation with a foreign tutor she knew in Belgium a nice performance by Victor Francken which is used in creating the character of Paul in VILLETTE. But the fiction is tied to a ruthless streak in Charlotte at her more talented sister's expense especially over Reverend Nichols Paul Henreid. Actually Emily never yearned for Nichols or any man Charlotte liked. Bramwell Arthur Kennedy is closer to Emily and tries to support her  but he's undermined by his drinking and declining health. Anne Bronte Nancy Coleman is unfortunatley typically given short shrift beside her two better known sister novelists.Thackeray is played by Sidney Greenstreet who physically and intellectually matches the rotund genius who gave us BARRY LYNDON VANITY FAIR and HENRY ESMOND. He shows an appreciation of Charlotte and shepherds her around London guarranteeing her social success. But he also realizes  good novelist and critic that he is  that Emily's writing has a raw power that Charlotte's politer writing lacks. But the movie misses that Thackeray's interest in Charlotte and JANE EYRE may have been based on the figure of Rochester's mad wife in the attic Bertha. It seems Thackeray also had an insane wife. However his social snobbery is deliciously given when he sneers at some street urchins Not my public! and when he warns Charlotte against an author they pass  Charles Dickens.DEVOTION is a entertaining film and a good way to get an audience to look into the Brontes and their literary work. At very least it leads one to view some movie version of JANE EYRE or WUTHERING HEIGHTS.".

It may not be an accurate biography in fact some critics said it should have been called 'Distortion' but thanks to fine performances and Erich Wolfgang Korngold's magnificent score it's fascinating to watch. Particularly effective is the montage showing a horse and rider against a cloudy sky as death approaches Emily Bronte and Korngold's music mounts as he comes closer and closer. Wonderful moment of imagery.Whatever its shortcomings I cannot praise Erich Wolfgang Korngold's score enough. It's one of his most magnificent and stands with KINGS ROW as one of his best film scores adding majesty and atmosphere to many of the film's most dramatic scenes.Trivia note DEVOTION has a strange history. It was actually filmed and finished in 1943 while de Havilland was still under contract to the studio. When she launched her famous legal battle against them for adding suspension time to the end of her contract Jack Warner decided to punish her.

	schema:reviewBody "To say that DEVOTION is an accurate representation of the lives of Emily and Charlotte Bronte is as erroneous as saying that 1939's WUTHERING HEIGHTS and 1944's JANE EYRE are flawless film interpretations of their respective novels. Viewers who seek to learn all they can about the sisters Bronte should look elsewhere. Those who wish to be enveloped in a wellwritten wellacted tale of two of the greats of English literature should tune in whenever possible.Ida Lupino and Olivia de Havilland turn in rich performances as Emily and Charlotte Bronte. Although much of the history in this film is distorted these woman effectively convey the personalities of the actual Bronte women as evidenced in scholarly research throughout the years. Charlotte played by de Havilland was known for being very outspoken and driven toward making connections in the literary world and becoming a success. Her view was that life was just a series of experiences that provided her with material on which to base her prose. De Havilland conveys a dualistic Bronte showing both her bold and outspoken tendencies as well as her actual naive nature. Charlotte is challenged by the fact that although not particularly wellversed in love and life she has composed one of the greatest novels the literary world has ever known Jane Eyre. Throughout the movie we see a definite transition in Charlotte...the eldest Bronte indeed grows up.For her part Emily played by Lupino was much more introverted preferring to use her experiences on the moors of Northern England and her own personal emotions to create her sole novel Wuthering Heights. Lupino conveys a very intense very troubled woman in her portrayal of Emily Bronte. Lupino and Arthur Kennedy effectively show the closeness that existed between Emily and Branwell Bronte and their scenes together are among the most touching in the film. Lupino also has a mastery of the rather literary dialogue here as she lends conviction to every line she is given.Bottom line If you want a complete and true account of the lives of the Bronte sisters track down an AE Biography on the topic. Although the characters in DEVOTION are reasonably true to the actual women and the leading ladies play them well the facts are skewed. Better yet grab copies of Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights as most editions of the novels have thorough biographical notes on the authors some even written by Charlotte Bronte. For a general notion of what made these women tick however watch DEVOTION. Just remember literary license does apply.".

Those who wish to be enveloped in a wellwritten wellacted tale of two of the greats of English literature should tune in whenever possible.Ida Lupino and Olivia de Havilland turn in rich performances as Emily and Charlotte Bronte. Although much of the history in this film is distorted these woman effectively convey the personalities of the actual Bronte women as evidenced in scholarly research throughout the years. Charlotte played by de Havilland was known for being very outspoken and driven toward making connections in the literary world and becoming a success. Her view was that life was just a series of experiences that provided her with material on which to base her prose. De Havilland conveys a dualistic Bronte showing both her bold and outspoken tendencies as well as her actual naive nature. Charlotte is challenged by the fact that although not particularly wellversed in love and life she has composed one of the greatest novels the literary world has ever known Jane Eyre. Throughout the movie we see a definite transition in Charlotte...the eldest Bronte indeed grows up.For her part Emily played by Lupino was much more introverted preferring to use her experiences on the moors of Northern England and her own personal emotions to create her sole novel Wuthering Heights. Lupino conveys a very intense very troubled woman in her portrayal of Emily Bronte. Lupino and Arthur Kennedy effectively show the closeness that existed between Emily and Branwell Bronte and their scenes together are among the most touching in the film. Lupino also has a mastery of the rather literary dialogue here as she lends conviction to every line she is given.Bottom line If you want a complete and true account of the lives of the Bronte sisters track down an AE Biography on the topic. Although the characters in DEVOTION are reasonably true to the actual women and the leading ladies play them well the facts are skewed. Better yet grab copies of Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights as most editions of the novels have thorough biographical notes on the authors some even written by Charlotte Bronte. For a general notion of what made these women tick however watch DEVOTION. Just remember literary license does apply.";

	schema:reviewBody "Ida Lupino is Emily Bronte and Olivia de Havilland is Charlotte Bronte in Devotion a 1946 film made in 1943 and shelved which tells the story of the two sisters their sister Anne and their brother Branwell Arthur Kennedy.In essence the Bronte sisters led sad miserable and short lives  there was nothing romantic about the moors as much as they seem so in the Bronte books. The sisters enjoyed poor health their brother was a disgrace and their father a cold man with a violent temper. Only with the entrance of their aunt into their lives was much attention paid to them. She was a warm woman who saw to their education and gave them structure.What the Bronte sisters had was imagination and plenty of it and they exercised their imaginations with their writings.Devotion is a lovely film with a wonderful performance by Ida Lupino as the tragic Emily. Olivia de Havilland does a good job as Charlotte shown in the film as selfish and a man magnet. In truth she was ugly and considered herself so and while she did develop a crush on Constantin Heger Victor Francen the affection doesn't seem to have been returned. All of Charlotte's success happened after Emily's death not where it does in the film and the reason the girls left school was not because of their brother's illness but because of their aunt's death.The eternally underrated Arthur Kennedy is excellent as Branwell shown here as only a drunk. Branwell did have several jobs none of which he kept had an affair with an older married woman which was an open scandal and is suspected of eating opium as well as drinking. However it is true that Charlotte was angry with him.Charlotte did marry Nicholls and died eight months later but there was no love triangle with Emily. Nor was Nicholls as in the film the model for the mysterious romantic men in Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. The fact that this love triangle is represented as inspiration for the men in their novels in Devotion is a good case for Paul Henried being miscast. The movie was made during the war when there were no men around and Warner Brothers would never have given a star like Errol Flynn a supporting role. But the role of Nicholls given his importance in the film cried out for someone a little more dashing and handsome.Sydney Greenstreet appears as William Thackery in a small but showy role toward the end of the film.The film was shelved in 1943 because of a lawsuit filed by Olivia de Havilland against Warner Brothers in 1946 though she won the suit the movie was released due to the big success of her film To Each His Own for Paramount.Devotion is worth seeing but not as a true story of the Bronte sisters.".

For his time he's a pretty liberal sort of fellow who insists on an education for his daughters. But his real concern is his dissolute son Branwell played by Arthur Kennedy. He's a painter and a misunderstood genius. Truth be told he's a bit of a lout as well but his sisters love him.This film has such an odd history it was made in 194344 and held up deliberately by the brothers Warner while Olivia DeHavilland was in court with them over her contract. She won the case and left to freelance but the film stayed on the shelf until 1946 when DeHavilland got rave reviews for To Each His Own which garnered her first Oscar. After that Jack Warner being the practical sort decided spite was not a luxury he could indulge in and he released Devotion to cash in on Olivia's new found box office.Because of that this film became the farewell performance of Montagu Love who played a great variety of parts going back to the early silent days. Paul Henreid is in this as well as the young curate assigned to Love's parish. His Viennese accent crops out occasionally during the film making him sound a bit odd for an English clergyman. Still he does a fine job.Lupino and DeHavilland are a well matched pair of sisters. But acting honors definitely go to Arthur Kennedy. It's an expansive part that Kennedy makes the most of.

Most of this is because I am a history teacher and the studios in particular Warner Brothers generally played very fast and loose with the truth. In so many ways the story is a very warped view of the truth as the studio was much more interested in selling tickets than telling the audience about this very complex family. In many ways the leading characters are more like cartoon characters and they behave very inconsistentlysuch as the curate's romance with Charlotte that just appeared out of nowhere.Now if you ignore the distortions and there are many and you ignore occasionally onedimensional writing you are left with some decent actors wearing pretty clothes running about nice sets and it's all set to lovely music. Olivia DeHavilland was given just awful dialog and came off as a headstrong and fickle ladytoo much to have been a great lady or world famous author. Arthur Kennedy was a complete rotter and that actually wasn't too far from the true character. And of all the siblings Ida Lupino as Emily came off bestas a more fully developed and rational person. Entertaining perhaps but the film made me long for an honest and realistic portrayalnot a jumble of confusing characters and motivations. Also based on the way her part was written I could understand why Miss DeHavilland sued to get out of her contract after completing this film!! Great actresslousy part.UPDATE I received an email from Doylenf indicating that it is probable that the film was held due to DeHavilland's contract problems with Warner Brothers. This makes a lot of sense as the studio was incensed when she fought in court and eventually won to end the studio system that forced actors to accept whatever their bosses demanded giving them no choice in projects.

Writers Theodor Reeves and Keith Winter have been unknown names to me up to now and they don't have extensive filmographies. I would certainly like to find more of their work. As the literary and wellformed ripostes and counterthrusts bounce from one character to another and as the priceless bonmots sparkle forth from Greenstreet's Thackeray I thought I was at a play by Shaw or Oscar Wilde. Greenstreet was much underappreciated I thought by your other reviewers. His entertaining and witty part was really the best in the movie.As a typical example of the quality of the script are Arthur Kennedy's words as Branwell lies dying in his sister's arms. Having collapsed in the street on his way to the tavern he comments that his collapses usually occur on his way home from the tavern not on his way there.I saw a recent version of Jane Eyre the other day on public television the first time I had seen a film of it. I've never seen the one from the early 1940s. I was struck by the resemblances to Dickens' David Copperfield and Nicholas Nickleby and how Charlotte Bronte established herself here as a female Dickens.One could easily become devoted to Devotion.

Therefore I didn't know the movie was a bio on The Brontes seems scriptor Kent Winter had a good imagination. I saw in on TCM's tribute to Ms. Lupino Emily Bronte.I agree the cast for Devotion was great and Sydney Greenstreet Dame May Witty Nancy Coleman Anne Bronte and all the others were very good in their roles......but also agree that Arthur Kennedy Bramwell stole the show.

Ida Lupino as Emily makes the film together with Arthur Kennedy as Branwell and they are convincing enough. Olivia de Havilland is all wrong as Charlotte and everything she does is wrong  she has never been less convincing. Paul Henreid is all right although his character is very constructed. It's true that he later married Charlotte he even made her pregnant and because of that she died at 38 in childbed only a few years after her sisters and Branwell so the widowed father had to bury them all who is completely shadowed away in the film and is given no real character at all.What saves the film is Sydney Greenstreet as Thackeray suddenly you are brought to a convincing character and reality of literary London in the early Victorian days and another very successful detail is the music. Korngold succeeds in giving just the right atmosphere by his soft and subtle music very much like Bernard Herrmann and also the other music is well found There is Beethoven and Schubert some Lanner some Chopin and nothing later than of that age except Korngold himself of course.Olivia de Havilland makes a mess of the sisters' engagement in Brussels and that's the worst part of the film a completely misapprehended Hollywood conjecture of the worst kind and Branwell's death scene is also a vulgar exaggeration.Well there is so much wrong with this film that it's a miracle it's worth seeing at all mainly because of the truly Brontan conversation eloquent and witty all the way especially when Branwell is involved Ida Lupino's strong and convincing performance as always the successful rendering of the environment and the atmosphere the music while the worst blunder of the film is the complete obfuscating of Anne Bront. The film states that two of the Bront sisters were geniuses. No they were three and all the sisters were agreed that Branwell was the number one genius among them.Compare it with To Walk Invisible of last year the one perfect Bront biopic completely true and almost documentary all the way although enough dramatic as well while this film will land and stay in the shadow.".

From what I've read you'd have to say this is a very loose telling of their biographies but it seems as if the basic facts are there. But I have to say at least as portrayed here there wasn't a Bronte that I would have wanted to know. The whole family seemed defective almost like characters out of a Lillian Hellman play if Hellman had written plays about England.Ida Lupino is the standout here as Emily Bront although generally I wasn't that impressed with Lupino as an actress despite her success. Paul Henreid as the reverend was interesting he was an actor who had a somewhat brief golden era before his career plummeted here he was quite good. Olivia de Havilland's Charlotte Bront was pretty much totally unlikable...so much so that I had difficulty judging the quality of her acting though I normally very much enjoyed her films. Sydney Greenstreet as William Makepeace Thackeray was Sidney Greenstreet. I'm not sure I agree with the praise I've read here about Arthur Kennedy as Branwell Bront seems like just one more of Kennedy's neer do well roles which seemed to make up the bulk of his career. It was a little disappointing to see so little done with Dame May Witty here.For the most part the film is nicely done. I almost would have thought it an MGM production of the era rather than Warner Brothers. The one effect that was not up to par was the imaginary horseman. Recommended to watch once but I doubt many will see this as a favorite.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time we meet Arthur Kennedy as Branwell Bronte brother of THE Brontes he's carousing on the grass with De Havilland as Charlotte the more headstrong of the sisters. He tosses her into the pond while they both laugh. Ida Lupino as Emily the sober and sensitive one chides them. Branwell snaps back I am sickened by your idealistic prattle. Anne the third sister looks on with a smile.That first scene tells us a lot. First of all everyone is too close too happy. Little do they know that tragedy lies just around the corner although the screenwriters know it all too well. Second this character Branwell is headed for trouble. I figured he was dead meat correctly as it turned out. Third Charlotte is going to have to go through some troublesome times that will drain her of that excess lan before she finds happiness. Fourth sullen Emily will finally find some lonely soul who has adored her from afar  perhaps a village cobbler  and settle quietly down into a life of pastoral torpor. Fifth no matter what her accomplishments Anne won't be seen much in the movie.I was wrong on Number Four. Paul Henreid comes to the village as a gentle vicar not a cobbler. Emily falls for him hard. It's obvious to Henreid but Emily's love remains unspoken and unrequited. Charlotte the gay little thing develops an ambivalent attraction to him as well but she's so wrapped up in herself that she doesn't notice Emily sulking in the background.By the way the screenwriters are so clumsy that few viewers will discern any real attraction between Charlotte and Henreid so that when they fall into each other's arms at the end it comes as a big surprise  I love you Charlotte. I've always loved you. Or maybe my intuition is getting rusty. Women are better at these things than men.Emily was the one who wrote Wuthering Heights a tragic tale and Charlotte wrote Jane Eyre which isn't nearly so sepulchral. I just mention that in case you get them mixed up as I often do.As Emily Ida Lupino is pretty but withdrawn and doesn't seem like she'd be much fun to be married to anyway. She has a recurring dream in which she stands alone on the foggy moor in the moonlight and a dark figure on a horse gallops up to her. In her final such dream the figure sweeps her up and carries her off.Olivia De Havilland is bright wide eyed and breathless although she's no longer the frangible kid she'd been ten years earlier in Captain Blood. She has a delightful laugh and in one scene reveals a charming but modest bosom. With the success of Jane Eyre she gets swept up in the London literary life with William Vanity Fair Thackerey and she gets a glimpse of Charles Dickens. Her novel is a runaway success. The book shop windows are piled with copies. If my work had been promoted with such abandon it would have become a best seller too. I'd have made a lot of money and you can be sure I wouldn't be sitting here pounding out movie reviews for nothing. Come to think of it I don't like her too much.As the vicar that the two women hunger for Paul Henreid is a sympathetic character but his looks and gentlemanly demeanor do nothing for me. Arthur Kennedy I think is miscast. He's great at certain kinds of roles whining and indignant but he's not the son of a vicar on an isolated English moor.I have no idea how closely the screenplay sticks to historical facts. If the other examples of period Hollywood biographies are any guide not very close. The musical score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold is subdued and enchanting. It's hard to believe this is the same composer who gave us the bombastic scores for Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk. The special effects get the job done nicely. That dark horse and dark rider emerging from the misty gloom is pretty spooky.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first time we meet Arthur Kennedy as Branwell Bronte brother of THE Brontes he's carousing on the grass with De Havilland as Charlotte the more headstrong of the sisters. He tosses her into the pond while they both laugh. Ida Lupino as Emily the sober and sensitive one chides them. Branwell snaps back I am sickened by your idealistic prattle. Anne the third sister looks on with a smile.That first scene tells us a lot. First of all everyone is too close too happy. Little do they know that tragedy lies just around the corner although the screenwriters know it all too well. Second this character Branwell is headed for trouble. I figured he was dead meat correctly as it turned out. Third Charlotte is going to have to go through some troublesome times that will drain her of that excess lan before she finds happiness. Fourth sullen Emily will finally find some lonely soul who has adored her from afar  perhaps a village cobbler  and settle quietly down into a life of pastoral torpor. Fifth no matter what her accomplishments Anne won't be seen much in the movie.I was wrong on Number Four. Paul Henreid comes to the village as a gentle vicar not a cobbler. Emily falls for him hard. It's obvious to Henreid but Emily's love remains unspoken and unrequited. Charlotte the gay little thing develops an ambivalent attraction to him as well but she's so wrapped up in herself that she doesn't notice Emily sulking in the background.By the way the screenwriters are so clumsy that few viewers will discern any real attraction between Charlotte and Henreid so that when they fall into each other's arms at the end it comes as a big surprise  I love you Charlotte. I've always loved you. Or maybe my intuition is getting rusty. Women are better at these things than men.Emily was the one who wrote Wuthering Heights a tragic tale and Charlotte wrote Jane Eyre which isn't nearly so sepulchral. I just mention that in case you get them mixed up as I often do.As Emily Ida Lupino is pretty but withdrawn and doesn't seem like she'd be much fun to be married to anyway. She has a recurring dream in which she stands alone on the foggy moor in the moonlight and a dark figure on a horse gallops up to her. In her final such dream the figure sweeps her up and carries her off.Olivia De Havilland is bright wide eyed and breathless although she's no longer the frangible kid she'd been ten years earlier in Captain Blood. She has a delightful laugh and in one scene reveals a charming but modest bosom. With the success of Jane Eyre she gets swept up in the London literary life with William Vanity Fair Thackerey and she gets a glimpse of Charles Dickens. Her novel is a runaway success. The book shop windows are piled with copies. If my work had been promoted with such abandon it would have become a best seller too. I'd have made a lot of money and you can be sure I wouldn't be sitting here pounding out movie reviews for nothing. Come to think of it I don't like her too much.As the vicar that the two women hunger for Paul Henreid is a sympathetic character but his looks and gentlemanly demeanor do nothing for me. Arthur Kennedy I think is miscast. He's great at certain kinds of roles whining and indignant but he's not the son of a vicar on an isolated English moor.I have no idea how closely the screenplay sticks to historical facts. If the other examples of period Hollywood biographies are any guide not very close. The musical score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold is subdued and enchanting. It's hard to believe this is the same composer who gave us the bombastic scores for Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk. The special effects get the job done nicely.

	schema:reviewBody "Although it is always stressed that this movie is totally fictitious there were many aspects of it that were true and helped me to learn more about the Bront family whose history can be Googled. For example Emily and Charlotte were only two of four children who had some promising artistic talent. All four of these siblings were born and died in fairly close time periods.The Bronts brntiz commonly brntez1 were a nineteenth century literary family associated with the village of Haworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire England. The sisters Charlotte 18161855 Emily 18181848 and Anne 18201849 are well known as poets and novelists. Like many contemporary female writers they originally published their poems and novels under male pseudonyms Currer Ellis and Acton Bell. Their stories immediately attracted attention although not always the best for their passion and originality. Charlotte's Jane Eyre was the first to know success while Emily's Wuthering Heights Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and other works were later to be accepted as masterpieces of literature. From WikipediaThe three Bront sisters and their brother Branwell were very close and during childhood developed their imaginations first through oral storytelling and play set in an intricate imaginary world and then through the collaborative writing of increasingly complex stories set therein. I totally enjoyed this movie and think of it as a family biopic. If nothing more it will help me to remember which sister wrote which novel. Emily played by Ida Lupino was much more introverted shunned crowds and publicity andaccording to this movieshe was haunted by the ghosts of Wuthering Heights. Charlotte Olivia de Havilland was quite the opposite. She seemed to seek the fame and the opportunity that only London could offer. Branwell Arthur Kennedy was a failed painter who was subject to alcoholism and drug addiction which were probably factors in his early death. Their father was a minister who had an associate Rev. Arthur Nicholls Paul Henreid who eventually married Charlotte. But was there ever a love triangle between Charlotte and Emily over him etc? In addition the movie lowkeyed the third sister Anne Nancy Coleman who also wrote novels in her shot lifetime. I think if this movie were made today it might stress the filth and disease so prevalent in England during the early industrial revolution. The sanitary conditions were bad enough in the English countryside and probably even worse in London where the population was more concentrated. Most of the characters in this movie died at an early age from a contagious disease.".

Though the love triangle between Charlotte Nicholls and Emily is silly Lupino excels at portraying the passion of her character. She is the one memorable aspect in this otherwise standard 1940s biopic.

This RKO Technicolor big budget film is unusual for that studio it was their biggest movie to date and they snagged Wayne along with Anthony Quinn. Somehow as good as it is in many ways it lost a million dollars a whole lot for the time. It's good however and watchable if still a bit contrived within its wild Andes excess.Though set in the mining roughneck edge of the mountains this is a romance. Wayne a savvy worker and engineer falls in love with the mine owner's daughter. That never goes well and it yet it goes very well at times. The love affair is sweet and innocent due both to Wayne's scruples and to the leading woman's equally good intentions. This is Laraine Day a good Nixon Republican who was faithfully Mormon her whole life. She's charming and truly attractive in the movie star mould of the day and was an MGM star of some importance during these years. I think Wayne and her have an odd believable consonance and since they make so much of the movie they hold it all together well.The larger plot is about a conflict in how to manage building he railroad. This sets up the structure for the different social strata of the leading characters Wayne and the mine owner but it distracts somewhat from the other deeper plot. The scenery vibrates the music pulses the romance is intense. Whatever the general predictability of the plot the story is well enough done and warm enough it's not a gritty tale whatever the dirty environs it makes you want to watch. There might be a social message in here somewhere about individualism and hard work about true love in the face adversity about the ruthless power of money about the folly of building things without getting permission first actually and so on. But it's not convincing enough on any level to quite take it so seriously. Why did the movie fail so miserably? For one it's a kind of grandiose movie that audiences were probably a little familiar with. For another this was the total height of the film noir boom which is essentially the opposite kind of film. And for another the female star was not a particular draw and Wayne was so completely known by this point as a cowboy the casting might have doomed it from the start.In the end after fighting the elements of the hot mountain desert the mine owner sells it all and goes with his woman to what he calls paradise.

Most of the actors are pros giving fine performances including the ubiquitous Anthony Quinn Edith Anderson Cedric Hardwicke and James Gleason. The Special Effects are top quality for 1947 with about 8 explosive mine blastscave ins and a good flood.There are however two elements which blasts this movie to smithereens the script and John Wayne.The script has the John Wayne character doing absurd and reckless things. For example he falls in love with Lorraine Day the daughter of his boss at first sight while being drunk. Her father orders him to stay away but he is so horny for her that he risks his own livelihood and the livelihood of dozens of men working for him to see her again. This just makes the character seem stupid. The stupidity kicks into high gear when he secretly meets her and drives off with her without telling anyone. Her father fearing that she has met with an accident rightfully organizes a posse to look for his daughter.If Wayne's behavior is stupid in the first half of the film his character turns destructive and obnoxious in the second half. He becomes fanatical about his building projects and alienates all his friends. In the hands of a capable actor like Gable or Bogart this good guy turns bad role might have been interesting but Wayne only knows how to play bad by looking constipated and scowling. He delivers his lines pretty much the same with a bitter don't mess with me hombre tone throughout.Actually there is one scene where Wayne does act well. The fatherboss says to Wayne that he might have to break Him if he sees his daughter again. Wayne looks genuinely angry like he's been kicked and walks out of the room. Unfortunately this is an exception and in most scenes he just looks tired and gives a one sour note performance.I have watched about 50 Wayne films only about 13 of his total but I can not remember him being this bad in any of them. Therefore I can't even recommend it for Wayne fans. This was the most expensive film RKO made until 1947 and also its biggest money loser. I can only recommend it for disaster movie fans and movie buffs who want to see major film disasters.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I'm thinking to myself as the story approaches it's dramatic conclusion  here's John Wayne engineering a locomotive to the middle of a hundred yard high trestle presumably to provide more stability in the face of a raging flood heading it's way. Do I have that right? Turns out it was a bad decision with the whole train toppling over in the storm and the bridge's center span lost as well. So does Johnny Munroe Wayne get fired and run out of town? Instead he makes up with the boss Cedric Hardwicke his band of construction jocks become the new board of directors and Munroe goes on his honeymoon with the boss's daughter Laraine Day. This just doesn't make sense on so many levels.One can also question some of the events leading up to the finale as well. There was the initial decision to go through the mountain with a railroad instead of a bridge. Johnny Munroe was proved right on that score but at what cost? It seems to me that Frederic Alexander wasted more money following bad advice from his board than by listening to the crew doing the job. Anthony Quinn had a rather dubious role in all of this as basically Alexander's yes man with little regard for his own instincts in fulfilling the project.Another thing that struck me was that as Wayne got older the romantic lead in his films remained a girl in her twenties. As another example you have Gail Russell opposite Wayne in 1947's Angel and the Badman. Here Laraine Day's character is mentioned as being twenty years old. She's quite attractive in her role with wardrobe changes that would get her pegged as a fashionista today. With that in mind this is one of the few pictures you'll see in which John Wayne sports a suit and a white one at that! He did it some years earlier in 1931's His Private Secretary perhaps the only two times in his movie career that he might have done so.So even though this film is panned pretty much across the board there are some worthwhile things to find if you tune in and pay attention. It's just that most of them don't have anything to do with the story itself. Loyal John Wayne fans at least should take a look just as little Chico Fernando Alvarado stayed true to the big lug through thick and thin.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was actually RKO's biggest failure of the year. This movie has Wayne playing an engineer who is building a railroad bridge across a gorge. He and his financier partner in this effort dislike each other intensely with spats that range from the inadequate financing of the project to the shotgun wedding of Wayne's character to the tycoon's daughter. This is where The Duke completely breaks from the hero he normally plays and acts like a spoiled child who believes that he who dies with the most toys wins. He and the tycoon's spat escalate to the point that sabotage is occurring and lives are being lost. There's some beautiful cinematography in this one and although the plot just didn't work for me Wayne's acting did. Most people don't like this film at least in part because Wayne convincingly plays someone completely unlikeable  and that's the point. He's given a role completely out of step with what he usually plays and does a good job.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film was actually RKO's biggest failure of the year. This movie has Wayne playing an engineer who is building a railroad bridge across a gorge. He and his financier partner in this effort dislike each other intensely with spats that range from the inadequate financing of the project to the shotgun wedding of Wayne's character to the tycoon's daughter. This is where The Duke completely breaks from the hero he normally plays and acts like a spoiled child who believes that he who dies with the most toys wins. He and the tycoon's spat escalate to the point that sabotage is occurring and lives are being lost. There's some beautiful cinematography in this one and although the plot just didn't work for me Wayne's acting did. Most people don't like this film at least in part because Wayne convincingly plays someone completely unlikeable  and that's the point. He's given a role completely out of step with what he usually plays and does a good job.";

I think people today are just spoiled with over the top fast paced special effects driven action movies and this makes it hard for people to have a little patience and slow down and just relax and try to enjoy the characters and the story. Also to try and watch the movie through the lens of the time it was created and shown instead of trying to apply today's filming styles and standards to a movie over 50 years old it's a little crazy in my opinion. Anyway overall I think it's a good movie and I find it enjoyable to watch especially at night when I want a more quite relaxing movie while chilling out in bed. So if it brings me joy in the end and every one else that likes the movie that's all that matters anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "This 1947 film by RKO is one of several in which John Wayne has an interesting role other than Western or war. The movie has a very good plot but an unfortunately weak script. The cast includes some of the best second tier performers in Hollywood during that time and all delivered very well. Wayne is good in his role but Anthony Quinn's role doesn't quite develop. Laraine Day and Cedric Hardwicke turn in good performances in roles that could have been developed better with a good script. One aspect that I don't see anyone else has commented on is the character played by Wayne. We all see quickly the hardness of Hardwicke's character and the dislike between him and Duke's character. But the film has a good undertone about the Wayne character. Pop touches on it toward the end when he says that Johnny has changed  and not for the better. He does go through another transformation  a return to his former self at the end. But the underlying characteristic that is the cause for much of the trouble he encounters is his pride. This is a film about a decent guy who lets his pride get the best of him when he gets locked into a feud with the Hardwicke character. And it almost leads to his downfall. In the end the loyalty and lasting friendship of his main crew members help draw Wayne's character out of his selfcenteredness and he returns to the Johnny everyone knew and liked.My rating is high for this film mainly for its subtle message and lesson and for its overall entertainment value. Tycoon holds one's interest from start to finish and has some excellent action segments some very good scenic shots and very good camera work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forgettable romantic drama about engineer John Wayne trying to build a bridge while falling for millionaire Sir Cedric Hardwicke's daughter Laraine Day. Daddy isn't too pleased. A huge flop for RKO at the time and it's easy to see why. Other than some nice location scenery and a couple of decent action scenes it's nothing special and it goes on way too long. Duke is solid. Day looks stunning in technicolor but this is a part anybody could have played and she doesn't have the best chemistry with Duke. Hardwicke rarely offers a bad performance and this is no exception. His character has a rather long stick up his youknowwhat. James Gleason is Duke's sidekick. He's great as always. Anthony Quinn and Judith Anderson offer good support though this is hardly a part Quinn would brag about. Not the best John Wayne movie or even in the top thirty but it's watchable and there are some good moments.".

Tycoon stars John Wayne Day Sir Cedric Hardwicke Anthony Quinn and Judith Anderson in a technicolor film about the travails of a falling in love with the boss' daughter and b then having the boss make sure you don't have the materials to build your railroad tunnel or whatever else you're building. Seems a bit selfdefeating and spiteful.Filmed in technicolor some of the shots are gorgeous and some are hilarious  for instance the South American town which is a painted backdrop.I actually like John Wayne when he's not in a western and here he's handsome and tough and brings some life to the proceedings. I've always been a fan of Laraine Day and she's lovely  but a chimpanzee could have played her part. I understand Day's husband Leo Durocher was on the set most of the time and was jealous of John Wayne. Judith Anderson as her duena is very good and Hardwicke is dignified. Anthony Quinn as he often was back then was shown to great advantage in a supporting role.It might have been a better film if it had been shorter  there's just too much down time in Tycoon. The script is a bore. The explosions are good.".

Sam Waterston and Jeffery Demunn play very well off each other and Kathleen Quinlen is a criminally underused actress so it is always nice to see her.The plot line has echoes of George Romero's earlier paen to paranoia and bio warfare spills 'The Crazies'. This film also prefigures Resident Evil and 28 Days Later but played on a much smaller scale. Watching a film shot in the mid 1980's now serves as a reminder of just how bombastic and overthetop most current films have become.A modest effort but entertaining nonetheless.".

Both Craig Safan's pulsepounding score and Dean Cundey's polished cinematography are likewise up to par. The uniformly terrific acting from a bangup cast warrants kudos as well with especially praiseworthy work from Yaphet Kotto as ineffectual fed Major Connolly and G.W.

Anyway the story is quite catching and most of the acting is above average thanks to a good ensemble cast of quality folks. Very well done artset design makes up for rather standard plot direction with some nicely eerie moments. There's well written believable dialog interspersed with silly and well developed characters interspersed with stereotypes. So it's a mishmash but a good one. Would have been nice to see a more believable military response to the viral outbreak but the budget must have only been enough for a small crew of national guard type soldiers rather than a more believable crack platoon outfit that would have been all over the locals and sent them packing. Definitely a good half of a double feature with Endangered Species or Andromeda Strain.".

The plot of the 1985 film involves a deadly serum leaking inside a biochemical plant in rural Utah.  The plant is sealed offno one can get in or get out.  What happens inside is best described as Night of the Living Dead meets the Andromeda Strain.  All in all not a bad horror film and the actors Sam Waterston Kathleen Quinlanboth Oscar nominees but alas not for Warning Sign manage to keep straight faces.  The film has an Alien feel to it and is quite stylish to boot.  More than anything the film has a good somewhat believable premise for a horror story.  But the execution is just so odd.  Scientists becoming zombies or monsters has been done before and the atmospheric first half of the movie is somewhat ruined by the overthetop borderline campy second half.  We'll see soon enough whether Anderson's version of the idea is successful although judging from the ads I seriously doubt it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie on HBO years ago. As time has gone on and I have seen more Science Fiction horror and zombie movies I have come to regard this movie as one of the best of all three. Certainly one of the highpoints of the 80s Science Fiction entries.This movie came out at the same time as The Stuff but Warning Sign is a more refined and seemingly a much higher budget movie. It has a very slick look when compared to The Stuff. It even looks pretty good when compared to Aliens.Spoilers Below The movie starts out as an average workday at BioTek the Head of Security Joanie Morse played by Kathleen Quinlan is going through her end of the day checks and talking to her husband Cal Morse the town's sheriff and aspiring lawyer played by Sam Waterston as he's on routine patrol. Something goes wrong. She initiates a security protocol. Yaphet Kotto plays Major Connolly who heads up the US response team who arrives in short succession. Townspeople unaware of the danger begin to form a mob headed by Vic played by Jerry Hardin XFiles Star Trek the Next Generation. Inside bands of roving scientists technicians and workers break out of containment areas and infection begins to spread while the infected begin to act irrationally. Several bands of people in the plant attempt different strategies from holing up to finding a magical antitoxin. G.W. Bailey Sgt. Rizzo from MASH TV Series plays Tom Schmidt who is trying to administer the antitoxin after overcoming disbelief at the accident thinking its a mixup for the first half of the movie. Richard Dysart plays Dr. Neilsen The Thing The Prophecy the head of the research team working on the virus and becomes the most violent infected person taking charge of a dangerous band of infected people who attempt to hide the accident in infected mind irrational perspective which involves lots of smashing and trying to infect the uninfected. Cal Morse contacts Dan Fairchild played by Jeffrey DeMunn a former employee at BioTek for more help to try to get Joanie Morse out when she seems to be uninfected. The government sends in a containment team which is overtaken by Dr. Neilsen's infected team inside the plant and Major Connolly decides to initiate a lockdown to contain the infection and minimize the spread of the infection. Sheriff Morse and Dan Fairchild then break into the plant to attempt to rescue Joanie Morse and find the secret to the spread of the disease. End of SpoilersFirst off the acting is very good for a movie of this genre. Kathleen Quinlan Sam Waterston Jeffrey DeMunn Richard Dysart Yaphet Kotto and G.W. Bailey all deserve some recognition for their acting. I like Jerry Hardin's SciFi work so I mention him although his role was a little lacking there wasn't much to grab on to. Hard to make Irrational Redneck an Oscarwinning performance.The director uses lots of modulation in the way the character's speak their lines to add emphasis to the dialog and to allow the audience to distinguish the infected from the uninfected. Kathleen Quinlan when under extreme stress at one point drops her western accent and produces a pure New York Brooklyn accent. Since she is from California it isn't an accident bad editing or bad acting I don't believe. Its meant to convey her stress. The infected people speak in a melodramatic way which seems cheesy but on closer inspection is a device the director is using to make the audience aware of the mental stress the infection causes. I would liken Barwood's attempt to Clouzot's analysis of characters in The Wages of Fear or Diabolique but far less insightful than Clouzot. I fear it may have been lost on most people though. Perhaps writerdirector Barwood tried to do too much for a movie of this type. Maybe Towering Infernos can't contain deep sociallyconscious points. The movie stretched out a little too far but it is still great and worth watching at least once.The movie isn't a full horror movie. I don't think it was meant to be. Its more in the vein of Andromeda Strain especially The Crazies and Quarantine to a lesser extent. Its more of a science fiction movie with zombieish infection. Warning Sign tried to accomplish more achieve a higher level and missed somewhat. For a horror or zombie movie its tame but the movie doesn't go out of its way to bludgeon you into being afraid. Its not that scary. Its more creepy than scary but not a common Vincent Pricebrand of creepy. The movie breaks itself out as a serious movie with an attempt at social commentary although fictional? great makeup effects a great screenplay a pretty good Dawn of the Deadlike electronic background score but tuned up for the 80s. The entire movie has an air of reality similar to Andromeda Strain. It feels like it could be an actually happening everything is just persuasive enough to make sense there seems to be an understanding of science written into the screenplay which is rare in zombie movies. Too many zombie movies have taken the approach Don't worry about it just watch the movie to the point they slightly insult the intelligence for people who are unable to suspend disbelief. Warning Sign dots the 'i's and crosses the 't's. There are points of costume and props that are poorly thought but they are background material. I found the ending to be a little mushy and a little too far outside the horror audience to be appreciated. As an adult I still find it a little crummy but it works for me ultimately and it provides closure.Fortunately Anchor Bay released this title on DVD. Watch this movie it's carefully constructed screenplay is worth unwinding.".

As an adult I still find it a little crummy but it works for me ultimately and it provides closure.Fortunately Anchor Bay released this title on DVD. Watch this movie it's carefully constructed screenplay is worth unwinding.";

The professionally written screenplay realistic makeup effects and stellar performances from a great cast make this one of the most underrated scienceprojectsgonebad films ever and it's a damn shame that I only found out about it now. The basic idea behind this movie which involves the development of secret government bioweapon that turns random people into aggressive maniacs is rather disturbing and not even that unthinkable if you follow the movie carefully. Strategically located in rural Utah there's a hitech institute of which the people think it improves national agriculture techniques. The institute's real purpose  biological warfare  only becomes clear when a serious accident occurs and the whole place is hermetically sealed. The employees that are trapped inside all slowly transform into zombielike monsters except for one the local sheriff's wife and her immunity becomes the only hope for rescue. This fastpaced SciFi thriller offers plenty of genuine suspense and the makeup effects never go over the top unlike in the majority of other 80's paranoid government conspiracy movies. The fear and despair of the people trapped inside the institute is very well captured and the atmosphere outside the building is even more intense. Sam Waterston Kathleen Quinlan and Jeffrey DeMunn are all great in their leading roles and there are excellent supportive roles for Richard Dysart Yaphet Kotto and G.W. Bailey. Although not a very experienced filmmaker Hal Barwood's directing is surefooted and impressive. The climax should have been more exciting though. Now the happy ending feels a bit too forced and implausible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Typically most scifi films featuring corrupt corporations Resident Evil Hell of the Living Dead portray scientists as evil rats in white lab coats who tower over a mix of hazardous chemicals. This movie tried its best to be realistic beginning with just average scientists who make the simple mistake of releasing a bioweapon that drives them to madness eventually. The government comes in revealing that the Biotek Agronomics factory is secretly something the world shouldn't see. All the employees including most scientists and a security officer get trapped inside Biotek as they begin to faint and get sick from the virus. Joanie the security officer wants nothing more than to help her coworkers and get back outside to her husband. She joins her scientist friend Doctor Schmidt who is starting to also fall victim to the virus and they realize that their oncenormal coworkers have all gone insane from the virus becoming hostile drones who want to kill everybody. By the time Joanie and Schmidt get away to the lab Schmidt is already dying and Joanie wants to quickly find some sort of cure.Meanwhile outside Joanie's husband Cal is teaming up with a former Biotek employee alcoholic to save everyone. They plan to infiltrate the premises find Joanie and the scientists and get out. When they get to the lab Schmidt is dead the virus had been on his contact lenses and Joanie murdered him to save herself and Joanie is searching for a cure. When she finally finds one she saves her friends and gets out with her husband. The only casualties are Schmidt and another older scientist so the government shuts down Biotek and abandons it in an open but lonely field leaving behind the dreadful events.First off I love the soundtrack. The main theme has to be the most amazing music I've ever heard in a film. Second despite the budget the actors did a great job and the film was made to look as real as possible. The mysterious Biotek building and its surroundings were excellently designed and the plot was realistic. Unlike the completely unrealistic idea of cannibal living dead in Resident Evil and Hell of the Living Dead Warning Sign showed something of a different sort not zombies just innocent people who were contaminated and then lost their minds to murder people. It's original it follows real pharmaceutical science somewhat and it was made before the 21st century A.K.A. the century of stupidity if people think the Hunger Games garbage is better than this. I'd give it 1010 stars any day and recommend it to anyone looking for a horror film with real aspects of science in it. Sadly Warning Sign is currently unpopular and very underrated. I think it's a movie everybody should see at some point because it creates a scenario of the thing everyone is afraid of... what if scientists are doing something evil?".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning Sign is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is extremely underrated but it's a beautiful movie. The beginning has stunning shots of Utah mountains farmland crop dusters spraying pesticides all with Craig Safan's spectacular soundtrack that compliments the entire film.Joannie Morse works for a huge agronomics facility called BioTek. Unknown to her and most employees BioTek is really a biological weapons station researching viruses in the event of the Cold War and attacks from the Soviet Union. A cheerful and unknowing employee Mr. Shmidt accidentally steps on a vial of the virus and it spreads through the factory and everyone is locked inside. Joannie is the only one who doesn't begin to get sick and she tries to rescue Shmidt and escape with him along with the help of her husband Cal and an exBioTek employee from the outskirts of town Fairchild. Unknown to any of the four the virus causes the infected to become killers bent on sociopath manipulation and using kindness to lure their victims. Visually the lab sequences are very terrifying and well acted. Typically most scifi films featuring corrupt corporations Resident Evil Hell of the Living Dead portray scientists as evil rats in white lab coats who tower over a mix of hazardous chemicals but this movie is not that way. In the end as a parting and rather depressing scene the government shuts down Biotek and abandons it in an open but lonely field leaving behind the dreadful events. Rather than a snobby group of suburban teens Warning Sign is about smart and capable adults who just make a couple of simple mistakes and create an inferno of danger.Kathleen Quinlan who played the role of Joannie was in a similar role in the film the Missing Are Deadly which was like Warning Sign but on a much smaller scale. It's up to Joanie's takecharge and rescue her coworkers including her best friend Tom Shmidt who is unknowingly spreading the virus. Sheriff husband Cal Morse and his drunk friend Doctor Dan Fairchild are out to rescue Joanie and her coworkers before it's too late. Historically many may not remember but this film was released at the time of Chernobyl nuclear accident in Russia. The acting of all the characters especially Fairchild and Shmidt was amazing. I'm honestly very surprised the film doesn't have higher ratings. The plot is suspenseful yet not too farfetched like Resident Evil or Death Factory. If you want an amazing and eerie horror film you'll certainly enjoy this. Despite the budget the actors did a great job and the film was made to look as real as possible. The mysterious Biotek building and its surroundings were excellently designed and the plot was realistic. Unlike the completely unrealistic idea of cannibal living dead in Resident Evil and Hell of the Living Dead Warning Sign showed something of a different sort not zombies just innocent people who were contaminated and then lost their minds to murder people. Warning Sign is one of my favorite films of all time I'd love a movie novelization of it. I just hope it's never remade the CGI of the 21st century cellular devices bad music and even worse acting would ruin this wonderful classic.".

Well not quite seems a deadly virus or something to that effect has been accidentally released. The lady working security and such locks the place down which is what she is supposed to do under the circumstances. Well people inside the place want out insisting they are fine and the family members on the out want in worried about their loved ones. Then the movie takes a twist and those infected become increasingly violent adding to the horror aspect of the film. If this movie had a bit more of the violent killer psychopaths I admit I would have enjoyed it more still it made for an entertaining thriller. You keep hoping they will find a way to get rid of this infection that they will be able to keep the relatives from totally going nuts and breaking in and you hope those trapped inside stay inside because if not the world will become exposed. Interesting movie that would have been more of a film I liked had they moved a little faster to infection starting to really make the people go crazy.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie has a facility that manufactures chemical agents and such in it. Well there is a problem at said facility and there is the movie. Well not quite seems a deadly virus or something to that effect has been accidentally released. The lady working security and such locks the place down which is what she is supposed to do under the circumstances. Well people inside the place want out insisting they are fine and the family members on the out want in worried about their loved ones. Then the movie takes a twist and those infected become increasingly violent adding to the horror aspect of the film. If this movie had a bit more of the violent killer psychopaths I admit I would have enjoyed it more still it made for an entertaining thriller. You keep hoping they will find a way to get rid of this infection that they will be able to keep the relatives from totally going nuts and breaking in and you hope those trapped inside stay inside because if not the world will become exposed. Interesting movie that would have been more of a film I liked had they moved a little faster to infection starting to really make the people go crazy.";

Biotek is shut down by security guard Kathleen Quinlan as Biohazard protocols dictate when an alarm signals the spread of the dangerous chemical a quarantine organized by the government's Yaphet Kotto. Quinlan's hubby Sam Waterson Law  Order the local sheriff is trying to figure out a way to get her out of the facility with help from Jeffrey DeMunn a former Biotek scientist who was attempting to develop a cure for the germ warfare chemical just in case of a potential disaster like the company now has.A message thriller Warning Sign is designed to forewarn against the development of biochemical weapons for future use by the military using the Biotek disaster as a device to bang the drum loudly. Despite all his efforts Kotto cannot maintain the quarantine because Waterson is devoted to his beloved wife. DeMunn is an alcoholic genius who understands germs and the damage chemical warfare can do to the human body if released on an unprepared people. Slowmoving in places with performances that are so restrained the actors seem to be going through the motions except when the infection causes scientists like Richard Dysart and Rick Rossovich to go berserk almost disinterested in the movie their making. I found myself struggling to care about the plot even though the story should be suspenseful considering the subject matter concerns rabid scientists wielding axes and the release of germ warfare on the very ones who created the chemicals to begin with. Quinlan for some reason doesn't have any signs of infection and DeMunn must discover why this is the case so an antitoxin can be administered to future victims. I think why the movie just doesn't work is because the pace lags and is never quite as thrilling as it should be. Maybe it is the approachpresentation. The film even has a mob of locals who decide to gather up weapons and take matters into their own hands. G W Bailey of Police Academy fame is a scientist who unknowingly spreads the infection his contacts contain the Typhoid Mary that contributed to the release and tries to help Quinlan find an answer to the germ and Jerry Hardin is an angered father who wants to get his son out of the quarantined building. A hohum effort from all involved which is a shame considering the powerhouse cast and potential of the premise. Some movies just cannot seem to cash in on a premise that should deliver the goods it ultimately comes down to execution. There are times when it seems like the screenplay is playfully tongueincheek but the performances fail to pull off the dialogue in a way to bring it to life.".

Incidentally Reeves also starred in MORGAN THE PIRATE 1961 and that legendary figure does play an important role in the plot of the film under review!The swashbucklerpirate film genre was pretty much pass by this point in time but this is a fairly lively and successful throwback to those matine adventures so prevalent in Hollywood between the 1920s and early 1950s. Kabir Bedi is a handsome and sympathetic leading man while Mel Ferrer is as villainous here as he had been in one of the touchstones of the genre SCARAMOUCHE 1952.

Having seen it again now it practically beggars belief but as I said it is an enjoyable audiencepleasing romp. What is remarkable about it however is the fact that director Sollima injects an overly solemn ambiance at times not to mention some fantasy sequences of Bedi tormented by the vision of the ghosts of his murdered brothers which lends it a ponderousness quite atypical of such seafaring stuff. Maybe it was intended as the last word on the subject or something Mel Ferrer even goes unpunished in the end and The Black Pirate himself retreats into obscurity with his true love leaving the field entirely to his consummate successor Morgan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Waaaaaaaaaaaay back in the early 1990's when Jeffrey Katzenberg was still a top exec at Disney he had one of his less successful ideas  to bring back the breakintosong musical.  So as the story goes he selected three scripts that were about to go into production and gave them to Disney Music Maestro Alan Menken and asked him which of the scripts could be turned into a musical.And that's how NEWSIES was born.It's a great story too being a fictionalized account of the newsboy strike in New York at the turn of the century.  It follows the exploits of a ragtag band of teenage boys including Cowboy Christian Bale who dreams of becoming a ranch hand in Santa Fe and David  Les David Moscow  Luke Edwards brothers who take up selling newspapers when their father is injured on the job.Conflict arises when Joseph Pulitzer Robert Duval gets greedy and raises the price of his newspapers to the newsboys but not to the public.  The outraged newsies decide to go on strike which eventually galvanizes all the working children in the city to stand up for themselves.It's a fun film with Duval playing his villain to the hilt but AnnMargret is wasted in her role as a showgirl both of her musical numbers are badly edited down to just snippets of song.  Bale is the real wonder here though singing and dancing with surprising aplomb.  The songs overall are quite good but a couple of them are hard to distinguish from each other. My favorites are the opening number Carrying the Banner and the rousing The World Will Know.  It seems odd though that Duval doesn't get a musical number of his own considering in Disney's animated musicals the villains usually get the best songs Poor Unfortunate Souls or Be Prepared anyone?.It's a shame that the film didn't do better financially since as a result of its dismal box office Disney declined to ever make another like it. First time director Kenny Ortega who also choreographed he was known for his choreography of DIRTY DANCING directed one more feature after this the underrated Bette Midler flick HOCUS POCUS since that film also failed to find an audience he hasn't directed a movie since.  And that's a shame he has a  very distinctive kinetic style that served both films well.Seek out a copy of NEWSIES and go for the widescreen version.  You won't be disappointed!".

The songs are so catchy my personal favourites are Carrying The Banner King of New York and Seize the Day. My favourite characters are Mush Jack Les Crutchy and David. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes musicals and good songs. Alan Menkin wrote most of the music and he was the one who wrote the music for The Little Mermaid so you know it has to be good! After watching this movie for the first time I asked for it as a Christmas present. I also bought the soundtrack so that I could listen to the songs wherever I went. I love this musical and it will always be in my top 10 movies list. I don't see how anyone could not like this movie. I've never met anyone who hasn't liked it yet. Kind of like the same thing with the Princess Bride. I don't a single person who doesn't like this movie! I give it 10 stars!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Newsies is my most favorite movie in the whole world! And that's really saying a lot because I'm seventeen and my other much loved movies include The Sixth Sense and Batman Begins. Oh yeah...Christian Bale is in both Batman AND Newsies. And for an eighteen year old he was that old in Newsies his performance is amazing.Newsies is based on the true story of the 1899 newsboys strike in New York City. Robert Duvall plays Joseph Pullitzer the real life newspaper tycoon who runs much of the city newspaper rival Hurst and Teddy Roosevelt himself also appear in the movie. When Pullitzer makes a ten percent cut on the sales of newspapers for the newsboys mostly teenage boys who smoke and pull off believable New York accents the boys get mad and go on strike. They are led by Jack Cowboy Kelly a boy on his own who improves the truth about himself. He is followed by his partner the good boy David Jacobs and his cute little brother Les and the rest of the grungy street rat boys in their crusade against Pullitzer.This movie has something for everyone. Really. For the older generation Duvall's performance is really funny he is the most entertaining character and then there's AnnMargaret who I don't know but my parents do although I thought she was the most annoying part in the movie. Whatever. And for the boys of all ages there is the rude crude behavior of the newsboys who use a lot of 1890s slang and slurs and who smoke and fight anybody they don't like. There are at least three fight scenes. And then for all the girls out there like me there are the dancing sequences and the typical love story thrown in. What is better than watching a lot of teenage guys especially when they're good looking...Christian Bale... dance and sing in tight clothing? Hmmm? And there is the lone girl among the boys Sarah Jacobs David and Les' sister who is the love interest for Jack.This movie is also interesting because it is based on a true story even if loosely. In fact two of the boys in the movie Racetrack and Kid Blink he's the one with the eye patch were real leaders in the newsboys strike. That's impressive. And it is certainly refreshing to see a downtoearth real movie unlike movies that are either fantasy or simply don't look realistic at all. This was the way New York was and this movie makes history a lot more entertaining.And of course there's the music. Okay most people I know don't enjoy musicals and most don't even know this movie exists. This is a Disney movie which is why I can't understand why no one knows about it. And surprisingly the word dumbass is even usedby Jack. But I love the music in this movie. Carrying the Banner and Kind of New York are fun and two songs you just have to sing along to my little brother sings King of New York all the time and The World Will Know is a song that upholds justice and personal rights. And Santa Fe is heartbreaking. This song is sung by Jack yes it really is Christian Bale singing as he expresses how he has no family and nowhere to go in life. This song gets me every time because you feel exactly what Jack is feeling. And of course each song is accompanied by amazing dance sequences which is mindblowing taking into consideration that these are all normal teenage guys who normally wouldn't dance. The newsies leap and slide and roll and make everything look so easy you have to smile.And now I must touch on why Christian Bale's performance boggles my mind. I first saw Newsies when I was very young and last year I was given the movie on DVD. When watching the special features I learned that Bale is British and I was floored. His performance as Jack is real and believable and I still can't figure out how a British teen could pull off a New York accent without flaw and sing in the accent on top of that.It really is a shame that most people don't know about this movie because it is truly a great story. It has great music great acting a true story and dancing that will make you want to jump off the couch and start dancing too at least I want to. I have yet to hear any bad word about this movie. It is a movie that I for one can watch over and over and never get sick of it. A must see for everyone.".

Or to be more forgiving a group of musical fans that will do anything to see the genre return.I'm glad so many people liked it and I agree Newsies wasn't terrible. It had singing and dancing with Mencken at the lyrics so we musical fans have to give it at least a five. And it's great to see men dancing  not that this rivaled West Side Story but it offered the high energy dancing as only young men can do. And it was based on a real inspirational event coming from Disney it had to be that or a heartwarming children's classic. Christian Bale has incredible appeal Max Casella is good and David Moscow shows potential. AnnMargaret unfortunately must have been forced to be in the film because she played her part like she was under heavy doses of antidepressant medication. Now that I think about it she was very authentic for the times.Music was great especially the range offered. The other day my husband flipped to the Hallmark channel and I could tell he was watching a Disney movie just by the way the horns were played turned out it was the Ugly Daschound  quite the classic. None of that here  the music was excellent.No Newsies wasn't terrible. But it certainly wasn't great. The production values were embarrassing. The sets looked only slightly better than Pollyanna's village. I can't believe Robert Duval allowed that cheesy piece of of beard to be pasted on his face every day  the closeups were OK but the distance shots were clearly my faux rabbit coat. And only Disney would managed to find so many clean welldressed povertystricken kids in such tidy slums toss in a crippled boy add a romance and a hero nicknamed Cowboy and say the film is done. Not a single urchin. You couldn't call them ragamuffins  none of them wore rags. Please. No crooked teeth. Not even dirty hair. I think they even used hankies. And such clean streets! Times Square is dirtier now after the renovation. Concept and basic story were excellent and I suppose I can't fault Disney for throwing in the romance and the poignant storyline. The writing especially lyrics! and music was beautiful and long missed from other movies. But the production itself could have been miles better. I hope they try another musical with a little more effort but all their movies have the same look  Princess Diaries II. Disney's movie execs should be forced to watch Martin Scorsese movies for 48 hours before filming anything.".

One I can't believe I'm watching a musical about newsboys. Two I freakin' love this movie.Yep I'm with the latter group. My interest in Newsies was revived when I picked up the soundtrack lately. The music is well written and infectiously engaging. If you don't like musicals you're not going to like this film. If you do like musical I defy you to not like it.Some parts yes are a bit hokey. It's a Disney flick and by definition is kid friendly. A lyrics sampling And we'll kick their rear! They gave their word but it ain't worth beans. But the characters are great and I'm not just talkin' 'bout Spot. The dynamic between Jack and Davey is great. And even though the cussin' is bland it's still a story of young kids living in an adult world facing adult problems with teen angst. That's good stuff. Plus Robert Duvall's in it. Come on.Newsies kind of got pushed aside after release. As an afterthought it's interesting to wonder with the new interest in musicals thanks to Chicago if the reception would be different if it were released today. No matter. As evidenced by the comments here people enjoy it. Darn tootin'.".

Dialog is mostly run of the mill. Newsies may harken back to a time when Newspapers were the information highways and all important but this Disney effort doesn't have the talent direction or musical numbers to stand tall with a movie like say Annie.

This character is seen sporadically thought the movie maintaining the real life person of Kid Blink involved in the strike. Theatre is always looking for drama to add and displaying Pulitzer as the mean selfish and prideful man conveyed the audience to be interested in the overall plot of Newsies. In real life Pulitzer started off as this character but later sided with unions during many strikes and compromised with the Newsies.

But if you don't like musicals this is an interesting history film too! It illustrates in a Disneyfied way something of what it was like to live in New York city over 100 years ago... you get some feel of how hard it was for the poor working class to survive. The topics of child labor  the treatment of orphans are touched on. My niece actually studied this musical in school! It's a good discussion starter. If you don't like history or musicals you still might like this movie because it is also a story of a poor underdog fighting against the rich oppressor.

Davey is a traditional big brother trying to keep little Les out of trouble and to watch out for his family.

I still am amazed every time I see the DVD because none of the boys had ever really sung or danced before. The songs are stuck in your head for days and you love them anyway.Kenny Ortega did a fantastic job with Newsies. I've seen the movie dozens of times and still applaud when the striking children of NYC walk onto the set. I am very impressed with this movie and urge everyone to watch it.".

However Disney has not given up the rights. Shame. What did poorly at the box office perhaps because of the timing. Musicals in 1990s did not seem to be terribly popular would probably do well on Broadway. Anywho on with the review.Newsies is a movie of rebellion. It stars Christian Bale and David Moscow. One of them got to be Batman and the other got to be in Honey. Not a fair exchange but hey. Bale's more talented. They turn in good performances and the story and dialog are endearing. You will feel the power of The World Will Know and Seize the Day reprise I have seen this movie maybe 15 times I do that with good films and it rarely gets boring. Minus AnnMargaret's stuff. I dislike My Lovey Dovey Baby does she actually say the words My coochy coo so much. Other than that the movie is pure gold and the story of rebellion at it's finest.It's a story of boys and that's the main thing I think kept it from being a hit as Girls were supposedly the only people interested in musicals.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was Antonionis third film and arguably his rarest from the preAVVENTURA period. Taking an episodic structure it is a sober treatment of juvenile delinquency  showing a widespread alienation affecting the youth of the postwar years in various European cities. The film has a rough tornfromtheheadlines feel to it  even if the directors perspective isnt nearly as acute as in his later more polished work tending also towards preachiness beginning from the opening montage.The French episode shows a gang of aimless youth from workingclass families coldbloodedly planning and carrying out the murder of a boastful bourgeois companion of theirs out of envy. The Italian part is more conventional though featuring some nice noirish atmosphere in its tale of a petty smuggler who commits murder in panic is hurt trying to escape from the police and dies on reaching his home having in the meantime confessed to his girl. It stars Franco Interlenghi who appeared in similar denunciations by other Italian master filmmakers namely Vittorio De Sicas SHOESHINE 1946 and Federico Fellinis I VITELLONI 1953 and Eduardo Ciannelli back home after a distinguished Hollywood career as a character actor.The English segment  involving the discovery of a body in the park  rather serves as an interesting precursor to the much more celebrated and abstract BLOWUP 1966 It emerges as the best episode again revolving around a conceited character  only this time its he who turns to crime just for kicks he relishes even invites all the ensuing publicity. The victim is played by Fay Compton from Orson Welles OTHELLO 1952 while Patrick Barr perhaps bestknown as the retired blind judge in Pete Walkers infamous HOUSE OF WHIPCORD 1974 is the reporter hero.For the record Antonioni was involved with four other featurefilm compendiums throughout his career  LOVE IN THE CITY 1953 the littleseen I TRE VOLTI 1965 BEYOND THE CLOUDS 1995 and his swansong EROS 2004 which I had the privilege of watching during the Venice Film Festival with the director sitting just a few paces away from me!.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Vanquished";
	schema:reviewBody "As introduced by Lorenzo Codelli The Vanquished consists of 3 short stories taking place one each in Italy France and England which while not a successful commercial film of the time it garnered strong reviews cementing Michelangelo Antonioni as a director with a critical audience and not considered a commercial director. And I agreed that all the characters here have rather interesting backgrounds and stories and the England segment has Blowup written all over it serving as a precursor to one of Antonioni's more famous works.The movie begins quite documentary like with a prologue touching on violence and the wayward youths of the postWWII generation. Like outcasts who challenge conventional societal norms the 3 stories with youth characters in proantagonist roles puts a fictional spin to the numerous articles and newsreels that set the tone of the movie.The first segment is set in France and I felt was the strongest of the lot. With a myriad of characters it tells of six friends embarking on a trip sans their parents' concerns but as they set up their excursion you can't help but feel that something's amiss and character motivations are not quite what they seem. For example why are two boys packing a pistol to bring along? And what's with the manipulative Simone Etchika Choureau up to dangling a carrot in front of different boys being probably one of the masterminds and chief executioner of some hideous plan? How about the braggart Pierre who flaunts his wealth around by lighting cigarettes with money bills and boasting of a model girlfriend but in fact has to borrow 100 francs? It's classic bluff against bluff with plenty of jealous and envious emotions thrown in for a good mix together with survivor styled alliances being formed that you just aren't too sure who's in cahoots with whom. It's a perfect short which builds on your anticipation with a tinge of mystery and foretelling of a gruesome inevitable crime to be committed and the ending being the cherry on top.The Italian segment was unfortunately the blandest of the lot. It highlights how most families and parents especially being clueless to their offspring's disillusionment and life of demeanours. Here the parents of Claudio Franco Interlenghi have absolutely no idea that their son is running a smuggling racket and knows neither his friends or his girlfriend except for a photograph in his room. We then follow Claudio throughout the short watching him seek out his girl Marina AnnaMaria Ferrero who's obviously from a well to do family and uses the excuse of living the life of crime to build up capital so that he can elope with her to a place they can call their own. Not too interesting though it did make me dig deep and wonder about the many crimes committed out of passion or using love as a crutch.I'm not sure but I felt the England segment had a wry humour filled thread with a faceless receptionist at The Daily Witness. Just when I thought I had heard the last from this person it gets popped up again and I can't help but to chuckle. So far the movies in the retrospective have been rather grim and serious but here's a sliver of wit that I didn't see coming if expected at all and so however short it was I thought it opened one big refreshing window.I can't make out much of the tennis game here which lasted no longer than a few seconds but the England segment draped itself with as mentioned earlier plenty of elements which would later be referenced used and explored further in Blowup. While Blowup didn't feature the crime in progress this short however provided some probable clues and did the conventional through an enactment a luxury which audiences in Blowup or even Story of a Love Affair never got to see and can only imagine if and how it happened. Ken Whatton Patrick Barr a journalist of The Daily Witness doesn't provide any interesting insights in the movie but serves his function as a proxy for the more interesting Aubrey Hallan Peter Reynolds from Saffron who discovers a dead body and calls him up to provide him the front page scoop material. The Aubrey character runs along the theme on exploring delusional youths as he's a fame seeker who doesn't think twice in cutting corners to the path of glory and money putting a lot of pride in himself in being able to analyze and make money from dog races.However he's quite a tragic character in living his dream and not giving a hoot about being pragmatic and holds onto his poetry to overcome his unrequited love for Sally. And in fact most of the characters in all the shorts have dreams and it is their inability to fulfill their dreams with concrete workable plans in a down to earth hardsmart working manner and in their wanting to make a name for themselves overnight that they resort to unorthodox risky behaviour with little responsibility or perhaps even the awareness of consequences in their actions.".

It begins and ends with moralistic announcements about how the youth of the film's postwar today treat murder and brutality as a path towards notoriety in the press implying that the political upheaval of the era had made the kids bloodthirsty. This public service announcement then demonizes both the characters of the film many of whom will commit or take credit for a murder and the insurrectionary movements that were gripping Italy at the time with the voice of a prosaic humanism that was wholly alien to Antonioni and the true spirit of this work.The triptych of stories of youth in major European cities getting violent is as is typical of the auteur extremely detached and nonjudgmental. The first about a bunch of Parisian kids killing their rich friend is pretty prosaic both narratively and visually. The one exception to the latter is a great shot when a huge remote control plane comes diving down on a field from nowhere technology once again making the natural world seem alien and unnatural as it so often does for this director.Perhaps the strongest if not the most intriguing segment is the middle one in the filmmaker's native language. The student son of a boughie Rome family gets involved with smuggling for kicks and ends up very much living the consequences of his criminal path. This is the closest Antonioni ever came to making pure noir with a brilliant chase scene on and through a bridge with magnificent chiaroscuro compositions. This segment with its privileged rebel earning the consequences of a violent path seems to me to be a precursor of Antonioni's magnum opus The Passenger.The final English segment has many widely reported elements that will be more fully developed in BlowUp. In both an offputting British youth finds a murder victim in a park and attempts to exploit it for mediaart's sake. There are a few fine examples of Antonioni streets and character blocking but mostly this segment is notable for how authentically British it feels much more so than BlowUp.The afore mentioned bookending add ons by the authorities try to shift the audience's perspective to that of the jury that confronts the main subject of one of the segments. But they're not fooling anyone. As he revealed in his English language trilogy Antonioni clearly identifies with the random violence of the youth of today and perhaps sees it as necessary for liberation. When the lead character of one segment announces that the end of a human life is of no significance we are meant to identify with the speaker not shudder at his words".

The DVD copy I saw claims to have the original soundtrack but it seems that the actor's words have been dubbed in after shooting  possibly a necessity in view of the large amount of exterior location footage. Raymond Lovell's voice is clearly not his  no hint of his easily recognizable lisp or slight accent. The other actor's would appear to be correct  as this was Lovell's last film role perhaps he was deceased before the voice  overs had been completed? Also does anybody know where the interior shots were filmed? There are a few inside a newspaper office in a court room and a house  were these filmed at a studio in the UK and if so which? I couldn't find any info about this at IMDb.For those who like location footage of London this is a must see. As well as shots at Piccadilly Circus and other central London locations there is also an excellent shot taken at the junction of Carshalton Road with Sutton High Street  identifiable because the names of both roads can be easily read. Lots of buses cars and motor vehicles can be seen in clear detail as well as shots at presumably Piccadilly Circus underground station.Hopefully someone here will have some more information about the filming of the English segment of this film".

	schema:reviewBody "First Love was a major transition for Universal star Deanna Durbin as she was being positioned to shift from child star to engenue something that Fox was inevitably unable to accomplish with Shirley Temple at the same time. While the film is not an overblown epic it's lavish in the details and carefully produced to give the whole piece a maximum of charm.  To today's audiences it might be a bit saccharine but if you can dial down the cynicism of our age the film's positive points grow.Durbin plays much more subtly in this film than she had in many of her earlier filmssignalling that she was now maturer instead of being a juvenile whirlwind ball of energy like she had been in Three Smart Girls and 100 Men and a Girl.  Her beau played by an impossibly young and almost scarily good looking Robert Stack gives Durbin her first screen kissa source of major publicity for the film at the time.The story is an updated Cinderellascrewball comedy which nevertheless allows Durbin's character to break out into a few operatic arias throughout the film this also takes some getting used to for modern audiences.  The most memorable part of the film suitably happens during the ball where Durbin and Stack dance for the first time.  Employing a charming idea a shot of a crowded dance floor dissolves to a shot of just the duo dancing to imply how the pair are so involved with each other that the rest of the world has faded away.  If you like stuff like this then you'll revel in the rest of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll take my Cinderella with Prokovief but after watching First Love a firstrate film with a queaseinducing title I'll place this Deanna Durbin vehicle second. You go up there to New York says Miss Wiggins a crotchety spinster music teacher to Connie Harding who has just graduated from a fancy private school. Make those people love you just as much as we do. Connie is an orphan and Miss Wiggins is referring to her uncle and his family wealthy New Yorkers who have paid all her bills but were just too busy to drive down for her graduation. They sent one of the family's limousines for her. And then Miss Wiggins says maybe someday you will meet a prince and you'll live happily ever after. Those fairy stories haven't come true for over 100 years Miss Wiggins Connie says. Miss Wiggins thumps the floor with her cane. Fiddlesticks! We just have to dust them off...streamline them a bit. And this is what director Henry Koster one of the best of Durbin's directors has managed to do. He is aided immeasurably by a clever script This is terrible says Barbara Connie's awful cousin I can't be more than an hour and a half late to Wilma's party...she's one of my personal friends! and solid pungent performances by some very good character actors. The story's sweetness is genuine based on the intrinsic sympathy for a young girl who manages to overcome obstacles with the help of others and then finds happiness. Deanna Durbin at 18 is an intriguing combination of naturalness and skill. We like her the moment we see her and her ability to win us over is enhanced when we meet the family. Her uncle Eugene Palette is a gruff man who seemingly only wants to keep far away from his wife and children as well as away from Connie. When we meet the rest of the family we sympathize with him. His wife Leatrice Joy is unpleasantly scatterbrained. His daughter Helen Parish a year older than Connie is a snobbish selfish manipulating terror. His son Lewis Howard is so languid he make laziness seem tiring. There's a lavish ball and Connie gets to go thanks to the intervention of the servants led by that great butlerplaying specialist Charles Coleman. She meets a prince of a wealthy young man Ted Drake whom she met once before with mud on her face. When they waltz at the ball all the other dancers fade away in a clever bit of instant love setting by Koster. Then Durbin receives her first screen kiss from Robert Stack as Ted as naturally as she acts. After the usual ups and downs for Cinderella there's a happy ending which involves a matching slipper. Her uncle becomes the worm who turns dealing brisk and satisfying retribution to his family and even Miss Wiggins smiles. We are assured that Connie and Ted live happily ever after. Durbin sings two or three songs including the hoary old tearjerker There's No Place Like Home. More impressively she sings Un Bel Di. Impressively because not many 18year olds I've heard of would be able to handle the emotions Puccini lays on with such a trowel. The aria is a tearjerker too but a great one. It takes a singer who knows what she's doing to handle the emotions in Italian as well as the notes. Durbin carries it off impressively with her usual uncanny poise. First Love except for that title is completely and satisfyingly charming.".

	schema:headline " After the Ball is Over";
	schema:reviewBody "FIRST LOVE Universal 1939 directed by Henry Koster stars Deanna Durbin in one of her ever popular movie roles. Basically a retelling of the old Cinderella story set in contemporary New York City the youthful Durbin making her sixth screen appearance and Robert Stack in movie debut are supported by fine movie veterans namely gravel voice Eugene Palette Leatrice Joy former lead actress of the silent screen and Kathleen Howard in a small but important role as the crusty but wise oldmaid school teacher with a heart of gold. Aside from her previous works opposite W.C. Fields in three classic comedies of the mid 1930s this is one of the few times where Howard's talent as a true character actress is fully realized. And now back to Durbin's FIRST LOVE.The plot begins at a high school graduation with the gathering of classmates receiving their diplomas one being Constance Connie Harding Deanna Durbin. With her parents dead and no relative in attendance Connie is invited to spend the summer with her closest friend Marcia Marcia Mae Jones but in good faith for all the financial support awarded her she decides to stay with her uncle James F. Clinton Eugene Palette a business tycoon and his family.

	onyx:emotionText "FIRST LOVE Universal 1939 directed by Henry Koster stars Deanna Durbin in one of her ever popular movie roles. Basically a retelling of the old Cinderella story set in contemporary New York City the youthful Durbin making her sixth screen appearance and Robert Stack in movie debut are supported by fine movie veterans namely gravel voice Eugene Palette Leatrice Joy former lead actress of the silent screen and Kathleen Howard in a small but important role as the crusty but wise oldmaid school teacher with a heart of gold. Aside from her previous works opposite W.C. Fields in three classic comedies of the mid 1930s this is one of the few times where Howard's talent as a true character actress is fully realized. And now back to Durbin's FIRST LOVE.The plot begins at a high school graduation with the gathering of classmates receiving their diplomas one being Constance Connie Harding Deanna Durbin. With her parents dead and no relative in attendance Connie is invited to spend the summer with her closest friend Marcia Marcia Mae Jones but in good faith for all the financial support awarded her she decides to stay with her uncle James F. Clinton Eugene Palette a business tycoon and his family. Afraid to face the challenge that awaits her it is Miss Wiggens Kathleen Howard her former teacher who encourages to move on bringing hope and happiness to those around her. Although Connie does win over her uncle's servants she's made to feel like an outsider by his wife Grace Leatrice Joy spending much time studying astrology Walter Lewis Howard their lazy son who'd rather be served than working and Barbara Helen Parrish the stuckup daughter who delights in giving orders and not taking them.

	schema:headline " Cinderella Deanna!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This has to be my very favourite Deanna movie. One or two critics at the time sneered that First Love was a return to the Cinderella story but had she ever really left that formula!!! It was a revamped Cinderella story complete with the slipper left at the ball as the clock strikes 12 and having all the horrible ugly stepsisters rolled into one supremely nasty cousin Barbara played by Helen Parrish who that same year had played one of Deanna's sisters in Three Smart Girls Grow Up. Poor Helen having to be nasty to Deanna no wonder her career didn't recover.Like all the best Durbins it was directed by Henry Koster a film maker of charm and taste and as Deanna's first adult vehicle much publicity was given to her first screen kiss by Robert Stack it was a smooth transition away from her little Miss Fixit roles probably because she had grown into such a beautiful young lady. The movie also borrowed from My Man Godfrey by dropping Deanna into the midst of a family of rich eccentrics complete with a very selfish daughter who makes Connie's Durbin life miserable and with Eugene Palette reprising his role as the exasperated father. A lot of Deanna's popularity with the depression era public was her warm rapport with the working class and the hired help and this movie was no exception.Most popular student at the young ladies academy Connie Harding breaks down during a rendition of Home Sweet Home knowing that as an orphan she doesn't have a home of her own. Crotchety old principal with a heart of gold of course Kathleen Howard urges her to go to New York and make it her own. She arrives at her uncle's doorstep feeling very small but after her soaring vocals of the beautiful Amapola immediately has all the staff entranced and ready to help her in every way. Her Uncle Jim Pallette is flabbergasted  You like being here you've met your aunt and your cousins and you actually like being here!!!Following the Cinderella story Connie is beside herself with excitement at her first ball but nasty Barbara thinks Connie is just too excited and also that Connie's dress is a bit too beautiful and doesn't believe it when Connie innocently says that the cook just fixed up her graduation dress that's what the staff told her  in reality they all chipped in to buy her a beautiful lacy gown. At the last minute Connie is told she can't go  but in the best Cinderella tradition and with the help of her fairy godmother I mean the butler and Uncle Jim Barbara's car is held up and Connie gets to the ball dances with her handsome prince sings a medley of Strauss waltzes a very funny sequence and leaves on the stroke of midnight being careful to leave her shoe on the grand staircase.By the end everyone has had their comeuppance but Connie doesn't know  she has fled back to her old school determined to become a teacher and an old maid. But after a beautiful rendition of One Fine Day from Puccini's Madame Butterfly and seeing all the old maids crying their eyes out she is more than happy to live happily ever after with her Prince Charming.Leatrice Joy who during the twenties had been married to John Gilbert played the addled Aunt but something about her showed to me that she was just too smart for the part. I started to wonder why she hadn't succeeded in talking movies she had clear diction and really handled the speedy delivery of the dialogue. Peggy Moran played one of Connie's pals at the beginning of the movie the other one was Marcia Mae Jones. Peggy soon retired to marry the director Henry Koster.Highly Recommended.".

The third melody which was unidentifiable at that time turns out to be a waltz from Strauss' little known operetta A Night in Venice. Thus we have 'Life is sweet and gay. . .' the Schatz waltz from the Gypsy Baron 'This is Maytime. . . .' from the Southern Roses and finally 'Spring in my heart.. . .' from  A Night in Venice. It is the 'Gondellied' or Venetian Boat Song from that operetta. And yes the accompaniment flourish at the end includes a few bars of the '1001 Nights' from the Gypsy Baron before finishing with 'Voices of Spring'. The medley has been seamlessly sewn together by Hans J. Salter and Ralph Freed supplied the lyrics. A joy to listen to.The success of the movie is first and foremost the performance of Deanna Durbin of course but turning her rendition of One Fine Day into a happy ending is to be recognized as an achievement by the producers and writers.

I had my doubts before I started watching it but it turned out to be just lovely. As a huge Cinderella fan finding this hidden gem in the list of adaptations of this old fairy tale was like a miracle. Probably this was the last liveaction version on Cinderella I haven't seen until now. Watching First Love was a bittersweet journey for me I was sad that there aren't more Cinderella stories I can watch but at the same time I was happy and grateful that this last one was one of the best versions of them all. Naturally First Love has some faults the characters are one dimensional Connie is a Mary Sue and the love between her and Ted Drake is really superficial. But still I loved it. I also liked the idea of making one of the stepsisters cousins here a boy while the other one remained a girl such a clever twist. The only part I didn't like was Spoiler alert? when Uncle Jim went crazy and hit his children. I know it was a different time but I think this kind of punishment was way too violent for a sweet movie like this. Oh and lastly but definitely not least Deanna Durbin was a wonderful singer and a talented actress. I can't wait to watch more movies she's in.".

	schema:reviewBody "First Love is a slight reworking of the Cinderella taleupdated to 1939 and starring Deanna Durbin. As a Deanna Durbin film you can be sure there is a lot of her singing. While Miss Durbin had an incredibly powerful and operatic voice it is not at all the style I like nor would it appeal to a lot of folks todaythough it made her immensely popular back in the day.The film begins with the graduation of Connie Durbin from a girls school. Sadly she has no family at the graduationher parents are dead and her aunt uncle and their family just doesn't want to be bothered. However she is invited to come live with them. Once Connie arrives she sees that her family is too selfabsorbed to make her feel the least bit welcome. What's worse is that her vain cousin Barbara Helen Parrish feels threatened by Connie and does nothing but demean her. Fortunately like Cinderella Connie is so sweet that by the end of the film she gets her own happy ending. However unlike Disney's Cinderella Connie gets help from the nice servants that work for her aunt and unclenot a bunch of cool animated mice! This is a highly enjoyable film from start to finish. It did however feature a lot of singingduring which time I usually fastforwarded the DVD! The ending also was a tiny bit weak but still enjoyable. Overall this is funat least as much fun as the animated version. Plus the use of a lot of wonderful supporting actors really helped as well as the film's nice sense of humor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two very young actors make up this cinderella story Robert Stack just 20 is the hero and Deanna at 18 still has quite a bit of puppy fat on her face I didn't like the hair style  was it to make her seem older? . She an Orphan like Cinderella lands up in  not step mother here but rich maternal uncle's home. Here of course there was one cousin of the stepsister type the other cousin of opposite gender the aunt and even the uncle are really not villainish by nature but villain by the lack of empathy not only towards our Cinderella but towards the whole world. There are of course nice songs too has to be when Deanna is there. The movie is well made and very watchable and of course the end is predictable in any fairy tale.

Even more problem in it was that even had she caught the opening she still would have been in for a trouble since it was a mix of three of Strauss' Waltzs SchatzWalzer the beautiful Rosen aus dem Sdenthe main body and lagunen Walzer finale  unless one knows that it would be impossible.The interesting and wonderful not necessary wonderful portion was after this waltz when Deanna was dancing with Stack I observed there was something in her left hand what was it I wondered.... and then it struck me. That was the cloakticket. And she had retained it held between the forefinger and middle finger of her hand till she exchanged it for cloak. In fact she had been playing with it even during the 'spring waltz'. This was unexpected that one would go for that much precision. I wonder who thought about it Koster or Deanna ? I am sure the viewers won't have noticed it or even wondered if it wasn't there you could have some pocket or fold in the dress to keep it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Two very young actors make up this cinderella story Robert Stack just 20 is the hero and Deanna at 18 still has quite a bit of puppy fat on her face I didn't like the hair style  was it to make her seem older? . She an Orphan like Cinderella lands up in  not step mother here but rich maternal uncle's home. Here of course there was one cousin of the stepsister type the other cousin of opposite gender the aunt and even the uncle are really not villainish by nature but villain by the lack of empathy not only towards our Cinderella but towards the whole world. There are of course nice songs too has to be when Deanna is there. The movie is well made and very watchable and of course the end is predictable in any fairy tale.

	schema:reviewBody "Deanna Durbin stars with Robert Stack Helen Parrish Leatrice Joy Eugene Palette and Kathleen Howard in First Love a 1939 update of the Cinderella story with Deanna receiving her first screen kiss.I first had to get over seeing Robert Stack so young  omg. Deanna plays Constance Harding an orphan who is spending the summer after her graduation with relatives. It's a sterile household with her uncle Pallette who doesn't want any noise and prefers his family be out of the house when he's there an unbelievable brat of a cousin Barbara Parrish and an airhead aunt Joy. The only warmth available comes from the servants.While her mother is busy doing astrology charts Barbara enjoys the life of a muchphotographed socialite and woman about town who has a closet the length of one wall. She's after the most eligible bachelor in town Ted Drake. One day she doesn't wake up when she is called at noon and instead gets up at 2. She is invited to go riding at 230 with Ted and some others. Because she will be late she sends Constance to the country club to hold Ted there by any means necessary. Constance does as she's told but develops a crush on Ted.The family is then invited to a fabulous party at Ted's. The servants get together and buy Constance a beautiful dress a corsage and a wrap from someone's relative. Barbara takes one look at her and makes up a reason why Constance needs to stay home  something Barbara's brother knew was going to happen all along. But unseen forces are at work.This is Deanna before my favorite part of her career which is a little later. As a little girl she was too energetic and her speaking voice too highpitched for me. Here she is delightful but her singing voice particularly the top is thin. Later on it would open up and be glorious. And Un Bel Di in English  it sounded like they took the literal translation and just had her sing it with the words not only awkward but out of order. Not a good choice for her as the aria is for a much bigger sound though it fit in very well with the theme.What made this film a bittersweet experience for me was the beautiful acting of Kathleen Howard as the old maid with a cane Miss. Wiggins. In those days if you weren't married you were nobody and Miss Wiggins beloved by her students exemplifies that. You can tell by the way she talks that she believes life passed her by but being a strong woman she has gone on and made the best of it. The end frame of her made me cry. Such an affecting poignant performance.I loved this film. Deanna's first kiss garnered a lot of attention later the first kiss was tried with Shirley Temple but in 1942 wartime no one cared.".

I love enchanting movies like this from its inventive special effects to its romantic aura it contains.

	schema:reviewBody "Driving a truckful of posies for a florist seems about as safe an occupation an excon could hope for.  But for John Payne in Phil Karlson's Kansas City Confidential it gets him framed for a milliontwo robbery.  His trouble is that you can set a clock by his punctual rounds and that one of his deliveries coincides with the arrival of the armored car at the bank next door.  His comings and goings have been meticulously stopwatched by the mastermind of the heist Preston Foster a disgruntled policeman forced into retirement who seeks his weird sort of revenge. Foster's plan assembles a gang who wear masks during the plotting so they can't recognize one another or him.  Payne's just the innocent fall guy who's thrown to the cops.  Those cops try to beat a confession out of him but it won't stick.  He nonetheless loses his job and ends up on the front pages as the prime suspect.  So he goes on the earie and follows the robbers Jack Elam Lee Van Cleef and Neville Brand down to Mexico where they're to meet with Mr. Big' again and divvy up the take.   The spanner in the works proves to be Foster's daughter Coleen Gray striking sparks with Payne as he poses as one of the conspirators killed in Tijuana en route to the rendezvous.  Gray's an aspiring lawyer in ignorance of daddy's scheme  which is to turn over the robbers thus rehabilitating himself with the force and to collect the insurers' reward of 300large. Those southoftheborder resort bungalows during the noir cycle at any rate were hotbeds of passion and gunplay.  Karlson gives us a little of the former not his long suit but plenty of the latter.  Over cardgames in the lobby and chance meetings amid the subtropical foliage at night the unknown players try to sniff one another out and gain whatever edge they can.  Their final gathering aboard a boat called the Manana shakes out as a crashing intersection of crosspurposes.Like Dick Powell Payne started off as a crooner and hoofer a light leading man his best remembered role is as Maureen O'Hara's fianc in Miracle on 34th Street.  But in three films under Phil Karlson's direction plus Robert Florey's in The Crooked Way and Allan Dwan's in Slightly Scarlet he ended up one of the most convincing ordinaryguy protagonists in the noir cycle.  He's tough all right but still shows the flopsweat of fear and he's smart too but because he's forced to be  what he's trying to hang onto is all he's got.  Offscreen he was even smarter seeing the potential revenue in color films like Hell's Island and Slightly Scarlet when selling to television was at most a pipe dream.  But as an actor in the ambiguous world of film noir he's seldom given the credit he deserves.  He's every bit as good as Powell or Glenn Ford if not quite so emblematic as Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum or Burt Lancaster.  Karlson's brutal accomplished works late in the noir cycle gave Payne his place in the dark sun.".

John Payne gets one of his best roles with a very good supporting cast. A strong sense of danger and uncertainty is built up early and is effectively carried through the whole movie right up to the end.Payne is wellcast as an exconvict who gets framed by a very clever criminal mastermind and who then determines to seek out the truth. In itself the setup is a familiar one but Kansas City Confidential gets quite a lot out of it and it is hardly predictable. The story moves from one hazardous situation to the next with very little pause for relief maintaining the tension constantly. Preston Foster is also very wellsuited for his role as the expolice captain and the roles of the three lowlifes are wellacted by Neville Brand and younglooking Lee Van Cleef and Jack Elam. The atmosphere and characters both work particularly well. The story has perhaps a couple of implausible turns but in itself it is so carefully constructed that this really doesn't matter. Director Phil Karlson certainly deserves praise for putting things together so well. Very few Bmovies are this wellconceived and as a result it still holds up very well.".

He is bitter about this forced retirement and so he creates a scheme to commit a major armed robbery of a bank using three lowlifes Jack Elam Lee Van Cleef and Nevil Brand as his bandits. But he arranges for them to wear masks when they all meet he is wearing one too so that none of them know each other or him. They are given half a playing card as a key of mutual recognition when they are to reunite for the splitting of the money some six months after the robbery in a resort in Mexico.Now in real life the three convicts would of course be dying to know who their partners and boss were. I can't believe they would not make some effort to find out compare this to Humphrey Bogart's clever way of tracing down Edward G. Robinson's phone number in THE AMAZING DR. CLITTERHOUSE to see what is more likely to occur. But as this film is going in a different direction I am willing to suspend my disbelief and just accept that Elam Van Cleef and Brand  despite all being thoroughly dangerous and nasty customers  are willing to go along with this witless demand by Foster.There have been comments made here understandably that Foster's attitude to John Payne accidentally framed by the scheme as being the thief are not consistent. Actually they are. Foster never intended for the three goons he used to split the money and get away with their shares. He was planning to spring a trap on them  as though he had solved the robbery himself  and so reclaim his job with the Kansas City police. Precisely how he would do this we never learn presumably he would have somehow killed them before they could identify him by his voice. But his plot miscarries when he gets involved with Payne seeking to clear himself. Suddenly watching Payne's involvement and realizing that Payne has been romancing his daughter Colleen Gray he is consciencestricken. You see framing Payne was never part of the scheme.The scenes with Payne are among the best acting that performer ever made. John Payne in the 1930s and 1940s was mostly in comedies or in supporting parts and in many musicals for 20th Century Fox. It was only in the aftermath of his best recalled role the attorney for Edmund Gwenn in MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET that he began appearing in offbeat noir regular films or noir westerns. It turned out he was a fully capable performer in negative or quasinegative roles. Here he has the misfortune to be fingered by his exconvict past and his chance appearance as the driver of a similar florist van to the one used in the robbery. He gets the third degree from the police before they find out his alibi is checking out. But the newspapers have plastered his face and history all over the place so he loses his job and can't get another. He is only able to hang on and locate his first clue with an assist from an old friend who understands what he is going through.The performance of Foster is good given the odd situation he faces of having set up a scheme to go from a to b to c to d and finding it is thrown off kilter by something he never intended. I like the performances of Jack Elam who has a serious drug problem in the days that drug addiction was rarely discussed in movies  but notice how many cigarettes he's smoking and how he is shaking and of Lee Van Cleef as a totally amoral criminal. Elam's death scene he is unarmed but by force of habit lunges for a gun that Payne has on his own person and is shot by the police is surprisingly sympathetic as he is crying and laughing as he dies. Van Cleef smart enough to figure out that Payne is not who says he is is as ready to kill Payne as he might be ready to kill his temporary ally Nevil Brand. Actually Brand's performance compared to the others is not developed. Maybe part was cut. Colleen Gray is wonderfully controlled and sexy as Foster's daughter and Payne's love interest.For a B feature it gets remarkable strength  comparable to the original THE NARROW MARGIN. I give it a 9 out of a possible 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a burst of casting inspiration three premier baddies Elam Brand and Van Cleef all together in the same film menacing the heck out of a vengeful John Payne. Elam should have gotten extra pay since everybody and his brother knocks the skinny wildeyed guy around. Actually for awhile I thought the movie was one long cigarette commercial or at least a chainsmokers' revival meeting. Speaking of casting Preston Foster really delivers in a sly role that runs the gamut from toughtalking mastermind to niceguy fisherman all in convincing fashion.Kansas City is I believe the first and clearly the best of a number of Confidential films made during the midfifties. For example note the unusually brutal cop interrogation of fallguy Payne. Keep in mind this was during a Cold War time when the TV megahit Dragnet was professionalizing law enforcement's image nationwide. Here however we get quite a different picture that certainly goes beyond the norm of the day. In fact director Karlson like noir filmmaker Anthony Mann built a reputation for emphasizing the raw nature of thuggish violence at least as much as the censors would allow. And this is certainly one of the more graphically brutal films of the era.All in all it's a fine imaginative script with a number of unconventional surprises. The robbery is cleverly plotted along with the getaway. I like the way the screenplay parcels out needed information instead of laying it all out at the beginning. That way viewer interest is kept up since a new wrinkle might pop up at any moment. Even pretty girl Colleen Gray's part is nicely woven in at the end after I thought she was just a romantic interest. I guess Dona Drake's role was a touch of local color or a favor to somebody since she adds nothing to the plot but apparently her Mexican girl does sell more than just souvenirs. There are echoes from this movie in such later caper films as The Killing Plunder Road and Mark Steven's underrated Timetable. Some might consider this a noir film since Payne is trapped by unseen forces through no fault of his own. Nonetheless other traditional noir elements are noticeably absent such as the angular shadows of expressionist lighting and the lack of a customary spider woman. But it doesn't really matter how the movie's categorized because it remains something of a sleeper with a number of genuine surprises.".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked this film but I got spoiled with the first 2030 minutes. It started off so intense that I thought this was going to be fantastic an incredibly edgy film noir. It still wound up good overall but it never lived up to that great beginning.The story slows down a bit once the scene shifts from the heist in Kansas City to the rendezvous of the bandits down in Mexico. It has as a full lulls here and there but still does enough things right to keep your interest. What it does is right is emphasize two things that a good film noir provides tension and paranoia. All the crooks are assembled in one spot but only the boss knows who the others are. They don't know what any of the gang members look like since all of the thieves had to wear masks throughout the planning and execution of the crime. However since the boss hired them he knows them all. Also down in Mexico the good guy in the film Joe Rolfe John Payne is an impostor pretending he's Peter Harris one of the crooks who got caught by the cops and knocked off just before heading south. Rolfe doesn't know however that the boss knows he's a phony. Payne's character got unfairly fingered in the robbery so he's down there trying to clear his name. All of this may sound complicated but it isn't once you watch the film. Suffice to say it's interesting to see how all these guys slowly figure out who's who. I thought Tim Foster played by Preston Foster was the best character in the film probably because he was right in the middle of everything. He was a bitter excop and the brains behind the whole scheme which could easily have been pulled off . He was just wasn't lucky because he had a great plan.One of the people he had to fool was his daughter who surprises him down in Mexico and further complicates the situation. Colleen Gray plays Helen Foster but she doesn't really come into the story much until the last half hour. Her character did one implausible thing after another things NO woman would do and softened the rough edges of this movie which was a mistake. Helen wasn't even needed in this film. It would have been better as a straight male only tough film noir.Speaking of tough how about this Rogue's gallery Jack Elam Lee Van Cleef and Neville Brand? Now there are three good faces for this genre of film. They were the other gang membersThere are a number of holes in this story but you have to ignore them and go along for the ride which for the most part is a good one. It's recommended for all film noir buffs.".

As for the plot it's amazingly complex and interesting. So good in fact that I don't want to talk about the heistlest if ruin the suspense.

	schema:reviewBody "Kansas City Confidential is a superior crime drama with a good story interesting characters and plenty of action. It features a considerable amount of bitterness violence and deep rooted cynicism and is presented in a style which is well paced and realistic. Its atmosphere is predictably grim tense and threatening and almost everyone involved in the story is either completely evil or at best morally compromised.At the centre of the story are two men who have suffered harsh treatment which has created in them an incredible amount of bitterness and a powerful need for revenge. Ironically they are brought into conflict with each other when one responds to his predicament by attempting to carry out the perfect crime and in so doing sets the other up as the fall guy.Expolice captain Tim Foster Preston Foster plans an armoured car robbery and recruits three criminals to assist in carrying out the heist. The robbery is to take place in front of the Southwest Bank in Kansas City and during the meticulous planning process Foster had observed that the bank's armoured vehicle and the neighbouring florist's delivery truck always leave the area at precisely the same time everyday. Using a truck which is identical to the florist's the gang carry out the robbery and after leaving the scene drive their vehicle into a trailer and successfully make their escape.Prior to the robbery Foster had recruited each of his accomplices separately and on each occasion had worn a mask. During the robbery each man had also worn a mask and kept it on all the time that they were in contact with each other. This ensured that none of the criminals could subsequently identify anyone else in the gang including Foster. The proceeds of the crime were in excess of 1000000 and after each man had taken a small amount of money it was agreed that they would meet up after the dust had settled to split up the rest of the loot.Very soon after the robbery the driver of the florist's truck Joe Rolfe John Payne is arrested by the police who interrogate him and beat him up repeatedly before releasing him when the phony florist's truck is finally discovered. Rolfe reacts to his experience by tracking down the gang as they gather in a Mexican resort to share out their money.After taking on the identity of one of the gang members who'd been killed by the police a number of complications then develop which make Rolfe's pursuit of a share of the stolen money much more difficult than he's originally anticipated. Helen Coleen Gray the attractive young lawyer that he'd met at the resort turns out to be the daughter of the gang's Mr Big who it becomes clear is actually planning to betray his fellow gang members so that he can pocket the reward money that's being offered for the recovery of the stolen cash.Considering the age of this movie it's surprising just how much brutality it contains and also how it portrays the actions of the police. The cops who interrogate Rolfe are depicted as a bunch of sadists who have no interest in justice or fairness and are only concerned with extracting a confession from their suspect in any way that they can. Rolfe suffers a number of savage beatings at their hands and then later goes on to beat up two of the gang members at different times before getting beaten up again by the third criminal.Joe Rolfe was a highly decorated war veteran who found that a purple heart had no value in civilian life and who'd also served a short prison sentence after having had some trouble with a gambling debt. The resentment he felt about these experiences then became even deeper after he found that he'd been framed for a crime that he didn't commit unjustly beaten up by the police and then unfairly fired from his job at the florist's. Similarly Tim Foster had also become embittered as a result of having been unjustly forced to retire from his job as a police captain.The strong performances provided by John Payne and Preston Foster provide an important contribution to the success of this movie and the supporting cast especially Boyd Kane Lee Van Cleef and Jack Elam are also terrific in their roles.".

It features a considerable amount of bitterness violence and deep rooted cynicism and is presented in a style which is well paced and realistic. Its atmosphere is predictably grim tense and threatening and almost everyone involved in the story is either completely evil or at best morally compromised.At the centre of the story are two men who have suffered harsh treatment which has created in them an incredible amount of bitterness and a powerful need for revenge.

With the help of a buddy he finds out that a criminal has split town suddenly for Mexico and he goes there to locate the man and hopefully clear his own name.

She shows up at the locale to surprise her dad Preston Foster who is actually the mastermind of the heist.Like any actor who worked for 20th Century Fox John Payne had to be versatile and he was. Here he plays a rougharoundtheedges war hero who has to survive among thieves by being tougher than they are. The the man known as The Singing Tyrone Power at Fox pulls it off. A handsome leading man here Payne steps into John Garfield territory with ease. Elam van Cleef and Brand are as mean and lowdown as you can get and the film gets quite violent at times.The print I saw was very grainy this wasn't a studio B movie but one made on the cheap though the film was distributed by UA.

The picture's not bleak enough and most of the story takes place in Mexico so the ambiance is more on hot and sweaty instead of your usual dark and foggy atmospherics. Certainly Coleen Gray is no femme fatale here that role might better have gone to Dona Drake if she wasn't so busy selling eleven dollar baubles to bedazzled vacationers.That's not to say it doesn't hold one's interest as a pretty gripping crime and caper film. The plot twist derives from the disgruntled expolice chief Foster Preston Foster who masterminds a bank heist in order to redeem himself and potentially get his old job back. The business with the masks seemed a clever idea but for me the whole scheme fell apart in Borados. Think about it  with a prearranged destination for the criminals and virtually no one else around at the hotel how would the bad guys NOT be able to figure out who each other was? So I had to let that slide in order for the rest of the picture to work for me.Now if I had to go out and cast the three best mugs for a TV or movie Western back in the Fifties there's no doubt I'd call on Jack Elam Lee Van Van Cleef and Neville Brand. That's why it was so darned entertaining to see them all here in a nonWestern venue engaged in their typical nastiness. It's too bad Elam's character didn't make it to Borados though but then John Payne wouldn't have had the ruse he needed to proceed on his own personal undercover assignment. Speaking of which for a floral company delivery driver who just got canned how did he manage the resources to travel to and stay in a Mexican hotel? Just wondering.Anyway when the dust finally settles FosterFoster manages to redeem himself without being fingered for his role in the armored truck heist and Joe Rolfe Payne winds up with the exchief's daughter having almost blown it earlier with that restless gun of his. My best takeaway from the film however is a line the real Pete Harris had down in Tijuana to Joe outside the gambling house  You been givin' me the fish eye all night. Can you imagine that coming from Jack Elam?".

My favorite piece of dialog is when one cop says to Payne's character Rolfe ... left school to enlist with the engineers. Pretty good soldier too! Bronze Star Purple Heart!

John Payne plays the putupon leading role in his usual keyed up hypervirile manner and while I would not call him a charming actor he was capable in the kind of modest tale. Coleen Gray is his love interest and proficient in a thankless part. The trio of bad guysNeville Brand Jack Elam and Lee Van Cleefare as manna from heaven in this sort of film and are as always fun to watch. Preston Foster's easygoing warmth is nicely utilized in a major role. His somewhat vague personality and amiable nature make him a more agreeable character than the putative hero of John Payne. Phil Karlson directed the film with his trademark paranoid edge and the high contrast black and white photography makes the movie if nothing else a pleasure to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Phil Karlson had an affinity for lean tight tough little crime thrillers 99 River Street The Phenix City Story and he did several excellent ones with John Payne this being one of their better collaborations. Payne is an excon trying to go straight who gets framed for committing a bank robbery and by the time the cops who come across in this picture as brutal corrupt and somewhat stupid find out he didn't do it he's lost his job he's broke and everything he's worked for since he got out of prison is ruined. Determined to find the men who did the robbery and framed him for it he picks up their trail and follows them to Mexico. One of Karlson's strengths apart from his hardasnails directing style was in the way he cast his films and here he has three of the nastiest bad guys who ever came down the pike Lee Van Cleef Neville Brand and Jack Elam. A romantic subplot doesn't really work they seldom do in Karlson's pictures and tends to slow things down but apart from that this is a crackerjack thriller with a terrific performance from Payne a solid one from Preston Foster and the usual fine villainy from Van Cleef Brand and Elam. Check this one out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kansas City Confidential AKA The Secret Four is directed by Phil Karlson and written by George Bruce and Harry Essex. It stars John Payne Preston Foster Coleen Gray Neville Brand Jack Elam and Lee Van Cleef. Music is by Paul Sawtell and cinematography by George E. Diskant. Plot sees four robbers hold up an armoured truck and get away with over a million dollars. Sadly for everyday ordinary Joe Rolfe Payne he's set up and accused of being involved in the robbery. But he wont take it lying down and promptly calls upon his dark half to seek out the actual culprits himself. In the police annals of Kansas City are written lurid chapters concerning the exploits of criminals apprehended and brought to punishment. But it is the purpose of this picture to expose the amazing operations of a man who conceived and executed a perfect crime the true solution of which is not entered in any case history and could well be entitled Kansas City Confidential.Produced by Edward Small Kansas City Confidential is believed to be the only film released out of Small's own Associated Players and Producers studio. Still if you are going to only have one film on your studio rsum you have to be thankful that it's a little belter. More B movie grit than film noir flecked nastiness Karlson's movie is lean mean and structured with knowing skill by the director. From the tremendous tension fuelled opening of the heist planning and execution through to the deadly payoff at the finale film is awash with knuckle slappings shifting identities and the turning of the protagonists psychological make up.Were it not for one of those endings and the telegraphing of optimism slightly shunting the pessimistic atmosphere out of the headlights this would undoubtedly be far more revered and better known in film noircrime movie circles. First thing to note of worth is the cast assembled for the picture. Payne was already leaving behind his formative acting years in family fare like Miracle On 34th Street and Footlight Serenade reinventing himself as a dramatic actor in films such as The Crooked Way. He's a perfect fit for Joe Rolfe an ex con war veteran down on his luck he has his every man qualities pummelled out of him by the police so much so he has to turn bad to prove he's good! The change is believable in Payne's hands his face that of normality in the beginning but latterly icy cold and untrustworthy. A trio of B movie stalwarts make up the thugs gallery. Jack Elam is sweaty and worm like Lee Van Cleef is snake faced and pulsing bad attitude and Neville Brand exudes borderline psychotic menace. Unfortunately Preston Foster as the boss man is not altogether convincing but in a film where characters are not always what they seem it's doesn't hurt the film. Coleen Gray shows a nice pair of legs for the boys but with Karlson not bothered about fleshing out the romantic and flirting aspects of her relationship with Payne she exists only as a secondary cog between Payne and Foster's characters.This is no femme fatale character. No sir. Music is standard fare and Diskant's photography only fleetingly shows some noir flourishes.But with two fist fulls of grit from which to punch and some boldness in the narrative involving police brutality Kansas City Confidential comes out as one of the better B ranked crime movies of the 50's. 810".

In this sense they worked for promoting an appearancenot for deconstructing but for creating a legendry of machismo and coolness. Payne is rather cool as the lead. The movie is supple and deliberately suspenseful. The cast is a very good one. The film acquires achieves a certain narrative depth.The pace is worthy of a noir's master. After an ingenious robbery an excon is framed then released he decides he has earned a share and is willing to obtain it. The film is violent and stylistically ambitious. The ultracool approach deliberately stylish and classic within the genre's canons and in a highly aware mode is sustained by an able cast. KCC may be seen as a lesson of noir as a core film and as a rehabilitation of the genre into the class of the adventurous thrillers rather than the cheaply philosophical fatalism.It has a considerable significant dramatic energy and elastic vigor that might remind one of Welles' noirs but on a small scale with humbler means and also smaller ends with a compelling dynamism and concision explicit this time but without Welles' inventive subtlety and hazy perspectives. With KCC these seem pastiched or quite borrowed yet they are still functional and did not get the movieish character of later pastiches that are merely laboratory abstract productsbut then again such the things were the good of a whole era in cinema . As it is KCC is a fine dynamic adventure moviea thriller. If in Welles' noirs the economy was like hidden and secret in Kansas  it is explicit and open.KANSAS  has some of the ingredients of the noir it is a rather pleasant surprise not to have a standard femme fatal yet on the other hand it seems a bit too selfaware selfconscientious as a cool noirin a way that better movies like DOA and SUDDENLY are not. It's coolness is a bit too obvious and rather overstated. Yet KANSAS  is all the way an interesting nononsense film.The noir is a huge umbrella encompassing covering many and various things from the bleak grizzly fatalism to the adventurous suspenseful thriller to comic books approaches and to the mere police procedural it refers to a historical cultural phenomenon that began before it is generally acknowledged that it did and ended later than it is generally admitted.The noirs' flaw is often the monotony the poverty of ideas here again a vast spectrum is between the intimidating inventiveness and creativity of the greatest Welles Wilder films such as DOAthe noirs of the most striking originality that may make a film a thing of many joys and the dire disappointing monotony of others that have but one note to play. In this important respect Kansas  is certainly way above the average.Nor the fatalism neither the coolness and machismo typical of the noirs had their origins here. They both came from the wide popular culture of the epoch between the warsincluding the hats and images. They were widely defining of the ancient cinematographic tradition that took shape in times of transition and ample changes in society. The fatalism and the macho and the cool tough guy came all from the popular culture and were not inventions of the noir.The core of most of the noirs is a naive popular aspiration of both telling sincerely what is perceived as the truth about destiny life marriage society etc. that is a tendency towards sincerity and immediacy and of creating mythical or at least legendary representations of fatalist machismo and coolness in a cheap and tooexplicit way. This double aspiration is contradictory in itself. These people want to sayintend to say the truth about many things yet they end up in worshiping fake phony images of wholly imaginary persons. The people can not afford to be radically sincere naturalistic wholly realist it always resorts to some kind of illusory cheap silly compensation that sometimes ends up by taking up the whole intended denunciation.

There is however one big plus in its favor the actors. They are given a sketchy draw of their perverse characters but they go for it with body and soul. Kim Rossi Stuart's tormented Freddo exudes a cutting pain that makes you think he has a conscience. Claudio Santamaria projects danger without even trying and the Libanese is played by an actor totally new to me Pierfrancesco Favino that gives the best performance by an Italian Actor in many many moons. Riccardo Scamarcio has a face to launch a thousand ships but unfortunately no character and Stefano Accorsi is totally unbelievable in a character that is nothing short of absurd. Explosions production values American style editing but very slow pacing a brilliant dirty photography by the great Luca Bigazzi.

There he touched a delicate real life story and treated with the vigor of a vintage Costa Gavras. I regret to inform none of that is evident in Romanzo Criminale The great bunch of young Italian actors assembled in one film! A story of friendship and betrayal paralleled to the turbulent 70's. But something definitely went tragically wrong. The film seems rushed and thoughtless. Kim Rossi Stuart one of the best of his generation is wonderful to watch but his character swings from gloomy to gloomier and we're ask to feel compassion for him  although we're not allow to grieve for his victims. Half way through the film I started to get impatient and glancing at my watch. I felt detached unmoved. The last nail in the coffin of this unfortunate venture is the casting of Stefano Accorsi. It may have been a commercial decision Accorsi is a big star in Italy but the idea backfired in a big way. His story is as convoluted as it is unbelievable. He doesn't have the strength or the power to transmit the ambiguity of his character. The women are treated as virgins or whores and what else is new. This time I don't think nobody can complain of lack of funds. I suspect they went for a commercial operation with fast cutting and a popular score with several well known hits from the 70's on. All together a disappointing experience.".

The script is rather tedious too with very few moments of sparkle and even though the movie looks good it only starts to feel like a watchable movie in its last quarter. And as if it weren't enough that the film is mediocre it also bears resemblance to an odyssey if we are to consider its playing time and the way I as a viewer interpreted it.The one interesting aspect is related to the political facet of the mafia and especially to the situation before the fall of the communist regimes.

Sounds realistic enough to me. However once the film begins to plough through a rather well crafted cocktail of betrayal revenge bravery and cowardice I couldn't help but think that if it was truly representative of a criminal reality so common or perhaps I should say ONCE so common to il Bel Paese then we have all been the willing victims of decades of an overblown media spectacle.At this point it might be borderline reasonable to ask what exactly it is that triggered this inane comment. Well the film follows the dawn daylight and dusk of a notorious criminal gang operating in the Italian capital throughout the whole of the 70s. All sounds fairly ordinary and the rather obvious subject of a film especially an Italian film. Yet what strikes a chord is the fact that at the end of the picture every single gang member is shotblown upchopped in pieces and so forth. But and here is the trick not at the hand of the police or some upandcoming criminal posse oh no that would be far too banal and thus far to cinematic. They all end up shootingblowing upchopping EACH OTHER in little pieces in an enjoyably sadistic spectacle. If only this implosive selfdestructive phenomenon were a common trait of all crimeassociated gangs in Italy then the authorities really shouldn't have bothered with their pitiable attempts at bringing them to justice. It would have been enough to buy some popcorns and watch them shoot each other to death.This might have revealed the ending of the film hence the conscious spoiler warning but rest assured it certainly does not give away the picture itself. And what a picture this is. Until now my opinion of Placido as a director was tainted by a ridiculously large stain of scepticism. I had only watched one of his directorial efforts Un Lungo Viaggio Chiamato Amore and found it miserably uninteresting and rather ignorantly I thought that Romanzo Criminale would be no different. Well I'm glad to say that I couldn't have been more wrong. The film is rocksolid across the board though particular commendation indubitably goes to the actors. True most of them are the usual suspects of watchable modern Italian cinema but they  Favino and Santamaria in particular  still manage to do an exemplary job in this picture. The direction is also and rather surprisingly competent crude direct and dare I say sophisticated  well for Italian cinema anyway.The only rather minor hiccup that I couldn't help but notice is the pacing of the film. Yes despite the stellar acting the competent directing and a gripping albeit somewhat repetitive story the film felt overly long. Perhaps and this is nothing more than a notsohumble hypothesis this is because it was in effect overly long with a running time of well over two hours. All considered this is a pitifully small price to pay for such a reinvigorating bout of fresh air in the otherwise unmercifully stiff atmosphere of Italian cinema.".

For one thing people who complain that it was too long and seemed like a miniseries...the two and a half hour version WAS a miniseries the cinema version was epic but not that epic. I actually prefer the long version. It is true that if you watch this trying to test your Italian language skills you will be hard put to understand most of it unless you have lived in Rome. I wouldn't have compared this film to the godfather or scarface it is very much less Hollywood. The feeling of overwhelmed connection between crime and politics the sense of no way out the fact that the characters seem not to be particularly penitent all of this is very accurate it truly does evoke modern Rome. We are so used to mafia movies big movies that show a rise to the top very American Dream style then the inevitable fall because the characters are bad and have to be punished. This film is beautiful because it is so far outside of American morality. The characters die horrible deaths not to pay for their crimes but simply because that is a risk of the line of work they are in. The deaths reflect the characters. Lebanese started a ruthless street gang in a dirty garage and dies full circle on the street no pomp or circumstance. Ice who always seemed to be scratching at the door of escape and salvation dies without ever reaching it on the steps of a church. This is significant even beautiful but don't give too much weight to the location. There are over 400 churches in Rome. The odds of being shot in front of one if you are going to get shot in a public place are quite good. I have seen Rome's criminal underbelly firsthand. While it is no longer what it was in the 1970's it is still a world with no master no real mafia rule and a great deal of political influence on its higher levels. This is a beautiful film. While watching it next time listen to and enjoy the cadence. Romans have a beautiful way of speaking. I also feel like people haven't given quite enough credit to Santamaria's Dandy. He is one of the best young Italian actors around in my opinion and he plays his insecure irritating and sometimes hateful character with such great tenderness and vulnerability.".

	schema:headline " A potential great movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Quite difficult a movie to rate. So i read the comments before voting. First I don't agree with many of the comments. I read they define the movie as a mafia one and compare it with others like The godfather. But this isn't a mafia movie. Mafia is an organization raised in southern Italy with deep historical roots and therefore it has strict behavior codes and organization. This is a movie about a REAL band  the banda della Magliana a group of streetraised rogues with no common moral code that terrified Rome and the whole Italy in its already difficult '70. So i think the movie could be better compared with a Scarface.THE PROS Excellent acting even singlevoidexpression Kim Rossi Stuart surprised me I have to reconsider him. Excellent character developing aspiring dictator Libanese aspiring drug sexbusiness lord Dandi and aspiring normal life boy Freddo are the three heads of the band and perfectly represent their not having a unique aim for the band. The nowayout atmosphere of the whole movie you can perfectly feel that the characters act because they can't do in another way call it fate socialeducational bounds political pressure they can't but do the things and consequently the mistakes you expect for them to do. Whatever they try to reach their happyness you know they are going to fail in the end.THE CONS Dialogues the characters talk with heavy use of dialect of Rome I suppose this is done for a matter of realism and with no noisefiltering so i missed some part of the speeches. Historical background as i already said this movie is about a band of rogues that acted in the '70s. I think a director is not forced to explore the historical background in its movie but if so he should avoid historical referrings. This is the major fault of the movie there are plenty of referrings to the happenings of those years the bombexplosion in Bologna train station the Aldo Moro kidnapping but there is no feeling with those year's atmosphere. Those were years imbued with fear and uncertainty and there is no trace of this feeling. This lack makes it an incomplete movie just a band of rogues movie while it could be an excellent portrait of both men and background. What a pity.All these things IMHO make a 89 worth movie get down to a 7 worth movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Quite difficult a movie to rate. So i read the comments before voting. First I don't agree with many of the comments. I read they define the movie as a mafia one and compare it with others like The godfather. But this isn't a mafia movie. Mafia is an organization raised in southern Italy with deep historical roots and therefore it has strict behavior codes and organization. This is a movie about a REAL band  the banda della Magliana a group of streetraised rogues with no common moral code that terrified Rome and the whole Italy in its already difficult '70. So i think the movie could be better compared with a Scarface.THE PROS Excellent acting even singlevoidexpression Kim Rossi Stuart surprised me I have to reconsider him. Excellent character developing aspiring dictator Libanese aspiring drug sexbusiness lord Dandi and aspiring normal life boy Freddo are the three heads of the band and perfectly represent their not having a unique aim for the band. The nowayout atmosphere of the whole movie you can perfectly feel that the characters act because they can't do in another way call it fate socialeducational bounds political pressure they can't but do the things and consequently the mistakes you expect for them to do. Whatever they try to reach their happyness you know they are going to fail in the end.THE CONS Dialogues the characters talk with heavy use of dialect of Rome I suppose this is done for a matter of realism and with no noisefiltering so i missed some part of the speeches. Historical background as i already said this movie is about a band of rogues that acted in the '70s.

	schema:headline " A decent film out of a brilliant novel";
	schema:reviewBody "I guess other people who commented on this film were either uninformed or unfairor both unfair and uninformed. The true story of the movie is this the socalled Banda della Magliana is a real criminal organization which dominated the Roman underworld in the late 70s and the 80s busy gathering immense capitals out the heroin market and protected by a web of political connections. Members of the band were used in some political murders and were good friends of powerful Sicilian mafia bosses such as Pippo Calo'. And that's history. The end of the Magliana Gang came partly because of a bloody internal war which opposed the two components of the organization partly because of police investigations and arrests.The novel Romanzo criminale by Giancarlo De Cataldo is based on the real story. De Cataldo is a good writer and a judge. He was involved in the trial which sentenced to life prison several members of the gang. I guess this makes him quite an expert on the matter. Romanzo criminale is heavily indebted to Ellroy and to Pier Paolo Pasolini the great Italian director poet novelist and essayist who was brutally slaughtered in 1975 shortly before the birth of the Magliana Gang. De Cataldo managed to blend Ellroy's politicized hardboiled to Pasolini's lyricism of degradation and marginality. The result is a really compelling novel which sort of continues Pasolini's exploration of Rome and its suburbs thus reconstructing a forgotten chapter of our national history.Then comes the film. As soon as I was told the director was Michele Placido I was totally disappointed. Placido is a decent actor but a lousy director yet he's so popular and has such good connections he always manages to find money for his films.But the film was much better than I expected. I even managed to stomach Stefano Accorsi's acting talk about overrated movie stars... because he was surrounded by such talents he was sort of neutralized. Kim Rossi Stuart was extremely good as il Freddo and Pierfrancesco Favino was a brutal and persuading Libanese those are the two founders of the gang whose real names are not used both in the film and in the novel. And yes its visual aspect was absolutely good much better than many other shoddy things made in Italy today it's a real pity that the country of Rossellini Pasolini and Fellini is today reduced to producing such dreck as Benigni's and Muccino's things.Obviously the novel is not a history book it does not mirror perfectly the true story of the Magliana Gang. And there are many differences between the movie and the novel especially at the beginning and at the end. All in all the film is more melodramatic than De Cataldo's novel and the plot line has been simplified in ways I cannot explain as to avoid spoilers. Yet it retains much of the power of the novel also because De Cataldo was involved in writing the screenplay.As for another commentator's remarks about criminal organization being destroyed by internal fight not by police forces intervention well that's what usually happens both in Italy and in other Western countries... unless you believe in Hollywood flicks where Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson always defeat the black hats.".

The movie looked like it was made in contemporary times and the few references to the 70's were confusing as nobody looked like they did in that period. Given that I loved the style color photography and editing and found the plot absorbing and the actors great for the parts. I haven't seen the extended version don't know what it includes but would like to since I was never bored for a minute and it could have been longer as far as I was concerned. Kim Rossi Stuart was great as were the other members of the 'band' though yes he seemed out of his element playing a 'coldblooded' killer. But his sensitivity and decline at the end worked for me. The other guys were great as was Anna who played Patrizia. She was pretty stunning to look at and believable  when she was on the screen my eyes never wandered. The movie reminded me of Soavi's Uno Bianca in its hypersensitive style which I loved though Romanzo wasn't as tight or as suspenseful I guess. And it wasn't scary either like Soavi's Ultima Pallottola. I don't know if it makes me shallow or what but I liked the glossy model feel of the movie a lot. Like I like Soavi's work. For my eyes it was a cinematic feast. Its apparent failings pointed out by other reviewers as a faithful adaptation of the material about the times didn't so much matter to me as I don't know that much about them anyway. I just enjoyed the movie as if it were taking place today and I think others like me might too.".

	schema:headline " Disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "Romanzo Criminale the Italian title of this runof themill gangster film literally translates as Crime Novel a much more prosaic handle that in many ways indicates the film's failings. In a nutshell the film offers so much more than it actually delivers. Touted by some as an Italian 'Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' it actually looks like a TV miniseries that has been compressed badly into a theatrical movie running time. The direction is flat and lacks imagination and the film fails completely to capture anything of the era it depicts.

Kim Rossi Stuart broods manfully as Ice the tragic antihero but never once convinces you that he can point a gun in your face and pull the trigger.The links between politics and crime are potentially fascinating but they are only hesitantly  and confusingly  explored here as if writer Cataldo is unsure of how to convey his message in the inadequate running time.All in all a major disappointment.".

In a nutshell the film offers so much more than it actually delivers. Touted by some as an Italian 'Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' it actually looks like a TV miniseries that has been compressed badly into a theatrical movie running time. The direction is flat and lacks imagination and the film fails completely to capture anything of the era it depicts.

When I first met him I would never have thought and guessed he could be so good at acting !

Funnily enough I had just watched The Consequences of Love the other night on DVD and the contrast between these two movies is pretty incredible.

And lurking even deeper in the background are State black ops figures who may or may not be manipulating both the criminals and the events themselves.I was expecting the sort of cheap crime exploitation movie that proliferated in Italian cinema back in the 70s but this is a different much more ambitious and better type of movie. Crime Novel is structured very much like an Italian version of American Gangster. It has the same intimate yet gritty feel the same long slow story arc playing out over years against a background of world events the dedicated cop who seems like the only police official who sees his duty as catching criminals rather than taking bribes and drug dealers who see themselves as businessmen providing a service rather than villains and most of time they are. The focus is clearly on the gang. They grew up together in the streets. Crime and friendship are what holds them together. They have strong loyalties to those closest to them but can be ruthless to those who oppose them. Individually they have frailties but together they are formidable. The script is structured to provide each of the central characters with plenty of screen time and its strong dialogue and intimate tone create very multidimensional and mostly sympathetic portraits.The resulting movie is very watchable and a worthy companion piece to movies like Carlito's Way Scarface and American Gangster.

Freddo and Roberta are one of the few convincing on screen couples and the film is a great exploration of loyalties. The pace is slower than in most 'heist' type dramas but this works to its advantage. It is visually uncluttered and the music is not owepowering so it really allows you to contemplate what the film is really about love loyalty friendship. Whoever approaches this as just a film about a gang is missing out on a lot. I wasn't familiar with any of the actors before but they completely convinced me. Someone complained about criminals being too pretty in this film but I have to say it is only halfway through that I noticed that Freddo is actually quite attractive as is Nero but the film is structured and filmed in such a way that your attention is not immediately drawn to this. Rather you get to know the characters first and only focus on their physical attributes second.".

It is visually uncluttered and the music is not owepowering so it really allows you to contemplate what the film is really about love loyalty friendship. Whoever approaches this as just a film about a gang is missing out on a lot. I wasn't familiar with any of the actors before but they completely convinced me. Someone complained about criminals being too pretty in this film but I have to say it is only halfway through that I noticed that Freddo is actually quite attractive as is Nero but the film is structured and filmed in such a way that your attention is not immediately drawn to this. Rather you get to know the characters first and only focus on their physical attributes second.";

	schema:reviewBody "Marco Bellochio pays homage in this film to the Gallic novelistic methods that he favours particularly those depicting a primal life force in this three part ethological drama coscripted by the director and his defrocked psychoanalyst friend Massimo Fagioli a cinematic triumph that displays a notable admixture of style and purpose as it reflects upon a trenchant formation of cause and effect the psychology of sex utilizing formal design in addition to surrealist imagery within mundane settings that few auteurs can match. Sandra Celestini Claire Nebout is touring the Farnese Castle gallery near Viterbo with her classmates under the aegis of their art professor and when she has apparently lost keys to her apartment she separates from the group in order to locate them and is subsequently locked inside therefore preparing to wait for the morrow when she discovers that she is not alone in the Castle because Lorenzo Colajanni Vittorio Mezzogiorno an architect is in for the evening. It soon becomes apparent that Sandra is about to be sexually assaulted by her new companion their unplanned intimacy being exquisitely choreographed. When Lorenzo tells Sandra that he has in his possession the keys to the Castle and that the two could have left the premises at any time part one abruptly ends with part two taking place in a courtroom where Colajanni is being tried for rape of Sandra an event marked by dialogue that concerns purely theoretical aspects of the Castle episode i.e. was the lovemaking a result of coercion or rather shared passion? indeed how can force be defined during sexual contact? is female sexual response released by an innate desire to be forcefully taken? This is plainly a subject designed for spirited controversy but the juridical proceedings are mirrored by the troubled psychosexual private life of the case's prosecuting attorney Giovanni Andrzej Seweryn forming the marrow of part three depicting a philosophical choice to be made between temptation and coercion that haunts the relationship of Giovanni with his dissatisfied mistress. Although clues to clear resolution of these perennial conflicts will be sought by some viewers the cardinal value of the film results from Bellochio's surehanded and ever fluid directorial craft as his gliding camera provides ongoing surprises throughout this visually splendid motion picture that energizes both mind and eye with rich contributions coming from Mirco Garrone and his crisp editing Giuseppe Lanci cinematographer and Carlo Crivelli for his illustrative score while acting honours here go to Nebout for her striking performance as Sandra.".

It was hard for me sometimes to just listen to it as an opera because I felt that there were so many messages being imparted through the sets landscape and especially the extras who continually move about the scene as the main characters sing and act their stories. Others have observed that the common people are present everywhere and yet just ignored by Don Giovanni he even conducts his attempted seduction of Zerlina with half a village standing on the steps and watching. As an aristocrat he doesn't even acknowledge the existence of these underlings and can do what he wants without worrying about their opinion or their interference. Nor is this just the behavior of a bad man Don Ottavio is much the same during one of his arias I think it is 'Il mio tesoro' when he is walking about declaiming as peasants dot the lawn taking their afternoon siesta. Perhaps the point is not so much to accuse anyone of being deliberately cruel as to underline how absolutely divided the aristocracy is from the common people. Not only do the aristocrats ignore the commoners the commoners seem to be pretty oblivious to the aristocrats too. No matter what Don Giovanni gets up to the work of the peasants just goes on  he may wander down to the kitchen once in a while to give a little speech and pinch a serving wench but it makes very little difference to anyone if he's present or not. The whole of this society seems as artificial and fragile as Don Giovanni's lace sleeves this is a world that is almost at the limit of its ability to hold together under the weight of its contradictions.Ruggero Raimondi is a terrific Don Giovanni  handsome graceful and charming but with a hardness in the line of his mouth and his eyes that creates a very disturbing feeling of danger. Zerlina though attracted seems to sense that there is something wrong about him though she isn't quite sure where to attribute the feeling of fear he inspires in her. Teresa Berganza was my favorite of the 3 main ladies Edda Moser seemed very grim after her opening scene and Kiri Te Kanawa reminded me irresistibly of Madeleine Kahn in Young Frankenstein especially with that tall silverpowdered hairdo. The silent servant played by Eric Adjani was another one of the puzzles that I felt this movie kept posing me. He seems to be a younger version of Don Giovanni and one who is present almost as Don Giovanni's spirit when the actual man is not there. During moments of crisis he almost always watches Don Giovanni not the action that is taking place outside him and only Don Giovanni seems to really look at him. In the finale he is almost like Banquo's ghost sitting in Don Giovanni's chair until the master confronts him and when the Commendatore's statue appears Don Giovanni almost seems to bid him goodbye as he passes. I think the servant is Don Giovanni's conscience the age when Don Giovanni as a young man cast him off and turned to evil. Now he follows him like a ghost of himself observing but unable to influence.".

	schema:headline " The Greatest Don Giovanni Ever Made";
	schema:reviewBody "Not only do we get a visual feast but the singers are incredible fleshing out the dramatic core of this opera and even delivering moments of genuine beauty and splendor. It stars Ruggero Raimondi as the seductive and sinister Don Giovanni Edda Moser as Dona Anna Kenneth Reigle as Don Ottavio Jose Van Dam as Leporello Kiri Te Kenawa as Dona Elvira Teresa Berganza as Zerlina Malcolm King as Masetto and John Macurdy as the Commandatore. In a minorsilent but seemingly important role as a servant in black is the youthfullooking Eric Adjani. The multiple dimensions of this film are too much to talk about but I will try to highlight some of them.First of all Lorin Maazel as conductor is perfect. He brings out the dramatic content without sacrificing the melodic beauty Mozart wrote into the opera. The cinematography is gorgeous. It was shot in Venice during the Overture we see the canals and opulent boats Vicenza the countryside crowned by Italian villas and palaces the Villa Rotunda is dismissed as a historic Italian landmark and becomes Don Giovanni's regal estate and some indoors scenes were shot in the interior of the Olympic Theatre. Most of the movie is shot in fresh natural sunlight or moonlight. The powerful performances by the lead singers is extraordinary and each bring a colorful and individual portrayal. Ruggero Raimondi is a rare breed of high bass capable of producing masculine chest voice but also a radiant tenorlike top register. He is seductive but devilish in his portrayal. His eyes especially seem to give away his dark predatory soul. In Raimondi we have one of the best Don Giovanni interpretations. He's lewd he's lusty he's murderous he's a shameless libertine whose motto is Viva La Liberta! Long live liberty! The film has subtle symbolism and poetic imagery. For instance during the Catalog Aria that Leporello sings to Elvira he reads from a seemingly unending list in which the Don has written his conquests a list that goes on and on draping the stairs and rolling to the road toward the villa. During the Seduction duet La Ci Darem La Mano we briefly glimpse a huge Crucifix and we see a dog sleeping. These I took to represent the ethic and morals that Zerlina would compromise if she succumbed to the Don's passions she would betray her Catholic faith by breaking her engagement with Masetto and being unfaithful unlike the faithful man's best friend the dog. Also the Commandatore is evidently foreshadowing his vengeance on the Don as he is dying when he is pointing at the Don.The complex Dona Ana' dilemma she is possibly lusting after the Don and attempting to fight off her own desire for him and keep faithful to Ottavio. Whom is she mourning really when Don Giovanni is sent to Hell ? She is always claiming that she mourns her father's death but yet as soon as she hears that the Don has been sent to Hell she postpones the wedding to Ottavio for another year. Very odd. Eric Adjani is the silent and mute strange servant in black. Who is this person ? Who's side is he on ? He is evidently one of the Don's many servants but during the Overture he is looking knowingly at Dona Ana as the fire furnace is being installed in the Don's home. Also during the scary scene in which the Commandatore statue comes to dinner this shady character shows no sign of being frightened and in fact one feels that he is in on it somehow as if he is an avenging angel as well. He seems to have knowledge of something the audience doesn't know and his personage both opens and closes the opera literally as he closes the doors to the Don's villa.Edda Moser portrays a supremely dramatic Dona Anna. She is Wagnerian in her dynamic performance a steely victim a wronged woman who seeks revenge on a man we also feel she might possibly be attracted to mainly because her fianc Kenneth Reigle's Ottavio is so lackluster and dull. Now I admire and love Kiri Te Kenawa in various other roles she is the definitive heroine in Cappricio and perhaps even the most definitive Fiordiligi in Cosi Fan Tutte and a rather touching Countess in Figaro but as Dona Elvira she lacks the fire and fury that is so vital to the role. Dona Elvira is the most Italianate heroine in the opera and she has arias and lines which focus on her feisty and fiery temperament. Kiri sings gorgeously but her emphasis is on the beauty and consequently comes off as too noble too majestic and dignified. She should be outraged and obsessive wanting more than anything to get back at Don Giovanni as well as to land him for herself. But Kiri does not show us any of this necessary dramatics.Teresa Berganza is an adorable Zerlina cute and clever. Note how she is almost tempted to run off with the Don but wises up and decides to stay with her fianc Masetto when she realizes Don Giovanni is a devil. Berganza is actually my first choice for the best Zerlina. Malcolm King who is sexy as hell is equally adorable as Masetto especially when we see how jealous and easily provoked he is. Finally Jose Van Dam as Leporello is quite good especially because he's not just a loyal idiot. He's in fact true to Mozart's concept of Leporello a servant who is wiser than his master. Van Dam captures the noble spirit of Masetto who is just a pawn to his master's schemes but who on his own would definitely be on the side of the good guys.".

She is Wagnerian in her dynamic performance a steely victim a wronged woman who seeks revenge on a man we also feel she might possibly be attracted to mainly because her fianc Kenneth Reigle's Ottavio is so lackluster and dull. Now I admire and love Kiri Te Kenawa in various other roles she is the definitive heroine in Cappricio and perhaps even the most definitive Fiordiligi in Cosi Fan Tutte and a rather touching Countess in Figaro but as Dona Elvira she lacks the fire and fury that is so vital to the role. Dona Elvira is the most Italianate heroine in the opera and she has arias and lines which focus on her feisty and fiery temperament. Kiri sings gorgeously but her emphasis is on the beauty and consequently comes off as too noble too majestic and dignified. She should be outraged and obsessive wanting more than anything to get back at Don Giovanni as well as to land him for herself. But Kiri does not show us any of this necessary dramatics.Teresa Berganza is an adorable Zerlina cute and clever. Note how she is almost tempted to run off with the Don but wises up and decides to stay with her fianc Masetto when she realizes Don Giovanni is a devil. Berganza is actually my first choice for the best Zerlina. Malcolm King who is sexy as hell is equally adorable as Masetto especially when we see how jealous and easily provoked he is. Finally Jose Van Dam as Leporello is quite good especially because he's not just a loyal idiot. He's in fact true to Mozart's concept of Leporello a servant who is wiser than his master. Van Dam captures the noble spirit of Masetto who is just a pawn to his master's schemes but who on his own would definitely be on the side of the good guys.";

I paid more attention to the words and what was going on in the plot than the music.As for the movie adaptation aside from it being very strange to watch and listen to an opera written more than 200 years ago on my modern television I found it enjoyable. Yes the preceding comment is true that the expressions were exaggerated and more fit for a stage but I don't feel they were inappropriate either. As far as sets and costumes and quality I have very little basis of comparison as I have not seen it on stage or any opera for that matter.In short I found it to be very good though I'm probably one of the very few sixteen year olds who would agree with that.".

Riegel's Ottavio is just as he should be a humorless square and Te Kanawa soars as Elvira. My only casting complaint is with Moser as Anna she sounds very shrill. I liked the hint that perhaps Anna was despite appearances actually quite attracted to the Don as well her protestations to the lumpish Ottavio that she thought it was actually he who'd come to her bedroom didn't persuade and frankly I've always wondered why he was such a putz as to buy it. The settings are lush and lovely including Palladio's Villa Rotonda. Of course some of the lipsyncing is off a bit but that's to be expected.

	schema:reviewBody "Filmed opera can be shot either on stage one lead example is The Magic Flute by Ingmar Bergman but there are many others either on site as in a fiction movie. Rarely it combines both elements for instance The Tales of Hoffmann by Powell and Pressburger. Don Giovanni is a masterpiece of the latter kind.Granted the film is not the first opera offstage among others we must mention at least the memorable Tosca by De Bosio 1976 shot in the actual Roman locations where the action is supposed to take place. However Tosca was a TV movie while Don Giovanni was a fullscale cinema movie with live recordings. As such it has set high standards and a trend that was imitated later on La Traviata by Zeffirelli 1982 Carmen by Rosi 1984 Madame Butterfly by Mitterrand 1995. Unfortunately these films are rare because of costs settings singers mobilised for a long period important crew dedicated orchestra etc.. Hence stage filming is more common because it is cheaper to produce apart from royalties there are few additional costs than stage production.Even if you are not an opera amateur you will probably like this movie it is loaded with action and drama settings are impressive costumes are gorgeous. And the music ah the music anybody would love it. Mozart is eternal.Where to start with such a masterpiece? Since it is an opera with the most obvious the singers are top class. Ruggero Raimondi is a fabulous lead role. He conveys an intense aura throughout the movie he gives everything to the character he strips figuratively and literally he does not play Don Giovanni he IS Don Giovanni. We knew he was a great singer we now know he is a great actor. Jos Van Dam is a colourful stylish smart Leporello. It is a bright idea to attribute this role that was then frequently considered secondary to such a talented singer the character and plot gain depth. Teresa Berganza is a prodigious Zerlina although she was more than 40 when the movie was shot we believe she is a young peasant. Despite her small role she is the most convincing of the female singers. Most other performers are remarkable but these three break the house down in terms of singing and acting.The orchestra directed by Lorin Maazel is a firm support to these great artists. To be honest it is not the best interpretation but does the job for the purpose of the movie with its dynamic tone and sharp texture. For information the reference recordings are by Giulini which has my preference and Krips. I would also recommend Jacobs an elaborate version or Gardiner a redblooded account. At the time the acoustic was somewhat flawed which raised criticisms but has been corrected since.Settings and costumes do more than illustrate the plot they give it an altogether new dimension. Note the movie does not aim for historical accuracy as the abovementioned Tosca it was shot in Veneto Italy while the action is supposed to take place in Sevilla Spain. Losey aims here for maximal aesthetic effect. On the one hand details enhance the feeling of reality peasants working eating sleeping a lively wedding a lush party. On the other hand remote surroundings elaborate costumes and mysterious masks create a timeless and abstract atmosphere. This gives the movie its universal dimension which makes me believe it will never be surpassed.In such an environment the fabulous arias rise to artistic stratosphere. Madamina il catalogo  questo is illustrated by Leporello unwinding a huge manuscript down stairs and a hill we can barely believe what is happening we are bewildered like Donna Elvira. This brilliant idea has since been imitated numerous times on stage in different forms. L ci darem la mano is sung in a beautiful sunny house surrounded by friendly folks we believe as Zerlina that Don Giovanni will love her for ever. Dalla sua pace is sung by Don Ottavio in a boat floating among marshes the calm and surrealist surroundings increase the character's loneliness and melancholy. Likewise later on with Il mio tesoro where he wanders alone in deserted gardens.The overture where there is no action always is a tricky part what to film as the music plays? Losey imagines a splendid and clever scene Don Giovanni visits a glass fabric. We see him behind a fire an illustration of his devilish character and an anticipation of the fact he will be devoured by the flames of hell. Losey even manages to beautify the epilogue after Don Giovanni dies clearly not Mozart's best piece of music. The duel the wedding the love scenes the party the cemetery Don Giovanni's death etcetera etcetera all scenes are impressive and flawless. The movie is a long string of perfect pearls.Enhanced by this artistic vision the opera's themes are better than illustrated they are transcended. Desire love ambiguity humour social constraints domination money destiny fate it is rare to see a movie that is at the same time so enjoyable and so profound. Regardless if you are a connoisseur or not Don Giovanni will change your vision of filmed opera opera in general classical music music in general and even cinema. Already outstanding at the time it has now become a mustsee classic.".

By the time BORN TO THE WEST aka HELL TOWN came out in 1937 Morrison was really growing into the John Wayne persona. The swagger the drawl and the squint are all there. Perhaps the character wasn't quite perfected yet but the seeds of Wayne's future superstardom are there on the screen.And the film itself is much better as well. No longer is Wayne a goodietwoshoes milkdrinking kiddiematinee hero. His character here is flawedeven a bit of a screwup. The script the direction and the acting are miles ahead of his early films. It's certainly not one of the greatest movies he ever made but it's a solid enjoyable little Western.710".

Wayne's a cocky sort fancies himself a great lady's man and poker player. The Duke even in his later and more irascible years usually didn't have parts that called for that but here he does show that side of his character and shows it well.Wayne moves in on Marsha Hunt who is Brown's girl friend. That does throw a monkey wrench into the relationship between the cousins. Later on at the hands of cardsharps Monte Blue and James Craig Wayne gets himself in quite a hole. Johnny Mack Brown had an interesting career. He was an All American back for the Crimson Tide of Alabama before Paul Bryant took over the team. He opted for a Hollywood career and appeared opposite stars like Mary Pickford and Greta Garbo in silents. His Alabama drawl made him a natural for westerns and he was grinding out the B films just like the Duke was at this time. This is their only film together and they both complement each other's persona well.Although another great football player Jim Thorpe has a bit role in this film some lists have Alan Ladd in the cast. I have to say that I examined it frame by frame and there's no trace of Mr. Ladd.Even without Ladd it's a passably good B western could have used some better editing but better than some of what Wayne was doing at Monogram at the time.".

A large number of herd are being rustled in the area headed by saloon and casino owner Bart Hammond. Tom gives Dare a chance to earn an honest living Dare bills himself as the greatest poker player west of the Mississippi while Dink sells lightning rods as part of a payment scam by working on his next cattle drive. Dare accepts mostly to impress Tom's sweetheart Judy. After failing to lure Dare into working for him Hammond has a few of his men sent to sabotage the trail drive including herd boss Lyn who lost his job to Dare and regulated to a hand working the drive. When that fails Hammond along with card shark Brady lures Dare into a crooked poker game getting the money that Dare earned for the drive. Will Dare leave the game before its too late or will Tom have to bail his cousin out of this jam somehow? Very good movie with an excellent cast. Wayne seems to carry most of the film seeming odd that Brown was an established B western draw and he could have gotten more scenes in the film. Same goes for Monte Blue who just seemed to pop in and out as the villain Hammond. A bit too much of stock footage for me but there are plenty of good scenes and the poker game at the end is on heck of a scene with plenty of suspense. Rating based on Bwesterns 9.".

At any rate the film under 55 minutes long has the look and feel of a featurelength Western of the time and it survives far better than any other of the Western shorts of the period.The story is solid with relatively serious overtones concerning the possibility of redemption. Wayne's character a gambling addict is rightly transformed when he discovers that his cousin is a better gambler than he is but just prefers not to gamble.Wayne himself is in topform for the period. All the little gimmicks and gestures we associate with him are here in a way never seen in any film of his before this  his cautious smile his frown his ability to strike a pose leaning his weight on one leg his soft but firm voice of warning his ability to face a tough situation with grace and even one must admit an oddly noble humility. This is no longer the Singing Mesquiteer of the earlier potboilders this is finally the Duke who would star in Stagecoach and lead an army of fans including myself through film after film for four more decades.This is where the filmography of John 'Duke' Wayne rightfully begins  a film that has survived well and may yet survive a few decades more.Note in another film made the previous year Winds of the Wasteland Wayne can also be seen coming into his own as an actor but this is the better film.".

He replaces familiar faces George Gabby Hayes and Yakima Canutt here staples of the Lone Star films. John Wayne's charisma is beginning to develop here preparing him for the leap to super star status that he eventually achieved. Helltown was based on a novel by legendary Western author Zane Grey.

It turns out they were helping cattle rustlers!!! This is NOT a very heroic sort of role that's for sure!! Fortunately Wayne and his buddy are not killed but captured by a guy who just happens to be Wayne's goodygoody Cousin. This Cousin castigates Wayne for being a lazy schlemiel and shames him. After Wayne meets a pretty lady who happens to be the cousin's lady Wayne falls instantly in love and completely....or somewhat completely changes to the side of good! If only it were that easy!! Later in the film Wayne's Cousin places him in charge of a cattle drive. It's winwin for the Cousinif Wayne screws up it will help the Cousin win the girl once and for all and if Wayne succeeds he'll have turned his life around once and for all. What happens next is not at all out of the hero mold for Wayne and yet he still manages to get the girl! Weird...and certainly demotivational for the heroes out there watching the film! Despite a morally suspect hero and some dumb behaviors on his part the film is pretty entertaining. So ignore the inconsistencies and just enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much better than John Wayne's early westerns 19321935 in terms of script character development production values and cast. The beginning a supposed attempted rustling of a cattle herd is a little too extended and confusing since it combines so many different unrelated stock footage shots. In a couple of panoramic shots you see a rider on a golden palomino  could that be Johnny Mack Brown?Someone noted above that this film revitalized the flagging careers of both John Wayne and Johnny Mack Brown  they play cousins. It's a pleasure to see them both in the same film playing good guys. Brown is Tom Fillmore a level headed successful cattleman and business man and Wayne is 'Dare' Rudd surprisingly a cocky horny drifter a role similar to the one he played in The Desert Trail 1934 opposite Mary Kornman but it is even more developed here Dare loses all of the money from the sale of the herd in a crooked all night game of poker to Hammond and his card sharp when Tom shows up to regain the money and expose Hammond's crooked scheme.When Dare and Tom's girlfriend Judy Worstall the effective Marsha Hunt catch each other's eye Dare decides to settle down in their Wyoming town to chase her and seek honorable work. A well played love triangle develops between the three of them while the evil saloon owner Bart Hammond Monte Blue attempts to steal Fillmore's cattle herd and later the money for its sale.This film almost reaches first class A level movie making. By 1937 full length musical scores had become common this one has exciting allegro music during the action scenes and even a love theme played over Dare and Judy's scenes The Hills of Old Wyoming! Syd Saylor thankfully plays it straight and tough as the side kick avoiding his painful 'comic' schtick stuttering and Adam's Apple neck bobbing we saw in his earlier films.But we don't get a final battle between Dare and Hammond the villains are all too easily dispatched in group horseback shootouts and the only time John Wayne chases after anyone is to catch Judy on her runaway horse. So except for the last minute rescue when Dare and Tom are pinned down by Hammond's henchmen there isn't all that much action.This probably makes it a better film but I can only give it a 5.Note Marsha Hunt is fantastic in the amazingly darkly lit film noir classic Raw Deal 1948. When there's a close up of her face as she visits Dennis O'Keefe in prison you see Christian crosses gleam in her moist eyes. You also get Raymond Burr as a pyromaniac villain. She went on to a life time career of television work.".

	schema:reviewBody "A good little movie that runs out of time before it runs out of story Born To The West offers a rare chance to see John Wayne making a western in the 1930s with a decent budget for a change even if it is still a Bpicture.Also known as Hell Town which is the title with the version I saw the film presents Wayne in an unusual role that of the aptly named Dare a wild and crazy fellow as his cousin Tom John Mack Brown calls him. Dare happens into Tom's home state of Wyoming looking for work and not particular how he gets it.An opening scene sets up the character as Dare and his comicrelief buddy Dink Syd Saylor show up in the middle of a gun battle between two groups of strangers.Which side you favor? Dare asks.Which side's winning? Dink answers thinking of his stomach.Dare and Dink would just as soon blow out of town after Tom hands over 100 in travelling funds until Dare gets a look at Tom's girl Judy Marsha Hunt. Hell Town then becomes an involving duel of personalities between Dare and the upright Tom who offers Dare plenty of opportunities to mess up and lose his claim on Judy.Hell Town benefits from a solid cast funny dialogue and able direction from Charles Barton who knew how to make a genre film work. His bestremembered film combines two genres Abbott  Costello Meet Frankenstein. Dink is always trying to sell lightning rods while Dare is out to prove himself the best poker player west of the Mississippi. Neither are successful but it's fun watching them try and fail again.The conflict involves a gang of cattle rustlers and their boss who works on Dare trying to get him to switch sides. Because the film runs under an hour there's little chance to develop any tension regarding what Dare will do and the ending is downright perfunctory in most particulars. But you do get a chance to see a nifty poker playing scene where cousin Tom steps in and helps Dare handle a tense situation the film's highlight.The rest of the film is pretty good too and represents a chance to see Wayne play a kind of ne'erdowell. He banters enjoyably with Saylor while showing ample nerve with Hunt Since you're not already spoken for I guess I'll just marry you. Wayne would play stolid good guys and hard cases but here is a rare chance to see him as likable rogue a direction his career might have gone if not for John Ford.".

In combination with The Malta Story Scapegoat allowed Guiness to indulge both his more serious dramatic inclinations as well as play another double role something for which he was a master. His Kind Hearts and Coronets is the tour de force of this genre of multiple identities.This adaptation of Du Maurier's novel has also the advantage of five strong female leads three of them Bette Davis Irene Worth and Pamela Brown known in their own right for their dramatic achievement. Actually all of the supporting roles are excellently cast even to the faithful manservant Gaston and especially the count's precocious and very articulate daughter.Bette Davis as the matriarch sets the tone for neurotic tyranny in this family but it is a role that could have been less of a caricature if Dame Wendy Hiller had played it instead See Dame Wendy in Murder on the Orient Express for the epitome of noblesse oblige. In the role of the wife Irene Worth gains some of our sympathy as the highstrung and beautiful sensitive but persecuted spouse unable to give the count a male heir. Her mobile and expressive face is a perfect foil to Guiness's stoic reserve.As the count's sister Pamela Brown's natural reticence and grave air her huge luminous eyes and rich voice which can be savored in an earlier role in I Know Where I'm going made her a likely choice in the role of a sibling however the differences she shares with her brother are not resolved nor explained neither is her motivation for being so antagonistic toward him. In other words through the eliptical somewhat ambiguous dialogue there is a history or subtext of sibling rivalry of which we must remain ignorant. Perhaps the novel delineated this more clearly.Despite the strong and balanced cast I found the ending a surprise and a slight disappointment. For me it failed to resolve Guiness's relationship with the other females save one his lover. Therefore despite the putative attempt to plumb his character it remained an identity problem hardly more than skin deep. Still all in all it is a fascinating attempt and a rare chance to see Guinness in a noncombative drama with strong females somewhat like a diamond set among a ruby emerald and pearl.Of four stars definitely a strong three for the excellent cast.".

In Kind Hearts he had the benefit of a variety of disguises and voices. In this film he had to create two completely different characters who look exactly alike. Of course he does so magnificently.This isn't the most successful DuMaurier adaptation  that honor has to go to Rebecca in my book but The Scapegoat has a strong cast  Guinness Bette Davis Irene Worth Pamela Brown and the lovely Nicole Maurey. The atmosphere of this black and white film is somewhat depressing given the gargantuan ugly home the family resides in  but it is certainly the right mood for what Guinness inherits when his double disappears. Bette Davis is good if on the grand guignol side. Guinness does so much with just a gesture her histrionics seem out of place. All in all it's a good film  it's very hard to go wrong when Alec Guinness is involved.".

At first of course he protests saying he is John Barrat. But the Count has made sure that no one will listen by telegraphing his doctor that he's been having delusions that he's someone else. Being a man that really had no one that cared about him to begin with he decides to go on with the charade. The plot thickens from there on. Good story  a fine supporting cast make this an interesting murder mystery. Enjoy it if you can find it. TCM is short for Turner Classic Movies cable station. It is worth note that this story is by the same author of Hitchcock's Rebecca another murder mystery worth viewing  much easier to find.".

The university teacher takes over the aristocrat's life and proves rather good at it so much so that he does not want to recover his old life when the aristocrat asks him to. The climax is a violent one. Hamer's film although set in France takes a particularly English approach to death the performances are quietly understated and the atmosphere of menace restrained. Bette Davis seems rather out of place in a cameo role as the aristocrat's mother her grande dame performance complete with rolling New England vowels contrasts starkly with that of Guinness. The ending is a bit peremptory betraying the fact that THE SCAPEGOAT was not without its production difficulties especially when scriptwriter Gore Vidal had to deal with an increasingly alcoholic director.

In a few weeks he has grown accustomed to his new life develops a fondness for his wife and child and brings a social conscience to the family by insisting that a failing company remain open so that dozens of people can keep their jobs. It's a lifechanging transformation not just for the family but for Barratt who realizes he has finally found what he's looking for.De Gue's dark motives are revealed later when he needs an alibi and Barratt realizes he has been a patsy.This movie is kind of stiff and formal but on the other hand the actors are playing people who probably act like that all the time.

NOTES Location scenes filmed in the Loire Valley France. COMMENT Newsweek headed their review of the book with the caption Take Me Back to Manderlay. Indeed there are so many echoes of Rebecca in the film it often seems the sprawling chateau and its atmospheric surrounds is the real star of the movie rather than Mr Guinness or rather two of Mr Guinness who revels in the cleverly crafted split screen special effects. Mind you that is all to the good for neither Guinness is terribly convincing. Not all his fault either. The book takes great pains to point out that the Barrett character can speak French like a native. And what does Mr Guinness speak? English! Not a word of French would you believe in either of his incarnations. The same goes for the rest of the cast. British accents all around. In fact the only person who has a foreign accent is the lovely Nicole Maurey. Still that is a convention I guess we have to put up with. But even suspending our disbelief the film still presents insoluble problems. The plot seems not only confused and confusing but takes an interminable time to get under way. It is Miss Maurey of course who makes the picture worth watching. Despite her star billing Miss Davis has only two or three scenes. It is is young Annabel Bartlett who enjoys the principal female role though Irene Worth as the wife and Pamela Brown as the sister are allowed to share in the histrionics. The Scapegoat is one of those rare movies that actually play better at least in a widescreen format on television where the viewer can relax in comfort and doesn't really care how long the plot takes to make itself clear or how talkative and slowmoving it all is. True attractively atmospheric scenery and a fair dollop of production values help too.".

He must be 100 years old by now! Geoffrey Keen is sublime as the manservant Gaston. For me though the irascible daughter steals this movie and makes it her own. The jolly hockey sticks are strong with this one! An odd beginning and an unsatisfying ending...I haven't read the book but it's never clear to me if the innocent French teacher on holiday in France was deliberately set up way in advance or he really did just meet his doppelganger by chance and allow himself to be dragged into this vortex of intrigue.But that aside when John Barrat eventually arrives at the large house and is welcomed as Jacques De Gue that rather messy start is forgiven and forgotten.And the ending also fails to satisfy completely too. I'd like to have seen how his future gets worked out with his adopted family. Instead we see him snogging his mistress.It's nice to see France as it once was and how I remember it in my childhood on holidays. Quiet with serene cobbled streets and ancient houses. I can still remember the powerful smell of fresh French bread in the mornings... What a shame all that is now gone.Sir Alec underplays his part and casually strolls through the fantastic situation that he's been thrust into. I'd like to have seen David Niven have a shot at this.

Jacque bored and overwhelmed by family dynamics wants out of his own life drugs John and replaces John's passport with Jacque's and John Barratt is forced to take on the role of Jacque De Gu however much he initially protests he soon acquiesces to the switch since no one wants to believe the bizarre story of being a replacement.The story worked. The supporting cast were more than adequate to the task. The story line and characters were sufficiently complex to be riveting.But finally Jacque De Gu reappears. His resolution is to shoot John Barratt dead. Just prior to this John Barratt had deliberately harmed his right hand to get out of a shooting contest which would give the game away.So at the end there is something of a duel with each other but only one survives. What one survives? One clue is the bandaged hand but Jacque De Gu could have replicated a bandage on his own hand. To me the telling moment came with the lack at the end of internal monologuenarrative that John Barratt had engaged in as the movie unfolded to explain motivation. That lack seemed to suggest that Jacque De Gu did indeed shoot to death John Barratt. But like all good mystery films the ambiguity adds to the suspense.".

Decades before his comical butler in Murder By Death As you can see I can see he chuckles in that Neil Simon classic or guiding the heroes of Star Wars Guennis was stunning audiences and critics alike with each performance he gave.This version of the novel by Daphne DuMaurier goes down familiar territory in the tale of a man assuming the life of another and only getting into trouble with the results of those actions. Here the good man is an unwilling participant while the bad man remains mostly in the background waiting like a spider to strike so he can swallow the fly. In this case the intended fly is his fragile wife Pamela Brown while bad Guennis wants to obviously frame good Guennis for her murder. Thrown into the midst is a mistress bad Guennis's two children and his psychotic bedridden mama played as if an older Fanny Skeffington by Bette Davis. Unlike other Du Maurier mysteries successfully done on screen most notably Rebecca and My Cousin Rachel The Scapegoat is plagued with a confusing narrative. Guennis is excellent and fortunately he is on screen for most of the film so this does sustain interest. But the legendary Bette isn't at her best here and screams most of her lines as if preparing to kick Joan Crawford in Baby Jane. She only has three scenes two of them while in bed so there are only a few opportunities to feel sorry for her. As an acting exercise for Guennis this is worth watching but that is the only positive statement I can muster concerning this misfire.".

	schema:reviewBody "The best description that can be afforded the almost forgotten AND NOW TOMORROW is I should think a neat and enjoyable well written romantic drama. Produced in 1944 for Paramount Pictures by Fred Kohlmar it derived from the novel by Rachel Field and was beautifully directed by Irving Pichel. The movie is notable for its appealing screenplay which was put together by Frank Portos and surprisingly Raymond Chandler. Ace cinematographer Daniel Fapp gave it a superlative crisp black and white look and the great Victor Young gave it a gorgeous sound with his lovely score.Emily Blair Loretta Young is the rich sophisticated industrial heiress who finds that after a bout with meningitis she is stone deaf. Searching throughout America and Europe for a specialist who could possibly cure her she finally gives up hope and now concentrates at home on her forthcoming marriage to wealthy Jeff Stoddard Barry Sullivan. Emily's doctor and family friend Dr. Weeks Cecil Kellaway has a new associate in the young Dr. Marek Vance Alan Ladd who coincidently is working on a new serum to cure meningitis deafness. After he cures a rabbit of the deafness Dr. Weeks suggests to the young doctor to try and experiment on Emily. He Refuses at first but after Emily's entreaties he reluctantly agrees. In the meantime Emily's attractive sister the vivacious Janice Susan Hayward begins having an affair with her sister's intended and things really get complicated when Dr. Vance falls in love with Emily his patient. But the core of the story is Dr. Vance's experimental serum and will it work on Emily. Of course in the final reel and like all good romantic dramas everything works itself out to everyones satisfaction.Performances are just about fine from the entire cast. The beautiful Loretta Young just lights up the screen as the pivotal character of the piece and Alan Ladd is excellent in a different kind of role to which he was usually assigned at the time. This is not the hard bitten two fisted tough guy we are so used to seeing him play. Here he is a subdued almost reticent gentleman of medicine. It is a likable and well balanced performance. This was a pleasing change of pace for the actor and his scenes with Young are engaging and appealing. The pair had starred together the previous year in Paramount's wartime adventure CHINA and were a hit with audiences. Good too is the lovely Susan Hayward in another step on her ladder to full stardom and Barry Sullivan as her weak willed and noncommittal lover.Also of note is the marvellous score by the brilliant tunesmith Victor Young. There is a lovely waltz theme for Emily which is heard in its broadest rendition under the titles and for the film's softer moments in scenes with Young and Ladd. And there's an equally lovely theme for the errant lovers Janice and Jeff which is played in one scene as an attractive waltz at a family gettogether.AND NOW TOMORROW is not and never was regarded as a brilliant motion picture but it is and will remain an engaging enjoyable well produced and well played romance.".

Ladd probably got the top spot because in 1944 all men were fighting overseas leaving the women to make up the majority of the audience.  Still his portrayal is very believable as one who has humble beginnings yet rises in the class structure while still showing rough edges.  The poor boy and rich girl theme is not as boring as it seems.  The LaddYoung interaction works well as their characters develop a reluctant caring for one another.The supporting cast and crew represent a Hollywood Who's Who at the time. Beulah Bondi is one of the great supporting actors of the 30s and 40s. Her appearances while cameo always added depth to her films.  Susan Hayward is superb as the brash assertive sister.  One could go on Barry Sullivan with his mellow distinctive voice costumes by Edith Head one of the great ladies of Hollywood music by Victor Young.Yes the movie is dated.   The Great Depression looms in the background. But that is also its strength.  Seldom was the Depression ever directly mentioned in the cinema.  It truly was one of the most formative experiences of American life because it affected the entire population.  While class envy always existed in our collective culture class hatred never engendered much support.  This movie touches on this with sophistication.".

So I realized there were a few mistakes...but they certainly won't bother the average viewer. So when I laugh when I see a woman learn to PERFECTLY speech read the newer term for lip reading...as almost no one can do it like the character does in this movie and most other films featuring deaf folks. No deaf people cannot magically and perfectly understand folks by watching their lips...just like blind people cannot read with their fingers like Daredevil!When the story begins Emily Blair Loretta Young is seeing yet another specialist who informs her they cannot cure her deafness. You see she recently lost her hearing due to meningitis and learned to read lips almost INSTANTLY. However a very grouchy young doctor Dr. Vance Alan Ladd MIGHT be able to help her. So she puts her life into his hands...which is tough since he HATES the Blair family and has a hard time separating that from Emily.At the same time Emily's fiance Barry Sullivan is waiting and waiting...two years. And not surprisingly he's tired of waiting and has fallen in love with Emily's sister Susan Hayward. But because he wants to be a good and faithful guy he STILL plans to marry Emily...but his heart certainly isn't in it! So what's to become of all this melodrama? See the film...you'll enjoy it. Overall it well acted though I WISH they had Ladd play someone who WASN'T grouchy as he played a grouch in MOST of his films!! Still despite this Young and the rest are quite good and the film a nice date night film...provided your date likes old films. If she doesn't...dump her I am kidding.".

	schema:reviewBody "And Now Tomorrow could have been a great romantic picture. It had a top notch cast and interesting premise but the script collapses somewhere in the middle of the story never delivering the romance a movie of this type needs to stay interesting. I don't know the book the movie was based on I'm not really a fan of this sort of stories but I can hardly believe that it was as weak on logic as this script. This movie got 7 stars from me mostly because Alan Ladd does a very good job showing the 'conversion' of a bitter resentful doctor from the wrong side of the tracks into a passionate man in love with an unattainable woman. He immediately establishes that he finds Emily Loretta Young attractive but spoiled. Then there is a slow dawning of admiration for her spunk followed by recognition of her vulnerability and finally something much deeper. My favorite is the scene in the diner after the somewhat contrived emergency operation. You can see in Ladd's face and in his words that he starts to deeply care for Emily whom he now considers a friend. This follows to an inevitable confrontation with Emily and confession of his feelings totally in keeping with the straight shooting nevertobeabletosufferin silence type Dr. Vance supposed to be. The movie is worth seeing if only to admire Ladd's range which inexplicably was and is continuously questioned by the critics. Where the film suffers is in the portrayal of Emily Blair Ms. Young can play to a tee the proud spoiled socialite with big problems but she cannot overcome a very inconsistent script. Initially our heroine can be excused to be so selfabsorbed after all she is trying to overcome what she considers a major handicap but after while given that this supposed to be a love story she should start showing some kind of affinity towards the doctor. Never do we see that she finds him in the least bit attractive. Never do we see any kind of deeper feeling developing for him. For most part she treats him no better than an employee somewhat tiresome to boot. The above mentioned diner scene shows only that she begins to see him as a consummate professional. In fact the cure is the only thing she seems to want from the good handsome doctor as he bitterly points out in the latter part of the picture. Therefore the last 15 minutes or so are completely incomprehensible. There in quick succession she forces the marriage with the long suffering finance with whom she spends no time whatsoever since she started seeing the doctor driving a decisive stake through Dr. Vance's heart then she emotionally blackmails the lovelorn doctor into jeopardizing his career and everything he worked for just so she can take another long shot at the cure for the sake of happiness with another man she actually tells Dr. Vance that!. Then improbably she gets over the shock of finding out that the man she was going to marry in a few days doesn't love her anymore it takes her less than 30 seconds of the screen time! and finally hold on to your hats folks! chasing Dr. Vance to Pittsburgh. What?! Frankly at this point if I were Dr. Vance I would slam my door in her face! D To be fair Loretta Young is not entirely to blame here  the script and direction gave her character just one dimension spoiled brat who cannot see beyond her own concerns. Good supporting cast doesn't have too much to do either with possible exception of Ms. Hayward who manages to inject some interesting spark into the role of Emily's spunky younger sister.".

And Now Tomorrow is more Loretta's kind of film and while it's better than China it will never be ranked as in the top ten for either Ladd or Young.This one is a medical soap opera the only time Ladd ever did one of these kind of films in his career. Young is a socialite who never thought about social problems in the town that she was brought up in which incidentally is named after her family the town's chief employer.

Now all grown up Ladd's got class resentments.And he's back in his hometown at the behest of Dr. Cecil Kellaway who has heard of his experiments with curing deaf people who got it as a result of spinal meningitis. That's what gave Young her deafness and among other things postponed her marriage to another yuppie Barry Sullivan.The main focus in this film is the growing mutual attraction between doctor and patient despite all their differences. A subplot also involves Sullivan seeing Young's sister Susan Hayward on the side.And Now Tomorrow is kind of a secular version of Magnificent Obsession without all the religious folderol that Lloyd C. Douglas put into his work involved. For those who like soap opera type films And Now Tomorrow will do. Young made a ton of these in her career but it wasn't Alan Ladd's cup of tea.".

It was Chandler of course who famously said that Ladd was a small boy's idea of a tough guy and as someone who admires both Chandler and Ladd I've always been uneasy with the quote. It is of course undeniable that Chandler writing entirely alone turned out a vintage Ladd vehicle in The Blue Dahlia but alas And Now Tomorrow is a wilting violet by comparison. Basically a soap it's the one about the rich girl who falls for her doctor and Bette Davis did it so much better in Dark Victory albeit Dr. George Brent was unable to cure her terminal illness. Ladd fares much better with Loretta Young's total deafness where better surgeons failed but along the way we get Young's sister Susan Hayward stealing fianc Barry Sullivan from under her nose. It passes the time but could have been so much better.".

Somehow Ms. Young came off kind of awkward in appearance here perhaps partially due to compensations having to be made for the difference in height between the two leads. But she seemed less graceful overall than I've ever seen her even in a lot of the costumes. As mentioned this is a departure for Ladd in type and he's good enough doing what he did but not 100 for the pairing. He seemed to be mocking and scoffing at Emily all the way through despising her really rather extremely and then suddenly he's in love with her. Not so smooth a transition. Yet I enjoyed some of it but it was just too choppy between them overall. The ending was unforgivable. Ms. Young's automatic speaking of the title phrase was so flat and inept as was the following kiss with Ladd looking like he was lying in her lap with his head on her chest. Just so awkward.The rest of it was smooth enough if not redeeming of the angst created by the above. Barry Sullivan was in very good looks here Susan Hayward doing a good enough job. Ms. Bondi as always provided quality and authenticity in her unusual role as a society matron. Cecil Kellaway was wonderful. Maybe another try at some future date.".

Alas this turns out to be nothing more than a typical Hollywood phenomenon. A more inappropriate assignment for Chandler would be difficult to imagine. It's probably sufficient to say that the screenplay bears not a jot of the literary qualities inherent in Chandler's famous novels. The dialogue here is banal and clichridden and the few attempts at wit are clumsily inept. And although the movie stars Alan Ladd he plays a doctor would you believe not a gangster or a pseudodetective or a gungho adventurer or a fastonthedraw cowboy? However while Ladd and his costar Loretta Young are writeoffs the movie does effectively present Susan Hayward in an unsympathetic role which she plays with such panache it will probably startle many of her fans. A pity the rest of the movie holds such little interest although Helen Mack makes a favorable impression in an unusual role. She plays Angeletta Gallo and is hard to recognize. But yes that's Helen Mack all right!".

She wipes the fear and shame away and asks even though it humiliates her to do it them to repeat themselves. It's very realistic and natural.When she falls ill Loretta breaks her engagement to Barry Sullivan so that his quality of life isn't diminished for having to care for a sick person. Alan Ladd a new unknown doctor wants to experiment on Loretta to see if he can cure her and in the many months of the treatment Barry falls in love with Loretta's sister Susan Hayward. And Now Tomorrow is very similar to Dark Victory so if you liked one there's a good chance you'll like the other.

Both may have grown up rich and spoiled but while Young seems to have settled into being a nice young lady sister Hayward is selfish and cold. Having been away in a clinic after suffering from meningitis Young returns home having lost her hearing. Her fiancee Barry Sullivan has been carrying on with Hayward during her absence and Young's deafness puts a damper on Hayward's plans for Sullivan to break off their engagement. Along comes ear doctor Alan Ladd who has discovered a radical way of restoring hearing in a rabbit no less! and Young pushes Ladd to become his guinea bunny in seeing if the procedure works on humans.Certainly there are a few obstacles in the way of this being entirely convincing but the performances and A grade production values makes this an interesting well made drama. A scene shows Ladd the son of an old employee of Young and Hayward's father who made a scene in their home at an employee Christmas gathering recalling seeing Young as a child with Young recalling the hatred she saw pouring from his young eyes. Fortunately Young isn't made out to be excessively noble and Hayward as cold as her character is isn't a complete monster. Beulah Bondi as the girl's aunt Grant Mitchell as their uncle Cecil Kellaway as Ladd's mentor and Jonathan Hale as Young's first doctor offer strong support. I didn't quite believe the ending which ties everything up far too conveniently and far too easily. Unfortunately my desire to see Hayward get taken down by both her sister and Sullivan didn't happen either but it's pretty obvious that a character like hers would end up dumped and alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell wrote the best one line review of In the Mood for Love when he said that it is dizzy with a romantic spirit that's been missing from the cinema forever. How true those words are! Truly romantic films are so rare these days while films that include plenty of sex and nudity which are often portrayed in a smutty and gratuitous manner abound. So given this cinematic climate Wong Karwai's latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air. In the Mood for Love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors Mr. Chow played by Tony Leung and Mrs. Chan played by Maggie Cheung whose spouses are having an illicit affair as they try not to be like them. But after hanging out with each other on lonely nights while their spouses are away on businesstaking care of a sick mother they fall madly in love and must resist the temptation of going too far.Several factors are responsible for making In the Mood for Love a new classic among romantic melodramas in the best sense of that term. First the specific period of the film i.e. 1960's Hong Kong is faithfully recreated to an astonishing degree of detail. The clothes including Maggie Cheung's lovely dresses the music e.g. Nat King Cole and the overall atmosphere of this film evokes a nostalgia for that specific period. Second Christopher Doyle's awardwinning breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelopes its two main characters but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of its sumptuous meticulously composed frame. Make no mistake about it In the Mood for Love was the most gorgeous film of 2001. It should also be mentioned that Wong Karwai's usual hyperkinetic visual style is understandably toned down for this film although his pallet remain just as colorful. Third there is the haunting score by Michael Galasso which is accompanied by slow motion sequences of e.g. Chan walking in her elegant dresses Chan and Chow glancing at each other as they pass one another on the stairs and other beautiful scenes which etch themselves into one's memory. The main scorewhich makes its instruments sound as though they're literally cryingis heard eight times throughout various points in the film and it serves to highlight the sadness and the longing which the two main characters feel. Fourth Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both deliver wonderful performances Leung won the prize for best actor at Cannes and they manage to generate real chemistry on screen.The above elements coalesce and work so nicely together to create a film that feels timeless dizzyingly romantic and in a word magical. In the Mood for Love perhaps more than any other film of 2001 reminded me why it is that I love going to the movies. And I guess that is about the highest compliment that I can pay to a film.".

All the film revolves around that and the rest is pure enhancement. At the core of the film are two characters that will ease into your heart and stay there long after the end credits roll Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are simply amazing and no language barrier undermines a single fragment of immediacy and truth they display. The additional material is also topnotch the films is magnificent to behold in part lensed by Hero's Christopher Doyle and the music is heartbreaking.This is something everybody must see if only because it is by far the most heartfelt mature and authentic love story out there.

Beautiful elegant and restrained with a narrative pace to match. A film with sensitivity and understated qualities that is rare in these times of clichd plots. The beautifully subdued photography saturated in rich luxurious colors and for lack of better words each frame is filled with an air of tension. The settings and locations are used repeatedly but the film manages to breath new life into them each time they featured there always seems to be a key prop light fixture or set piece to slightly clue the audience as to where we are in the characters world.The acting reminds me of the The Bicycle Thief not the style but the fact that you forget that you are watching two actors engaged in their craft. There is meaning behind every gesture and almost every movement has assigned significance to explain the inside world of the characters the relationship the feelings and situation of the two lovers. The dialogue is sparse but like the rest of the movie is imbued with meaning. Speaking of meaning the soundtrack is infectious. Used here it becomes a story telling device. And although the film is of Chinese origins even a song sung in Spanish by Nat King Cole imparts the film with subtle meaning. The orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive but the repetition is what makes it comfortable. It is used in conjunction with the story and not just a means to put music to action or to cue the audience to feel a certain way at a certain plot point.I would not recommend this film to anybody I fear most people would be jaded by the calm flow of the story but I would recommend it to someone who is looking for an alternative to the romantic schlock that fills the multiplexes on our side of the world. I must say that I was completely taken by this film and continued to watch it night after night. The story takes time to present itself and bears repeated viewings as very few films in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. A very beautiful movie.".

	schema:headline " Possibly Wong KarWai's best film";
	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to see why many people consider In the Mood for Love to be Wong KarWai's best film. The toned down appeal of the film centering on the studied view of a relationship put through an emotional ringer is a retread into Happy Together territory but without the hyperkinetic patchwork of jarring film stocks and hypersaturated sequences that have become a trademark of KarWai's films since Chungking Express. Like Soderbergh's The Limey this is a different kind of curio for KarWai where dialogue and plot are forsaken by mood and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in a seemingly confining emotional stasis.It's a testament to the genius of KarWai that he is capable to making such a simple tale so resonating. Chow MoWan Tony Leung and Su Lizhen Maggie Cheung move in nextdoor to each other within the same apartment building. He's a journalist who dreams of publishing martialarts novels and she is a secretary at a shipping company. Their eventual coupling is obvious from the beginning but the pleasure here is the way that KarWai ambiguously paints such a journey with his grand masterstrokes.The key to the success of the film is KarWai's use of the interior space playing with foreground and background planes in ways that are similar to the works of Polanski. During the wooingly sensuous first half of the film KarWai isolates Leung and Cheung within shots in such a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible. KarWai is concerned with environment and space here creating a cramped emotional dynamic between his characters. It's also telling that KarWai never chooses to focus on the physicality of MoWan and Lizhen's spouses. Their faceless partners are noticeably absent from the film as they are tending to their own love affairs with each other.This is not to suggest that In the Mood for Love is a confining experience because KarWai manages to inundate his film with broad splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sound. There is one shot where Cheung's slow sensual rise up a metaphorical stairway turns into Leung's descent down the very same stairwell their movements perfectly compliment each other bookending the shot and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two figures. Their souls have connected but they have yet to physically unite. The erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating as two starcrossed lovers reject physical consummation due to their humble fidelity.Other scenes in the film are punctuated with brief slowmotion shots of Cheung erotically moving through her interior surroundings set to Mike Galasso's hauntingly beautiful score. Cheung's dresses beautifully compliment her exterior space as she moves slowly through her surroundings. Her movements slowly build up to what seems to be an inevitable fusion between Liszhen and her dream lover even though the seduction process seems to be entirely subconscious.If I make it seem that these two characters are more like two birds unleashing pheromones on each other it probably isn't that farfetched of a statement. The tight bond these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship to the exteriors. The film rarely moves into an exterior space and when the camera does it is usually to peak through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals. KarWai continues to tease us even when the lovers get close enough to touch shattering the couple's proximity to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps within articles of clothing located inside of a closet. Mother Nature even seems to respond to their love lust often unleashing a soft crest of rain over the characters after their bodies have glided near each other.KarWai's hauntingly atmospheric shots of a waterfall allowed Leung's Lai YuFai to experience a cathartic release in Happy Together even if Leslie Cheung's Ho Powing was not there to enjoy it with him. By that film's end love was so inextricably bound to the act of war that a third man's muted declarations of love signaled YuFai's realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace even if it would not bring him back his lover. MoWan's journey terminates within the confines of a crumbling temple. His own emotional depletion is paralleled nicely with the political climate of his country and the absence of Liszhen is only made tolerable by the fact that KarWai allows MoWan to experience a release of sorts. MoWan caters to an ancient myth and his secretive release into a crack in the temple leaves him capable of living his days with the hope that all his loss and heartache somehow served a higher purpose.".

Their faceless partners are noticeably absent from the film as they are tending to their own love affairs with each other.This is not to suggest that In the Mood for Love is a confining experience because KarWai manages to inundate his film with broad splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sound. There is one shot where Cheung's slow sensual rise up a metaphorical stairway turns into Leung's descent down the very same stairwell their movements perfectly compliment each other bookending the shot and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two figures. Their souls have connected but they have yet to physically unite. The erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating as two starcrossed lovers reject physical consummation due to their humble fidelity.Other scenes in the film are punctuated with brief slowmotion shots of Cheung erotically moving through her interior surroundings set to Mike Galasso's hauntingly beautiful score. Cheung's dresses beautifully compliment her exterior space as she moves slowly through her surroundings. Her movements slowly build up to what seems to be an inevitable fusion between Liszhen and her dream lover even though the seduction process seems to be entirely subconscious.If I make it seem that these two characters are more like two birds unleashing pheromones on each other it probably isn't that farfetched of a statement. The tight bond these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship to the exteriors. The film rarely moves into an exterior space and when the camera does it is usually to peak through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals. KarWai continues to tease us even when the lovers get close enough to touch shattering the couple's proximity to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps within articles of clothing located inside of a closet. Mother Nature even seems to respond to their love lust often unleashing a soft crest of rain over the characters after their bodies have glided near each other.KarWai's hauntingly atmospheric shots of a waterfall allowed Leung's Lai YuFai to experience a cathartic release in Happy Together even if Leslie Cheung's Ho Powing was not there to enjoy it with him. By that film's end love was so inextricably bound to the act of war that a third man's muted declarations of love signaled YuFai's realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace even if it would not bring him back his lover. MoWan's journey terminates within the confines of a crumbling temple. His own emotional depletion is paralleled nicely with the political climate of his country and the absence of Liszhen is only made tolerable by the fact that KarWai allows MoWan to experience a release of sorts. MoWan caters to an ancient myth and his secretive release into a crack in the temple leaves him capable of living his days with the hope that all his loss and heartache somehow served a higher purpose.";

I must admit this is one of the best love movies maybe the best of all I have ever watched. The content and the form overlaps perfectly. As watching the secret love we see the characters in bounded frames that limits their movements as well as their feelings. Beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the blues even touchable. I want to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee for their fantastic cinematography which creates the mood for love. Also the music defines the sadness of the love which plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in despairing moods. And of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real. Eventually all the elements in the film combined in a perfect way under the direction of WKW and give the audience the feeling called love.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two people living in the same flat complex find their partners are having an affair with each other. As they try and piece together how it happened they also embark on an emotional journey that aches for a resolutionBuilding on his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express Wong Kar Wai gives us this rather old fashioned and marvellous story of reawakened passions yearning and unrequited love. Possibly In the Mood for Love is not to everyone's taste. It wanders in rather lazily at 98mins not particularly long for a film but it appears longer because not a lot really happens. But this lazy feel conceals a quite tightly constructed film. Most of the story is cunningly woven around a series of set piece role plays where the characters act out presumed scenarios between their respective spouses trying to work out how the affair started. I say cunning because of course this makes it difficult for the audience and the characters to tell what is inrole and what is genuine. If all this sounds rather arty and selfconscience that's because it is. Unashamedly so. And it is played to perfection by two of Hong Kong's finest Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai with some excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan.It is also a virtuoso performance by Wong Kar Wai who treats the audience to a sensory and sensual overload. Bringing together Christopher Doyle who later deployed his lush overripe style on Hero and Pin Bing Lee whose beautifully understated style can be seen on Springtime in a Small Town was cinematographic genius. It has all the bold beauty of Doyle without frankly the Athenaposter cheesiness of his work on Hero. The music as always with Wong is prominent. From Nat King Cole singing in Spanish to the haunting strings of the main theme it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images. All in all a top film whether judged on plot acting cinematography or soundtrack. Similar to but more accessible than Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire this is a beautiful old fashioned story about love lost and regained. And watch out for Tony Leung's hotel room 2046 which presaged Wong's recent film of the same name.".

It's not hard to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and nonverbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of reenacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters' lives. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of Mr. Chow Tony Leung and Mrs. Su Lizhen Maggie Cheung to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationship.The plot even resembles something that Duras could have written Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su Lizhen neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them and they discover quite naturally it's with each other. The question is should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners? Every scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other and at one point it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of Cheung's dresses we never see it. And just as not seeing either of their spouses heightens their own love story not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something to happen  some catalyst  and the only one which comes is when Leung reveals to her that he loves her followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband which implies that neither will he. It also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do from a Western point of view a consummation of their romance into a more solid lasting affair would have been possible especially in the 60s but as it's Hong Kong cultural values are markedly different.Performances here are of the high order it's very easy to play a torrid love affair but to continually play a repressed platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual. Cheung and Leung smolder and their blighted chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.Start with your typical Hong Kong Kung Fu movie. A normal director will simply film that. But not this guy.What drives kung fu movies is not the bozos doing the fighting but the masters behind them who use them as surrogates. But then what drives the kung fu masters? The fellow writing the story that's who.That's where this kung fu movie starts. The central figure is the writer of a successful martial arts series. But it is even more abstract the film is about what creates him.It is half about his space. every shot starts or finishes on the surrounding space very close confining. That space includes his neighbor who is thrust into his life by proximity and indirect relationship.I choose to think that the relationship between the spouses is imagined part of an extended role playing activity which forms the core of the film.

But not this guy.What drives kung fu movies is not the bozos doing the fighting but the masters behind them who use them as surrogates. But then what drives the kung fu masters? The fellow writing the story that's who.That's where this kung fu movie starts. The central figure is the writer of a successful martial arts series. But it is even more abstract the film is about what creates him.It is half about his space. every shot starts or finishes on the surrounding space very close confining. That space includes his neighbor who is thrust into his life by proximity and indirect relationship.I choose to think that the relationship between the spouses is imagined part of an extended role playing activity which forms the core of the film.

The beginning of the film starts with a two different people moving into an apartment. This is scene that most people get lost in and then can't understand the movie. The theme of the film is about a two people who find out that there spouses are cheating on them with the other spouse. This is where the film took a unique path from the other Hollywood films it follows the journey of them falling in love. The film is not about cheating it is about the struggle and the tension created by Chow and So can be felt. The film is not about a sexual affair but it is about an emotional affair. The story has a perfect ending for this film. The film is not like the rest of the other Love Film genre. The best thing about the film is the way it was filmed. The movie is ALL about tone. The tone is created by the songs and by the color of the scene. The music compliments the scene so perfectly that the songs could have been a character in the film. The slow motion is overly used in many other films but it is used perfectly in this film. The color of the scene and dresses is used to show the emotion that the two characters cannot show to each other. This film is an example about how film about romance can be shown without sex. This is a perfect example of why film making is an art work. The film sets a great tone that the song Yumeji's Theme haunts me at night.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wong KarWai's elegant study of the love between two lonely neighbours is a rare masterpiece of beauty and subtlety that will reward the close attention of any viewer willing to absorb the quietly defining moments of its character's lives and prepared to forsake today's seemingly preconditioned requirement for a story to be laid out for them like a menu. It is an intimate story told with care at a deliberate pace that captures with exquisite beauty both the depth of emotion shared by the main characters and the social constraints and sense of propriety that apparently precludes them from consummating their love.Chow Tony Leung and Chan Maggie Cheung move into single rooms in adjacent apartments on the same day in 1962 Hong Kong. Chan's husband spends weeks at a time away from home on business while Chow's wife proves to be equally elusive. Over time it becomes apparent to both of them that their spouses are engaged in an affair with each other a realisation that draws them together and signals the beginning of a deep relationship.Wong KarWai has fashioned a story that is as beautiful as it is enigmatic. Almost everything is hinted at here requiring a high degree of concentration from the viewer if they are to be rewarded with any kind of insight into the both the sexual and sociological elements with which the protagonists struggle and the irretrievable sense of loss that is the reward of those who lack the strength and courage of their emotions. The adulterous spouses are never seen on the screen  this isn't their story they are merely the catalysts for the one we are shown  and the manner in which Chow and Chan uncover their infidelity is typical of the subtlety with which Wong KarWai tells his story. We watch the emotions flickering beneath the surface of Chan's carefully composed face as she offers medicine to Chow's wife knowing before we do that she has interrupted her illicit liaison with her own husband. Next shot Chow's fist knocking on her door wedding ring prominent  their wedding rings symbols here of love infidelity and the guilt that separates them are often prominent  while Chan cries in the shower. A couple of scenes later the deceit is confirmed when both Chan and Chow realise their spouses have identical possessions that can only be bought overseas.The mood is almost noirish at times and the film is suffused with lush colours and patterns. Wong KarWai repeatedly obscures our view whether through dusty windows or through skilfully composed framings designed to emphasise the sense of confinement within the teeming overpopulated city of Hong Kong. Many times a wall takes up half or more of the screen. Wong also makes effective use of slowmotion to evoke the impression of loneliness and richlytextured memories such as the moment early in the film when Chow and Chan before their friendship develops share a brief glance in the front room of her landlady in which a mahjong game is taking place. Leung and Cheung are perfect together conveying their sense of guilt and frustration in performances that rely more on nuance than they do on words  it's the type of acting that only the most accomplished can pull off and both Leung and Cheung do so admirably.In the Mood For Love is a film about loneliness in a crowded place about the bitterness of regret and its story is told in an intelligent and seductive manner that leaves the viewer astounded by the director's seemingly innate sense of visual imagery and ability to deliver a film of highlycharged emotion in a restrained manner that reflects superbly the internal struggle of its protagonists. Anyone who considers themselves to be a true movie lover should make an effort to see this movie.".

The phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was inpermanance and short. The whole movie pretty much fit the title. Not to mention the flowery Cheung Sam.My favorite scene was definately the street corner in the alley. It looks so beautiful the sun shining on the old and faded wall at night in the dark in the rain  truely a poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of intimacy of their relationship seeing them standing against the wall and talk quietly. I felt a terrible heartache when Mr Chow was rehearsing his departing moment and Mrs Chen cried on his shoulder.... Bravo Wong KarWai!As much as I like this one Chungking Express still top my favorite. However I'll give this one a 10 as well.

Wong Karwai's approach more simple and standard multi  there are pieces from their drop rate middleshift process is very stable but is not fancy. The foundation of shift lens is field. That means between two scenes 's shift  or a new scene from the black scenes. This shift lens combined with Maggie Zhang beautiful dress that may illustrate different places and time. Meanwhile the shift lens also gives us a steady rhythm time is goes to our peaceful life.Another foundation of lens shift is rendering the plot. At the first time Maggie Zhang and Tony Liang date in a restaurant . They are talking about her husbands 's tie and his wife 's bag. The director uses shift lens but faster than before. This sudden change in rhythm give the audience visual impact. We can understand about most of events happen in our daily life we feel surprised and sad but those unpleasant feeling cannot destroy our whole life. That is because of the back grand and their personality. We can see that Mr. Zhou smoking unless in order to control his complicated emotion .  Wong Karwai loves fixed shot no push shot  no pull shot and no pan shot. This is the whole style of Mr. Wong 's film. Mr. Wong loves to express emotion use depth of filed. For example Mr Zhou walks into the hotel room. At the beginning of that scenes the audience can see the end of hotel corridor. All curtain are red and Wong uses oblique angle to present this shot. Then director turn to use Zhou 's foot closeup shot . I think most common shot is the camera follow that main characters and then the main characters stop.All of those will be by full shot or medium shot. However Wong Karwai uses different way to present the salve with depth of filed. In other word  he try to give the audience choice a deep space and then let your vision will remain at the end of the space. Wong was so careful and he seems afraid you'll bother to go into the old stories of the characters. He loves closeup shot with depth of field in this film . When he wants you to see a person's face and eyes you can not miss. because you never see them before. However the tone of the whole movie is always free just little talking  and also the director always remind you that this is yesterday's story not your story. Be careful them  don't touch them . Just stand far away from them to see them.".

	schema:reviewBody "I want to comment on the metaphors I found maybe reading too much into the film itself in Kar Wai Wong's film. The cinematography in this film is astounding in my opinion. The fact that most shots of the protagonists are through the reflection of a mirror is reminiscent of the fragmentary reality we live in in which each perception and definition of the situation shapes the reality of the otherwise objective event mirrors that can be metaphorically interpreted as the windows to our memories by the fact that they as memories themselves are blurred cracked and even stained symbolizing the gaps and even black holes that the unimportant events create in our conscious mind when we remember. They symbolize an opaque reality that is distorted not only by the passing of time nor by the perception of each one of those involved but by the needs and desires of the protagonists. A story that delves with the existential dilemmas of our era the resolution of solitude the acceptance and defiance of loneliness the need for company and therefore love are echoed in Mrs Chan and Mr Chow's journey to one another. It is this common element and dilemma what drew them together in the first place and continued ruling the rest of their existences. Another incredible moment of the film at least to me is the final scene in the temple. It was very interesting to see how from the whole in which Chow whispered his secrets a plant grew from the mud we assume he puts after wards to seal the secret in as if life and redemption would come out of any misfortune or as a metaphor for the resilient condition of humanity and the capacity to be reborn in the presence of a painful situation. In this particular case a metaphor o the love that grew from the hatred sadness and deep solitude felt before between the protagonists. Lastly but not least what caught my attention was the depiction of a plate of apples set as a decoration in the beginning of the film that were set in juxtaposition with a painting of still life apples in fact on the wall. I found it very interesting because again it is reminiscent on how each ones perceptions and definitions of a situation can determine the objectivity of a memoir and affect the reality and because it evoked again to the idea of the present and the past in the end it seems as if that painting made previously was created revolving around the apples seen in the present.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maggie Cheung's Mrs Chan and Tony Leung's Mr Chow are husband and wife but not to each other. Cheung is dressed gorgeously in no less than 46 Cheongsam dresses each vivid and ornate and often descends from the shared apartment in this formal dress and makeup to purchase noodles for a lonely dinner. Leung's hair is always immaculately gelled and styled and he wears his one wrinkled grey suit with a sense of modesty in his presentation. They are in the mood for love but they do not consummate it for fears of becoming just like their cheating spouses. Wong Karwai's direction ensures that Mr Chan and Mr Chow are never quite clearly sighted face to face through precise blocking and composition. In one transition we see Mrs Chow her back facing towards us via mirror making another of her excuses over the phone to a lonely Chow at home. We then cut to the same mirror with Chow now inquiring at her wife's work his face full and revealing flushed with honesty sincerity and looming heartbreak. The first of the those evocative slow motion moments where the tender and mournful strings of Yumeji's Theme and the rhythmic Pizzicato plucks rise has Mrs Chow then Mrs Chan enter the dining room both with a sense of elegance and beauty. These recurring musical motifs signal each little moment of weakness of coincidence of intimacy through unspoken words and emotions. They brush past each other whilst purchasing meals for one in the alleyway they work closely but not too closely on the martial arts serial they lament their separation and missed opportunities. One time her hand flirts away when he tries to hold it. Later they fully wrap around each other and provide comfort in the bottom lit taxi. They belong to their respective spouses but in that first scene we are already shown an inkling of what is to come. There's a clever moment where we open with a OTS shot of a man and Su having dinner where she brings up those fateful accusatory words. The confrontation is allowed to continue and simmer with denial before we finally cut to reveal that they have been simulating the whole thing. But it's remarkably authentic  they choose to wound themselves with imaginary dialogue too scared to face reality. Doyle's and later Ping Bing's cinematography plays plenty with depth of field often framing Chow and Su's moments from behind curtains or blinds or shutters of a cupboard which are in the foreground and blurry whereas the pair are crystal clear in their emotional intimacy and lack of physical intimacy. This voyeuristic aesthetic works within the context of socially conservative Hong Kong of the 1960s  the supporting cast do well to create an aura of gossip judgement and scrutiny of every tiny detail of the pair's lives even more so in the shared proximity of the apartment. Mrs Suen misreads the recipient of a letter from a spouse abroad and that little mistake is enough to create a storm of doubt and fear within both Su and Chow. My parents lived through this period of HK and by all accounts the cramped claustrophobic set is pitch perfect right down to the fly screen cupboards that served as makeshift fridges. It's limited in scope and size encapsulating the lack of space and privacy of urban Hong Kong. But it's not grimy these families live in relative financial comfort in spite their domestic strife. Lush reds browns yellow and greens saturate and seep into the screen and work with the bold multicoloured dresses and the noir elements  in one scene a lonely Chow retreats at night to his office framed by the single overhead light of his desk the swirls of cigarette smoke billowing in the light and shade. Doyle cuts off the heads frequently and lingers on the body language and the attire on the pretense of innocence and naivety. A simple dolly of the camera from wall to wall emphasises each lonely soul so close and yet so far apart. In a lesser film the presence of convenient downpours of rain might be criticised for a plot device in bringing together a couple. Here it becomes tragic because although they have the opportunity the whole double spouse cheating plot is pretty much a romcom script waiting to be written they can't bear to take it. When Su finally gains the courage she is too late and the film slows down to an agonising pace where Chow waits for no one in the corridor the same place Su later stands still the red of her dress matching the curtains. A hotel ripe for infidelity is the location for innocent activities unable to bridge the gap. In that final scene Chow travels to Cambodia finding a hole into the stone of the Angkor Wat Temple before whispering a heavy secret and covering up any presence of his visit with an earthly mound of soil. We then cut and the soil is now sprouting blades of grass  he has carried this secret with him beyond time. In the Mood for Love is about two people wrapped up in intimacy yet so full of guilt and sadness and despair for what they have done and what they haven't. My heart breaks for them.".

Virtually without exterior shots possibly due to budget constraints i.e. trying to recreate early 60s Hong Kong the film relies heavily on its lush oversaturated interior surfaces to create the mood. Yet I would suggest that beyond being representational of the repressed passion of the characters there is little more to see here besides the sets. The performances have been outlandishly overpraised by the less is more crowd. In particular the oftenwrong Cannes judges bestowed a best actor award for a performance that in fact does not even create a threedimensional character but focuses on long pulls on cigarettes and blank staring into space. Yeah great stuff. Both my wife and I have seen thousands of films combined and we both thought it underwritten underacted repetitive and akin to watching paint dry. Beautiful paint yes but that's all.What is more intriguing is the praise the film has gotten. At least one critic mentioned how he thought the film would have been dismissed as laughable if it had been Western actors in a less exotic locale. Could be. It is baffling that so many can be taken by something with so little merit. I could only find one major critic who panned this film Peter Rainer in New York Magazine. His comments are spot on in case you want a more thorough argument regarding its selfconscious aesthete mindset.".

You could equate it to a photo realistic painting of a stone wall while the skill is impressive in doing that it would still be a boring painting.The dialogue was boring and the plot was thin to say the least! I just couldn't get invested in these characters enough to care.. It became dull and tiresome very fast. Then the same music was used over and over which became very repetitive. I also noted this in Chunking Express which is making me rethink that film and the director...Overall I'm giving this film a 5 mainly for the cinematography but I really feel like I wasted what was left of my night watching this instead of something better..".

	schema:reviewBody "The earthquake that struck Northeast Japan in March 2011 forever changed the lives of millions and we all knew it would eventually be reflected in Japanese films. I just didn't expect it to happen so quickly much less by Sono Shion of all directors making such an inspirational film that encourages the Japanese youth to never give up. Himizu was an adaptation of the manga but Sono Shion had reportedly reworked the script after the earthquake.The title Himizu is a mole species in Japan. The movie is set in a boat rental shack by the lake and the protagonist was repeatedly covered in mud due to external forces yet stands up each time. I think in addition to the gloomy darkness seen from a person's perspective the title also reflects Sono's message that one should advance forward no matter how muddy and hopeless the outlook may be.The first third of this film portrays the despair facing today's youth using extreme examples Having the perception that they are in the way of their parents' happiness having an ordinary life as a goal rather than having a big dream due to the disappointing job market and the urge to release anger by physical violence even murder or suicide. The story paints a bleak picture of today's youth with a touch of quirky comedy while introducing the main characters.The Shionesque bizarre plot twist goes on full throttle in the second third as the film as characters succumb to their dark desires and go on a rampage from theft Death Notelike vigilante justice and finally murder. There is quite a bit of art house scenes and corny WTF lines tossed around. This may make Himizu a difficult watch for some but I thought it really depicted the deranged minds kids may have and adds the Sono Shion flavor to this movie.The final third is where the drama occurs and all the loose ends tied up. It shows that even today there is kindness around you by the last supper scene. Followed by the epiphany of what it means to be a responsible adult. Finally topped off by a cheer to Japanese citizen to never give up and dream big. The presentation was incredibly powerful and it left me in tears. Himizu begins and ends with a jog. The final scene could not have been any more dramatic and inspirational.Repetitive use of Mozart's Requiem in this movie was especially memorable. The same passage was played in many occasions throughout the film. While it sounded like jovial comedic support at first it appeared to raise a sense of urgency in the second third as the story progressed before fully turning into a sombre yet peaceful requiem in the end. Such powerful use of BGM is pretty rare from my experience.Casting for this movie is incredible. The lead couple Sometani Shouta and Nikaidou Fumi delivered performances worthy of their newcomers award at the 68th Venice International Festival. Nikaidou Fumi as the stalker girl Chazawa especially stood out resembling Miyazaki Aoi in every aspect from her cute looks the ability to handle quirky comedy to dramatic performance she shed tear in 6 different scenes in this film by my count. She's definitely the actress to watch out for. Kubozuka Yousuke who also appeared in TIFF's Monsters Club 2011 was actually given the opportunity to shine. Remainder of the cast seemed to be directly taken out of Sono's Cold Fish 2010. Many directors reuse their favorite actors but it was really fitting in this case since their chemistry was excellent. The strengths of each actor were definitely drawn out to the fullest by the director.Himizu is a powerful film that has everything you might expect from a Japanese flick Quirky comedy angst despair yakuza violence horror search for self identity bittersweet adolescence romance drama inspiration and the art house treatment. Not only is it entertaining it also manages to be provocative and deep.It's a shame that some foreign film critics didn't seem to understand that the reference to 2011 earthquake was not meant to drive the plot nor intended to be the reason these characters are in despair. It's a movie that screams You are one and only flower in the world Sekai ni Hitotsu dake no Hana as the title of the popular boy band group SMAP's song referenced in this film which is often used to inspire people in Japan when they're feeling down. This movie is meant to call out a clearcut message for the devastated Japan to never give up that one should dare to dream and that there's hope. It delivered.I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it easily ranks in my alltime top 5 list of Japanese films. Highly recommended for Sono Shion fans and non fans alike.".

	onyx:emotionText "The earthquake that struck Northeast Japan in March 2011 forever changed the lives of millions and we all knew it would eventually be reflected in Japanese films. I just didn't expect it to happen so quickly much less by Sono Shion of all directors making such an inspirational film that encourages the Japanese youth to never give up. Himizu was an adaptation of the manga but Sono Shion had reportedly reworked the script after the earthquake.The title Himizu is a mole species in Japan. The movie is set in a boat rental shack by the lake and the protagonist was repeatedly covered in mud due to external forces yet stands up each time.

	schema:reviewBody "I was stunned. This film by Shion Sono stuns me. It is by no means a perfect film nor it tries to be so but it is one of the best manifestos of the Japanese psyche which is revealed with honesty and sincerity. On the surface I like everything Japan. Deep down I find Japan and the Japanese to be so hopelessly trapped in its and their own social and economic creation which is modern Japan. This film chronicles a few lives and still it tells a universal story of what feels like to be a Japanese today. Japan is a world's notable story of ragstoriches and it is even more notable and revealing as it seems to reverse the fortune at the stagnation of self development today. It is still too soon to name Japan's story of the richesbacktorags nature. But the emergence of China and South Korea and Taiwan and the once thirdworld Asia puts Japan at a paranoid of getting a lot closer and faster to the rank of rags. I find the boy Sumida in several Japanese friends of mine. Their unspeakable pains and sorrows are much more understood now. Japan has created itself especially after the second world war into a society depending on other people's perception and judgment. The Japanese then are left to struggle with the realities of their own sometimes most degrading and inhuman and continuing to protect the great image of worldly success and of loyal conformity to the society at large. This great contrast proves too much for a human being. There go suicides vicious killings and other unnamed psychopathic episodes as a tragic result. This film makes us wonder which will win hopelessness or hopefulness. It ends with one winning just an inch over the other. I believe this sad film wants to convey the desperation of Japan and the Japanese at this time. It does well. I recommend this Shion Sono film for everyone who cares more than just about yourself and I wish Japan well in every way. Dear Japan you have killed your own father the old and traditional Japan and been trying to live with the leftover being the modernised Japan. Tall order it indeed is but you are not as short as before. There is a future.".

Sumida is abandoned by a drunken father and a mother of questionable morals and Keiko suffers from an equally poor family life. It should be kismet but trust me it is anything but as we watch many bad things happen to good people for two hours and ten minutes. The lead actor and actress are tremendous but the story meanders at times and becomes a bit tiring by the end.

It's set in posttsunami Japan and this setting is not only a context but a very important part of the plot perhaps too much so especially at the ending when the film turns a little into a moralizing or even propaganda piece with the main character crying Don't give up! repeatedly while we see images of the ravages of the flood. I gotta say those last minutes moved me to the verge of tears though but that has more to do with how it builds up and connects previous elements shown in the film in a rather messy way. But I think that's the Sono way with quick shots and thoughts put together unexpected transitions poetry mixed up with violence sometimes inscrutable characters... This film also has some powerful cinematography going for it with thinned down and warm colors probably with some filter involved or maybe just postproduction grading to create this beautiful effect. Also worthy of notice is the soundtrack with pieces from Mozart and Barber that enhance the poignancy of the film. So in the end it's a tragic and also hopeful love story with different situations involved that make true sense only towards the end. It has some disturbing scenes with parents who want their children dead or people who want to kill other people in the street for no rational reason... Situations that are quite effective in portraying not only the material but also the moral and mental damages that can be caused by such an event as last year's tsunami. Still it's no match to Love Exposure and I don't think anything else from Sono iswill be.".

Now this might disappoint some hardcore fans of the manga. But personally I liked the direction this movie took it just went with the more emotional style instead of constant awkward Japanese humor that is in the manga. Not saying this movie is better than the manga or visa versa. It just has a different tone and style going for it. Sure the characters in this are very awkward and does things that doesn't make much sense. But those elements actually work for this movie sometimes in Japanese movies the awkwardness can go all over the place without being consistent. This movie is actually consistent for the most part. Plus just about all the actors in this did a great job while also bringing out good amount of emotion. And just about all the character are likable for the most part even if what they do doesn't make much sense sometimes. Even some of the effects doesn't make much sense like the music for instance that constantly play classical music especially from Mozart. But these effects that doesn't make much sense comes together in a consistent package overall. This movie shows that sometimes you can't judge people just by your perception alone but need to be in their shoes to understand since we all come from different background. It also has other messages but that one stood out the most. This is a fine manga adaptation that shows that not everything has to be word for word or frame by frame.7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie had an impact on me like no other film had before. Two 14 year olds coming from abusive homes are forced to look at their lives and see where they plan on taking them. The main character Yuichi Sumida claims early in the film that he just wants to be ordinary. Keiko Shazawa happily agrees with him since she is infatuated with him. Neither of the teen's parents could care less about them. The girl's parents go as far to create a noose from which they want their daughter to commit suicide since she is only a disappointment in their eyes. Yuichi and his mom run a boat shop which he runs on his own after she abandons him. His father shows up only to ask for money and abuse his son. The bad parenting in this film may be an exaggerated representation of Japenese culture in how much pressure children are put under in order to succeed. The teens in this film have obviously given up on any dreams of success they may have once had. The Yakuza comes to collect the debt that Yuichi's father owes them and this pushes his mind to a point where he becomes confused and violent. After this point the film takes a turn. The first third is filled with comedy  the scenes with Yuichi and Keiko fighting I found the most amusing  but the second two thirds are dealing with dark subject matter. Things become more shocking and also more intriguing. Anger and that has been built up in Yuichi is let out in unhealthy though sometimes helpful ways. He commits an act that he feels guilty about and isn't sure what to do leading him to try to find himself in scenes that I found very powerful. The sorrow frustration and hopelessness I saw on screen resonated with me in ways incomparable with any other works of fiction. To put it bluntly Himizu is a comingofage story for angsty teens that aren't sure where their life is headed. By the way this isn't an insult given how much I could relate.".

This is easily seen in the completely superfluous knife fight over a transitseat being offered to a pregnant woman. Although the unthinkable does not happen the tension is sufficient to recognize that the director is hungup on portraying unspeakable violence against the women of the movie.Nonetheless it is not an overly bloody movie but the subtitles are not sufficient to provide a proper understanding of the scene where the partiallyclad woman with Japanese insults written on her body in Japanese  hings such as pig and bitch who says I do this by choice. In other words she invites being called a pig as part of being the female in her relationship where she literally walks around with a chain on her ankle.I would not go so far as to call the movie unwatchable in its treatment of women although there were some loud boos at the screening I went to eventually there was some applause at the end. To appreciate the movie one must come to the understanding that each and every character in the movie is not just involved in a movie about angst but is quite literally insane or in the language of psychiatrists in a deep psychosis.I would not go so far as to call the director psychotic but rather lacking the plot timemanagement skill to convince us otherwise.Unless you're a psychiatrist in a supermax prison this movie is not escapism and the assertion that people in Japan need a cynical criticism of the Let's go Japan! rebuilding mantra in their media that the director presents can quite safely be tossed in the trash.My advice to the director Move to Osaka.".

Having not yet met her Petruchio agrees to court Katherine when he is told of her beauty and wit. Petruchio is even more excited at the prospect of marrying this wildcat of a woman after meeting her. Katherine will have none of it even if it means her sister's spinsterhood but has no choice but to marry him.

	schema:reviewBody "Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks star in this bowdlerized version the the Shakespeare play. This was Fairbanks' full talkie debit and Pickford's followup to her talkie debut in Coquette which won her an Oscar. Hollywood legend has it that this film was a huge flopnot true. While not a resounding success it did make money. It was the marriage between the 2 superstars that was flopping. Their careers were also nearing their end as well Pickford was to make only 3 more films Fairbanks made 4. What hurts The Taming of the Shrew most is that there are long silent sequences sequences where director Sam Taylor allows the stars to mug at each other rather than talk. But when the stars talk the film is fine. Both are good actors stage trained but I guess they just didn't trust the new medium of sound. Geoffrey Wardwell is a handsome Hortensio and Edwin Maxwell is good the the father. But Dorothy Jordan as Bianca has like 2 words to say and is in hardly any scenes. Jordan is best remembered as Marie Dressler's daughter in Min and Bill. I'm sure the DVD version I saw is the rerelease from 1966 that had new music added and some judicious cutting. There are several instances when actors are mouthing words but nothing is heard. Nevertheless this is a charming film with 2 of the biggest stars of the era and wonderful sets. The opening scene of the city street is excellent. This is the second film I'm seen where Mary Pickford wields a whip. The other was The Pride of the Clan 1917.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks star in this bowdlerized version the the Shakespeare play. This was Fairbanks' full talkie debit and Pickford's followup to her talkie debut in Coquette which won her an Oscar. Hollywood legend has it that this film was a huge flopnot true. While not a resounding success it did make money. It was the marriage between the 2 superstars that was flopping. Their careers were also nearing their end as well Pickford was to make only 3 more films Fairbanks made 4. What hurts The Taming of the Shrew most is that there are long silent sequences sequences where director Sam Taylor allows the stars to mug at each other rather than talk.

	schema:reviewBody "While it's far from perfect either as a movie or as an adaptation of Shakespeare this version of The Taming of the Shrew is enjoyable as light entertainment.  It also offers a rare chance for silent film fans to see Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks together in a sound feature no less. Fairbanks has a role much more suited to him than does Pickford but it's still good to see them together.Petruchio really is quite a suitable role for Fairbanks and his buoyant confidence works well.  His portrayal seems to be pretty close to the kind of character that Shakespeare intended.  The role of Katherine doesn't give Pickford a chance to use her greatest strengths.  She does project good energy and has plenty of charm when it is called for but at times her portrayal doesn't seem to fit the original conception of the character and the role definitely did not give Mary the chance to display her wide range of talents with more subtle material.The story is a rather loose jaunty adaptation of the original and there would be little point in making detailed comparisons.  As a movie most of it works all right aside from the occasional instances of awkwardlypaced dialogue and the like that are characteristic of so many films of the early sound era.  Fairbanks does help make some of these moments less noticeable with his obvious good humor.  There are certainly a number of obvious ways in which it could have been better and it's fair to point them out.  Yet it still has enough of the classic story plus enough of its own energy to make it worth seeing as long as you know what to expect.".

The Taming of the Shrew sees him returning to his roots staging the verbal comedy as broad slapstick. Taylor is a master of the pullbackandreveal gag making us think one thing then punchlining us with another. In adapting the play he pares down Shakespeare's dialogue and reduces it for the most part to a poetic backdrop allowing the comic vignettes to tell the story. This is quite something because this style of physical comedy more or less died out when the talkies came along but here Sam Taylor is showing a way it could have continued.But what is also intriguingly good about this version of The Taming of the Shrew is its sly subversion of Shakespeare's misogyny. The bard's lines remain what they are but the action in between them is enough to tweak their message. Pickford is brilliantly sarcastic for Katherine's final speech and as Fairbanks sits beside her with a large bandage on his head it becomes clear who's taming whom.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1929 talkie version of Taming of the Shrew has little Shakespeare about 20 but a great deal of two immortals of the silent screen Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. Restored in 1966 with a new soundtrack and released in tangent with the Elizabeth Taylor  Richard Burton version Taming of the Shrew has now found its way to DVD and it is quite a treat seeing these classic actors together for the first time. This early film version presents the play as a screwball comedy in the manner of Howard Hawks later His Girl Friday but without the rapidfire dialogue. The 1929 version lasts only a little over an hour but is full of high energy and fun if not much Shakespeare. Ms. Pickford was said to be dissatisfied with her performance as Katherine and to me she doesn't look shrewish enough but she is a charming presence and Fairbanks is a boisterous Petruchio who does perfect justice to his domineering character. One of William Shakespeare's most popular plays The Taming of the Shrew satirizes the subservient role of women in the Elizabethan age. Set in Padua a city in Northern Italy Baptista Minola Edwin Maxwell has two lovely daughters Bianca Dorothy Jordan and Katherine Pickford. He refuses to have Bianca marry before Katherine but that is a hard sell since she is temperamental and possessed of a razor sharp tongue. Kate has managed to frighten off potential suitors until the lothario Petruchio a gentleman from Verona comes into town looking for a wife. When Petruchio and Kate meet for the first time he boldly announces that he plans to court and marry her. She reacts with a flurry of insults and he retorts with playful taunts then tries to calm her. Finally she slaps him. He threatens to strike back if she slaps him again. Later after more fireworks Petruchio uses reverse psychology on her saying . 'I find you passing gentle. 'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen And now I find report a very liar For thou are pleasant gamesome passing courteous. Act II Scene I Lines 243246 Kate says that she will see Petruchio hanged before she will marry him but suddenly changes her mind and in the next scene is upset because he is late for the wedding. Something seems to have happened offstage to change her mind but the audience is not told what. The two marry but that is only the prelude to the battle of wits as Petruchio attempts to subdue his rambunctious bride. There is a lot of farce and slapstick and as usual in Shakespeare the commoners at Petruchio's estate come off as fools. At the end Petruchio forces Katharine to acknowledge that he is always right even when he says the sun is the moon and Kate ends up being tamed. Though it seems that the ending reinforces male superiority Shakespeare's women are not shrinking violets. The two seem to demonstrate true affection towards each other and it could be argued that Kate got what she wanted and can now let Petruchio think that he is in charge.Interestingly there is a prologue to the play a play within a play called the induction that does not appear in the film but it is a curiosity and seemingly has nothing to do with the play itself. In the induction a nobleman on his way home finds an inebriated sleeping man named Christopher Sly. He decides to play a joke on him by having his servants bring him to the best bedroom in the home dress him in the clothes of a rich nobleman and spray him with exotic perfumes. When Sly wakes up the servants pretend he is a lord and master who has just woke up to reality after having been insane for fifteen years. Sly then watches as a traveling group of actors perform a play called The Taming of the Shrew as he drinks some more. The joke here is that he cannot appreciate nor even stay awake for a play. Could this be the author's way of mocking a commoner who is pretending to be the author of plays written by a nobleman?".

In fact it is so bad that it is quite possible that when this film debuted Shakespeare's body was spinning like a rotisserieit's THAT bad!! Now the problem is NOT the sets or look of the film. The studio managed to create a nice lavish look befitting the time period and the production. No the problem is clearly the leadsin particular poor Mary Pickford. While I have been a huge fan of her films here she is clearly WAAAYY outside her elementattempting the sort of role that in hindsight seems quite insane! Seeing the petite lady who is usually associated with child and childlike roles yelling and throwing hissyfits almost made me want to smile and say ain't she cute?!?! and pinch her little cheeks. It was adorable yes but far far from shrewish. To put it plainly it's like watching a cute little girl playing dressup! While her then husband Douglas Fairbanks wasn't great he like her was just too small for such a biggerthanlife role and he overacted horribly he wasn't that bad either. Despite widespread reports that he had a terrible and thin voice it wasn't that noticeable here and I think this is a bit of a bad rap. I also think Fairbanks was lucky Mary was so badit really made him look so much better by comparison! So despite everything is it worth seeing? Well it all depends. If you are such a diehard fan of the pair that the thought of seeing these great stars destroy themselves on film then please for your sake avoid this film and all of Mary's sound films believe me they are all pretty badeven Coquette for which she was given an Oscar. Instead just lie to yourself and pretend her career ended with silentsbecause these truly were brilliant and sublime pictures. If on the other hand you are curious a lover of kitsch or perhaps a masochist then by all means give the film a look!!By the way I have never been much of a fan of Shakespeare and loved it when his work was parodied in films like Strange Brew it's Hamlet with Doug and Bob Mackenzie and plays like those done by The Reduced Shakespeare Company with this movie I really had to feel sorry for the guy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Douglas Fairbanks is Petruchio and Mary Pickford is Catherine with bad direction by Sam Taylor. Plus I'm sure that The Bard was not amused that Sam Taylor thought he could improve his original dialogue. But I digress. The big problem is that Pickford is so small when I got my first look at her she looked like a little girl playing at fancy dress. Taylor stages things so she is equal in height or taller than Fairbanks when they are side by side but when standing apart she is obviously much shorter. Maybe a match in bad manners but she is obviously not his physical equal. For example she is blown about by a high wind in one scene while Fairbanks is unaffected.Fairbanks as Petruchio is actually playing one of his swashbucklers and Pickford as Kate is one of her many spunky waif characters. She does not inspire fear just a isn't that precious! reaction given her size. Notice that when Pickford is supposedly beating up servants and smashing furniture she does so out of view of the camera because someone her size would not be capable of doing all of that damage. The odd thing is that the film looks like great care went into the art direction and photography and the supporting players are pretty good. Neither Fairbanks nor Pickford have that stiff early talkie way about them but they are given to wild gestures as though they are still in a silent film. So it is the little things that are done well and with care while it is the big things that sink the film. I'd give it 510 with four of those five going to the physical production design.".

	schema:headline " My least favourite Fairbanks film but still not bad";
	schema:reviewBody "The Taming of the Shrew is not one of Shakespeare's best plays but its wit and charm still makes it enjoyable. And Douglas Fairbanks one of the alltime great silent film stars is always worth watching. He has done much better films than this which doesn't show off what he was best at and the Elizabeth TaylorRichard Burton film is a better film but it is still worth a look and not too bad. The biggest flaw for me was Mary Pickford who seemed out of her depth in a performance that was a mix of looking lost and overplayed mugging she has her charms but she is nowhere near shrewish enough which is a crucial part to Katherine's character. She also doesn't have that much chemistry with Fairbanks apparently they were having marital problems at the time and it shows. Occasionally the dialogue is a little awkward the film drags a tad in the middle and Dorothy Jordan has next to nothing to do which is a real shame. Fairbanks however is surprisingly good as aforementioned it is a role that doesn't show him play to his strengths but he is very funny and has a real sense of humour and great charisma. The supporting cast are also very good. The Taming of the Shrew1929 is skilfully shot and the costumes and sets are beautiful. The music score is energetic and with shades of romanticism. The dialogue on the most part captures the wit and charm of Shakespeare's play very well and while the story has like 20 resemblance it still feels cohesive and relatively easy to follow. There are a few lulls here and there but the film does move nicely and the direction is above serviceable not great but far from a hack job. Overall The Taming of the Shrew1929 is my least favourite Douglas Fairbanks film but it is enjoyably light and charming and not a bad watch at all. 610 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " Pickford  Fairbanks  Shakespeare";
	schema:reviewBody "The Taming of the Shrew 1929 was directed by Sam Taylor and stars Mary Pickford as Katherine and Douglas Fairbanks as Petruchio. I've always have found this play painful to watch because it reminds us of how many societies in the world were and are paternalistic. A woman belonged to her father until she was married and then to her husband. As Petruchio tells the crowd at the wedding I will be master of what is mine own. She is my goods my chattels she is my house My household stuff my field my barn My horse my ox my ass my anything. Sadly it was true. Then to tame his reluctant wife Petruchio uses techniques perfected at prisons to break a prisoner's spiritdeprivation of food deprivation of sleep arbitrary rules that change in arbitrary ways. And of course there's always the threat of physical force if none of these methods work.We can't blame the movie for thisthat's what Shakespeare wrote and that's what Taylor shows us. Pickford and Fairbanks were the great Hollywood couple of their day. It was said that their marriage was coming apart and they tried to save it by costarring in this movie. As we know it didn't work.However I think the film itself benefited from their personal relationship. My take was that when Petruchio kissed Kate Kate responded as if she were sexually aroused. Certainly on their wedding night she makes it clear that she will welcome him into their bed.Finally Kate's final speech when she accepts the total domination of husband over wife is undercut completely by Kate's sly wink to her sister Bianca. I think Shakespeare meant this speech to truly represent his views of a dutiful wife. Pickford wasn't buying it. She may have been forced into outward submission but her spirit wasn't broken.We saw this film on a classroomsized screen as part of a Shakespeare on Film honors seminar. it will work well on DVD. If you enjoy Shakespeare and you want to see an early talkie with two famous stars playing Kate and Petruchio the movie is worth seeing. I prefer it to the TaylorBurton version where Kate really appears to buy the concept of total submission to her husband. Now that's a painful scene.".

	schema:headline " Dull lifeless and unworthy";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERT By detaching from any consistency on style setting characterization and duologue this adaptation of the Taming of the Shrew forfeits any authenticity and originality compared to the Shakespearean text. Arguably progressive for its time period and critically acclaimed for its giant leap into talkie cinema this film successfully introduces themes that send the world back into the dark ages. The opening scene clearly depicts said attributes by foreshadowing the prominent domestic violence portrayed throughout the play by including a puppet show of a man who uses a malletlike weapon to beat the woman into submission. Judging from the enthusiastic response by the audience the idea of physically abusing another person seems to be perfectly rational in their eyes. The film continues to border on moral ambiguity inspiring more cringe worthy responses as the plot advances leaving the viewer more scarred than any emotion resembling enjoyment.Stylistically speaking the director chose to incorporate a myriad of perspectives. The film seems to take place during the Shakespearean time period from the incorporation of traditional wardrobe and surrounding setting for each scene. However some period discrepancies are blatant throughout the film like the makeup used for certain characters and some visible contemporary furniture in some bedroom scenes. The black and white style hid most of the other obvious time inconsistencies including textural differences leaving a more realistic approach to the film. The filmmaker's incorporation of closeup shots to main characters was stunning and interesting because it meant the actors needed to further the plot through more than just duologue but also through their facial expressions and interactions. This inclusion brought a heavier influence of character acting and made the supporting character's antics more enjoyable. The supporting characters also brought comedic relief to the otherwise less funny main character portrayals of their Shakespearean counterparts which was the best idea by the director of this film. The external shots of the surrounding city of Padua also made the film more watchable bringing more of an emotional depth to the film. By involving more setting changes the movie was less stagnant and made the movie more relevant to contemporary viewers who would otherwise get bored from the prolonged difference of action depicted compared to modern cinema pieces.A rather bothersome issue prominent throughout the film was the actor's portrayals of the characters. From the duologue presented it is apparent that women are not treated with the same respect men are in this time period and yet everyone in the town fears Katherine through her reputation. They start from bragging how women are easy conquests to disapproving of her disobedience claiming she is the unattainable. Disregarding the obvious issue of needing to tame any woman the characters do not seem to fully grasp their identities. Petruchio enters carrying a whip used throughout the film as a gag prop and not something violent and willingly admits to his interest in marrying a woman solely for her money addressing his amusing desire to also prove to everyone that he can overcome the challenge of procuring the town's black sheep. He is the only character who remains loyal to his conquest without any character discrepancy and even though his methods are medieval his refusal to give up is admiring. In contrast the character of Katherine does not seem to fully understand her purpose within the film. She is introduced wearing contemporary clothing down to the feather boa wrapped around her neck a seemingly metaphorical way of introducing how modern her character is compared to the rest. She refuses to get married take orders from anyone and disengages from the societal expectations of her. The town fears her essentially giving her the power even giving her a room higher than the rest of the bedrooms and yet her perception falters as soon as she is introduced to her fiance to be. Both carrying whips and highlighting the heavy influence of slapstick humor the two set off on some hilarious excursions of trickery and manipulation. However Mary Pickford's style of approaching this character leaves the audience more puzzled than anything. She goes from being too angry to stand him to swooning over his kiss. She doesn't care about fitting into society and yet gets so frustrated when he arrives to their wedding late and in nontraditional garb. Her upset does not represent Shakespeare's character whatsoever. It is only after Katherine becomes aware of his motives that we see the true feminist emerge proving she'll pretend to be a loyal wife to get what she wants again addressing her unclear motives.The minor characters throughout the movie stole scenes and it's a shame that they were not given more of a dominant role. The only seemingly interesting parts of the movie were the ones including supporting characters even with the discontinuing plot development of Bianca and her suitor. It's unclear why they were introduced in the beginning only to be cut completely as the movie progressed just proving how disorganized the movie actually was. The duologue which was clearly recorded separately did not make the movie any better it was incredibly distracting as some parts did not match what the actors were saying. Still worth mentioning as this shattered the illusion regardless of knowing these are flaws of the time period to which the movie was created. Overall the film left more questions unanswered making it one of the worst film adaptations from text and an hour that any viewer will never get back.".

The spirit of this line implies a certain amount of reciprocity not as easily apparent elsewhere in the original text but this 1929 take on one of Shakespeare's more widely adapted comedies seems to take that mutuality to heart.While not one of Shakespeare's problem plays The Taming of the Shrew remains problematic both for those who would adapt it and those who would experience it. For one who wrote so eloquently of love Shakespeare's matrimonial tale of female subservience and the crude tactics employed to achieve it may ring discordant especially within a modern context. Is the play sincere or satire? An endorsement of such attitudes or exaggeration for the sake of criticism? Perhaps it is the challenge such a question presents that has inspired the multitude of responses across the centuries and from various forms of media. Writer and director Sam Taylor's version from the early days of classical Hollywood cinema opts for a sort of compromise between straight adaptation and exaggeration that allows for a more freely enjoyed sojourn in Padua.Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford who famously or infamously were experiencing marital difficulties of their own during production take on the roles of our purported tamer Petruchio and the intolerable curst Katherine. Both of their performances are marked with an abundance of energy that at times borders on excess. Indeed we are introduced to Katherine following a projectileaided outburst that throws the household into chaos. The camera climbs the stairs and slowly surveys the damage before settling on the title's namesake. Our first shot of Katherine involves her staring wildly about her outofbreath and whip in hand. In keeping with the zoomorphic theme established by the dialogue we frequently catch her in the midst of some restless pacing like a caged wild Kate as Petruchio unashamedly puns later on during his nominally successful wooing. The overthetop kinetic style can perhaps be attributed as a remnant of the silent era especially since the film was originally intended as such. The exaggerated deliveries could also serve as a reflection of the satirical tone adaptations frequently adopt.Speaking of adaptations with a relatively brief running time stretching a little over an hour it is hardly a surprise that the final product is pretty streamlined. The focus rarely deviates from Katherine and Petruchio and characters such as Lucentio and Tranio are excised completely or combined with others. The subplots are retained as far as they are useful for initiating the main story. As a result the sometimes overshadowing storyline of Bianca Dorothy Jordan and her love life hardly play into the proceedings.Far from being a criticism narrowing the focus to the two characters allows for greater depth in exploring Katherine and Petruchio's relationship. During the wooing scene Katherine pushes against Petruchio and subjects him to slaps and blows from her whip. He is immovable and shakes not though they blow perpetually. Here and elsewhere Katherine's resistance is stifled because not even her will can overcome the nature of things namely society physical needs and even nature itself. After arriving at Petruchio's home soaking wet from the rain and mudsplattered she contemplates escape. The wind blows her back and Katherine has no choice but to go inside. Later she initially refuses Petruchio's blusterous summons to the dinner table but alas hunger wins out. Interestingly each instance is countered with a reversal of sorts. Katherine has the final word in the wooing scene with the addition of a soliloquy not present in the original text. Petruchio's speech outlining his taming tactics is overheard by Katherine and she is then equipped to match his deception with her own.What results from this give and take is the impression that these two do seem oddly suited for each other rather than one being ensnared by the other. Fairbanks and Pickford infuse the relationship with an unconventional unexpected chemistry. However while Petruchio may believe his wife tamed according to his standards what Katherine does learn is how to play the game without revealing herself as a contender. The delivery of Katherine's final speech an opportunity to demonstrate the play's interpretive flexibility represents this quite nicely with a knowing wink and smile directed at Bianca but another more telling incident occurs minutes before. After Petruchio is knocked down by some airborne carpentry Katherine begins to comfort him. While he moans offscreen we see her take up her whip regard it and her dazed husband for a moment and then toss it into the fireplace. After all she no longer needs it.Accompanied by suitably grand production values and the distinction of being Shakespeare's first talkie this Taming proves itself to be a surprisingly enjoyable or at the very least palatable rendition of our dear madly mated pair.".

Considering that the stage play takes at least two hours to perform without counting any interval between acts and that at least half the movie's running time is taken up either with extended horseplay or extraneous scenesetting there is very little of Shakespeare in the film at all but a great deal of Mr Fairbanks and a fair amount of Mrs Fairbanks.Despite playing the title role and her firstplace billing Pickford is often upstaged and displaced by Fairbanks. His usual largerthanlife performance seems too heartily selfpromoting when dialogue is added to his customary selffocusing and ceaseless posturing and seemingly endless displays of swaggering acrobatics. True the role does call for these qualities but Fairbanks obviously doesn't believe in either halfmeasures or subtleties.Although she seems to sense that her reallife husband is intent on putting her in the shade Mary Pickford fights back gamely. Unfortunately although she has the will she simply doesn't possess the dramatic equipment to do this. Her voice seems weak. It lacks power authority and cadence. As a dramatic actress she comes across as an amateur. A good amateur mind you. But as a pro definitely not. She has no tricks no charisma no presence. What's more her makeup is poor. Her white unlined face completely lacks character. She seems to be playing the ghost of Lady Macbeth rather a live lively spiritedly shrewish Kate.The other players don't help much either. Geoffrey Wardwell is as weak as water. Dorothy Jordan is hardly in the movie at all. Clyde Cook and Joseph Cawthorn hog the camera mercilessly.Oddly the movie is at its best when director Taylor fills the screen with sets and crowd extras rather than his main players. Art director William Cameron Menzies has designed some really eyecatching medieval exteriors which Karl Struss has photographed with an expert eye.".

I was very eager to see her in a talkie and this DVD turned up in my local video store. I immediately snatched it up with my little hands and dashed up to the register. Am I dreaming? I thought. Have a finally gotten a Mary Pickford talkie?!? I wasn't dreaming fortunately and I made it home with my purchase. My opinion for what it's worth follows below.I knew that this film's reputation hasn't quite survived the passing years neither has Mary Pickford's for that matter. So few of Mary's films are available and this one does bring down the average a bit. Getting down to brass tacksMary Pickford is pretty awful in this picture but I do think it's helpful to put her performance in perspective. While I did enjoy the film and I always enjoy Mary's performances the one word that kept coming to mind while I watched this is UNCOMFORTABLE. She seemed incredibly apprehensive as though she'd never seen the script. That might be due to improvising though...she could have known Doug was going to give her a hard time! Her marriage to Doug was steadily heading towards the rocks and it does show. Mary seems aware that Doug has the picture in both hands and is running away with it but she doesn't seem to know what to do about it. The bigger louder and bolder he gets the more tight and restrained she becomes.All this is unfortunate because Mary could play a hellcat and did on several occasions. Check out her performance in M'Liss when she armed with a slingshot addresses Thomas Meighan with I'll pump ya full of rocks and you don't doubt for one minute that she will. The main difference between Mary's previous good little devils like M'Liss Little Annie Rooney and Mavis in Heart O' The Hills and Katherine is of course sound. Stage training or no Mary's voice isn't cut out for constant screeching. To add to the problem Mary interestingly enough sounds like a little boy. Jarring? Absolutely. Not such a major issue though because Doug has practically all of the lines in the movie. That is a relief of sorts because while he's going through the required histrionics Mary is free to use body language with which she was undoubtedly more comfortable. A good example of this would be the scene in which the smug praying Petrucio prevents a weary Kate from eating. No one could call Mary's comedic timing in that scene inadequate. Silent yes but never inadequate.Mary's performance aside this is a great Shakespeare movie for people who don't like Shakespeare like me. There are so many silentera gags in it that there isn't room for the Bard. Witness the wedding scene which revolves around a man trying to dispose of an apple core. I imagine this movie gives English teachers fits.Granted this movie has shortcomings but it will entertain you and isn't that what movies are for?".

	schema:reviewBody "Quai des Orfevres directed by the brilliant HenriGeorges Clouzot is a film to treasure because it is one of the best exponents of French film making of the postwar years. M. Clouzot adapting the Steeman's novel Longtime Defence shows his genius in the way he sets the story and in the way he interconnects all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that as DBDumonteil has pointed out in this forum it demonstrates how influential Cluzot was and how much the next generation of French movie makers are indebted to the master especially Claude Chabrol.The crisp black and white cinematography by Armand Thirard has been magnificently transferred to the Criterion DVD we recently watched. Working with Clouzot Thirard makes the most of the dark tones and the shadows in most of the key scenes. The music by Francis Lopez a man who created light music and operettas in France works well in the context of the film since the action takes place in the world of the music halls and night clubs.Louis Jouvet who is seen as a police detective is perfect in the part. This was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of the French theater. Jouvet clearly understood well the mechanics for the creation of his police inspector who is wiser and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from the others. In an unfair comment by someone in this page Jouvet's inspector is compared with Peter Falk's Columbo the television detective. Frankly and no disrespect to Mr. Falk intended it's like comparing a great champagne to a good house wine.Bernard Blier is perfect as the jealous husband. Blier had the kind of face that one could associate with the man consumed with the passion his wife Jenny Lamour has awakened in him. Martineau is vulnerable and doesn't act rationally he is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong as he finds in the middle of a crime he didn't commit but all the evidence points to the contrary.The other great character in the film is Dora the photographer. It's clear by the way she interacts with Jenny where her real interest lies. Simone Renant is tragically appealing as this troubled woman and makes an enormous contribution to the film. Suzy Delair playing Jenny is appealing as the singer who suddenly leaps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like Brignon the old lecher.The film is one of the best Clouzot directed during his distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way he brought all the elements together.".

	schema:headline " Clouzot's Least Dark Suspense Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "The extraordinarily adorable Suzy Delair plays a statuesque performer obsessed with succeeding in the theater. Her husband and accompanist played by Bernard Blier is a composed but jealous man. When he finds out in a less than preferable way that his flashy wife has planned a rendezvous with a lecherous old businessman with the intention of advancing her career he loses all control and threatens the businessman with murder. Now at that point I must stop describing the film to you because it skates on such thin ice with its twists revelations ambiguities and suspense that to imply any of it would endanger it. I am not sure how good or bad that is for this French police procedural emanating from the song anddance community though it is certainly interesting that what we do know throughout is who did not do it. We just don't know who did.The story depends upon the procedure of following clues where ideal alibis fail and where cautiously created fabrications and deceptions disintegrate. Interestingly this is a suspense film in which suspense is generated in spite of the knowledge one would traditionally think too much too soon.Quay of the Goldsmiths is the least dark of HenriGeorges Clouzot's films. It's nowhere near as sinister as the shocking Les Diaboliques as tragic as the riveting Wages of Fear or as eery as Le Corbeau. Maybe it is due to the vibrance of the dance halls and theater settings of 1940s France which all work as the milieu of this crime thriller.Clouzot both understands and approves of his characters even the more rotten ones where he has more of a vindictive streak with his other films. Where he may have had understanding for the scheming women in Les Diabolique or the truck drivers who sink to the level of risking horrible death in order to oust themselves from miserable life in The Wages of Fear there isn't necessarily support or agreement on the part of the filmmaker for these are characters who plainly made the direct decisions that determine their fate. All the characters in this more settling film have scenes and moments that endear us to them even the harsh cold detective played by Louis Jouvet who worries about his young adoptive son amid all the trouble and despair that happens in his life at any time with the drop of a hat.There is humor and unabashed sexiness the latter mostly on the part of Delair that neutralize the pressure to a degree. Clouzot was quietly practicing his craft patient till he made his unrelenting later films in which he would permit his audiences no pardon from the tension.".

	schema:reviewBody "After his shocking masterpiece LE CORBEAU was denounced by both the Gestapo AND the Resistance who felt its negative portrait of the French was proGerman and they did have such a wonderful war Clouzot was suspended from filmmaking activities for three years.  If it was expected on his return that Clouzot would try to 'atone' for his bleakness with more reassuring fare than people didn't know him.  QUAI DES ORFEVRES seems an easier pill to swallow than its predecessor  the brooding Expressionism of LE CORBEAU is more restrained here the characters are nicer there is even a bright happy ending set at Christmas time of rebirth renewal redemption  then it's just as hard to digest.Although billed as a Louis Jouvet film the great theatrical innovator who plays the bluff detective the first third concentrates solely on the build up to the crime and is a wonderful insight into the theatre and domesiticity.  Jenny Lamour is a singer determined to make it big in the music hall.  This of course means pursuing dubious contacts inflaming the insane jealousy of her timid balding accompanist husband Maurice Martineau.The more successful Jenny becomes the more elderly gentlemen friends push themselves in her interests.  One in particular an odious wizened lecherous old goat keeps inviting her to restaurants and his huge town mansion.  Exasperated Maurice storms into his booth and threatens to kill him.

	onyx:emotionText "After his shocking masterpiece LE CORBEAU was denounced by both the Gestapo AND the Resistance who felt its negative portrait of the French was proGerman and they did have such a wonderful war Clouzot was suspended from filmmaking activities for three years.  If it was expected on his return that Clouzot would try to 'atone' for his bleakness with more reassuring fare than people didn't know him.  QUAI DES ORFEVRES seems an easier pill to swallow than its predecessor  the brooding Expressionism of LE CORBEAU is more restrained here the characters are nicer there is even a bright happy ending set at Christmas time of rebirth renewal redemption  then it's just as hard to digest.Although billed as a Louis Jouvet film the great theatrical innovator who plays the bluff detective the first third concentrates solely on the build up to the crime and is a wonderful insight into the theatre and domesiticity.  Jenny Lamour is a singer determined to make it big in the music hall.  This of course means pursuing dubious contacts inflaming the insane jealousy of her timid balding accompanist husband Maurice Martineau.The more successful Jenny becomes the more elderly gentlemen friends push themselves in her interests.  One in particular an odious wizened lecherous old goat keeps inviting her to restaurants and his huge town mansion.  Exasperated Maurice storms into his booth and threatens to kill him.  One night his wife goes off to meet him anyway.

	schema:headline " A marvelous amusing movie about murder jealousy music halls and love with enough raisins even for Hitchcock";
	schema:reviewBody "Is it a murder mystery? Is it a police procedural? Is it a backstage look at seedy French music halls? Quai des Orfevres is all of these but more than anything else it's an amusing comedy of infidelity jealousy and love set in postWWII Paris. It may be surprising that Henri Georges Clouzot the director of such grim films as Le Corbeau or such suspenseful nail biters as Diabolique and The Wages of Fear is the director of this one. Clouzot however was a shrewd filmmaker. In a murder mystery he tells us 'there's an element of playfulness. It's never totally realistic. In this I share Hitchcock's view which says 'A murder mystery is a slice of cake with raisins and candied fruit and if you deny yourself this you might as well film a documentary.' Quai des Orfevres is a wonderful film and it's no documentary. Jenny Martineau Suzy Delair is an ambitious singer at music halls and supper clubs. She's a flirt she's sees nothing too wrong with using a bit of sex as well as talent to get a contract. Her stage name is Jenny Latour. And she really loves her husband Maurice Martineau Bernard Blier. Martineau is something of a sad sack. He's her accompanist and arranger. He's a bit balding a bit chubby and jealous to a fault. Then we have their neighbor the photographer Dora Monnier Simone Renant. She's blond gorgeous think of Rita Hayworth and capable. She and Martineau have been friends since they were children together. Dora however is definitely not thinking just of friendship when she looks at Jenny. Then comes along Georges Brignon Charles Dullin a wizened rich and dirty old man who often has Dora take art photographs of his young female proteges whom he poses himself. He offers a contract for a film to Jenny and suggests a dinner at his home to discuss the details. Jenny is more than willing. Maurice is furious and forbids it. Jenny shouts right back at him You're jealous of the rich! Well I want my share of their dough. I'm all for royalty! You're dad was a laborer Maurice shouts back. So what? Under Louis XV I'd have been Madame de Pompadour! I'd have heated up their tights! And after Brignon is found dead with a smashed champagne bottle next to his bleeding skull there's Dora to try to make things safe for Jenny. But wait. Inspector Antoine gets the case. Antoine Louis Jouvet is a tall tired middleaged bachelor with sore feet. He has seen it all. He served in the colonies with the Foreign Legion and returned with an adopted baby and malaria. The child is now about eightyears old and Antoine dotes on him. One of the first things Antoine discovers is not only did someone brain Brignon with a bottle someone shot him in the heart. Who did it? Before long Jenny Maurice and Dora all are making up alibis lying and at one or another point confessing. How will Antoine discover the murderer? Will we have a chance to see some great music hall songs sung by Jenny Latour? Everything becomes clear but only with time and Detective Antoine's persistence. We are left with many kinds of love leading to all kinds of motives from hairtrigger jealousy to longing glances...and all played with a nice mixture of Gallic amusement. Clouzot takes us to a Paris of seedy but not threatening neighborhoods to downtrodden music publishers where tunes are played on the piano for buyers to restaurants with discrete private dining rooms. Most of all he takes us to the music hall where Jenny Latour often performs. We can see Jenny as she sings with couples in the seats and single men wearing their coats and hats in standing room. And everyone smokes. The first third of the film in fact takes place largely in this milieu. With Jenny singing about Her petite tralala her sweet tralala we follow her from trying out the song at the publishers to a rehearsal to a saucy performance with Jenny in a feathered hat a corset gartered stockings and not much else. Delair Blier and Renant all do wonderful jobs but it Louis Jouvet who holds everything together. He was a marvelous actor who disliked making films. The stage was his world and he took on films only if he happened to like the director and to make money to finance his stage work. Jouvet was tall with a long face and broad cheekbones. He was not conventionally handsome but he had what it takes to dominate a scene. For a look at how skillfully he could play comedy watch him in Drole de Drame. He's a fascinating actor. At one point he says I've taken a liking to you Miss Dora Monnier. Me? she asks. Yes. Because you and I are two of a kind. When it comes to women we'll never have a chance. Jouvet brings all kinds of nuances to that line from rueful regret to a gentle amusement.".

Frankly I and at least 97 of the audience don't care why it is dull simply that it is dull and that makes it a chore to sit through! So what we actually have here is an extremely oldhat detective yarn with a lame conclusion. It's rather sluggishly paced. But not only is it slow in the telling it is saddled with an unsympathetic lead Bernard Blier and a heroine Suzy Delair who admittedly has a few bright moments but is mostly rather boring. On the plus side the great Louis Jouvet does what he can with the detective part and the film has been well produced on a sizable budget. Occasionally the direction is quite slick. On the other hand the photography is always skillful and the music score attractive.".

This movie was made by HG Clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the Law professions.Its main star is Louis Jouvet who studied and practiced as as pharmacist before becoming The Greatest Actor and also director of France's Theater before and after WWII.They both had health problems. Clouzot had TB while young Jouvet had cardiac problems and died on a theater..Such events shape the character of men and women of course. One might even say that today's Artists are so poor because they had never suffered and fought for their lives.To me this is the greatest of Clouzot's movies. Wages of Fear is greater in suspense Diabolique also has more suspense and a better plot and is more about female evil.Quai des Orfvres is more human. Clouzot was falsely accused by De Gaulle's entourage mostly communists and Jews of collaboration with the Nazis and banned from making films until until De Gaulle left France's Government in early 1946. De Gaulle came back in 1958 as President.The main characters are all good souls Jenny L'Amour may perform as a putain on stage but she is not a whore dictionaires make synonyms of those words but they are not the same loves her husband and refuses the slight advances from her presumably Lesbian friend Dora the photographer.Maurice the husband is jealous and timid but runs away from the scene of the crime. He is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more upscale career for love..Antoine the detective interpreted by the great Louis Jouvet basically a stage actor performs in this French Gray not Noir as well as E.G. Robinson in Double Indemnity shows flair for pseudo criminals tenderness for a Negro son? and compassion for the true author of the crime because he remembers that is father cleaned the latrines at some nobleman's chteau!!Clouzot was capable of slapping an actor's face in order to put him in the right frame of mind but deep inside he was very human. I have his horoscope in front of me. He had Venus in Sagittarius which means openheartedness devotion charity and altruism. For those who do not believe in Astrology my most sincere apologies...".

We can find great actors too Suzy Delair is impeccable.Is interesting too how we can find aspects of this film nowadays. Quai des Orfvres inheritance is palpable in Woody Allen tradition. Plunging a crime situation in a picturesque environment. The naive ending is also typical in Steven Spielberg's goodending films. And finally I would like to point out the deja voo sensation during the photography session between Jenny Lamour Suzy Delair and Dora Monier Simone Renant in which the first one confess that she thinks her husband is being unfaithful and exactly with the woman who is photographing her. That scene is exactly the one between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer Mike Nichols 2004.".

Louis Jouvet is the investigating inspector and his methods are to say the least somewhat unorthodox. The setting superbly captured by Clouzot and his cameraman Armand Thirard is the seedy milieu of the Parisian musichalls.

	schema:headline " French popular cinema at its best ...";
	schema:reviewBody "To nonFrench audience Quai des Orfvres carries the same resonance than 'Scotland Yard' for British people as the legendary Police headquarter Police in Paris preceded by number 36 and the setting of the most memorable criminal resolutions that nourished French popculture of the early century Landru la Bande  Bonnot etc. So as the title indicates HenriGeorge Clouzot's classic is a police procedural but there's more to see in the film besides the realistic and thrilling elements of a crime investigation.What strikes first and what I immediately associate with the film is the score the musical version of the main song Avec son Tralala which is continuously sung by Jenny Lamour Suzy Delair during the first act. What begins as a simple ballad turns into a smash hit joyful naughty and unbelievably catchy to a point I kept it stuck in my head for many days after watching the film. The 'tralala' is a sort of childish onomatopoeia referring to the beautiful behind of a Spanish gypsy girl who didn't need 'maracas' to charm men only her magnificent natural assets. The music remarkably contrasts with the overall tone of the film but efficiently establishes the setting of the investigation the musichall a decadent and permissive world. HenriGeorges Clouzot has an endearing quality his thrillers are appealing to universal audiences but they're always set in a particular world truck drivers boarding school a small village his movies are an opportunity to discover a slice of French life in a determined era. And it's precisely for his ability to be so specific that his films can work as universal explorations of the human soul. The music hall or showbiz is the perfect setting to crystallize such emotions as ambition jealousy or cynicism. They are also mirror the vices of a society through the character of Jenny who makes eyes on anyone who can help her to succeed in theater to Maurice his mildmannered and jealous accompanist and husband played by Bernard Blier and Dora Simone Renant as the cynical charm photographer friend of both. Yet the most despicable of all is Brignon Charles Dullin an old lecherous businessman who visits Dora just to admire some naked girls. With Dora Maurice and Jenny the film seems to open on a triangular love a plot device cherished by Clouzot.But as usual clichs are misleading Dora is obviously not interested in men but ready to help their friends Jenny loves her husband and Maurice is the kind of guy who can make death threats but is not so hot when it comes to pull the trigger. These flawed but realistic characters are inevitably put in a tricky Hitchcockian situation. Jenny has a secret rendezvous at Brignon's house but the date turns sour and she knocks him out with a champagne bottle and escapes. Maurice finds his address and goes confront him in the house before ensuring a perfect alibi but when he enters his house he finds him dead and when he leaves it his car has disappeared. This might suspend some viewers' disbelief but nothing is hazardous in the film. To make things even more intricate Dora goes at Brignon's to erase the fingerprints take Jenny's fox scarf and while she's there knocks the dead man in the chest in one of the most cruel and memorable scenes from any Clouzot's film. Last revelation the man was shot with a bullet in the heart which makes four people who went to the victim four potential suspects. The plot starts like a reverse whodunit but at the end it's still a whodunit. Maurice is supposed to go the music hall only when he comes back he raises suspicion by being the only one not to notice one flaw in the show Jenny went to her grandmother at the last minute and Dora left a blonde hair on the crime setting.Still the film would never have reached its legendary status without Jouvet as Inspector Antoine a fifty something inspector tall and lanky with cut head and sharp eyes he's intimidating without being unfriendly and cool without fooling anyone the AntiColumbo with the same likability. As soon as he makes his entrance he's the one driving the action and all the characters turn to a passive status while he confronts them to their contradictions. The genius of Quai des Orfvres relies essentially on the writing the way the character interact the social discussions the way each clue is obtained after a clever trick. Pierre Larquay one of Clouzot's regulars plays a taxi cab driver that took a blond blonde to Brignon's but while some people genuinely go to the police the driver refuses to be a stool. The last exchange with Antoine before he would finally confess is simply delightful and a clever demonstration of police procedural  la Franaise. I wondered if the driver wasn't meant to make up for the villagers of The Crow and the whole paranoid and denunciationinducting atmosphere. One even has to wonder if the film doesn't carry some dark and pessimistic undertones inherited from the German Occupation which contributed to the deterioration of the Police's image. But the film doesn't make statements about who's right or who's wrong it doesn't manipulate our empathy but rather offers us a gallery of characters who're all identifiable by their jobs cab driver policemen singers photographers and this is why Quai des Orfevres surpasses many French stories like all Clouzot's films it's a slice of people's life a powerful social commentary set during the Christmas holidays which gives its final Dickensian flavor.Clouzot is the director who gave its letters of nobility to Popular Cinema I'd rather watch one Clouzot film ten times in a row rather than any other socalled New Wave existential stuff.".

The last exchange with Antoine before he would finally confess is simply delightful and a clever demonstration of police procedural  la Franaise. I wondered if the driver wasn't meant to make up for the villagers of The Crow and the whole paranoid and denunciationinducting atmosphere. One even has to wonder if the film doesn't carry some dark and pessimistic undertones inherited from the German Occupation which contributed to the deterioration of the Police's image. But the film doesn't make statements about who's right or who's wrong it doesn't manipulate our empathy but rather offers us a gallery of characters who're all identifiable by their jobs cab driver policemen singers photographers and this is why Quai des Orfevres surpasses many French stories like all Clouzot's films it's a slice of people's life a powerful social commentary set during the Christmas holidays which gives its final Dickensian flavor.Clouzot is the director who gave its letters of nobility to Popular Cinema I'd rather watch one Clouzot film ten times in a row rather than any other socalled New Wave existential stuff.";

	schema:reviewBody "Should we take the opening shot as a strange frame??? I guess we have to. Anyway two women are behind a closing umbrella they walk upstairs to the talent agency and we go with them...and then they are never to be seen again. Okay how come not INSIDE the place at the piano or even outside with the SOUND of the piano then track inside and over a la Hitchcock??? So I guess Clouzot is already telling us in a not very subliminal manner that we are following a segment of postwar society especially how he then uses a Citizen Kanelike song cut up into about five pieces to show the lady singing traveling from the talent agency all the way to her first roses and applause of her Vaudeville debut.After that we are relentless observers of more or less small disgusting details of a defeated country getting off its war torn tattered knees. And nobody ever handled small disgust better than Clouzot. In fact too bad he never tried Sartre's Nausea. Almost everything we see after the first few minutes makes us ever so slightly queasy. ....okay okay I'm grossly overstating that let's just settle for a general feel of a lot of the film. Look carefully in fact and you will even see one of the cops picking his nose. And in how many films has anyone ever done that. Then there is a very loud nose blowing bit in front of the photographer lesbian by the main cop and notice that she does not literally blink an eye or raise an eyebrow.The point of all this is an almost feverish immersion in contiguity seemingly until you can smell practically every scene as well as see and feel it. As for the other aspects of the movie others here have covered them in a lot more detail than I. But forget about the mystery here this is the ultimate McGuffin. Clouzot is about as interested in the real killer as those two women coming in out of the rain in the first few seconds of the film and are never seen again. From beginning to end all he wanted to do was follow a bunch of people around not even particularly interesting ones at that and say here look at this woman's twitch that man's hitching of his pants in all their insignificance years and years before Tina Turner was singing we don't need another hero. Even the forced levity of the ending is bleakly done in a dilapidated part of Paris and rather chilly bare walled apartment. With only the couples love for each other to see them through as if to say there must be two or three million like you throughout the city working your fingers off by the day for a little love at night.From this it was just a short step to Wages of Fear and the ultimate in despair. They don't even know how to make films like this anymore in the U.S. For that matter they didn't even know how to very much in France then much less now. The relentless detail of gesture makes even the neorealists of Italy look like bad psychologists. Which I guess makes Clouzot a kind of Rosselini on speed. Very enjoyable nonsense this movie. The only flaw seems to me and as was pointed out by another viewer the lead woman is somehow not quite right. Everybody else in the film is just about perfectly cast.".

Still Clouzot's direction is great and the acting is quite good. Louis Jouvet who also costarred in Marcel Carn's Drle de Drame gives the best performance as the clever detective. I wonder if the Coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote Fargo.

The society of American Noir is one in which the old patriarchal values have been eroded by the absence of men during the war. Women have become independent and therefor dangerous leading the traumatized former soldiers astray into darkness. The downfall of such characters in most Noir is the reinstatement of order or at least of justice. Perhaps the world is no longer one that deserves happiness but it will not be a place where transgression is rewarded. The characters in this French film engage in many illegal dangerous activities. Yet the film does not feel the need to moralize about them. Indeed neither does law enforcement which is depicted here as simply another weary faction of the working class. This is a cosmos that is neither punitive nor loving but simply in Camus's phrase gently indifferent.".

The film is a bit long so falters in places but the storyline and cast are good. You can tell that certain actions are going to come back to haunt the relevant characters and it is entertaining to see if these actions will be found out. Nothing gets by detective Louis Jouvet Antoine. He is tenacious and is no fool. Can he get to the truth? Simone Renant Dora plays a glamorous lesbian photographer who seems to lead a lonely life of unreciprocated love although it is suggested that she may well be involved with wannabe heterosexual Suzy Delair Jenny who is prepared to do anything to get to the top. That includes sexual favours with influential sleazy Charles Dullin Brignon who can get her into movies. Her husband Bernard Blier Maurice is her musical accompanist and he is no fan of Dullin. For me Blier is what is wrong with the film as he doesn't cut it as a leading man  he's short fat balding unattractive and his whole countenance is slightly retarded. No way would Delair be by this man's side. Or so this film leads us to think.Renant is clearly in the right profession of photographing nude young women and she is my favourite character. All the lead characters have an inner strength when dealing with the police that is admirable. It's a French determination that should be applauded. The women are particularly good in this film. Shame it drags in places and Dullin is slightly unconvincing.".

	schema:headline " Still the best cinematic rendering of an opera ever";
	schema:reviewBody "Who else but Franco Zeffirelli could make what is the best opera movie ever? He has made several of them. After all his productions at La Scala in the '50s catapulted that opera house once again to reign among the world's best and preceded his move into film making. Known for lush period costume dramas Zeffirelli surely doesn't disappoint in that department. In fact visually LA TRAVIATA ranks among his best work. Controversial innovations luxurious locations and superb casting make LA TRAVIATA even more unique. His editing down of several repetitive arias and visual depiction of many of the arias' contents through flashbacks caused much controversy in Europe where I first saw it in its 1982 premiere. However the controversy was generated by opera purists since from a purely artistic viewpoint not to mention a strictly cinematic one LA TRAVIATA has never been so well expressed in fact no opera has. The cinematic enhancements and cutting a few minutes off the running time to make the work more accessible only made opera more attractive to all. The beautiful actual locations of the Seine old Paris the French countryside and opulent palaces are a treat to watch as the wonderful music conducted by the Met's legendary James Levine is played. Neither is pushed back to the background. Both elements blend into an unforgettable whole. If one wants to see pure opera one can buy several versions of LA TRAVIATA especially filmed live at an opera house and watch the musicians in the orchestra pit play the conductor's gestures and hear the superb voices of the usually out of character physically and agewise singers on stage. The performances are usually longer as many arias are repeated several times something film can avoid through its unique advantages. In this case the performance on film runs 1 hour 45 minutes without the elimination of any arias just avoiding the repetition described above. In contrast the opera house experience including two intermissions usually runs twice that length if not longer. This version of LA TRAVIATA is not only fine moviemaking but showcases the superb voices and musical excellence of the best of the classical recordings. With the sublime Teresa Stratas in the title role and the now legendary Placido Domingo as her love interest one cannot ask for better leads. They are also of believable age and display great chemistry together. The young Domingo's fiery Latin emotions with his imposing looks and the very slender and also young Stratas' passionate interpretation especially in her facial gestures are totally convincing and captivating as are needless to say their vocal talents among the greatest of the century. Added touches such as subtle shots focusing on the period's social customs and a knockout ballet sequence in a party scene are among the final master touches to this unique production. One simply cannot compare say  the classical version released two years later featuring Dame Joan Sutherland possibly the greatest soprano ever but at the end of her incredible careerand Luciano Pavorotti to whom comparable comments also apply. But two extremely overweight leads pushing sixty portraying young lovers obviously lend a different perspective of this great opera. Placido Domingo and Zeffirelli have since made more opera movies and they are all excellent. But here Domingo is in his prime and looks the part. He has obviously aged as consequent opera films were made up to ten years later in fact. And Zeffirelli here is still at the stage designing grand opera productions around the world while still in his creative prime as a film maker. As for Stratas her Violeta la traviata the woman led stray is for me the highlight of many highlights. She combines compelling acting unforgettable vocal agility and almost unheard of in opera a very thin attractive physique. It is almost to good to be true. Many viewers who are not opera buffs do in fact think she is a dramatic actress dubbed by a great soprano. An incredible package indeed and this applies to the entire production. Definitely a 10. Someone should put pressure on Universal who is still selling the same 16 year old video to restore this gem and rerelease it on video and DVD. I just bought another VHS and was disappointed it was still the original version. With DVD's growth I'm sure that will soon change if it isn't already happening. Don't miss it in any version you can get your hands on.".

She combines compelling acting unforgettable vocal agility and almost unheard of in opera a very thin attractive physique. It is almost to good to be true. Many viewers who are not opera buffs do in fact think she is a dramatic actress dubbed by a great soprano. An incredible package indeed and this applies to the entire production. Definitely a 10. Someone should put pressure on Universal who is still selling the same 16 year old video to restore this gem and rerelease it on video and DVD. I just bought another VHS and was disappointed it was still the original version. With DVD's growth I'm sure that will soon change if it isn't already happening. Don't miss it in any version you can get your hands on.";

Their love for each other is torn apart by his fatherbut she still loves him. It all leads to a tragic end.I saw this in a theatre back in 1982. They tried to play it like an opera. When I walked in the screen was covered by a red curtain back in those days some of the older theaters still had curtains. As the lights went down the curtain parted and the film began. When the film ended the curtains pulled back together and the lights came up. My audience applauded even after the lights were up. It gave the feeling of being at a live opera. That can't be recreated at your home but this film is still well worth seeing.Director Franco Zeffirelli wisely did not film the opera as it is staged. He opened it upthis was set up for a film. Sequences take place outside and the inside sets are way too elaborate for an actual opera.The costumes are beautiful and the sets are just stunningfull of color and light. Every moment of this picture is filled with beautiful imagery. It matches perfectly with the singing and the music which are just incredible. There's even a showstopping matador dance halfway through! I've never seen the opera but I've heard this is very faithful and Stratas and Domingo have beautiful voices and also can act! The only negative here is that Domingo is way too old for his role...but that can be forgiven whenever he sings.This was actually a sizable hit back in 1982. The same team got together a few years later and filmed Othello. Surprisingly that was TERRIBLE and is a textbook example of how NOT to do an opera! But this one is just great and a mustsee. I give it a 10.".

The plot based on the book by Alexandre Dumas Junior is not too complicated and easy to follow. The performances are astonishing. Placido Domingo not only looks the part of Alfredo but sang and acted a dream easily up there with Alfredo Krauss as one of the best tenors playing that particular character. Teresa Stratus was perfection as Violetta. I did worry that her performance was going to leave me cold but her beautiful voice and outstanding acting ability equalled a real tearjerker of a performance that was poignant and understated. Cornell MacNeill is not a name I am familiar with but he certainly shone as Germont with a fine baritone voice and good stage presence. Overall a perfect opera film that is a real tearjerker. 1010 Bethany Cox".

The singers are at the top of their game Domingo is a young sexy Alfredo and Teresa Stratas IS Violetta Valery in a performance that even Maria Callas would envy. Zefferelli who has long claimed he had a friendship with her and in truth he had been behind various opera productions of hers had Maria Callas in mind when he cast Teresa Stratas. Like Callas Stratas has a Greek background through her parents though she was Canadian born has similar looks has the same type of dramatic voice and she is in Zefferelli's own words an electrifying actress and soprano of the lyric entertainment. The Callas connection is most obvious when Stratas appears in a black veiled gown in Act 2 at Flora's party where even her hair is similar to Callas' infamous 50's performances.Released in 1982 Zefferelli sought to convert people into opera lovers through the lush visual seduction of the cinema. This is exactly what he did. The cinematography of this film kills you with excessive beauty. The opening credits roll as we see scenes of Paris in the Notre Dame Cathedral area and surrounding residential district by the Seine river. The interior of Violetta Valery's mansion where she hosts the Act 1 party is luxurious and Zefferelli allows us to be dizzied with the sheer opulence of the house gilded mirrors portraits of Violetta curtains chandeliers etc. Visually on film we are able to tell things about the characters that stage performances do not for example as the guests depart from Act 1's party an old woman steals a silver box from Violetta proving to us that Violetta is not among real friends these are only fairweathered friends and bad ones at that. They were not even there for her when she was dying in the finale. Also noteworthy is the cruel trick one has to catch on early on. Violetta and Alfredo are never reunited as in the opera but instead his return is a hallucination and she dies alone in her apartment.The beginning of the film has Violetta reminiscing about the better days as a desirable and wealthy courtesan who partied all the time. She is deathly ill and already her house is sold and men are moving her things out. The country scenes are incredibly beautiful as Violetta and Alfredo live happily in seclusion. Alfredo rides his horse and Violetta picks flowers for her greenhouse and feeds her white doves in their big cage. Cornell McNeil's bombastic but fatherly Giorgio Germont is a great support to the refined performances of Domingo and Stratas. The Flora's party scene is exceptional with even more visual beauty as Gypsies and bullfighters dance seductively and professional gamblers enjoy themselves. The closing ensemble is not to be missed and neither is the melancholy and tragic ending. This is the greatest and ultimate version of La Traviata ever made. It is a must have for opera fans and for curious nonopera lovers.".

	schema:reviewBody "If one considers the love stories of all times beside the undeniable classics by greatest playwrights inevitably comes to mind the name of Alexandre Dumas fils who in 1852 wrote a novel THE LADY OF THE CAMELLIAS. Since then the endless love story set in the 19th century Paris has inspired both opera writers and movie directors. Consequently the power of the tale embedded in the libretto by Francesco Maria Piave prompted opera maestro Giuseppe Verdi to write one of his most famous operas LA TRAVIATA basing his content entirely on the story about a deathly ill courtesan who though does not have long to live due to tuberculosis finds the true love of her life. What came out was a greatly successful work where only characters were renamed but where the audiences were provided with something special and timeless glorious music.However lots of modern viewers skip those classics easily reducing their knowledge to films only. More to say the commercial nature of cinema hardly promotes any of this high rank entertainment. As a result the question appears is it possible to captivate amaze and enthuse a pop corn generation's viewer with the staff of this sort? The Italian director Franco Zeffirelli managed to prove it possible through this production with some of his personal additions and most importantly with the magnificent leads marvelous tenor Placido Domingo and astounding soprano Teresa Stratas. Though LA TRAVIATA has been staged and filmed several times so far this version occurs to be the best one. Why? The first aspect that addresses the viewers both opera buffs and modern genres' lovers the aspect that highlights the very core of their emotions and experiences are the visuals of the movie. From the very credits with the view of the Notre Dame Cathedral and the surroundings of the Seine River when the sounds of larks and pigeons mix with the sounds of crows it all appears to be as if a moving work of art that you look at in perfect admiration and astonishment. The wardrobes together with sets and decorations of interiors are stunning to the very essence of visual feast. This effort taken in providing the viewer with vision's awe is magnificently executed throughout. There are plenty of moments one could enumerate praising their pearls and uniqueness but for me personally there are two sequences of greatest interest the lavish party as a flashback of Violetta's delirious mind and her visit to the countryside where the nature seems to praise the sincere love as no one and nothing else. This goes with sublime music by Verdi which is practically much more memorable for the viewers and their enthusiasm for the entire work of art. Opera is promoted by modern means. Therefore some of the commentators are right saying paradoxically that this is an opera movie for people who hate opera.Besides the whole cast fit very well to their roles. This refers both to the lead I have mentioned before as well as to the supporting cast. Placido Domingo as Alfredo Germont and Teresa Stratas as Violetta Valery were a perfect choice for the couple because of their attractiveness and the desirable chemistry. Cornell McNeil is excellent as Giorgio Germont the authoritative parent who supposedly cares for his son's future. The three memorably reach the top notch performances at the end when emotions are riding to the highest degrees... The supporting male and female roles including a bunch of beautiful young maidens are easily recognizable and leave a personal impression in viewers.So to say LA TRAVIATA is a true work of art a mysteriously beautiful and subtly exquisite screen work that anyone should see. Referring to the words of Vincent Canby in New York Times who called this film triumph and found it dazzling I heartily recommend this masterpiece! Perhaps one of the greatest operas of all times and one of the very best productions by Franco Zeffirelli.".

	schema:reviewBody "A path of education...Art of high achievement influences many eternally and profoundly. Maybe he was not as accomplished as his good old dad Alexandra Dumas Fils made his own work a classic household name which is wellremembered and appreciated.I first heard about Cha Fa Nui Camille from the mouth of my mother when I was still an upper primary school girl. To a young Chinese girl this meant nothing at all but I went to the public library and found that there were many copies with this title translated by Taiwanese. I never finished reading it because the names are too long and the Chinese is too literary I was bored to death by it. The only thing I remembered was that it was a French novel. Dropped the book but not the name.A few years later in the early 80's Franco Zeffirelli's operatic movie with Chinese title as Cha Fa Nui was on show in one and only one movie house Palace at Causeway Bay demolished!. At that time this prestigious cinema showed mostly western movies of big names like Gone with the Wind Casablanca Dr. Zhivago and so La Traviata was one of them.Hong Kong Chinese were then not very familiar with Western culture the cinema staff had even misplaced Plcido Domingo's name as Domingo Plcido on the billboard. I as a teenager was a little intimidated by the movie house by its reputation and grandeur. Yet out of curiosity in those fearless carefree and innocent days imitating the adults with good taste I bought a ticket to see this movie. And it was a WOW what an eyeopening experience!The vision the music the powerful opera singing the acting and the poetic cinematography the wondrous costumes and hairdo it was an educational adventure to a young life. So until now I still don't understand how come the man at one row before me could be sleeping and snoring so annoyingly while his girlfriendwifesister was staring hard on the screen without moving her head. Everything is unforgettable about this movie. The happy time of the lovers that Violetta once fell off into a shallow brook from the narrow wood plank. The histrionic and comical fit of Alfredo when he was struggle to open that fateful letter from Violetta. And the most excruciating of all I can still feel the deafening horror that the deserted and seriously ill Violetta was standing desertedly in the cruelly empty and stripped big house letting out piercing shriek of pain.The subsequent episode is an educational search for me I looked for abridged version of Cha Fa Nui in English Camille and found out that the names of the original protagonists were Marguerite Gautier and Armand Duval but not those in the operatic adaptation as Violetta Valery and Alfredo Germont. Furthermore the book inspired Giuseppe Verdi first to make it into an opera but not Franco Zeffirelli's movie.And five years later I learned some French and so dared to touched the original La Dame aux Camlias. Later I learnt from an Italian lady that the name of Verdi's opera La Traviata was derived from an Italian verb traviare which means to mislead to lead astray or to corrupt. Thus a corrupted man is a traviato and so the fallen woman or the corrupted woman is La Traviata. And the book has inspired every generation's filmmakers or TV producers so far there are more than forty adaptations. Well well well what a job all through the years.What's more interesting I once read from an oddlyenough page about the Brits' Prince Charles. It is reported that his favourite opera is La Traviata and my eyebrows arched. Of course his loved one is named Camilla and strictly speaking by royal standard she is a fallen committed adultery  divorced woman.".

	onyx:emotionText "A path of education...Art of high achievement influences many eternally and profoundly. Maybe he was not as accomplished as his good old dad Alexandra Dumas Fils made his own work a classic household name which is wellremembered and appreciated.I first heard about Cha Fa Nui Camille from the mouth of my mother when I was still an upper primary school girl. To a young Chinese girl this meant nothing at all but I went to the public library and found that there were many copies with this title translated by Taiwanese. I never finished reading it because the names are too long and the Chinese is too literary I was bored to death by it. The only thing I remembered was that it was a French novel. Dropped the book but not the name.A few years later in the early 80's Franco Zeffirelli's operatic movie with Chinese title as Cha Fa Nui was on show in one and only one movie house Palace at Causeway Bay demolished!. At that time this prestigious cinema showed mostly western movies of big names like Gone with the Wind Casablanca Dr. Zhivago and so La Traviata was one of them.Hong Kong Chinese were then not very familiar with Western culture the cinema staff had even misplaced Plcido Domingo's name as Domingo Plcido on the billboard. I as a teenager was a little intimidated by the movie house by its reputation and grandeur. Yet out of curiosity in those fearless carefree and innocent days imitating the adults with good taste I bought a ticket to see this movie. And it was a WOW what an eyeopening experience!The vision the music the powerful opera singing the acting and the poetic cinematography the wondrous costumes and hairdo it was an educational adventure to a young life. So until now I still don't understand how come the man at one row before me could be sleeping and snoring so annoyingly while his girlfriendwifesister was staring hard on the screen without moving her head. Everything is unforgettable about this movie. The happy time of the lovers that Violetta once fell off into a shallow brook from the narrow wood plank. The histrionic and comical fit of Alfredo when he was struggle to open that fateful letter from Violetta. And the most excruciating of all I can still feel the deafening horror that the deserted and seriously ill Violetta was standing desertedly in the cruelly empty and stripped big house letting out piercing shriek of pain.The subsequent episode is an educational search for me I looked for abridged version of Cha Fa Nui in English Camille and found out that the names of the original protagonists were Marguerite Gautier and Armand Duval but not those in the operatic adaptation as Violetta Valery and Alfredo Germont. Furthermore the book inspired Giuseppe Verdi first to make it into an opera but not Franco Zeffirelli's movie.And five years later I learned some French and so dared to touched the original La Dame aux Camlias. Later I learnt from an Italian lady that the name of Verdi's opera La Traviata was derived from an Italian verb traviare which means to mislead to lead astray or to corrupt. Thus a corrupted man is a traviato and so the fallen woman or the corrupted woman is La Traviata.

Which in turn gave me great expectations for this film i was terribly mistaken. The first hour of this film is filled with nothing more than the usual scare tactic employed in the last 2 films which does work to a certain degree but also grows old very quickly as its all be done before in the last 2 films. A slight mix up was the camera attached to a fan trick which i did find a good idea although even that wore thin. Also took away from the fear aspect of the film was the comedy factor which they seemed to incorporate which personally i believe has no place in the PA films. I also thought that the scene in the kitchen was a ridiculous play on the scene in the 2nd PA could have been a bit more creative there.After the first hour passed i believed the film was beginning to pick up and bit and actually had me frightened for a short period of time. Before i continue after this is a SPOILER!!. Why this film turned into somewhat of a cult film was beyond a joke. It completely took away from the main isolated fear aspect that the film was famous for. The ending was completely ridiculous leaving and unbelievable amount of questions unanswered.1. Where does it show you anything to do with the house burning down?2. Why weren't any of the clips in the trailers in the actual feature?3. It never explains what the entity actually is?4. How did the mother actually die in the film? And where does it show that she is actually dead at the top of the staircase?5. Why does the ghost haunt the children although it is meant to haunt the first born son?6. Where did a cult ever play a part in any of the other films?All in all this film was a complete let down and i wouldn't recommend anyone to pay any amount of money to go and view this even just to understand the story its not worth seeing as it does not answer any of this.P.S as well as all of this the reaction of the people in the cinema watching this took away from the fear as a lot of laughs were had.".

That's a fact. The setup and premise are familiar even if the characters are not. So as such I can understand someone's not liking this one much at all. But. I personally found the first and second ones to be pretty scary  even when in the second one I knew stuff was going to happen. It has to be a good film when you're surprised even when you expect something right? So right or wrong I loved this movie. It gave me what I was seeking and more.Whereas the second film was set shortly before the first one this film takes a look at the childhood of Katie the protagonist of the first film. You may recall that as the first movie progressed Katie became convinced that something was after her specifically  but she couldn't imagine why. This movie attempts to resolve that issue. And you sort of have to give credit to a movie that resolves some things while leaving other threads dangling just enough to make one wonder what the hey is going on.It's 1988. Young Katie lives with her younger sister Kristi her mom Julie and Julie's boyfriend Dennis. Strange things are afoot in their house around the same time that young Kristi begins communicating with an imaginary friend named Toby. Is it a normal kid phase or is it something more sinister? As with the other films cameras are placed around the house to capture anything odd that may happen during the night. In a clever bit of ingenuity Dennis takes apart an oscillating fan and places a camera on it so that he can pan from living room to kitchen and back.What makes a movie like this work for me is the same thing that made The Blair Witch Project work and its sequel not work at all  it feels voyeuristic as if we were simply peeking in on some family's everyday lives. Reasons are given for the constant filming Dennis tells Kristi for example that he's testing his new camera as they have a tea party. We're automatically drawn to the video footage. What will we see? We're now ready for something  will it jump out at us? Will furniture be overturned? Or something even worse?The mood is another huge selling point. People react as you'd expect them to. Dennis is obsessed with finding out what's causing those noises and other disturbances Julie thinks he's completely off his rocker and becomes more testy as time goes by. People who also experience the occurrences like a babysitter and a friend of Dennis are stunned to the point of not wishing to discuss the matter further hurriedly leaving as soon as possible.Now I can't say that everyone even those who love to be scared is going to love this as much as I did. For me since we see almost everything through the lens of a camera the terror  and the anticipation  are grossly heightened. When that door is opened what will we find? It's not going to be pretty but unlike a standard horror film where one can simply slough off a shock as being too fantastic here we're so easily drawn in by and engaged with our surrogate family that we feel as terrified and mystified as they do.Paranormal Activity 3 won't answer everything that the first two may have left unsolved but it does offer hints as to why in the present day these events are still occurring to Katie and her family. We see a part of that genesis and it's not really what I expected. I was unsettled and thankful I hadn't seen the movie at night. Okay that might be a little hyperbolic and when some of you actually watch the movie you'll laugh at me for being skittish. I don't care. I enjoyed the movie and that's all I'm concerned with.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never so quickly have I seen a franchise get whored out in Hollywood. A couple of years ago the world was hit with Paranormal Activity making you wonder what happens when you're asleep. It's the most successful independent movie ever with a small budget of fifteen thousand and making over a hundred million is just incredible. But with big hype comes a lot of back lash. I personally loved that film and it's one of my favorite horror movies taking the simplicity of what's in the dark fears from our childhood and making our imaginations go crazy. Since the film was a huge success Hollywood naturally called on a sequel. Paranormal Activity 2 was released a year later pretty much claiming the Saw franchise money. Paranormal Activity 2 was an alright film it wasn't as scary because we knew what to expect and with bigger budget the effects could be a little too over the top at times. Paranormal Activity 3 was advertised and I was thinking that this film was a mistake but I was just curious where they were taking the story so I saw it opening night and this film blew me away. What a scary movie and so perfect to add to the franchise making me want plenty more.In 1988 young Katie and Kristi live with their mother Julie and her boyfriend Dennis. Kristi begins interacting with an invisible friend named Toby. Dennis notices that since Kristi's friend appeared strange things have been happening in the house. While reviewing some footage later Dennis notices a strange incident with presence being shown on camera. He invites his friend Randy over to view the footage who suggests that Dennis place cameras throughout the house to capture any other incidents. After more disturbed nights and strange occurrences Dennis discovers a strange symbol in the girls' closet. He finds the same symbol on a picture of women in a book about mysticism. Dennis explains to Julie that the symbol belonged to a witches coven that brainwashed young girls into having sons. Thus explaining more about the two previous films.A couple of flaws with the film being that one being based in 1988 the film sure does look very crisp with it's picture. Wonder where the guy got his video obviously not Wal Mart. Secondly there are still some questions left unanswered maybe due to the overwhelming success of the first film the writers had to do what they could with Katie's story. Only explanation being in this film is that the cult brainwashes people so maybe Katie and Kristi had a different story in the previous films due to the spell. However this film scared the heck out of me which takes a lot. The beginning does start off a little silly to me since again you know what is going to happen. But not even 25 minutes into the film it does pick up again. The last fifteen minutes had me frozen to my seat. A lot of people are complaining that the trailer has completely different scenes than from the movie I personally like it that way because it keeps the film fresh and has you guessing. The bloody Mary scene in the film is much more scary than in the trailer in my opinion. Paranormal Activity 3 really did raise the bar and I'm so glad. The characters a likable and the effects are actually top notch and done effectively. There's a scene with the babysitter where the demon is wearing a blanket and is standing right behind her believe me you'll have such major goose bumps from that scene. If you like scary movies you're going to love this film I can't wait for the fourth one and I'm glad that we finally went back to the basics of a good ghost story. Though my suggestions to the characters stop filming the demon! That's obviously ticking him off.810".

	schema:reviewBody "To be honest I never liked Paranormal Activity movies. It's about people who lived in a house with cameras and there are evil spirits haunting them then all of the events are caught on tape. The idea is interesting but the execution always end up being unsatisfying. Paranormal Activity 3 is the very beginning of the series. It's not actually a prequel. It's more of a backward trilogy to make the ending of the rest of the Paranormal Activity films mysterious. Although the twist is a little bit predictable but Paranormal Activity 3 has a decent story to tell with these found footage. And it really has the scares. Finally this series has a genuine scare.Paranormal Activity 3 reveals all the mysteries of the first two movies. Unlike the first two instead of watching the lives of these people and wait for the spirits to come out this one really tells a story through the videos. The story is not anything new though but the execution is decent. The second Paranormal Activity narrates almost everything in the story. Here you don't need it you just have to look at the video footage to know the story.Aside from its storytelling Paranormal Activity is all about the scares. They improved the scares by moderating the slow burns and keep the objects floating. The ghosts aren't quite invisible like the first two. Here it's campy. You can see its shadows. And of course there's a lot of threat from the ghost. The scares are more than just jump scares. It has more terror and gumption to the thrills which is kinda fun. The cameras are well shot. Everything is well made. But the twist remains predictable for some reason.Paranormal Activity 3 is not earning the fear anymore. It's now earning the scares. It's great to see Paranormal Activity with exact scares than wait for more than five minutes to be scared. It's not the scariest horror movie of the year but it's the best part of the series and also the most decent horror of the year. I still wanna see the parts on the trailer that wasn't show in the actual film but Paranormal Activity 3 is satisfying enough in its short runtime. Decent enough as a foundfootagehorrorfilm.".

	schema:headline " What you don't see scares you the most";
	schema:reviewBody "Horror movies tend to polarize opinions all the time... Far more than the majority of movie genres. What one person might find scary may be humorous to another person... So when I left the theater after a packed screening of this movie  the audience seemed pretty polarized in their opinions. It really is an example of a 'you either love it or hate it movie' Although some people may not take either extreme which is absolutely fine .I am one of the people who came out of the theater loving it.Paranormal Activity 3 is a prequel that goes back to the year 1988. It follows the sisters Kristi and katie from the last 2 movie's 18 years before the events of Paranormal activity 1. Its an origin story that gives us a little more information but still leaves us feeling confused and uneasy. The new cameraman Dennis acts as a foster father to Kristi and Katie The whereabouts of the real father remains open to debate works as a wedding moviemaker. This gives a decent enough explanation as to why he seems to have top of the range filming equipment for the era . His character comes across as more caring and less irritating than Micah from PA1. The Mother of Kristi and Katie Juliecame across as caring towards her children. The children who play Kristi and Katie actually come across and fairly decent actors.The basic plot is like the last two movies. Strange occurrences are happening at the house they are staying in. Dennis out of curiosity decides to set up cameras around the house to hopefully find something unusual. The greatest improvement of this movie over the other movies is probably the pacing. I wont ruin anything that hasn't been in the trailer at least but the younger daughter kristi has a seemingly imaginary friend called toby that she talks to at night. As the movie progresses things get out of head fairly quickly and this imaginary friends becomes something real and horrific.The movie does a good job of taking us out of our comfort zones. We feel confused and that confusion adds a sense of helplessness. While we may know the formula of the last movies we know little about the monster. What we don't see but know is there usually scares us the most. The camera footage itself comes across as grainy and lower in quality than before Again the trailer is rather misleading . It makes it feel more authentic. While you know its not real you cant help getting sucked in by the movies world. There are also some clever shots and effects Scenes with the oscillating camera are ingenious at times .The main complaints that I have with the movie are that sometimes the actions of Daniel can be questionable and the ending left me feeling a little unsatisfied.That being said it doesn't detract from my own experience of the movie. I was terrified! It may not terrify some the ratings on IMDb show some that already but I think the best thing to do is go watch it and make up your own mind".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all this is my first review on IMDb. I guess I'm a long time reader first time contributor. This movie didn't infuriate me enough to write my first review it just happened that I didn't read an accurate assessment before I paid to see it and I was thoroughly disappointed. Times are tough I don't want to waste my money on a mediocre flick. I read all reviews and watch all trailers before doling out 30 to go see a movie. So here is my assessment.I enjoyed PA1 and PA2. I care about plot development when it comes to scary flicks but I do get enjoyment from purely frightening imagery. The trailer for PA3 is misleading. I'd say about 20 that's being generous of the material from the trailer actually made it into the film and what you saw in the trailer was the scariest material.The movie started off well sticking with exactly the same video imagery as the first two films. We're introduced to young Kristie and Katie their mother and new stepfather all of whom live in their family home. Several times I found myself confused at the house it seems like they combined the house from PA1 and PA2 into one massive super scary house. The scares in the first half of the film are all similar to those from the first two. They're predictable with a few jumps and jolts that were unexpected. They introduce the presence of Tobie who is communicating with Kristie. Mom seems to think he's just an imaginary friend and for quite a while he seems to be just that. The relationship is seemingly harmless for the most part albeit slightly creepy however things start going downhill when Kristie tells the spirit We never find out what exactly he is to leave her alone.The movie picks up in the second half several scares and jolts abound. However the movie suddenly goes downhill at a rapid pace. After a few frightening incidents kitchen scene Katie being dragged into Tobie's hidey hole Blood Mary scene you aren't missing much it's nothing like the trailer the family packs it all up and heads to grandma's house. Here things get...odd. We find out that grandma belongs to some kind of witch coven. This however leads to more questions than answers which is what I wanted from this movie. If you're looking for answers to any of these questions...please don't waste your money to see it in theaters1. The house burning down? Not even addressed or covered. 2. What the heck is Tobie? A demon a spirit? Mostly he's just an invisible pedophile. 3. Supposedly all of the family pictures and heirlooms were lost in the fire however in the beginning Katie drops off a huge box of VHS tapes to her sister. 4. What happened to the baby from PA2? No idea not even mentioned. 5. Did Katie and Kristie's mom have no idea about grandma's coven? Wouldn't she be involved? Clearly the little ones are. 6. Why is Tobie pestering the girls if the coven only cares about a son?My final assessment if you're in it for shocks scares and jolts I'd say go see it. Make sure you keep an eye on the light bright in the girl's room it helps you understand the ending a little bit better. There were several times I was peeking at the screen through my hands. However if you thought PA3 would answer your questions from PA1 and PA2 I'd say avoid this like the plague or wait until it comes out on Redbox. It's a great Halloween flick but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I thought this would tie it all together but in retrospect I left confused and irritated with all the unanswered questions. Happy Haunting!".

There was parts in the Trailers which weren't in the film. Like the whole Bloody Mary scene was different which was one of the moments i was most looking forward to. You didn't get to see what the demon looked like they kept reusing ideas from the other two films for instance in paranormal activity 2 all the drawers and cupboards opened at once. Whereas in this film all the stuff in the kitchen was stuck to the ceiling and then fell to the ground with the majority of it smashing. Again this was very predictable. The majority of the audience i was with laughed at the film there was even a girl who wasn't even phased by this so called 'horror' what was even funnier she predicted several things that happened. If you want to see this film i would highly recommend watching it for free online something because the film isn't worth money at all. Thanks for reading.".

	schema:headline " It Runs In The Family";
	schema:reviewBody "PA3 is a prequel to the previous two films in which we find out the origins of the paranormal entity that haunted Katie and Kristie when they were adults. It is safe to say that there will be many moments in the film that will make you jump out of your seats and make your jaw drop in pure terror.This is the third film in the successful PA franchise that has since replaced SAW as the annual Halloween event. The formula has been established and perhaps you already know if you'll watch this film or not. However let me say this the trailer is misleading. If you know me I'm very much against movie trailers that spoil almost everything so I loved how the marketing team approached this film. About 90 of the scenes in the trailer don't appear in the film so the scares are actually much more satisfying effective and shocking this way and thank goodness for that because I felt that the trailer was way too cartoonish and cheesy.Suffice to say that this film is successful in almost every way. Because this is the third film in the series you may think you know what's going to happen. However the film pretty much plays against your expectations on almost everything. For example minimalism and subtlety is pretty much thrown out the window. If you were tired of the doors opening and shutting and the lighting flickering on and off in the first two films PA3 will show you things you would never have expected would happen in a PA film. I'm not going to lie there are some pretty elaborate and creative scares here and most of these scares come from the genius addition of the oscillating fan camera in which the camera rotates left to right. This not only makes for great use of effective jump scares but also for the building of suspense and dread as we see things the characters don't.In terms of jump scares there are many that appear. While many people might complain about this the film really succeeds in building up the tension that we know that something startling is going to happen and that's what makes it so fun and unnerving to watch. This may be counterproductive because what made the first film so scary and unique to me is the lack of jump scares and the lack of anything elaborate in general. In PA the simplicity is what makes it so great relying on the viewer's imagination to create the fear so showing all these scares in PA3 pretty much goes against everything established in PA. However I'm not going to hold this against the film because the scares are orchestrated so well with the timing and editing that it doesn't matter at that point.I also want to point out that the scares come earlier than expected. It seems as if the directors know what the audience wants so they're giving it to them. Not only is the quantity of scares much higher than the previous two films but the quality of them are pretty great too. There is surprisingly a lot of humor added in the film as well. The film seems self aware of itself and has some fun with it. The character development is much better here than that of the second film. The parents are good as they are but I have to say that the two girls were pretty great. This film proves that just because there are kids in a film doesn't mean they have to be bad and annoying.The only flaw I can find about the film is the climax because it was eerily similar to another horror film that was released a couple of years ago. However I will say that PA3's climax was very terrifying to watch. Overall if you didn't like the first two films you'll like this one the most. If you're a fan of the series you'll obviously like this one. And if you want to watch things that go bump in the night PA3 is one of the best out there.".

	onyx:emotionText "PA3 is a prequel to the previous two films in which we find out the origins of the paranormal entity that haunted Katie and Kristie when they were adults. It is safe to say that there will be many moments in the film that will make you jump out of your seats and make your jaw drop in pure terror.This is the third film in the successful PA franchise that has since replaced SAW as the annual Halloween event. The formula has been established and perhaps you already know if you'll watch this film or not. However let me say this the trailer is misleading. If you know me I'm very much against movie trailers that spoil almost everything so I loved how the marketing team approached this film. About 90 of the scenes in the trailer don't appear in the film so the scares are actually much more satisfying effective and shocking this way and thank goodness for that because I felt that the trailer was way too cartoonish and cheesy.Suffice to say that this film is successful in almost every way. Because this is the third film in the series you may think you know what's going to happen. However the film pretty much plays against your expectations on almost everything. For example minimalism and subtlety is pretty much thrown out the window. If you were tired of the doors opening and shutting and the lighting flickering on and off in the first two films PA3 will show you things you would never have expected would happen in a PA film. I'm not going to lie there are some pretty elaborate and creative scares here and most of these scares come from the genius addition of the oscillating fan camera in which the camera rotates left to right. This not only makes for great use of effective jump scares but also for the building of suspense and dread as we see things the characters don't.In terms of jump scares there are many that appear. While many people might complain about this the film really succeeds in building up the tension that we know that something startling is going to happen and that's what makes it so fun and unnerving to watch. This may be counterproductive because what made the first film so scary and unique to me is the lack of jump scares and the lack of anything elaborate in general. In PA the simplicity is what makes it so great relying on the viewer's imagination to create the fear so showing all these scares in PA3 pretty much goes against everything established in PA. However I'm not going to hold this against the film because the scares are orchestrated so well with the timing and editing that it doesn't matter at that point.I also want to point out that the scares come earlier than expected. It seems as if the directors know what the audience wants so they're giving it to them. Not only is the quantity of scares much higher than the previous two films but the quality of them are pretty great too. There is surprisingly a lot of humor added in the film as well. The film seems self aware of itself and has some fun with it. The character development is much better here than that of the second film. The parents are good as they are but I have to say that the two girls were pretty great. This film proves that just because there are kids in a film doesn't mean they have to be bad and annoying.The only flaw I can find about the film is the climax because it was eerily similar to another horror film that was released a couple of years ago.

I don't know if they where trying to trick people to think what's going to happen to make it more suspenseful or a bad last minute decision but they took the worst possible direction ever borderline the horrible conclusion of The Last Exorcism. It had the whole feeling of tense unease going for it and a couple of cheap but clever scares and the whole planting the camera on a rotating fan is brilliant and the scariest parts of the film as well as one bedroom scene with the little girls and the clever babysitter scene but then they go to grandma's house and the direction and tone changed for the worse for me and I just didn't buy it for a second! This series use to be effective raw and unrelenting but now it's just plain silly but the curiosity still remains with even more unanswered questions about this ghost tale that might lead to another sequel in the near future but for now I'm done with these type of movies because after this disappointing one that leaves you on a sour note this trend is fading rapidly. Another thing that it has going for it is the involvement with the audiences and knowing more than the characters making you scream at the screen waiting for something bad to happen which is more fun and playful spook this time around than being truly frightful but the acting and characters is probably the best of the series but it doesn't help the film's many problems and I'm officially Paranormal Activity out and I dare them to change my mind! Overall to basically not show anything from the trailers is criminal and a bad trick to me and shows that the directors don't give a damn about the fans and thanks for ruining a potentially good horror sequel good job. Don't treat us fans like we are nothing we deserve better than this shame on you guys for lying to all of us and getting away with it and shame on me for believing it I'll learn my lesson for believing the hype! Don't waste a dime on this one! For once I believe the haters. I personally think they should be accountable for their false advertisement actions.".

There are a handful of scenes where you wonder why they'd actually film that. They don't detract from the whole.

The story was unbelievable but for those of us who never saw a believable story out of Hollywood it was just as real as a Gene Autry western. We enjoyed all genres and that meant Gene Autry and Dorothy Lamour equally. There were Frank Buck documentaries socalled that were hokier than anything the B movies presented and those too were very popular. Perhaps we should only judge those pictures in the context of the times they were presented. I would love to see The Jungle Princess again and revel in Ray Milland's revelation on the Johnny Carson show what he did in a swimming scene with Dorothy.".

	schema:reviewBody "An illogical and fairly routine Bpicture The Jungle Princess is know if at all for giving Dorothy Lamour her first big break. It lead to that image everybody has of her in a snug sarong and it led to superb films like The Hurricane. It's not surprising Dorothy is exquisitely beautiful even if the film she in is silly and stupid.Jungle Princess is not impossible to enjoyable unless you really true crave something deep and meaningful. This movie has all the formulaic plot devices neatly assembled and has all the usual lapses in logic. Like how did Dorothy raised by wild animals in the heart of the jungle manage to look like she was cranked through Busby Berkely's beauty machine with her perfect hair and makeup and clean neat sarong that she obviously didn't sew for herself.From what I remember Ulah Miss Lamour is raised by the jungle creatures since girlhood and has become part of Malasian folk lure long enough for a stodgy British hunter to run into her. The two of them fall in love and he sort of teaches her English. He also apparently shows her off screen how western boys and girls make love. Her pronunciation is a little off so when she calls him by name Chris she yells 'Kis Kis' and it sounds more like she's demanding one yet again from him. Her childlike mentality vanishes when she is mocked by her rival for Chris' affections and when her beloved tiger is nearly killed by the natives. A climactic raid on the village by oversized monkeys they appear to be attacking an elaborate model of the village ensures a happy and satisfying ending it also really must be seen to be believed.The audience I saw it with was interesting. A woman there probably in her late sixties mentioned to one of her fellow theater goers I was listening in that this was the first movie she remembered seeing. She still enjoyed it although she probably spotted more flaws with the picture than a little girl would in 1946. That instance gave me personally a slightly enhanced appreciation of the movie. I liked the film itself although for for both artistic and entertainment value one would be better off seeking out Lamour's next and much better south seas picture a truly great film The Hurricane. Viewing this film requires only that you leave your wellguarded sense of logic at the theater door.".

He displays the sort of childlike naivety that you would find in a woman from the Pacific Islands who is enchanted by a Western man. I'm not too sure if I believe it in the context of Malaysia but perhaps it's possible in 1935.I'm not particularly a Lamour fan and I never thought she was quite pretty in her films. However she is charming in this film and quite endearing.In terms of the story and the characters it didn't particularly impress me as I wasn't engaged at any level. It's just Lamour's performance and that lovesick puppy expression in her eyes when she looks at Milland that makes this film bearable.".
