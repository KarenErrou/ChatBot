Its a great story involving a woman with marital problems played superbly by Mia Farrow. Here Farrow gives one of her best performances much better than she was in a film i recently viewed called Shadows and Fog. Jeff Daniels is also good in his role as the movie character who comes into the real world as well as the actor who plays that role. This is by far one of the most complex yet well written Woody Allen flicks. All the performances are good as well as the direction and writing almost everything is perfect.

	schema:reviewBody "The Purple Rose of Cairo poetically defines what it means to love movies through the story of Cecilia an ordinary woman whose cinematic passion plays as a backandforth ticket to escape from the Great Depression literally.But this era also coincided with the Golden Age of Hollywood films  adventure movies romances screwball comedies or filmsnoir the decade started with an immediate transition from the silent era to the talkies allowing so many genres to finally emerge on the screen. And people came to see movies because of this constant capacity to surprise to create new worlds to become the ultimate escapism with a popular appeal incarnated by the magical opening image of Astaire and Rogers dancing Cheek to Cheek. Cinema is ordinary people living extraordinary moments.This is what loving movies is about and this translates Cecilia's obsession with films as a desperate need to forget about her lousy husband and her waitress' job two situations she handles with a poignant if not annoying clumsiness beautifully embodied by Mia Farrow's natural vulnerability. Cecilia like anyone can go to the movies but more than anyone she needs them. The only bits of enthusiasm in her voice and her eyes are hinted when she talks about movies and her shy heart suddenly becomes passionate only a movie lover can understand this weird state of constant amazement.Cecilia's endearing quality also is her poignant weakness as she uses movies to fantasize on improbable love stories the way women used to do with literary romances. Cecilia enjoys films in an old fashioned way not an intellectual appreciation or some sort of quest for a deep meaning. This is the nostalgic aspect of The Purple Rose of Cairo  an ode to these times where distraction and amusement were simple when people's eyes were easily amazed and their hearts easily thrilled when Cecilia needed to watch the titular film over and over again to forget about the job she just lost and the husband Danny Aiello she couldn't lose. In a way the film's atmosphere foreshadows the tone of Woody Allen's Radio Days with an extra fantasy element literally againCecilia indeed lives in a fantasy that spectacularly materializes on the pivotal moment where The Purple Rose hero emerges from the screen to finally meet her provoking a chaotic situation that none of the audience or the still onscreen characters can handle. And this is where Allen's genius writing emerges too when I applauded excited to see where would lead the romance between Cecilia and Tom Baxter the explorer played by the actor Gil Sheperd played by Jeff Daniels. And Allen's approach is subtly iconoclast in the way it totally denudes the characters by underlining the gap between their unreal qualities and the real world.First fascinated we start looking at them with very compassionate eyes. Tom is like a child impressed by this world his life freed from any script's diktat but whose journey with the prostitutes reveals him as an asexual character ... no money no sex no religion Baxter's Utopian background betrays the Disneylike innocence of these old movies and the deadend aspect of his realworld adventure. The irony is that he mirrors Cecilia's own condition as a woman with no job no money not even a sexual life so she would be living the same life with Tom but happily. So the process in reversed and Cecilia gets in the film to live with Tom in a world where the only colors inhabit Tom and Cecilia's hearts.But as much as we enjoy seeing the thoughtprovoking inventive script exploited to its core this part only reflects the dreamlike quality of the movies as illustrated in the most hilarious moment in the film when the restaurant maitre d' realizes he's allowed to do whatever he wants and starts a spectacular tap dance number. It reminded me of these lucid dreams where you allow yourself to go as far as you can movies are nothing but artistic lucid dreams after all. And the most delightful ones lead to the most painful wakes and I consider the script to be one of the best thanks to the genius idea of confronting Tom Baxter with Gil Shepherd who in an ironic twist pretends to be in love with Cecilia in his attempt to convince his alterego to get back to screen.What follows is a love triangle and a cruel dilemma for Cecilia torn between an unreal and a virtual reality virtual not as the opposite of real but of actual of Cecilia's current life. What is virtual is potential might happen and will happen and this is where Cecilia's fragile naivety conditions the sad conclusion of the film confirming that nothing in Allen's scripts is irrelevant. Cecilia chooses Gil over Tom Tom understanding real life's cruelty gets back onscreen and Gil to Hollywood after having accomplished his mission with Cecilia as a collateral heart's damage. Realizing her oneway ticket to Paradise was phony she sadly returns back to her husband who warned her that life was not like the movies. Allen just furnished the cynical proof.Cecilia was obsessed with unreal stuff while her heart was broken by something virtual because of her trust on a real man not a character this is the alibi for movies and Allen's ending with Cecilia enjoying again the sight of Astaire and Rogers proves that she doesn't blame it on the movies. The bittersweet last shot shows Cecilia as one of these poor souls not heroic in their acts but in their faith in humanity and people despite the encountered treacheries and deceptions the ending reminds of Night of Cabiria Fellini's masterpiece about another woman's heart victim of her own goodness.And despite all the hell Cecilia went through her illuminated eyes prove that with movies she'll always have her backandforth ticket for Heaven even for one short moment she'll feel she is in Heaven ...".

Cairo happens to be one of the best 80's movies Woody actually made  Crimes and Misdeameanours and Braodway Danny Rose being other greats.The reason why I think that Cairo is better than the other 80's efforts is that the idea is really inventive. The movie raises so many questions of reality and fantasy but does so in a highly surreal fashion. The switching of scenes from reality to fantasy movie made me realise where movies take us as a viewer. Cecelia finds solace in the world of movies and comes up against the decision of which is better  the perfect world of movie or reality where things are never certain.Jeff Daniels is so enigmatic in this movie. Not only as Tom the screen legend but as Gil the actor. Two very different characters both played brilliantly. Mia Farrow is great as usual and shows how broad her talent is Broadway Danny Rose and Radio Days  both very different characters. Danny Aiello is good as the lazy slobofahusband Monk.Like Radio Days Woody isn't actually on screen he narrated Radio Days mind and in a way this eased me up. Woody is fantastic when he is on screen but this film benefited from losing his neurotic nature and instead concentrated on the era the love of movies and the complex themes of a movie within a movie. I will admit some neurosis is retained in the dialogue talk of morality to prostitutes!  and this added to the surreal nature of the movie.This has to be one of my favourite films Woody has directed. Annie Hall probably being my fave Manhattan Crimes and Misdeamenours and Sleeper following. Cairo is so constantly fresh and inventive I couldn't help being captivated during it's short running time. I recommend this to any fan  or any lover of movies themselves. A real treat.".

This romantic fantasy tickles your funny bone and tugs at your heartstrings at the same time and I go through a myriad of emotions whenever I watch it. Mia Farrow stars as Celia a depression era housewife trapped in a dead end marriage to a pig Danny Aiello whose only escape comes from going to the movies. She goes to see the movie of the title several times and then at one show the main character in the movie played by Jeff Danielsspeaks to Celia directly from the screen saying You must really love this movie don't you? The character then walks off the screen and into Celia's life claiming that he loves her and wants to be with her forever. Meanwhile the actors in the movie on the screen are stuck and don't know what to do because they can't finish the movie without Daniels' character and they are seen conversing with each other about what to do and to the audience in the theater who for some reason sit and watch the actors on the screen trying to figure out what to do. Further complications arrive when the character starts walking off the screen in other theaters around the country and the actor who played the character also Daniels arrives in town to try to convince his character to go back in the movie. Woody doesn't delve into the territory of fantasy too much but this one totally works with one of his most intelligent screenplays and winning performances from Farrow and Daniels and the ending is a heartbreaker. A mustsee.".

Everything he took on whether it be romance comedy mockumentary or fantasy he managed with unparallelled panache and creativity.

One day whilst watching her favourite film for the fifth time one of the characters suddenly starts interacting with her and from there starts a chain of events that range from the absurd to the deeply touching handled in a way that only Woody Allen could pulloff.It may be easy for younger cineastes to underrate Woody Allen and his contribution to cinema based on the Lukewarm fare that is now attached to his name but for anyone curious about one the most inventive hilarious and brilliant film directors to have emerged in the entirety of cinema's history watching films like this one will reveal just how brilliant Woody Allen is at his best.This film is a meditation on the nature of existence reality and love reflecting on the merits of escapism versus the value of acceptance of reality whilst also being extremely entertaining and immensely original and creative.It should also be mentioned that Mia Farrow's performance is one of the most enchanting I have ever witnessed.

The Purple Rose... is wonderful is one if Allen's greats  a perfect combination of poignancy and humor romance and drama reality and fiction. It is the moviewithinthemovie that blends sophisticated romance from the lives of rich and beautiful where the dashing main hero with bravery and chivalry written into his character always gets a girl and Depression Era New York City where a poor waitress tries to escape the realities of her joyless life in the movie theater. The story focuses on Cecilia Mia Farrow a waitress and a battered wife of an unemployed abusive man Danny Aiello. Cecilia only feels alive when she watches her favorite movies that take her away from her dreary realities. One day as she watches Purple Rose of Cairo for the 10th or maybe 15th time the leading man Tom Baxter Jeff Daniels decides to leave the movie and be with Cecilia in real life. His screen partners are left confused and trapped in a scene they can't get out of. The live actor who plays Baxter is blamed by the film's producer for his character's rebellion and tries to get him back on the screen. Cecilia's husband finds out that his wife was seen with a good looking man instead of working as a babysitter in the evening. On the top of all Tom Baxters in other theaters try to leave Purple Rose of Cairo too... It is not the first or last time Allen has played with the concept of the thin line in this film the silver screen that divides film's world and reality but rarely has he created the film as sweet gentle sad technically realized and simply terrific as Purple Rose of Cairo.910".

	schema:reviewBody "There was a time when words could not be spoken out loud and blackandwhite cinematography overshadowed everythinf colour. I speak of course about the silent era of filmmaking back when a stillyoung Buster Keaton released the 45 minuteslong masterpiece entitled Sherlock Jr.Keaton's use of illusions and smart editing mesmerised the audiences creating one of the most important shortfilms ever made. Woody Allen one of the most significant filmmakers of alltime made his own version of Sherlock Jr. back in 1985 The Purple Rose Of Cairo.  The Purple Rose Of Cairo is not only a tribute given to the works of Buster Keaton but also to the art of filmmaking itself. Woody Allen is never shown on the screen in this magical piece of cinema but we can feel his presence everywhere. It's within the story the script or better said the reel. We simply know he's there even though we can't see him. The plot is simple an everyday woman escapes everyday problems including a notsocaring husband played by Danny Aiello by going to the cinema. She already watched The Purple Rose of Cairo for about 4 times but that doesn't stop her from watching it the 5th time when one of the characters Tom Baxter played by Jeff Daniels is so impressed by how much she likes the movie that he jumps off the screen and runs away with her out of the cinema. Things go a little crazy of course no story that plays with reality is simple. But what Woody Allen tries to tell us is that fantasy is just as important as reality itself and it can help us remain sane. How many times have you said that one single book film or even song saved your day? That's the power fantasy has on us. The Purple Rose Of Cairo is probably on of the most delightful films a cinephile could ever watch. It's beautifully crafted funny romantic and it has a lovely cast. It's not only the Sullivan's Travells of the 80's and Woody Allen's Sherlock Jr. it represents the reason why we watch films and when you'll get to the final scene you'll know what I mean.".

Set in New Jersey during the great depression of the 1930's Mia Farrow plays Cecilia a film aficionado and broken housewife. Recently her marriage has since turned into a considerable disaster and she finds herself in frequent disagreement with her outofwork abusive and even womanizing husband Monk Danny Aiello.Too afraid to be on her own she naturally finds escape at the local cinema where she sits upon hours in admiration of the actors on screen and the lives in which their characters live. When the theater first features the film entitled The Purple Rose of Cario Cecilia finds herself enamored by the film and its subsequent character Tom Baxter Jeff Daniels. The following day while at work as a waitress she finds herself distracted from the mere memory of the feature and due to the nature of her reverie is there upon fired for her demeanor. She later frequents the film over and again and it is not until the happening of one her later viewings perhaps the sixth time over that her presence attracts the attention of Tom Baxter causing him to come offscreen and appear before her and all others in the theater.As he confesses his attraction toward her together the two run off as the audience and too the characters on screen as if suddenly viable actors taking part in play remain caught in panic and awe. Word soon spreads that a character in a feature film has walked off screen discovering the realworld. Not unexpectedly the news spreads quickly to ears of the film's producer Raoul Hirsch and the actor who portrays Tom Baxter Gil Shepherd Jeff Daniels. Mr. Hirsch's objective here is to stop the mass running of his picture to cease any further occurrences that share semblance and potential lawsuits. Gil Shepherd finds himself frightened at the thought of losing his growing popularity due to what crimes he believes the character he created his essential double for all intensive purposes may be out committing.Cecelia You're Breaking My Heart Mia Farrow's interpretation of Cecilia is simply charming. It is with such perfection that she plays the role of this lonely nave romantic in search of change. Her lamenting disposition and reserved attitude together truly make her irresistible to any viewer and impossible for one not to feel sympathetic toward her plight.Jeff Daniels does as well a marvelous job as both Tom Baxter and Gil Shepherd. He very well may be amongst Hollywood's underrated.Film as a World of its Own The Purple Rose of Cairo presents yet another interesting aspect in the sense that Allen depicts the world on the theater screen as a world entirely of its own and it is! Cecelia mentions over and again her desire for a world similar to the depictions on screen and it is with a high degree of craft that Allen creates that so sought after world. The scene in the picture itself when Tom Baxter leaves can no longer move forward or backward but must remain in place.

Their world of routine has since been interrupted and they are left in a state of restlessness and wait for there is nothing more they desire than to continue their life of pattern. One character even mentions excitedly how he is a dramatic character and needs forward motion while another mentions the fear he has of the screen going black. In their impatience others pass time arbitrarily by poking jokes at the audience. As a whole these sequences make for brilliant satire that only Allen could write.Tom Baxter leaves the picture and enters the realworld where he remains no longer a victim of repetitiveness. Moviegoers however enthusiastic wish to enter the very world of a Hollywood picture in the hope of escaping theirs.The two worlds do exist and perhaps are separate equals but after all what is a life without the movies? What is a life without wanting to or even having an escape even if only for a little while?

It is here in Allen's piece that Cecilia falls too in deep affection toward the actor who portrays Tom Baxter. He is certainly a man of a great many faults no doubt but an artist no less and more importantly the man who gave life to Tom Baxter. It is such that Cecilia finds herself amidst the grand decision of choosing reality or fantasy for her ultimate happiness.One Sentence Summary The Purple Rose of Cairo is a fantastic probing piece of cinema in which through comedic romantic tones great acting and of course music leaves the viewer appreciating cinema that much more than what was once before.".

	schema:headline " One of five bonafide Woody Allen masterworks.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Purple Rose of Cairo shows us just how vital a filmmaker Woody Allen is when removed from the bumbling neurotic caricature who often overwhelms the broader aspects of his work. Along with Love and Death Annie Hall Crimes and Misdemeanours and Bullets Over Broadway The Purple Rose... is a bonafide masterpiece one of the greatest American films of the last fifty years and further proof that Allen is a filmmaker equal to the more celebrated likes of Coppola Spielberg Kubrick Scorsese et al. Like those films aforementioned Purple Rose demonstrates that Allen can take on board the influence of European cinema and combine it with a style of his own creating a film that relies heavily on character and conversation and yet is totally enjoyable and occasionally very funny.The script is really one of Allen's best combining a great and imaginative story with intelligent characters and believable scenarios... while the whole thing is made just that little more enchanting through the evocative recreation of depression era New Jersey and the mannered though no less impressive directorial flourishes from Allen. The cast is perfect too managing to bring Allen's world to life as well as presenting us with a believable emotional centre on which the director can navigate the more elaborate elements of the plot. Farrow has never been better as the putupon dreamer swept up in her love of cinema and in particular her dashing leading man in the making Gil Shepherd. As a result the entire film from almost the first frame to the last can be seen as a treatise on the idea of escape and escapism and how these ideas correlate with Farrow's character Cecilia who whilst attempting to escape from her life of drudgery work and her cheating husband becomes infatuated with Shepherd's latest film also called The Purple Rose of Cairo and his character Tom Baxter a fearless adventurer cast adrift in the complicated world of New York's glittering social milieu.Allen's script like his later film Crimes and Misdemeanours is full of selfreference and contains many different layers that compliment the more obvious elements of the script perfectly. For example Allen plays with the idea of mirroring having a character within the film brought out of their natural habitat and into a world that is completely alien. This is again referenced later when the same character Tom Baxter is brought out of that environment for a second time and dragged into the real world. Later Cecilia is taken back into the film within the film on an adventure that mirrors the real life adventure the pair had previously been caught up in before the third component of the story Gil is brought into the world of Cecilia... a place that is completely alien to his world of mansions film premieres and celebrity parties!! These elements might sound confusing within the context of a review however the way Allen so casually places them within the plot is amazing. He never lets his ideas dwarf the story at hand keeping the focus on the characters whilst simultaneously playing a number of subtle games around them.The concept of fictional characters invading the world of the living and viceversa is never fully explained so really it requires a great leap of faith and a little suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience to really buy into the 'deeper' aspects of the film. As a result I think the film can be interpreted on two different levels... either the whole thing is just a series of unexplainable phenomenon making The Purple Rose of Cairo a fantasy film as enchanting as Who Framed Roger Rabbit or E.T. or the whole thing can be seen as a figment of Cecilia's imagination. The film ends in such a way that Allen seems to be suggesting that none of these events ever took place... creating a circular narrative that makes it easy for us to see the journey that the character has supposedly undertaken to be completely redundant something that has merely destroyed her faith in the world more so than before and perhaps left her even more desperate to experience the warming glow and friendly familiarity of the nearest cinema screen.As well as Farrow in the lead there is fine support from Jeff Daniels as the exuberant character Tom Baxter and his bemused and frantic cinematic creator Gil  who manages to give the film a sense of heart but also a bitter undercurrent  as well as small roles for Danny Aiello and Allen regular Diane Wiest. There's also some nice cameos from Edward Herrmann Van Johnson Zo Caldwell and Milo O'Shea as some of Tom's bewildered supporting characters left to sit and literally chew the scenery as they find themselves without their pivotal lead player. The ending might be a little too downbeat for some... not wanting to give too much away but Alan does have a tendency to leave his characters high and dry sacrificing the feel good factor in favour of some important life lessons and the intrusion of reallife's cynical streak.Regardless The Purple Rose of Cairo is a fantastic film... one that draws you in with it's subtle and believable characterisations and eventually takes you completely by surprise with the deep emotional resonance of the plot. For me it's one of Allen's masterpieces and is proof that along with Bullets Over Broadway that he doesn't need to be in the film to deliver solid entertainment. It's certainly not as light as say Love and Death Annie Hall or Broadway Danny Rose but it is lighter than the likes of Interiors Another Woman and Manhattan. As a result it'll probably appeal to the kind of people who don't normally appreciate Allen's particular blend of cinema but really regardless of personal tastes this is a fantastic film.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the Depression Cecilia escapes her dreadful life and abusive husband by going to the same movie again and again. And little does she know that while she is watching the movie the movie is also watching her particularly Tom Baxter the star of the movie. And in the manner that Cecilia longs to escape into the focus of her own voyeurism so too does Tom longs to escape into the focus of his to break out of movie into reality so he can be with Cecilia.Their voyeuristic objects are just inverted. She's watching the screen completely unwitting that she is being watched. And he is watching out voyeuristically relishing her voyeurism knowing she does not realize his ogling. As a result Woody Allen creates yet an extra metaphysical tier of voyeurism between his own film and us. We too the watchers watching the film are made conscious of our own standpoint and our own urge to bond with the focus of our attention.It's as if the visual stare is so compelling as to be essentially boundless and infallible. God and film are equated. Tom can't fathom the things of the real world but when Cecilia attempts to explain God to him Tom equates the description of God with the filmmakers who made his movie. Everything considered the filmmakers conceived him as a character. They decide the plot of his reality and they are the conclusive judges of his existence.Together with this interpretation of unlimited voyeurism one also sees aspects of Woody's artistic and creative moral code. By the end Cecilia has been obligated to decide between her real life and going into the movie eternally she must decide between reality and fantasy to be eternally entrenched within the affectedly artful universe of fantasy where she can become what she wants live her dreams and command her fate. But then what is reality if you can indeed control that much?When Woody every so often makes a movie that departs from his usual formula I'm doubly pleased. The Purple Rose of Cairo is one of the most brilliantly weaved and most original stories I've ever seen on film. It doesn't even just stop at the inventive and inspired premise. The film manages to arouse every emotion.

	onyx:emotionText "During the Depression Cecilia escapes her dreadful life and abusive husband by going to the same movie again and again. And little does she know that while she is watching the movie the movie is also watching her particularly Tom Baxter the star of the movie. And in the manner that Cecilia longs to escape into the focus of her own voyeurism so too does Tom longs to escape into the focus of his to break out of movie into reality so he can be with Cecilia.Their voyeuristic objects are just inverted. She's watching the screen completely unwitting that she is being watched. And he is watching out voyeuristically relishing her voyeurism knowing she does not realize his ogling. As a result Woody Allen creates yet an extra metaphysical tier of voyeurism between his own film and us. We too the watchers watching the film are made conscious of our own standpoint and our own urge to bond with the focus of our attention.It's as if the visual stare is so compelling as to be essentially boundless and infallible. God and film are equated. Tom can't fathom the things of the real world but when Cecilia attempts to explain God to him Tom equates the description of God with the filmmakers who made his movie. Everything considered the filmmakers conceived him as a character. They decide the plot of his reality and they are the conclusive judges of his existence.Together with this interpretation of unlimited voyeurism one also sees aspects of Woody's artistic and creative moral code. By the end Cecilia has been obligated to decide between her real life and going into the movie eternally she must decide between reality and fantasy to be eternally entrenched within the affectedly artful universe of fantasy where she can become what she wants live her dreams and command her fate. But then what is reality if you can indeed control that much?When Woody every so often makes a movie that departs from his usual formula I'm doubly pleased. The Purple Rose of Cairo is one of the most brilliantly weaved and most original stories I've ever seen on film. It doesn't even just stop at the inventive and inspired premise. The film manages to arouse every emotion. It's hilarious it's romantic it's heartbreaking.In all The Purple Rose of Cairo is one of the most effective movies I have ever seen in stimulating one's sense of imagination and fantasy. I'm getting corny and about now is where I realize that there's nothing else specific that I can substantially comment on. I mean the acting is great the camerawork is fine et cetera.

This is the pivotal moment of the film. This level of meta could quite easily lose it's audience. Thankfully Jeff Daniels sincere delivery of the line and scene all together completely sells this plot turn. So when he eventually escapes from the cinema screen it feels believable. The fact that the audience is readily accepting of this level of absurdity is a testament to Allen's fantastic writing. The film is also one of his best looking films. The setcostume design is excellent and makes the time period in the film look authentic.The film contains fantastic performances across the board. However it's Farrows and Daniels on screen chemistry that is the highlight of the film. They are both incredibly sweet and likable together without it ever coming across as feeling overblown. The Purple Rose of Cairo is a wonderfully crafted film that in the hands of lesser skilled directors could of easily gone awry. Allen manages to create an endearing and poignant film that takes pleasure in it's retrospective look at classic Hollywood and what makes cinema so magical. From the moment I saw the RKO title card at the beginning of the fictional film I was instantly won over. This film is Woody Allen at his best.".

She brings such adorability and sweetness to this poor little waitress at the same time infusing her with such humanity and believability that it seems no wonder that a movie character would want to descend from the screen to meet her. And as that character Jeff Daniels is charming and hilariously innocent his goofy scenes acclimating to the 'real world' are amongst the funniest in the film. Daniels also does a fine job in the part of the actor who plays Tom in the 'real world'.But Woody Allen's screenplay is the real star of the show. Bright and inventive it sucks in the viewer in a manner similar to the way Cecilia comes to be sucked into the motion picture within the film. It introduces a world where the inexplicable and magical can occur without explanation  which only makes it all the more wondrous  and is chockfull of memorable quotes and sequences. Allen brilliantly satirizes Hollywood movie conventions and in the close of the film makes a poignant and sobering comment on the line between fantasy and reality that may not be to everyone's tastes but which elevates this movie from simple escapism to greatness.From the start even unto its bittersweet conclusion The Purple Rose of Cairo is a fascinating delight not to be missed.".

	schema:headline " Better than the critics say";
	schema:reviewBody "Like the reviews overseasAustralian critics have generally snubbed this film as bland and contrived with some nasties regarding Russell's accent and wooden comedy delivery.I thoroughly enjoyed this intoxicating film which I agree has its faults however it succeeded in its core themes of lovefriendship and beauty as being central to a well lived life.I feel Crowe does a good job as Max an arrogant and ruthless bonds dealer who inherits a chteau from his Uncle HenryFinney. Initially interested in how much money this can make circumstances necessitate a longer stay whereby Max begins to recall his many enjoyable Summers spent with his Uncle at the Provenal chteau.Marion Cotillard provides the love interest as the beautiful and tempestuous Dark French girl and young Aussie star Abbie Cornish contrasts as the fair blond Californian beauty who is Henry's illegitimate daughter. Both perform well though I know Cornish is much more capable than this role requires.The movie is a little uneven at times as Max learns his lesson on what is truly important in life.Sometimes the comedy is light sometimes slapstick and all this juxtaposed with some sentimentality and more serious moments. Most of the characters are contrived from Max through to the peasant French verniers. However in spite of this the story unfolds in a believable way and the photography is stunning as you would expect of the Province and Scott.The women are gorgeous the wine looks delicious and the food makes you salivate. It succeeds in its attempt to seduce and makes one a little sad to return to suburbia as I did.Finallyon Crowe.I feel there are many critics who love to pan Crowe. It has become the fashion.How he missed out on a nomination for Cinderella Man is beyond me.Though he would not have beaten Hoffman or Phoenix. He is obviously still anathema in Hollywood and to many critics a man they love to hate because he is simply not liked.One critic criticised him in this film because he was unlikeable but surely that was the point! At least he is an actor who acts. I mean Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant and Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise.But with Crowe he always plays his character.And a good job he does once more.All in all 7 12 out of 10.And definitely more delicious on the big screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is definitely the first time I have gone to see an Russell Crowe andor Ridley Scott film at the cinema fully bracing myself to be disappointed and...I am very pleased to be able to say that I enjoyed it thoroughly. It has a very warming glow to it  beautifully played gorgeously shot. Anyone who isn't just a little bit seduced by Provence after seeing it needs their head or more likely their heart examining. The lessons may well have been taught in a hundred films before but that doesn't make them any less relevant or resonant for the commercial era in which many of us now live...So why the terrible reviews? I really don't know. The comedy was not overplayed in the way implied by the critics at all. To be blunt it was not really necessary as the warmth and effectiveness of the film and story lies in the romantic drama. The comedy is fine but doesn't really add anything to the film. However it does give it a very upbeat cheerful and likable feel and maybe that is reason enough.Max's character and Russell Crowe's performance? It's in the quieter moments where Crowe really excels and shows just why someone would want to cast him as opposed to say Hugh Grant in a film like this. His reactions to memories and the things that other characters do and say are just so much deeper and more real than Grant is capable of which is why Grant always comes off as the same character in these films a variation on the Grant formula and Max comes off as real.It almost seems as though the critics have a film with this plot pegged into a box because they can only see and can only expect to see a Hugh Grant characterisation they cannot accept anything other than a Hugh Grant characterisation. Whereas the actual reason that Crowe doesn't come off as Hugh Grant is because he isn't channelling that kind of characterisation at all. This is a very different kind of film.Also the critics seem to be completely off the mark in assessing the character when they say that he starts off a bastard and ends a bastard too. Actually this is far more about unearthing other qualities  not completely rejecting those 'bastard' qualities that he begins the film with but refining and diluting them as he becomes more and more adjusted to his past. He doesn't change he opens his heart and mind to qualities that he has been ignoring within himself. You can see that other Max from the moment he opens the letter telling him Henry is dead  but he tries to resist the feelings that are clearly there in large part because he doesn't want to face the fact that he has let his Uncle down  and all of the guilt that is allied with that.The film is not the best film I have ever seen. The questions it asks are fairly fundamental but they aren't startling or especially thought provoking.But the film is highly enjoyable from start to finish and it's warm something that is pretty rare in films these days.So to end clearly I am not in tune with the critics  but then increasingly that seems to be the case nowadays. I just think that I see completely different films to them...".

	schema:reviewBody "A Good Year is much like Peter Mayle's other books  shortish picturesque sometimes mouthwatering generally light and definitely charming.To that end this film does the book excellent justice and even manages to make the cinematic transition without losing or adding much in the process. Max has however become a blend of Wall Street's Gordon Gecco and Capt. Aubrey  a cold power hungry cutthroat exterior with a bit of a romantic hedonist hiding a Depardieulike charming buffoon locked inside. Sir Ridley Scott makes it clear that the real star here is the Provencal countryside in all of its golden sun soaked glory. Russell is the fulcrum that moves us from one beautiful scene to the next lightly shuffling and dancing in oversized pajamas with a suit jacket and a tie for a belt.And oddly this isn't necessarily a bad thing.As obvious as the story line is both in the book and the film it remains absolutely charming and Crowe's performance is an essential part of what makes it work hammy or no. He looks great and his trust in Scott as a director allows him to simply have fun here  a nice break from all of the heavy and often heavy handed Oscar bait biopics he's pigeonholed himself into recently.The rest of the cast is picture perfect. I've been waiting to see when Freddie Highmore would play a young Russell and he's lovely here big eyed and gracefully gawky as young Max. He holds his own against Albert Finney's lovingly blustery Uncle Henry. Marion Cotillard is gorgeous as Fanny and also sturdy enough to hold her own against both Max and Crowe himself. Abbie Cornish is pretty and sweet and her American accent is damn near perfect. Isabelle Candelier is a colorful counterpoint to Max's stuffy British ways but it is Didier Bourdon who nearly walks away with the picture. His is a character we haven't seen done a million times before and whose eyes hint at a story equal in richness to the Chteau itself. Archie Panjabi is Max's assistant a character created for the film. As the all knowing and mischievously wicked Gemma she appears ready to run away with this picture. And as always watch for a cameo by Ridley Scott's longtime partner Gianina Facio  I won't spoil your fun by telling you where she appears. Again there is nothing new or groundbreaking here. It will be compared to Under the Tuscan Sun and a long history of countless other films of this nature  an attractive woman or handsome bastard gets in touch with who they really are gets back to basics and becomes who they were always meant to be.Forgive me for taking this path but the winefilm comparisons are inevitable with this one.Like most of the films made today the fresh elements in this film come from the particular vision of the film maker the chemistry of the cast and the way all of it can come together in a charming and palatable fashion. In other words the blending of the key ingredient's.It all comes down to being a matter of chemistry craftsmanship and preference. Chemistry causes the grape to ferment and become wine. Craftmanship and experience make that wine something worth drinking. Chemistry amongst the elements of a film  story cast and setting makes these pieces form a cohesive whole. Craftsmanship and experience make it a palatable film.And the rest is simply a matter of taste.Though it lacks the crisp originality of a sauvignon blanc the hipness of a pinot grigio or the bold edginess of a Cabernet but the elements here come together to make a film that plays pleasantly over the tongue like a decent rose  easy to sip and enjoy and given the chance could well leave you with the warm glow of a late summer afternoon.But enough with the wine clichs! You could easily take advantage of the value of a matine or opt to wait for DVD though neither will do the scenery justice. This sweetly charming film will hold up equally well as a date movie a mid week escape or something that you can take Mom to.Worth a look.Roo's Reviews".

	schema:reviewBody "Food tastes better there. The women are naturally beautiful. Walks are more romantic. Wine is more complex... but life is less so. France can turn good memories into grand ones. It replaces currency with passion. It replaces accumulation with appreciation.I believe the above statement to be very true. France is among the loveliest countries that I've ever been privileged to visit. If they had ESPN I'd consider moving there. So when I heard that Ridley Scott was directing Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard in a film about a moneyhungry British stockbroker who is lured into giving it all up for an inherited French vineyard I thought it would be right up my alley.To be honest the film is so far up my alley that I felt my dreams were being violated. I cannot imagine a life more pleasurable than one spent living in a chteau overlooking my own vineyard waking up every morning to the glorious sensation of Marion Cotillard's morning breath. I'm practically orgasmic at that idea.A Good Year is a crystal glass filled to the brim with 1982 Chteau Margaux... but unfortunately diluted by some city tap water.As mentioned before I loved the premise. The cast is equal to the task. The cinematography is only enhanced by the country's natural canvas. The music is eclectic and joyful ranging from old standards to a traditional uptempo score to the modern energy of tracks like Alizee's Moi Lolita  which was oddly not chosen to play upon the arrival of a certain character. Nevertheless...Everything about this film is a deliciously prepared meal... on a paper plate. The plate in this case is a flimsy script that brushes over too many details cannot maintain its tone for more than a scene or two reaches for grandeur without ever attaining it and presumes its audience is naive and unworldly.There are just too many scenes in this film that demanded more time and effort. Characters fall in love too easily. Massive decisions are taken too lightly. The tone shifts uncomfortably from romantic to slapstick to tragic to wistful to sarcastic. It all just felt a little forced. Screenwriter Marc Klein seems to be trying too hard. And Ridley Scott seems rushed as though the studio demanded a running time under two hours.It is a shame really because the film has greatness in it... but they uncorked the bottle before it had time to mature.Russell Crowe is relentlessly reliable on screen. He rarely if ever gives even a mediocre performance. It is no wonder that he is so highly regarded. I just thought that his character Max Skinner too obvious was written so twodimensionally as to handcuff his immense talent. I also thought his English accent was a little too mate blimey bllocks bgger tally ho  If you know what I mean.Marion Cotillard is typically brilliant as Fanny Chenal the glorious vision of a waitress from the nearby town. She gives the film and Max some heart and soul. She is a fiery French lass with shampoocommercial hair and skin that makes silk seem like sandpaper. I can't get enough of this actress. She is the visual equivalent of Pringles... once you pop you can't stop.Relative newcomer Abbie Cornish is also very impressive here. Again her character like all the others is somewhat underwritten. She deserved much more screen time. However this critic is 100 sure that she will have tons of screen time in many major films over the next decade or so. She is a future star with talent and beauty in equal measures.A Good Year may remind many of the similar Diane Lane adventure from the female perspective Under the Tuscan Sun. The main difference aside from the sex of the protagonist is that Tuscan decided from the getgo that it was going to be a lighthearted romantic comedy. I think that the screenplay for A Good Year got a little confused along the way. Sometimes it aims higher... and that is when it works the best. Other times it aims lower... and that is when it dwindles into lame slapstick comedy. If it had maintained a lofty romantic tone it may have been one of the best films of the year. As it stands it is a merely a nice film with a pleasant message. Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com".

Tho not an exact replica of the book it is based more on a story line running thru Crowe's and Marion's characters. The emphasis being on Crowe's character finding out what is truly meaningful in his very hectic supercharged rather non ethical life. He rediscovers what he is missing i.e. love trust and friendships.A Great date movie. The local scenery should definitely be seen on the big screen and not on a DVD! Tho not Oscar caliber it is why most film goers go to the movies pure entertainment and escapism. Ridley and Crowe have achieved that goal. A Great date movie and worth the price of admission".

He rediscovers what he is missing i.e. love trust and friendships.A Great date movie. The local scenery should definitely be seen on the big screen and not on a DVD! Tho not Oscar caliber it is why most film goers go to the movies pure entertainment and escapism. Ridley and Crowe have achieved that goal. A Great date movie and worth the price of admission";

His recent appearances on the TV promotional circuit have proved this once again. Those who only know his films since LA Confidential for the most part focus on his ability to capture and project power strength and inner turmoil. Those who have seen his films such as Proof For the Moment Love In Limbo and The Sum of Us have seen his ability to show the gentler funnier and often more uncertain sides of the human experience. I would also argue that these are readily seen in his films such as The Insider A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. A Good Year is a wonderful return to the Russell of those earlier films. Like a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie you know just where it's likely going to take you but with such lovely engaging people in such a wonderful setting you just want to enjoy the trip. And so you shall. What a refreshing change from the overheated oversexed over special effected and over bloodied fare that Hollywood usually dishes out. Thank you so much Mr. Crowe and Mr. Scott for my little vacation in the South of France!".

A good friend of mine that came along was thrilled with the views and landscapes and caught up with the dramatic plot despite having a distinct preference for action flicks. Speaking of which here's a chance to give a little tip for the guys although this is generally referred to as a chick flick the screen is filled with the presence of 2 beautiful women throughout the film. Watch out for the young Abbie Cornish who appears in a brief nude sequence so don't blink and for the arousing french actress Marion Cotillard as Crowe's love interest throughout the film.As it's title may imply A Good Year is just that a good film by Ridley Scott. It's tone reminded me of Scott's Matchstick Men and it's premise is similar to Under the Tuscan Sun. Nonetheless despite the similarities Scott managed to create something new and different in this movie muchly thanks to it's rich plot vivid characters and breathtaking landscape that build up an enchanting European atmosphere that allows you to wander off to France for some enjoyable 118 minutes.The plot follows Maximillian Skinner Crowe a young and bright manager in the British stock market that has low morals which bring him high financial results. He's cocky and arrogant and like all characters that appear in films of this nature his life is about to change dramatically. This occurs one sunny day when he finds out his Uncle Henry Albert Finney who appears in flashbacks throughout the film has passed away and left him his heritage a vineyard in Provence France. Skinner immediately realizes the financial value of the property and boards the first plane to the colorful valley. Arriving there he is filled with childhood memories through which we see Henry teaching his young oprhan nephew Max Freddy Highmore Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the values of life. Meanwhile the plot thickens when a young attractive American girl arrives claiming she's Henry's long lost daughter and posing a threat to Henry's inheritance. When problems at work force him into a forlonged leaf of absence he falls in love with a local French woman and starts unveiling the secrets of the vineyard.I gave it 8 out of 10 for it is a good way to spend a matine or an evening with your partner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this fantasy of cashing out to live a life of food wine sex and sunlit idleness in Provence you don't suspend disbelief for a minute. Right at the outset we are shown that Russell Crowe's character is exactly what his beloved uncle calls him when he cheats at chess as a boy  a little st. Now grown up he enjoys making money by cheating not so much for the money though that's nice too but for the sheer pleasure of dominating others by being smarter tougher and more ruthless than they are. Since he's surrounded by agreeably available women in London the movie tries to make a running joke of flashes and cleavage shots it is clear that he needn't sleep alone. Nothing Crowe does makes us believe that he is less than perfectly satisfied with the life he leads or that he would give it up to take up with a Provencal girl and contendedly guzzle home grown wine on the terrace. Nothing convinces that he and she are made for each other or that she should see him as anything but a good looking rich foreigner who'll be an enjoyable but shortlived roll in the hay. Because Crowe's boss writes him a thumping severance check when he turns down a partnership and leaves the firm his choice is too easy to be interesting. His buddy the real estate agent has it right. After six months he'll be bored to death up to his ears in some financial shenanigan and probably fooling around on his honey just to prove to himself that he can get away with it.The subplot with the American cousin never gets its feet untangled because the conflict between them over who deserves the property and what to do with it isn't fully developed. She's supposed to be smarter tougher and more knowledgeable about wine than her youth and good looks indicate but she doesn't get to do very much with those qualities. Crowe's character can't stand losing. It would have deepened him and explained his change of life to have this kid see through him take him on and beat him at his own game. It would have been a more dramatically satisfying romance to have him try to seduce her fail and then fall in love and have to win her. The film hints at those possibilities and immediately backs away.There's a lot else wrong with the picture. We never feel that Crowe is actually in serious trouble over the financial maneuver that gets him suspended for a week because he never acts like a man who's job is on the line. There are a number of pointless sexual innuendos involving secondary characters that don't go anywhere except perhaps the cutting room floor. The rental car foul up is formulaic not credible and therefore not funny. The smack at a couple of clueless American tourists with Southern accents is smug gratuitous and irritating. Albert Finney's role of Bacchus as an English gentleman gone native is written by the numbers and phoned in on screen. The flashback structure allows Scott to pull out of the hat whatever rabbits he needs to keep the plot moving like Crowe's childhood ability to imitate his uncle's handwriting and his one childhood encounter with the woman he falls in love with. That actress by the way is too young for a character whom we learn is about the same age as Crowe.The only really enjoyable performance is Archie Panjabi who played Parminder Nagra's older sister in Bend It Like Beckham as Crowe's hip all knowing secretary. Her work I'd like to see more of.Bottom line is that this is an unsuccessful variant on the formula High Pressure Guy Finds Self And Love In Laid Back Town. Cars and Doc Hollywood did it better. The Luberon region photographs beautifully but that's it.".

The rental car foul up is formulaic not credible and therefore not funny. The smack at a couple of clueless American tourists with Southern accents is smug gratuitous and irritating. Albert Finney's role of Bacchus as an English gentleman gone native is written by the numbers and phoned in on screen. The flashback structure allows Scott to pull out of the hat whatever rabbits he needs to keep the plot moving like Crowe's childhood ability to imitate his uncle's handwriting and his one childhood encounter with the woman he falls in love with. That actress by the way is too young for a character whom we learn is about the same age as Crowe.The only really enjoyable performance is Archie Panjabi who played Parminder Nagra's older sister in Bend It Like Beckham as Crowe's hip all knowing secretary. Her work I'd like to see more of.Bottom line is that this is an unsuccessful variant on the formula High Pressure Guy Finds Self And Love In Laid Back Town. Cars and Doc Hollywood did it better. The Luberon region photographs beautifully but that's it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first time director Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe paired together they made the award winning Gladiator and perhaps surprised folks that a mainstream action movie could snag the best picture Oscar. Here they come together again for a pretty feel good movie but I don't expect that this would win any major honours. Not that it's a bad film but it's quite vanilla plain that you could guess every other step of how the narrative and plot will unfold.Based on a book by Peter Mayle A Good Year has plenty of life references to wine and vineyards made as a comparison and reminder on how to live life. It's quite unlike Sideways which was more of a road trip movie and had its plot revolve around wine. A Good Year has its revolve around an arse hole of a character Maximillian Skinner Russell Crowe the successful bond trader everyone loves to hate given his ruthless knack on the trading bourses and making loads of obscene money.So he learns that he had inherited a chteau in France the same one he had spent his childhood little Max played by Freddie Highmore summer holidays in with his Uncle Henry Albert Finney but instead the first thing that crosses his mind is how much is it worth should he sell it?It's a look at how you want to live life making loads of money versus living it out with plenty of heart and love. Love for the people who once made a difference to your life and love and appreciation of life itself. Time to stop and smell the roses versus the corporate rat race filled with backstabbing and office politics. And naturally when finding out about oneself a look back at one's roots will always be a good way to start.There are a number of sub plots weaved into the movie like the sudden appearance of a possible illegitimate cousin Christie Abbie Cornish who could complicate matters of inheritance of the opposition of resident vineyard caretaker Francis Didier Bourdon and of course romance in the form of a feisty French woman Fanny Marion Cotillard amongst others. There's also a bit about the different wine standards thrown in which serves only to confuse rudimentarily. There's a ring of familiarity to these characters and at a glance you would probably be able to guess the parts they play to develop the story as do the little nagging business bits in the movie but by making all these threads come together and certain plot devices as well only served to deliver up to expectations in an all's well that ends well.Some random thoughts  I loved the song by Alizee used in the movie and quite surprised that it actually made it other than just be featured in the trailer. The movie also turned out to be quite the technological showcase at least in the beginning accompanying Max's progressive change. You have GPS and almost an ad feel to Max's use of his PDA phone for calls photo taking the whole works. And if you think Crowe's outfits looked snazzy yes he's outfitted by Armani.The very first time I took notice of Russell Crowe was when he played the villain in Virtuosity. Back then I thought that the guy had something going for him. And I've been convinced having watched his last 6 movies that he's a pretty fine actor though his buffed and gruff demeanour had the tabloids highlighting his every shenanigan. Albert Finney and Freddie Highmore make a good pairing as well given their limited screen time as the Uncle and his young nephew spending summer together. And don't get me started on the eye candy who well remain eye candy for the most parts.A Good Year runs on an even keel and feels light by the time it ends. Let's hope the next collaboration between Scott and Crowe in American Gangster with the addition of Denzel Washington who played opposite Crowe in Virtuosity will be something more explosive.Winning's not everything it's the only thing!  Maximillian Skinner".

	schema:headline " Crap d'rhone  this 2006 vintage certainly leaves a bitter taste.";
	schema:reviewBody "A Good Year is a film predominantly set in France made by somebody who doesn't appear to understand the first thing about France nor indeed French people nor indeed English people or England  nor indeed comedy and had the film been made by anyone else other than someone with a track record as good as Ridley Scott nor even narrative. This is not a good film  a piece here refusing to depict anything intricate or subtle this is an aggressive film the worst possible comedy one can come across an 'international' comedy that has been made with the widest possible audience in mind flush with stars and a poorly thought through 'tourist' aesthetic which plagues proceedings throughout. As far as CroweScott combinations go this is one of the more exasperating.At its core is actually an interesting idea about someone stuck in a very stoic very specific life of hardline rhetoric whose ignorance to other people and cultures is challenged when by chance they find themselves abroad. How the film goes about depicting such a thing is laughable to say the least but not in the way that arrives via a good comedy. The lead is a certain Max Skinner played by Russell Crowe. When we observe the earliest part of a point in Max's life we see him spending carefree summers with his uncle in the south of France summers of which include the briefest of moments of wine tasting and games of tennis and chess in the sun. Cut to years later and London has replaced France Cognac has replaced wine and a sharp metallic greyed out office in the Gherkin building has replaced messing about in life. Max is a trader and a good one at that. His insistence on competition winning and daring to cheat during those aforementioned chess matches has carried over into his job a job that allows him to be someone who abuses the system in ways that are perfectly legal that often results in the making of lots of money. Feared and respected in equal measure by his peers Max is the boss of his surroundings.Hark for time away from his luxurious apartment successful job and cold characterless cutthroat surroundings are challenged when a trip back to Southern France rears up out of the fact his dear old uncle has died and left Max the house. Wary that should he go someone could usurp him as is the tradition in the field of trading Max is sceptical but is convinced by coworkers that it will be good for him. Cue comedy and the fishoutofwater content suddenly kicks in as this toughasnails trader ends up in a zone that is the polar opposite to what he's used to. Where films such as Brick Lane and The Namesake have depicted people of such varied cultures and backgrounds trying to come to terms with a different societycultureclimateset of beliefs and have done reasonably well to depict such things A Good Year appears to be of the belief that separate sequences involving Russell Crowe rolling around in some mud and being urinated on by a dog should suffice as instances ably depicting someone out of their comfort zone.Scott's laughable ideas on how this person's adventure out and away from what he's used to are equalled only in their rank abjectness by a Godawful approach. Listen hard and you can hear the wails of a subtext crying out to be explored which might have seen the vast cultural differences between two oncegreat nations that are so close to one another geographically depicted and explored  tragically drowned out by a rampaging series of cleavage shots ugly stereotypes and derivative character frameworks. Crowe who one must remember is actually a New Zealandborn Australian agrees to play dress up to Scott's behind the camera antics and act as the epitome of a priggish Englishness one encounters when one is abroad in places such as France or Spain. Sporting a cricket kit and possessing a brash arrogant tone as if one is 'above' one's host he revels in trumping those he encounters at whichever turn he can. Further evidence that this was always intended as an international comedy with no regard whatsoever to the subtleties that should be inherent in a film such as this the French are offered few favours in their depictions as scatty eccentric people whose heat in the South appears to have gone straight to their heads and stayed there.Of these French is Fanny Chenal Cotillard a young woman whose purpose is to pout a lot allude to the fact she has breasts and fall off a bicycle. As time goes by it appears she ought to be more relevant to Max than initially seems. The groans one ought to induce upon a certain reveal being made should be long and hearty the sheer coincidence of the instance should make one feel they have had their intelligence not only insulted but removed entirely beaten with a small pole and then shoved back in again. Max's womanising ways already established in the opening are here designed to act as the film's centrepiece around which the very makeup of the man should shift into being the polar opposite of what he was back in London. Twist in mind the process is wholly sped up in this regard when compared to how it would've been had they had to start from scratch and the technique is nauseating  what does Max actually learn about women in this regard? The film left me feeling cold and unsatisfied not things I associate with the director's work the lead actor's work and the location when it's put to film properly.".

As far as CroweScott combinations go this is one of the more exasperating.At its core is actually an interesting idea about someone stuck in a very stoic very specific life of hardline rhetoric whose ignorance to other people and cultures is challenged when by chance they find themselves abroad. How the film goes about depicting such a thing is laughable to say the least but not in the way that arrives via a good comedy. The lead is a certain Max Skinner played by Russell Crowe. When we observe the earliest part of a point in Max's life we see him spending carefree summers with his uncle in the south of France summers of which include the briefest of moments of wine tasting and games of tennis and chess in the sun. Cut to years later and London has replaced France Cognac has replaced wine and a sharp metallic greyed out office in the Gherkin building has replaced messing about in life. Max is a trader and a good one at that. His insistence on competition winning and daring to cheat during those aforementioned chess matches has carried over into his job a job that allows him to be someone who abuses the system in ways that are perfectly legal that often results in the making of lots of money. Feared and respected in equal measure by his peers Max is the boss of his surroundings.Hark for time away from his luxurious apartment successful job and cold characterless cutthroat surroundings are challenged when a trip back to Southern France rears up out of the fact his dear old uncle has died and left Max the house. Wary that should he go someone could usurp him as is the tradition in the field of trading Max is sceptical but is convinced by coworkers that it will be good for him. Cue comedy and the fishoutofwater content suddenly kicks in as this toughasnails trader ends up in a zone that is the polar opposite to what he's used to. Where films such as Brick Lane and The Namesake have depicted people of such varied cultures and backgrounds trying to come to terms with a different societycultureclimateset of beliefs and have done reasonably well to depict such things A Good Year appears to be of the belief that separate sequences involving Russell Crowe rolling around in some mud and being urinated on by a dog should suffice as instances ably depicting someone out of their comfort zone.Scott's laughable ideas on how this person's adventure out and away from what he's used to are equalled only in their rank abjectness by a Godawful approach. Listen hard and you can hear the wails of a subtext crying out to be explored which might have seen the vast cultural differences between two oncegreat nations that are so close to one another geographically depicted and explored  tragically drowned out by a rampaging series of cleavage shots ugly stereotypes and derivative character frameworks. Crowe who one must remember is actually a New Zealandborn Australian agrees to play dress up to Scott's behind the camera antics and act as the epitome of a priggish Englishness one encounters when one is abroad in places such as France or Spain. Sporting a cricket kit and possessing a brash arrogant tone as if one is 'above' one's host he revels in trumping those he encounters at whichever turn he can. Further evidence that this was always intended as an international comedy with no regard whatsoever to the subtleties that should be inherent in a film such as this the French are offered few favours in their depictions as scatty eccentric people whose heat in the South appears to have gone straight to their heads and stayed there.Of these French is Fanny Chenal Cotillard a young woman whose purpose is to pout a lot allude to the fact she has breasts and fall off a bicycle. As time goes by it appears she ought to be more relevant to Max than initially seems. The groans one ought to induce upon a certain reveal being made should be long and hearty the sheer coincidence of the instance should make one feel they have had their intelligence not only insulted but removed entirely beaten with a small pole and then shoved back in again. Max's womanising ways already established in the opening are here designed to act as the film's centrepiece around which the very makeup of the man should shift into being the polar opposite of what he was back in London. Twist in mind the process is wholly sped up in this regard when compared to how it would've been had they had to start from scratch and the technique is nauseating  what does Max actually learn about women in this regard? The film left me feeling cold and unsatisfied not things I associate with the director's work the lead actor's work and the location when it's put to film properly.";

In their wisdom IMDb omit five actors from the initial cast list so that you have to click 'more' to find out that Marion Cotillard Abbie Cornish Isabelle Candelier Didier Bourdon and Valeria BruniTedeschi are also part of the ensemble leading lady and loveinterest Cotillard is arguably the largest omission but Candelier and Bourdon offer huge support throughout Abbie Cornish is the Californian who turns up looking for her father whilst BruniTedeschi is an avocat. It seems to be a truth universally acknowledged that Russell Crowe doesn't do Charm andor light comedy but hey he gives it the old college try and with support like that mentioned it's not such a big deal. It's basically a feel gooder with some great scenery punctuated by some Judge and Andy Hardy lessons in life with Finney in the Lewis Stone role and Crowe as Mickey Rooney but the two hours really do fly by.".

In fact I saw Russell being interviewed about this movie and he didn't even seem too impressed with it. He's not one to put up a front.So even though I really wanted to like this movie I just couldn't. Here's why 1. The dialog is very hard to understand. Everyone either has a thick English or French accent. And they all talk really fast and kind of mumble. Very frustrating.2. The plot is stupid and predictable yet confusing at the same time. I still couldn't tell you how that's possible. Something to do with two different vintages of wine. And so help me if the British stock market REALLY works as it's shown in the movie then they are in BIG trouble!3. The acting is mediocre. Russell is just phoning it in as they say. Must have needed the paycheck??? The other actors not at all noteworthy.4. This is supposed to be a romantic comedy. There was a little boring romance with no real emotional buyin or interest generated. Comedy? I can't remember anything really funny in the movie. Stupid yes. Plenty of stupid. Funny no. It reminded me of a bad sitcom pilot. Honestly. It was that bad.So in contradiction to all the other commentaries DO believe the critics. It's not worth your time.".

Oliver Reed is perfectly cast as the gruff thickly bearded 50yrs man who places the ad. And for once in a brilliant casting decision an actress was chosen who shares much chemistry with him onscreen! Amanda Donohue is the much younger blonde and an aura of sensuality about her chosen to play his reluctant love interest in the film Lucy. His young bride is only interested in learning island life and the frustrated Gerald broods and seethes as young Lucy parades  either naked or wearing the tiniest of loin cloths. She is ever the tease and as she becomes more accustomed to island life Gerald silently broods in his own lust. She has no interest in this man old enough to be her father other than basic companionship. Gerald has other ideas. The movie is full of powerful scenes of the struggle of the sexes and beautifully shot on a gorgeous island. Gerald and Lucy heat up the screen and it is the contrast in their ages and physical makeup that only add to the film. The story deals with their trials and tribulations and contains many interesting twists. It builds up to a fantastic climax that shows the viewer the fate of both characters. Very powerful film  and beautifully cast Castaway is highly recommended. More films of this nature should be made.".

With Amanda Donohoe Oli stars in a wonderful film about an Odd Couple who for certain reasons decide to live together on a desert island.Oli is superb as the 45 year old man who just wants to be alone on his dream island with the gorgeous Amanda Donohoe and she's also superb as the girl who's forced to live with the volatile Oli Reed.The difference in viewpoint between the two central characters is stunning and drives the film along well as whilst Oli is blatantly interested in both her enjoying himself and fulfilling a few desires she's keen on being much more active and building things. The comparison of the two continues as the film progresses until eventually a boat containing two men appear. Truth be told it is the appearance of these two men Jason  Rod which leads to the film going slightly downhill for the customary dip which most films experience. The psychology of Donahoe as she blatantly gets upset at a missed opportunity to sleep with one of the men is slightly infuriating for the audience as well as the characters and it's clever to see how the two characters behave differently amongst visitors and this is actually quite an interesting portrayal of how we change amongst guests compared with in close company.Eventually the two almost die of malnutrition and yet once again some random strangers turn up this time in the face of nuns. It becomes blatantly obvious this time however that Donahoe does actually quite like Oli at times when he's not being aggressive and violent or excessively lazy. It is the upgrade in living enviroments and food provided by the nuns and their friends that allows the two to regain their health and the film perks up now as the end of their year approaches.Eventually the film runs through to it's climax via a few memorable moments and the film is completed as looking back it seemed destined to throughout.It's hard to sum up this film really. After a slightly weak review as the one I've just written most people will probably have stopped reading by now. I guess it's probably just worth saying that whilst films on desert beaches are by no means in short supply this one is more enjoyable than most other efforts and is head and shoulders above both Tom Hank's most recent effort and the Beach with Leo Di Caprio. Enjoy one of Oli Reed's finest roles and find yourself inspired to escape society to a beach of your own.".

In fact she is fully nude in many many scenes and with long lingering shots almost voyeuristic.She is a very beautiful woman and her nudity made the film far more realistic for 2 reasons. One is that people do often go about nude when there is nobody around her nudity helped to convincingly portray a sense of isolation. Secondly as a man I can get a sense of the frustration that Reed has when he sees her walking about and he can't touch.I feel bad for the people who have seen this movie censored because there is very frequent high level nudity in this film which means that the censored version would have been cut to ribbons. This may also explain the experience some people had with short scenes or scenes that ended abruptly.A very good film worth while watching uncensored.".

	schema:headline " My island getaway.";
	schema:reviewBody "Gerald Kingsland a middleaged writer advertises an ad in a magazine looking for a wife to take to a secluded island for a year. The young Lucy answers and the two marry and head off to an island off the coast of Australia. However their idyllic dreams are pushed to the test and soon the two are caught up in a love and hate relationship.Far from Nicolas Roeg's best but Castaway is an interesting curio that pulls you along for a very offbeat psychological drama than what might seem like a relaxing pastoral getaway. Alan Scott's adapted story opens up as a thoughtful jaded powerplay between two characters impeccably performed by Oliver Reed and Amanda Donahoe. While the sporadic script comes across literately trivial in the growing situation than actually delving deeper into the character's past and motivations. Something about this downplayed metaphorical search for acceptance communication fulfilment obsession and inner discovery is unpredictably planned out. It's quite a warped spin on the island dream as you observe and get involved with the feelings being shrouded about and their journey now to survive. Nothing comes easy and both realise they have to work hard for their dreams. What was their choice to escape the madness and restrictions of society eventually becomes their downfall because there's nothing there to shape their daily lives. There you could escape your problems but on an island you got to live with them and overcome them to move on. Gerald seems to be the gogetter from the very beginning but it's Lucy who adapts to the island life. This is a surprise as the tables are turned with the muscularity card. Lucy is the resourceful one not afraid to shy away compared with a loafing Gerald's relying on her. This gives her power a sexual one over the lazily whiny Gerald and her inner strength and confidence makes her the object of affection or better put lust to Richard. She uses this sexual edge to her advantage and spends most of the time flaunting about in little or no clothing. The hardship makes her stronger but he gets weaker. The real pettiness that Lucy shows Gerald is deservedly so. As he hides his pain and uncomfortable side with erratically insane behaviour. That's until he finds a purpose then she sees the true person he is than the one she had been stuck with for most of the year. Now the attention she drew from him is clouded and the true notion of them roughing it out on the island is lost with the intrusion of mechanical devices locals from another island and food supplies making it much easier to cope. It's no longer about survival and depending on each other. Where left trying to figure him out. Both are selfseeking persons with their own goals for this journey. She's there to be apart of the island but he has his eyes on her. Humour can be found in some sharp witty passages and there few amusing darkly twisted exchanges. Reed's hearty performance is one of complexity intrigue and tremendous versatility. His let loose. A ravishing Donahoe terrifically grows with her independently headstrong performance.A true calling card of Roeg is the visually enigmatic experience he emits from his productions. Reality and fantasy convincingly milked together and not with the usual fractured editing style that he incorporates. It hasn't got that vagueness openended feeling that usually ends with his films. Incidentally there's a strange surreal punch done in a more clearcut fashion finding its way in but it's the whimsically mediative illustrations of nature doing what it does best that engraves many striking and at times dreamy images. Blending the beautiful with the jarring. Harvey Harrison's scenic photography work is masterfully projected and admirably frames the lush pristine locations stunning water shots to the desirably leering lensing of Donahoe. Stanley Myers silky melancholy music score wraps itself with many uncanny moody shades. Roeg's symbolic direction is sufficiently customfit with his usual brassy stylish imprints and casual sense of pacing.There are two novels out there but the material is taken off Lucy Irvine's version Castaway which was soon followed by Gerald Kingsland's book The Islander.While it might not have a lasting powerful stamp of his other achievements. Castaway is still a creditably solid and lyrically transfixing opus.".

He doesn't feel like a real person. Whereas she can do no wrong and her emotional needs are explained to death.And then it dawned on me This is a onesided story told only from the woman's side consisting of rants against a man she doesn't like nor understand who finds herself in a survivalist adventure that didn't match her romantic ideals.Imagine my lack of surprise when I looked up the credits and found that this is based on a reallife adventure book written from her point of view.Another flaw is the lack of realism and changes in their alwaysdisplayed nude bodies Roeg having to insert awkward shots of another emaciated body to convey the idea that they are in bad health. Compare this with Tom Hanks' physical work in his desert island movie.In summary I like the idea I like the acting I like Roeg's constantly challenging cinematic work and inventive methods of telling a story but the material this is based on feels fundamentally flawed and biased with Reed's character making no sense as a result.

	schema:reviewBody "Castaway movies are always a treat but this is one is a little different. It's essentially about two ordinary Londoners who are able to make this ultimate fantasy a reality but then face the problem of things not going as they thought it would.A few words of advice gleaned from this movie to anyone wishing to live out this fantasy. Pick your island mate with great care. Find someone your own age. Only go with someone you're sexually attracted to and make sure he or she feels the same way. If you go with someone you're not attracted to be prepared to put out. For god's sake go on a few holidays together first. And not just for a week. Try to find someone who is selfreliant and handy a natural explorer and a hard worker. Avoid picking a user or a loser. Go into therapy for a few months beforehand to make sure you understand your relationship and psychological issues because they will all arise to bite you in the ass once your diversions are gone. Try to find out what you are really looking for. Take survival and first aid courses first. Study the ecosystem. Bring lots of medicine. Don't do anything that will get you injured.If you're very lucky you'll find someone who looks like Amanda Donohue when she was 24. The nudity in the film wasn't gratuitous though because it was essential for understanding Gerald's frustration. However I can see why some might think it overdone.And if you're very lucky you'll end up with an island like Tuin filmed in the Seychelles. The director does his best to show us how this island was perfect for Lucy.The problem for Gerald is that the island is not what Gerald really wanted. In a nutshell Lucy is into the island Gerald is into Lucy. It's essentially a Huis Clos drama. Like a paradise island a sexy young lover is what many older men want as the door is gently closing. It's a powerful fantasy that even in fruition proves fruitless.This movie is underrated here on IMDb.com. I can think of several reasons for that. I didn't like the complicated Oliver Reed character at all. Oliver Reed was the right casting choice because I can imagine Oliver Reed being a little like Gerald Kingsley.This movie worked for me. It felt realistic including the strange dream sequences. I agree with the other reviewers about the jarring body double scenes. That didn't work for me either although I assume it was the director's way of showing us their bodies through their own eyes and objectively.The movie is interesting and has a few profound things to say. It's worth about 7.5. Also be sure to read the review here by DavidFrames. It hits the nail on the head.".

	onyx:emotionText "Castaway movies are always a treat but this is one is a little different. It's essentially about two ordinary Londoners who are able to make this ultimate fantasy a reality but then face the problem of things not going as they thought it would.A few words of advice gleaned from this movie to anyone wishing to live out this fantasy. Pick your island mate with great care. Find someone your own age. Only go with someone you're sexually attracted to and make sure he or she feels the same way. If you go with someone you're not attracted to be prepared to put out. For god's sake go on a few holidays together first. And not just for a week. Try to find someone who is selfreliant and handy a natural explorer and a hard worker. Avoid picking a user or a loser. Go into therapy for a few months beforehand to make sure you understand your relationship and psychological issues because they will all arise to bite you in the ass once your diversions are gone. Try to find out what you are really looking for. Take survival and first aid courses first. Study the ecosystem. Bring lots of medicine. Don't do anything that will get you injured.If you're very lucky you'll find someone who looks like Amanda Donohue when she was 24.

These are merely introductions into the nature of the potential partners evolving but they attempt to serve each other  at times seem quite close. But they are in an Adam 'n' Evetype scenario of ambivalence. So the hostilities between them do not take long to surface! And they dare to reflect remarkable similarities to the difficulties  modern complexities we are all part of in our respective worlds as islands within islands of government religion  media domains almost always beyond our control operate.So we have a movie here a little over 20 years old as I write this which invites the viewer to see a microcosm of the world that surrounds us everyday as we live  watch TV  visit the cinema! A bit ahead of its time I would suggest! So in the process of preparing this I have upgraded my rating of it from 8 to 9 out of 10.

This is a gap year with a difference in this case the gap between reality and the ignorant daydreams of a couple of selfish moronic Londoners. If this introduction implies you should feel some sympathy for Irving then forget it. If Gerald Kingsland as portrayed by Oliver Reed was as crass and obvious as one of those sex cards you find in phone boxes then Irving as played by Amanda Donahoe is a priggish middle class suburbanite who tires of the grind of city living and facts of life like crime and Royal weddings and so imagines that she alone despite having no idea how it might be done will travel thousands of miles to be selfsufficient and uses Kingsland to make this a reality. Initially she's not going to let anything even the facts get in the way of this protracted venture to lala land. She ignores the warning signs  Kingsland's obvious fear of female intelligence the fact that he's had to advertise for a wife in the first place his obvious interest in sex with a woman 20 years his junior and even in a wonderful example of the will to ignorance the way he contrives to spend all their money before they've left forceing Irving to marry him in accordance with Australian immigration law. Some women might bale out at this stage and cut their losses but those sandy beaches are quite the lure and the two sadsacks go anyway prompting 12 months of predictable implosion in which Kingsland angrily resents Irving's lack of sexual interest while she alone is astounded by his laziness toe curling advances crudity and total lack of survival instinct. In fact 9 months in and the two have virtually died from malnutrition. If Irving had hoped to spend a year bathing naked while Kingsland built the house and grew the food she's as deluded as the old man who hoped to spend 12 months engaged in vigorous intercourse pampered by his new wife in idyllic surroundings. This is a fascinating story but its impossible to feel anything but irritation at these two characters and Roeg does nothing to pull us toward either of them. He seems content to be a bit of letch himself focusing on Donahoe's nakedness while mercifully sparing us shots of Reed's reed. Ultimately Irving's story confirms something we already knew namely that Robinson Crusoe is a great story but it makes a lousy lifestyle choice for a mismatched couple from west London who would normally get no closer to the life of selfsufficiency than a visit to M and S. It wouldn't have taken us a year to figure it out either. Pity they had to come back.".

If you have ever been in a longterm relationship with a selfish partner you will see a lot that looks familiar here and as a tool to help sort out your own feelings and make sense of your own experiences you might find watching this useful.

Basically this movie is about two notespecially likable people who don't really like each other either all that much either trying to have a relationship together and the entertainment value you get from that exists right at that level.Yes there is a good deal of nudity here involving the heroine but it is usually not especially erotic it is presented so matteroffactly and almost entirely in nonsexual situations in fact most often while she is entirely alone to the point that I got the impression that she was more of a sensualist than anything else and certainly she was no party girl or anyone else with anything more than an ordinary female interest in sex if that. Moreover I never got the impression that she was conspicuously teasing the male lead as some other reviewers seem to have indicated beyond the mere fact that she was there with him on this same island with nothing or nobody else around and granting that such circumstances alone might make for some of the subtlest and most provoking kind of erotic torment possible. Certainly there are women in real life capable of the same.The male main figure is no less selfish in his own way and the mere fact that at his age he can't think of any way to bed this woman other to demand sex like a lovesick college freshman shows it as well as anything else. For a man of his maturity to behave the way he does certainly justifies the description of lecher given him by some other reviewers. Whatever complaints might be assessed against his wouldbe mate he certainly didn't make much effort to treat her very well. If the dummy had done just a few simple things to make her feel good about herself for having made the decision to shack up with him on this island for a year they both would likely have had a much better time. But he was too selfish or at least too selfabsorbed to see that something that is shown in the film to be just as true of his life before the island and which indeed would explain his reason for wanting to be there in the first place.What some of the movie reviewers more talented than I have said on here about the cinematography and so forth is true those aspects of the film as as good as any and make me wonder if this film wouldn't be better watched over a glass of wine or two and the right music on your stereo while the sound on the TV is turned OFF.".

Beyond that thrill I also enjoyed the development of the characters through the story. I have seen the late Oliver Reed in a couple of other movie. And I expected from him a strong performance well that how I know Oliver Reed Bill Sykes! I sent my dice rolling on the table and it produced a 7 for my rating how about that. MM";

	schema:reviewBody "Watched this as a Netflix streaming movie. Filmed in the Seychelles.It starts in London where an middleaged man nearing 50 with teenage sons at home decides that he wants to spend a year on a tropical island with a younger women. There is a bit of mumbling in the dialog so he may have said and I missed it but I never found out what he was going to do with his sons during this time.So he places an ad for a wife and is in the process of meeting the respondents one by one until he meets Lucy and she seems to be just right. So he cancels the other interviews he and Lucy start spending time together sleeping together and probably planning the details of their trip although it isn't obvious that they do so.When ready they set off and once in Australia find that they must be married to cavort alone on the island and somehow Lucy had decided she wanted to remain single but they marry to avoid canceling.As we watch this story it seems that planning was not done very well. They don't really know what they will do with their time and they don't seem particularly prepared for food shelter or invariable medical needs. Plus she decides once they are on the island alone she spends most of her time nude but loses all her interest in sex which creates its own new set of problems.Veteran actor Oliver Reed is the man Gerald Kingsland. Amanda Donohoe as the woman Lucy Irvine was about 23 and very lovely.While the movie is interesting from a character study and just the idea of two relative strangers spending a year alone together on a small island with no conveniences it doesn't flow very well and when it is all over doesn't particularly make sense. Except perhaps to show that even if you go halfway around the world to an island you still end up eventually doing and enjoying what you did back home. He stayed in Australia she flew away probably back to London.".

A couple of meetings later they are on their way and most of the time as I said roaming around naked as they indulge in what the island has to offer which is not much. It soon becomes clear it is not as idyllic as they would have thought with both the island and their arguments creating tension but they have to bare with it the full year. Also starring Georgina Hale as Sister Saint Margaret Frances Barber as Sister Saint Winifred Tony Rickards as Jason Len Peihopa as Ronald Todd Rippon as Rod Virginia Hey as Janice John Sessions as Man in Pub Stephen Jenn as Shop Manager Sorrell Johnson as Lara Paul Reynolds as Mike Kingsland and Sean Hamilton as Geoffrey Kingsland. This is a very odd film for director Nicholas Roeg Walkabout Don't Look Now The Witched to choose and both Reed and Donohoe aren't very suitable there isn't much to say about this film to persuade you to watch it well maybe seeing Donohoe naked but that's it. Oliver Reed was number 78 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars and he was number 26 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Adequate!".

John Litgow plays the sympathetic duped husband while Madchen Amick plays both husbands against each other. All is not as it seems and there are at least a bunch of double crosses and back stabbings along the way to an intricate bank robbery. Part inside job part outside job the amoral characters try to outsmart each other as the story twirls toward the unexpected conclusion. Love Cheat Steal isn't going to make anyone's top 100 list but for what it is it succeeds nicely. If you enjoy fast moving films with quirky dialog give this one a try.  MERK".

Even the score is lowrent. It's just cheap. It looks and sounds as though they had about 2.50 to spend and they blew that on paying the local delivery boy to write the script.Honestly this looks like one of those erotic thrillers that are churned out by the dozen  the ones designed to appeal to those who really want to watch fullon porn but can't admit it to themselves so they watch softporn thrillers instead. This movie won't even satisfy that undemanding crowd though  there isn't nearly enough nudity and sex.There really is very little to say about this production that is positive. The only saving grace is that the twists at the end of the tale are interesting. It's just a pity that the whole enterprise is so poor and the buildup to the climax equally so that the impact of the ending is mostly lost.If this film had been done properly  with a decentsized cast more locations a wellwritten script good direction and production  it could have been good. As it stands it is just a waste of time.The people posting positive comments must have an agenda. I don't know what that might be  perhaps they are John Lithgow fans or they fancy the female lead or maybe they just enjoy the idea of wasting other people's time by recommending rubbish. Whatever I suggest that everyone reading this should look elsewhere for entertainment you won't find it here.I have given this movie three stars and if anything that is too high. It only rates that much because of the ending  but I suspect that most people will have lost interest long before they reach that point.Definitely a movie to avoid.Rating  310".

Where pop rock became worth listening and not just dancing to? Where John Paul George and Ringo became firmly established as individual personalities as well as the premier entertainment troupe of the 20th century?Only this A Hard Day's Night is good yes and significant but it's fun too. Still and above everything else it's a lot of fun.A Hard Day's Night is probably more responsible for the Beatles' enduring image in our culture than any single song they made. It came out in 1964 within a few short months of the Fab Four's sensational appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show that truly launched them globally though they had been making great pop music for more than a year which was all the rage across Europe. Hard Day's Night captures the band when they were still relatively provincial and innocent not yet in the marijuana for breakfast phase they were well into the following year when they made the zanier Help! LSD Yoko and the Maharishi were not even on the radar nor was the psychedelic era the Beatles would usher in less than three years later. Finally Hard Day's Night clicked not only with the kids but the adults who previously viewed the band as a motley band of overplayed haircuts. It gave all the generations of the time something they could agree on. These guys were good.The story of Hard Day's Night is thin by design. We see the Beatles in slightly fictionalized form with a manager named Norm and a roadie named Shake traveling by train across England and ducking into a studio to make a TV appearance. Paul has his grandfather along a codgy old troublemaker who nevertheless is very clean. The irony of the movie is that the old guy played by British TV star Wilfrid Brambell is the one that continually ruffles the feathers of society while the Boys themselves play things fairly straight and legal.Grandpa has the best take on the meager storyline I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far I've been in a train and a room and car and a room and a room and a room! Brambell works very well in the film a needful focal point in a film that requires some bearings in order to work. Of the Beatles themselves Ringo makes the strongest single impression by showcasing his vulnerable side while John probably has the best moments with his wacky caustic humor. George shines too in a scene with a trendhappy fashion maven and married one of the girls on the train in real life so he did pretty well here too.Is it the best Beatles film? I think Yellow Submarine is better for what it's worth but Hard Day's Night is the best film actually featuring the Beatles for who they were and what they were about.Great music too. The sequence on the train with I Should Have Known Better still works as a video with all the baggagecar bricabrac thrown in for ambiance. Then there's Can't Buy Me Love which shows the Beatles in fulltilt boogie mode after momentarily escaping their studio confines. And I Love Her has some of the film's greatest camera work very moody and intense in its focus on how well the Beatles worked in a TV studio setting.As a film Hard Day's Night lacks a bit of heart. Not that it's cold or cruel just a trifle too detached to get enveloped by the way one does with great cinema. I don't really miss the fact that Help! wasn't a true sequel Hard Day's Night works for its 90plus minutes but doesn't leave you wanting more. The relationships between the band members and with Grandpa Norm and Shake are left unexplored and you don't really miss that as much as you maybe should.But as a collection of small witty moments interspersed with great music Hard Day's Night is a pleasure throughandthrough. Like the scene where John cuts the tailor's measure I now declare this bridge open or has that absurd corridor chat with Anna Quayle She looks more like him than I do. Or when Ringo tells the crotchety train passenger who complains he fought the war for your sort that I bet you're sorry you won!".

	schema:reviewBody "The first 60's film to ever waken my musical interest in pop music and electric guitars...not to mention I wasn't even born then! The film is full of great music and British humor by the Fab Four. It stars The Beatles themselves  John Lennon Paul McCartney George Harrison and Ringo Starr in their first acting debut. The music they perform in this 'black and white' film are 7 'Lennon  McCartney' classics  from the title song A Hard Day's Night to Can't Buy Me Love and She Loves You. In the comedy skits of the film The Beatles' drummer Ringo Starr definitely leaves the other lads in a socall 'run against time'. It's a fun and exciting film...a pop film on what 'Beatlemania' was all about back then in 1964. This classic is a must see for all upcoming Beatle fans from all around the world as well as people and kids of all ages. And for those of you who never felt the magic and excitement of The Beatles...like me I promise that you will by the end of this fab film!".

Without this we would have a piece missing from their history  and lets be frank  our history. They changed the world and all they had to change it with were electric guitars and their personalities!The script is clever in that it showcases the personalities of the group without asking them to do much acting. Wilfred Brambell tags along to give comedy relief and the whole thing fits in plenty of songs that are good  but not as good as what soon followed. They are still tied to the Northern dance halls.I have always thought that if they had a died in a car crash at this point they would be a mystery to the modern audience  hugely popular at the time  but not particularly standout from the other bands around. Like the way we regard Charlie Chaplin or Mary Pickford  both incredibly famous in their prime  but little regarded today. Whether you like to admit it or not there are three geniuses at work and Ringo Starr. So I guess that it is fitting that Ringo comes across the best of the group Downtoearth chatty witty and willing to talk to anyone. Even the kids down by the river. John Lennon had a comic wit that could have given him another career had his music not been up to scratch. Talk about being master of the witty comeback. Anyone watching this film will see London as it really was at the time. Not the swinging sixties that everyone pretends it was. Grubby shops unpainted windows that look about to fall out of their frames empty streets bar a few beat up cars. I guess you could say this is the perfect record of Beatlemania The driving beat songs cranked out even quicker on stage the backstage sieges the pingpong put downs that is the hallmark of English humour the screaming that overpowered the performance. Enjoyable at the time as light entertainment it becomes an important historical document now and every generation should see it. Your pop culture education depends on it.".

We're used to all its madcap editing and photography now thanks to television and music videos and we can only sit back and imagine or try to remember what it looked like through eyes that had never seen anything like it before. Watching it today A Hard Day's Night still seems fresh and original because it's still different we're used to music videos but not featurelength music videos but to the 1960's audience it would have seemed entirely different from anything they had previously seen especially if they were expecting a traditional rock musical considering that the only good one of those made prior to this which I've seen is Go Johnny Go.Lester infuses the film with nonstop quick cutting and energetic pacing giving the film an almost documentarylike feel and somehow managing to integrate the biggest pop band in the world into the French 'nouvelle vague' style of filmmaking. When Orson Welles was interviewed in Playboy magazine in 1967 he said that the film directors that appealed to him the most were 'the old masters by which I mean John Ford John Ford and John Ford. With Ford at his best you feel that the movie had lived and breathed in the real world even though it may have been written by mother Machree'. When questioned about younger directors he enjoyed the most he named Stanley Kubrick and Richard Lester. It seems absurd after Kubrick's long and distinguished career and Lester's career which while featuring some famously good films also includes Butch and Sundance The Early Days a cheap prequel with none of the original cast and the notoriously horrible Superman III to compare the two directors but looking at Welles' reasoning behind loving John Ford films it all makes sense. A Hard Day's Night really does feel real we are basically transported into a day in The Beatles' life and given a VIP pass to accompany them wherever they go. It's a fascinating adventure which the screenplay handles very well. The Beatles were not actors but they really come off as themselves because all they have to be is the cocky wisecracking and rather charming men they were in real life. The screenwriter is smart enough not to provide them with any real acting which really helps the film. That's not to say there isn't any good acting in the film quite to the contrary actually since Wilfrid Bramble is hilarious as McCartney's grandfather and was presumably cast thanks to his very funny costarring role on Britcom Steptoe and Son which was one of the shows I frequently watched as a kid and was remade for American audiences as Sanford and Son. The film is effortlessly charming relying on the Beatles' natural charisma to carry the film but also including enough wit to warrant comparisons to later great British comedies and also to the later Beatles films including Lester's later slightly funnier and more experimental Help!. The Beatles were not yet the musical innovators they would later become but there's something I personally prefer about their simple short and perfect Merseybeat songs especially those on this soundtrack which contains some of the most joyous and memorable pop songs ever written. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "What a fun movie. I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release as a kid in 1964. They gave us black and white Beatles Fan Club buttons. Looking back through a 10 year old's eye's I couldn't wait to see The Beatles in a movie. I had seen them on TV and in magazines but an entire movie about them was going to be a watershed event in the career of the group. Indoctrinated by all the corny teen movies that mostly were made prior to Hard Day's Night you knew that if they were going to be portrayed as conventional teen idols it was going to be a bust but if it was a glimpse into what it was like being a Beatle and the London mod scene of '64 and The Beatles in their irreverent but likable persona with cool clothes and Beatle boots and lots of Beatle's music and The Beatles playing their guitars it was going to be a hit. Well it didn't disappoint. I didn't even expect there to be a story. I just wanted to see the Beatles on the big screen and hear their music. The theater even had women playing nurses in nursing outfits and stretchers for people who fainted. Cool and campy. I have to give that theater credit for all they did. The first 50 people in got Beatles wigs. As I grew older this film did not when I would see it on TV. Sure it was dated but it was still fun. Supporting or in this case actual actors Norman Rossington as Norm and Victor Spinetti as the TV Director along with Wiford Brambell as Paul's clean grandfather and John Junkin as Jake gave the movie a legitimate cast to cohesively hold it together and it worked well but heck The Beatles were good on their own first time out. George Harrison's future wife fashion model Pattie Boyd is one of the girls in the train car with the band Her only line is prisonors and even future rock and pop star Phil Collins is in a scene as a teen fan. Director Richard Lester should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director. Alun Owen did get a nomination for Best Screenplay in the only film he ever did. George Martin also received an Academy Award nomination for Scoring of Music Adaptation. Any of The Beatles songs in this film should have been nominated for Best Original Song but they weren't. Gilbert Taylor was the cinematographer for this film. He had just come off doing the cinematography for the film Dr. Strangelove. John Jympson who had just come off editing the film Zulu was the editor. This film does a wonderful job of capturing the era of mid 1960's London and Beatlemania on film in black and white. Their next film Help also directed by Lester tried to be too James Bondish and although good was largely silly and didn't come close to HDN. This film has been with me so long and I've seen it so many times I can't help but give it a 10.".

This is because film incorperates sound theatre painting dance and writing. That dry polemic aside A Hard Day's Night is a fine example of what film can do. This film is one of the purest expression of joy in cinema history. What made the Beatles so fantastic as performers and ultimately as cultural icons is they personified all of our hopes and dreams. We all wish we could be as expressive and has happy as they appeared to be. I know that much of what we see is fabricated but one cannot fake the explosion of life we see on the screen and hear on their records. There was the celebration of life and creativity in those four young men and they shared so much of it with us. This film is a great document as to what made them so great. Richard Lester the director got out of the way and let them be the Beatles. The camera work and editing in this film arguably made the '60's cultural revolution. It is a perfect marriage of music to image. Without this film there never would have been an Easy Rider or even an MTV on second thought maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing. Of course John Paul George and Ringo couldn't completly match their images in their private lives who could? and of course they matured and evolved as we all have. But this film inspired many to live to love and to create. It is such a force of positive life affirming love that it has to be savored and enjoyed. I don't apologize for dripping over it the way I do. It is a great film on the level with Kane Singin' in the Rain The Seven Saumurai and others. It should be so much higher on the IMDB scale.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am just about the biggest Beatles fan imaginable and so axiomatically I enjoy this movie very much. However I think it's time to put to rest the notion of this being some kind of great film apart from its value as a keyhole onto to the Fabs' heyday. Let's face it as pure moviemaking this thing is a bit of a joke. The story as such is nonexistent the pacing is flabby and the Paul's grandfather subplot which no one ever seems to mention in appraisals of the movie anymore despite its taking up of a good deal of film time is embarrassingly cheesy. On top of all that the Beatles themselves are simply so hard to understand much of the time Liverpool scouse being a very mumbled and slurredtogether dialect that quite a bit of the socalled sparkling wit just goes over or under your head the first three or four times you see it. Someone really should have sat the lads down with some Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello movies to teach them at least the rudiments of enunciation and comic timing.As a story it's very interesting how the film portrays the Beatles as prisoners of their own fame with an unmistakable wisp of pathos and frustration which is allowed to undergird all the wildness and comedy. This especially comes through in the sequence where Ringo leaves the band to go parading and enjoy some freedom an unconscious foreshadowing of future events to boot as Ringo was the first Beatle to ever leave the band  four years later during the White Album sessions. Yet the irony is never put forth that the very people who are keeping the Beatles prisoner  their fans  are the ones for whom this movie is made and is being aimed at. A decade later such a disparity would have forced a punk band such as the Sex Pistols to fire off a massive F You! to its audience and in fact one rock star did do just this  in film no less Roger Waters during the amazing and squirminducing In the Flesh segment of Pink Floyd The Wall where a concert of mindlessly adoring fans is compared none too subtly with a Nazi rally.I'm not saying of course that the Beatles should have come out spitting and gobbing at their fans and tearing apart their image in A Hard Day's Night. This would have been impossible to do in mainstream cinema in 1964 anyway. What I'm saying is that by introducing such a glaring irony and then failing to deal with it in any way the film asserts itself solidly as a product of its times and nothing more  no great and enduring piece of art certainly. In some ways the next year's followup Help! was the better film because it did not try to be anything more than a madcap Beatle travelogue and succeeded admirably with its pristine color beautiful locales and clever comic moments  although its setups do get a bit monotonous after awhile.Of course A Hard Day's Night will endure  simply because THE BEATLES endure and this gives us the best sustained look at their performing prowess and allaround joie de vivre. The musical sequences in the film are simply glorious particularly the orgiastic concert at the end but even more muted moments such as when the Beatles sneak off to a nightclub to dance and intermingle with other youths to the soundtrack of their own songs the scene provides a wonderful you are there quality to the partying and clubhopping side of Swinging London circa 1964. But a film's overall quality I say must be judged by its ability to be a complete and satisfying whole not just as a vehicle to show off the talents and charm of its central figure or figures otherwise by that measure Ace Ventura Pet Detective would have to be preserved and championed as one of America's greatest contributions to world cinema.So what am I saying finally? A Hard Day's Night  if you are a Beatle fan it is essential see it enjoy it revel in their youth and vitality as often and as passionately as you want. Just don't allow your enthusiasm for the group to confuse this with a great film.btw If you wish to experience the group's charm and musical euphoria of this time full on without the intrusions of a tacked on plot or supplementary characters check out the wonderful documentary The Beatles' First U.S. Visit. Done by the Maysles brothers  the duo behind the Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter later in the decade  the film captures all the excitement and footage of the Beatles' triumphant arrival in America including all their Ed Sullivan appearances various backstage reflections and shenanigans and an extended supercharged sequence of their concert at Washington Coliseum. For my money this film is even MORE essential than A Hard Day's Night it is quite simply the best extended visual document of the Beatles that we have.".

This picture demonstrates The Beatles at the peak of their popularity in the Summer of 1964 wandering about London with the ultimate soundtrack in the background. A fascinating homage to Beatlemania when viewed now over half a century later. The inventive boys from Liverpool are displayed at their sarcastic and witty best in this natural setting. A Hard Day's Night is a great example of the early Beatles musical ability and work product being that the title tune was written in about 20min between finishing an American tour a European tour a plethora of television specials recording an LP in Paris in German for the Deutschland market writing and recording the Hard Day's Night LP as well as making this film all within the same year and before May of that year. After which they all went on a month long vacation recorded another album and began work on the next film. These guys were driven workaholics at this time and their collective creative synergy has never been seen again.There wasn't anywhere The Beatles could go without being mobbed thus they spent years boxed up in hotel rooms together to the point where they knew each other so well they often finished each others sentences during interviews. As a group of young men going through that type of stress day in and day out they had to develop coping skills in order to keep it together it seems they chose humor as their main tool. This movie shows us a little bit of that. Genius casting is evident in Hard Days Night with the inclusion of Irishman Wilfred Brambell as Paul McCartney's incorrigible Grandfather. Brambell was only 52 at the time but looked 82. At the time Brambell was very well known to British audiences due to the popularity of his television character named Albert Steptoe in a show called Steptoe and Son. Brambell's 1960s character Steptoe was the basis for the Fred Sanford character played by Redd Foxx on the 1970s American TV show Sanford and Son. Look fast for a 13 year old Phil Collins in the audience as a screaming fan and look even faster for 20 year old Pattie Boyd as a schoolgirl on the train ride.".

For anyone new to The Beatles who's looking to discover what they were all about A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is the perfect place to start.

The market was ripe for this film which it was decided would show the rigors of a typical day in the life of the band at the peak of their stardom.

I did not become interested in music of any kind until after I first listened to Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. Within three years I had seen all the Beatles films and heard every album and single and within 5 years I was playing electric guitar and electric bass and singing in a rockandroll band. Their records certainly had a profound influence on me.Two hours ago I saw A Hard Day's Night on Korean television fortyone years after this film was originally released in theatres. What a wonderful joyous charming wacky piece of work. It was much much better than I remembered.A day in the life of the Beatles was almost certainly nothing like the portrayal in this documentarystyle film shot in black and white. Even in 1964 they were well into alcohol amphetamines and girls so naturally all that was cleaned out or up. After all this movie was obviously produced as a marketing medium for their music and their personalities and what a brilliant job of directing Dick Lester did to showcase both.It is a cleverly crafted screenplay and an amazingly effective film considering none of the band could act. As their musical recording producer George Martin has said I knew that their charm alone would sell them when he was talking about why he recorded them at EMI in the first place. This film clearly illustrates what he meant.And of course the music in A Hard Days Night is stunning not to mention the reaction of the young female audience. The professionalism and skills of the band are on clear exhibit including Ringo's much deprecated but original and innovative drumming. The Beatles in full flight.I love this movie and will be showing it to the kids a little after the eldest one reaches the age of ten.A groundbreaking pop classic!".

My sisters and their girlfriends who were all at least 7 years older than me and on their way to college sat in our living room and watched the movie together. They were like mesmerized by the Beatles and being only about 9 years old at the time it was hard for me to understand what was really happening. But I sat there with them and had a really good time watching their antics and listening to the girls comments about each Beatle being 'Gorgeous whose favorite was whose and beginning to understand that this was truly something special something that I had never experienced before.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Richard Lester and written by Alun Owen A Hard Day's Night is a musical comedy starring the Beatles at the initial explosion of 'Beatlemania.' The movie focuses on several days in the lives of the members while in England including recording music and a concert at the end with the requisite screaming pubescent girls.While the Beatles were before my time they were indeed great. There was something about the chemistry of the members that produced catchy hit after hit during their decade together from 19601970. When A Hard Day's Night the movie was released in the summer of '64 simultaneously with the album of the same name they had only three albums of material released in two years 19631964. The producers wanted to get a movie out before their popularity waned like practically every other pop rock artist or group. But their fame was not to decline as their appeal spread to young and older alike. They would release four more movies before breaking up if you include the animated Yellow Submarine. A Hard Day's Night is considered a cult movie and I can see why. It captures the group while they're not much more than kids still in shock about their skyrocketing success. The best parts of course are the music numbers which play like what would later become known as music videos. Seriously any time one of their hooky ditties starts playing your attention perks up and your feet  hands start moving in delight. It's the in between scenes that are problematic. You might enjoy these sequences more than me if you're enamored by the members. I'm not I just like their music. I suppose it doesn't help that these episodes are plagued by mumbling dialogue with the corresponding English accent not to mention British humor from the time period that I mostly don't 'get.' The film runs 87 minutes and was shot entirely in England.GRADE B".

The plot is very good and evolves at the right pace for this type of story. Not terribly fast but never stands still either.

Such films as Pearl Harbor Titanic etc. are a bit over the top but I honestly think that Legends of the Fall contains so many qualities that it deserve the credit it deserves. All along the film we follow the life and times of the Ludlow family living in Northern USA in the late 1800's and early 1900's. It is always well balanced between ingeniousness and clich. Just a few times this line is crossed thereby 9 not 10 points and in the end you're left with a good feeling 'cause this is really a feelgood movie.

OK many of them seem corny now but why do people think that every movie made has to be stark realism? I was tremendously impressed with Brad Pitt's performance. I'm a guy so I mean that and am not swooning over his looks. I had never seen him in anything before and had barely heard of him.  Anthony Hopkins was as always fantastic. In fact every single actor hit every single note with the possible exception of Henry Thomas. One of Aidan Quinn's best films also. The photography of Alberta is magnificent and I think no one can begrudge LOTF its cinematography Oscar.The film makers have an excuse for the occasional credibility lapse in that there is a story frame the recollections of One Stab the old Cree. This covers things like Susannah falling for Samuel who seemed to be an empty suit Tristan keeping his long hair while in the British Army etc. Excellent performance by Gordon Tootoosis by the way although his manner of speaking is very reminiscent of Chief Dan George.I highly recommend this film if you can watch it without trying to dislike it.".

The overall effect is disappointing when after spending a couple of hours with these characters you have no better understanding of their nature or what makes them tick. And yet despite poor motivation all of the actors do outstanding jobsfrom Brad Pitt to Henry Thomas to Aidan Quinn to Anthony Hopkinshats off for some fine acting. But at the core of the movie is a hollow factor that fails to touch base or explain the events. The jumps in continuity are a bit baffling.On the plus side the war scenes are especially realisticand it's nice to see Henry Thomas the boy from E.T. developing into a fine actor. The outdoor photography is awesome and the score by James Horner is an impressive one.

She is supposed to be in the 1910s yet she behaves like a very promiscuous 90s woman. If the movie had any grasp on historical realism this woman should have been ostracized from society end up as an outcast. Instead she jumps from bed to bed in her fiancee's house like there's no tomorrow and nobody seems to be bothered about it!The screenwriters add some characters to the story for the sole purpose to be killed and make our heroes look sad and puppyeyed. Literally! Otherwise someone please explain to me the character of Isabel in the movie. She doesn't even have two decent lines in the script!The worst element of the movie was the incredible amount of historical mistakes or anachronisms. There were too many to let you concentrate in this excuse for a plot. I'm a great enthusiast of movies that try to reflect an era and pay lots of attention to every detail. The erroneous details were so numerous that I would burst in laughter at times. And this movie was made by the director of a movie like Glory! From the way they talk to their apparel to the tools they use to every other detail the movie as bad as Titanic as far as historical accuracy is concerned.To illustrate with an example at a point in the movie Susannah Julia Ormond  pulls a portable photo reflexcamera on a tripod and takes idyllic pictures of the brothers in the Montana landscape... They are supposed to be in the 1910s1920s! Cameras were as big as a TV set! And portable reflex cameras were not available as consumer products until the 1950s! Anyone that knows a bit about photography probably caught that major goof!The movie is so plagued with goofs that makes it difficult for a serious moviegoer to concentrate on the story. I guess they really made the movie with one thing in mind milking the cash out of those teenage fans of Brad! There's no other explanation for this awful flick.Please avoid this movie at all costs if you don't like 3 hour long shampoo commercials with very very bad plots.

The three sons in Legends Of The Fall are Aidan Quinn Brad Pitt and HenryThomas chronologically. Quinn is the solid and reliable eldest who becomesone of Montana's Representatives in Congress. They usually had and still haveonly two of them. Henry Thomas can't get out from under being the baby ofthe family. The other two are constantly looking out for him.It's Brad Pitt as the middle son who is our brooding protagonist and the closestthing Pitt ever did on screen as a romantic idol. Brad's like something out ofone of those romance novels. The brothers start showing their differences when Henry Thomas brings homeJulia Ormond as his intended bride. She gets all their hormones in overdriveand when Thomas fails to return from World War I the rivalry between Pittand Quinn drives the rest of the film.Anthony Hopkins who served in the Indian wars in the cavalry was disillusionedby said conflicts and built his own empire where the native Indians share in itsbounty. His kids however grew up in the era of Theodore Roosevelt where you answered your country's call no matter what. And like TR all three Ludlowboys are imbued with the idealism of the Allied cause. All three go to Canadaand enlist in their army and defy their father. It all becomes a Greek tragedy of sorts in the end.The Oscar winning cinematography is just breathtaking. The vastness of God'searth will dazzle the viewer and you might become an instant conservationist.Legends Of The Fall also won an Oscar for ArtSet Design which is also wonderful and I think that TR's Sagamore Hill might have been a model used.Sad though that Hopkins Pitt Quinn and Ormond got no Oscar recognition for this film.

Don't expect just another period piece. Brad Pitt was delightful although it wasn't his best roleclose enough and I also really liked Aiden Quinn who put in an Oscar worthy performance. In fact I liked everybody. I would like to know why Julia Ormond did not become an instant star from this or at least get an Oscar nomination she was absolutely brilliant. My feeling is had this movie been made with a different more serious cast it would have received a lot more critical recognition. Picture Legends Of The Fallstarring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep.So many people lump Brad Pitt as a pretty boy ignoring the fact that he's a really good actor. In fact the performances by EVERYONE here are top notch. This movie is absolutely stirring and I've watched it so many times I've lost count. Everything from the characters  to the richly appropriate music to the almost unbelievably magnificent scenery and emotional power to the movie in general come together to create a movie that is very much unique in it's way. This beautiful tale had it all and though there is a lot of death and you will cry throughout the picture it shouldn't be missed if you haven't already seen it. 10 of 10.".

And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana where his father Colonel William Ludlow had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect.  Legends of the Fall' directed by Edward Zwick is the story of Tristan Brad Pitt and his brothers Alfred Aidan Quinn and Samuel Henry Thomas a tragic story of the life they shared and the wounds they suffered many of which were never to heal.  And it's their father's story as well for it was he who raised his boys with only the help of his loyal friend One Stab Gordon Tootoosis after his wife Isabel Christina Pickles unable to withstand the harsh Montana winters had left her family for the more civilized East Coast never to return.Colonel Ludlow Anthony Hopkins had served his country during the Indian Wars after which disheartened by the government's treatment of those they had suppressed the proud people of the Indian Nations he turned his back on the civilized' ways of his own people and carved out a niche for himself and his family in Montana.  And it was there on their ranch that the boys learned the ways of the West and the ways of the Indian under the tutelage of their father and One Stab.  But of the three only Tristan eventually heard that inner voice with such clarity that he could neither deny nor ignore it and it awakened a passion within him that he embraced and which set him upon the path he was seemingly destined to follow a path that would ultimately affect the lives of everyone he had ever loved.By 1914 Europe was at war and the very tenets of truth and justice that had driven Colonel Ludlow away from society now compelled his sons to take a stand according to their own beliefs.  Despite his recent engagement Samuel decides to go to Canada and enlist in the army in order to fight for England.  Alfred and Tristan refuse to let him go alone and enlist with him.  And in the desolate muddy trenches of France they soon learn the harsh truth and the reality of war just as their father had before them and by the time the war has ended for them their lives have changed forever Tristan's most especially.  Back home Tristan tries to settle down to life on the ranch but the restlessness of his soul speaks to him of things he must do and places he must go and the voices are too strong to resist.  So despite the ties that bind him to the home and the people he loves he sets out on a journey of selfdiscovery that eventually takes him physically and emotionally into places he never knew existed and away from the woman who loves him the most.Director Edward Zwick delivers a sweeping saga of life and love with this film that is every bit as big and grand as the country in which it is set. He presents his story through the recollections of One Stab the one who saw it all unfold first hand.  And it gives the film a narrative quality that is storytelling at it's best.  Zwick had a vision of how to bring this tale to the screen and he realized it magnificently aided by John Toll's breathtakingly beautiful cinematography for which he received an Oscar Lilly Kilvert's superb set designs and James Horner's compelling dramatic score.  And most importantly through the tremendous performances of Hopkins Pitt Quinn Thomas and the lovely Julia Ormond. Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance creating a threedimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses.  And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan watching him you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life.  Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred the older brother delivering an emotional and convincing performance as does Julia Ormond as Susannah a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers.  Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell and he managed to get it all from the principals to the least of the supporting players and it's all there on the screen the passion the intensity the love and the care.  It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.The supporting cast includes Karina Lombard Isabel Two Paul Desmond Decker Tantoo Cardinal Pet and Robert Wisden John T. O'Banion.  A visually stunning film that will touch you emotionally and stay with you long after the screen has gone dark Legends of the Fall' perpetuates the tradition of classics like The Big Country' and Giant.'  Engaging and memorable it's a transporting experience courtesy of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 1010.".

In that department I was disappointed it's basically a narrow love story that is clich and very formulaic. The constant emotional or dramatic music that plays in almost every scene starts to get annoying after a while as well. The main highlight of this film is the young Brad Pitt and the makers of this movie knows this as well and not because his character stood out or anything. But because it's the type of movie where the handsome man rides in with his horse and gets the female audiences to drool. The movie is basically about three brothers falling for the same girl and all the drama that goes with it. The story is also very slow moving and gets tedious after a while I enjoy some romance movie but I can't really say I really enjoyed this one all that much. The pacing is awkward like some scenes were cut due to length so I assume the book to probably be better. Some critics claim this movie is poetic but I just found it mostly corny.5.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I think director Edward Zwick has a massive inferiority complex . Primarily a maker of TV shows he sets out to make LEGENDS OF THE FALL the biggest cinematic epic the world had seen for many years and it goes without saying he fails  SPOILERS The story starts in 1914 in Montana where one of three Ludlow brothers  Samuel  is getting married to Susannah . All this is accompanied by great cinematography but the music is often intrusive and unwarranted . Not content with marrying a beautiful young woman Samuel and his two other brothers Alfred and Tristan enlist in the Canadian army to fight in the great war where Samuel dies . Alfred and Tristan return to the Montana landscapes where Alfred falls in love with Susannah but its Tristan who embarks on a sexual relationship with her to the strains of intrusive music  but then Tristan decides to become a hunter on a Pacific island  and after a few years he returns to find Susannah is now married to Alfred who is now a congressman Got the idea ? Got any of the ideas ? Theres so many ideas in the above paragraph to keep a Hollywood studio in business for several years . Oh and did I mention that were only half way through the film or that much of the film centres around Native American mystical mumbo jumbo ? This film makes THE DEER HUNTER look tightly plotted . And Im sure I missed something . In fact Im sure I missed everything because I cant recall how all these subplots tie in with each other . Whats the reason for the Ludlows being so Anglophile ? Why did Tristan decide to become a hunter ? Oh I forgot to mention that several other of the main characters die which means their relationship to plot becomes superflous in the end .So in the end LEGENDS OF THE FALL is an overproduced mess instead of the epic that Edward Zwick hoped it would be . Im sorry but sticking a bunch of massive subplots together and setting it to great cinematography and irritating music  And I cant tell you how annoying I found the music  most certainly does not make a great film".

	schema:headline " Degeneration of a lifestyle regeneration of a marriage";
	schema:reviewBody "In this film about work and marriage by 'Bread and Tulips'director Silvio Soldini a welloff Genoa couple has to face selfimage marriage and work problems when their financial world crumbles. Right after Elsa Margherita Buy of The Unknown Woman passes her graduate exams in art history and her husband and friends give her a big surprise party to celebrate the truth comes out. Michele Antonio Albanese reluctantly reveals to his wife that due to hard times corporate restructuring and his own stubbornness he's been pushed out of the firm he cofounded with Roberto Alberto Giusta and hasn't been working or receiving a salary for months. They're in debt. Everything has to change now.First off Elsa is furious at Michele for not telling her all this sooner. His judgment was that knowing would have made it hard for her to finish her graduate work but now that she has to know it angers her to have been lied to. Probably he was lying to himself but he's forgotten that marriage is a partnership.Neither Elsa nor Michele knows how to adjust. One night they go out to dinner with friends and Michele insists on paying even though the bill is over 300. Again Elsa is furious. Later she finds it impossible to speak frankly to her best friend Nadia Carla Signoris. It pains her to confront people now that one by one their status symbols are being removed. In the face of loss there's the typical denial. Everything seems shaky.Whether they're getting along or not their beautiful apartment must be sold. Their maid Daisy must go to take a full time job and they have to sell something to raise the money for her severance pay. Elsa has to give up her art restoration projectwhich was an adjunct to her graduate work and her passion but was unsalariedand find a parttime job in telemarketing and in the evenings fill in as secretary to a shipping company boss. They haven't told their grown daughter Alice Alba Rohrwacher about any of this. Relations with Alice are painful because Michele doesn't approve of Ricky Fabio Troiano the boyfriend she lives with. Later he is to get down off his high horse when he learns Ricky's not such a bad guy. For now they haven't told Alice.Michele looks for work but has a hard time accepting offers that are inevitably all below what he's been used to. This is another form of denial. One day he's desperate to do something anything. He takes a day job through an employment office delivering packages on a motorbikeand Alice sees him. So she finds out. Alice has previously used the money her parents had given her for university to open a restaurant. It's doing fine and she works there. Alice is torn between anger at Michele and serious concern for her parents.Michele has failed to take what turns out to be the best offer he's going to get so he falls into something utterly humble but somehow satisfying because it's physical. He does minor rehab work with two of his former employees Vito Giuseppe Battiston and Luciano Antonio Carlo Francini who were let go by his firm before he was. Signor Salviati Paolo Sassanelli the shipping boss Elsa secretaries for in the evenings has a weakness for her and keeps flirting. His attentions are all the more tempting with things so rocky in her marriage but she still resistsmostly. Michele gets increasingly depressed when Vito and Luciano get hired back in the shipping industry and he can't finish their rehab jobs on his own and no longer has their company. Now he doesn't even go to interviews and he has nothing to do but mope.This little Italian film's hard lessonthat economic disaster can happen to anybodycomes at all too good a time for an American audience. The question the film subliminally asks is to what extent relationships sense of self and peace of mind may all rest on a lifestylehow much economic security or its absence can change everything. Now that Elsa and Michele's days are full of clouds and their nerves are on edge and Elsa is exhausted from her new makedo jobs they get into fights easily. It's not certain their marriage will survive. After a fight Michele sleeps over one night with Ricky and Alice. This is when he sees that Ricky's a good guy. It's also clear now they're lucky Alice has made herself financially independent.Elsa's restoration project which we see her presenting during the opening credits involves unearthing a fresco that may be the work of an early renaissance painter she's interested in. Toward the end of the film she returns to the project and finds that her intuitions were correct. She's vindicated her professor is admiring and this becomes a metaphor for discovering a future. In the final scene Elsa and Michele agree to forget the past and move forward as best they can. Their losses have taken them back to basics and to honesty with each other and their daughter.While this starts with a premise like that of Laurent Cantet's 'Time Out' of a man hiding that he's been pushed out of the corporate world the development here is much more practical and everyday. The film succeeds because of a lack of tricky plot developments and the charisma and polish of Buy and Albanese. Soldini does a splendid job of evoking the uppermiddleclass lifestyle the couple lives in Genoa. Events are nervewracking because they're living so much on the edge. This is probably a more common situation than it used to be. It's not very hard to identify with the couple and feel the daytoday insecurity they suddenly live with. The security blanket is easily ripped. In a world of globalization and ever more rapacious capitalism the upper bourgeoisie is yet another new proletariat and 'Days and Clouds' is a sympathetic portrayal of what that may mean.".

	schema:reviewBody "Times are tough right now mirroring the era of The Great Depression. Financial security is a ghost friendships and relationships are tested by walking the razor edge of insolvency and according to the 'popular movie' polls the escape for many is in the darkened movie houses with comic hero or animal animated mindless safety net entertainment. Not so with the very brilliant film DAYS AND CLOUDS written with Doriana Leondeff Francesco Piccolo and Federica Pontremoli and directed with immaculate attention to detail by Silvio Soldini BREAD AND TULIPS etc. Soldini recreates the global financial nightmare in the form of an examination of one family's fracture and consequences. It resonates despite the depressing story offering a glimpse into the universal ties that bind us at this moment. Elsa Margherita Buy is graduating from Art History and Restoration school and seems to be a woman on top of her league complete with surprise gifts and a celebration staged by her husband Michele Antonio Albanese. Waking up the morning after her congratulations party Elsa is ill with a hangover but even more shocked when Michele breaks the news to her that he has been out of work for two months ashamed that he has lost his company and his job hiding in the couple's boat during the day. There is no money left and the couple must face losing their home and are forced to take on menial tasks to survive. Pride prevents the couple from sharing their financial downfall with friends and with their one child  Alice Alba Rohrwacher who has elected not to pursue education in favor of waiting tables in a restaurant she has invested in with friends. The tension of keeping the secret to themselves causes mounting friction between the couple and events that would have never happened had they shared their misfortune with friends and family bring their relationship to a near fatal end. How they survive is touched quietly and quickly and gently at film's end. Soldini spares no pain in the responses of his characters' misfortune but at the same time he allows each character to emerge from ideal married tropes to completely human victims of financial ruin. Buy and Albanese are triumphant in their performances as the married couple caught in the crumble of decline. But there are fine performances by Rohrwacher and Fabio Troiano as her lover Riki and Carla Signoris as Elsa's closest friend Nadia and actors playing two exemployees of Michele who provide a window of friendship in Michele's time of desperate need. The cinematography by Ramiro Cirita and the musical score blending opera and folk music by Giovanni Venosta enhance the motion of the film that though just under two hours in length appears more succinct. Silvio Soldini has taken a topic that affects us all and polished into a film that is bound to touch every viewer deeply. Highly recommended movie from The Film Movement. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Elsa and Michele are living a comfortable upper middle class life in Genoa ... until Michele is forced out of the company he cofounded. This film examines the effect this event has on Elsa Michele their daughter Alice and their friends. If you are a middle aged person with a good income then this film will probably touch a raw nerve since you would have to feel that this could happen to you if this has happened to you then you will likely doubly feel the pain.The film is brutally honest as it shows how Elsa and Michele give up their comforts one step at a time. After Elsa recovers from the initial shock she is quite practical in looking for work any kind of work. But it's different for Michele. He has been used to being the breadwinner and deals with serious issues like humiliation wounded pride and feelings of worthlessnessone day he was a key player in his work and family and the next day he feels he is nothing. He is so embarrassed that he cannot even reveal the truth to his daughter until she makes an independent discovery of it. Friendships are severely impacted. What has happened to Michele and Elsa has happened to thousands since the economic downturn and their reactions are not atypical but their story is laid out here in a very affecting manner.Antonio Albanese as Michele and Margherita Buy as Elsa turn in very believable performances. No great tricks in cinematography or time sequencing just straightforward solid filmmaking.Life goes on and people cope but I think it would be difficult to watch this film without responding to its intense emotional content. No matter what your status it's always hard to take several steps back. Money work and status are important and as illustrated in this film I think it is the unusual person who can withstand a serious blow in any one of those areas and come out the better for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Days and Clouds 2007Tender true and rather moving without being the slightest bit sentimental. This is a look at normal life in a way in modern Northern Italy the setting is Genoa. A fairly comfortable middle aged couple is going through a crisis as one loses a job and the money crunch adds to other everyday stresses.And that's it. Which is a lot when you realize that that's it. There will be no murder or shocking accidents no illness or surprise turn of events of any kind really. Which is why it draws you further and further gently with more humor than pathos until you really believe these people or these kind of people exist quite like this. It's not a random slice of life since there is certainly a core problem being scrutinized the loss of a job in midlife etc.. But in many ways the little events are so little in the cinematic sense they are just a small pageant for the viewer.So what makes it sing beyond the compelling restrained story is the acting above all the acting. The couple the husband and wife facing the crisis makes sense because the woman Margherita Buy and the man Antonio Albanese are so perfect at being imperfect. They don't push their crisis too hard nor do that have the ideal love at the beginning. What they show is the normal troubled tenderness and awkward anger of getting into such a situation.Besides a second thread following somewhat their daughter's life which has taken a less materialistic turn then the parents the movie adds a whole other element throughoutearly Renaissance art. The mother happens to have just finished belatedly her graduate degree in Italian art from the 1400s. And she is helping restore an obscure small ceiling painting somewhere else in town seeing it gradually reveal itself as the movie progresses. The reason this matters is it adds an element of beauty and idealism that is implied by the whole rest of the movie. That we all of us are not simply here to make ends meet and worry about money. And this something bigger call it art call it something spiritual inspired by art or inspiring art is what holds us up at times.So by the end the two aspectsthe mundane and the etherealmeld every so softly. Quite beautiful.".

And this something bigger call it art call it something spiritual inspired by art or inspiring art is what holds us up at times.So by the end the two aspectsthe mundane and the etherealmeld every so softly. Quite beautiful.";

Michele on the other hand has no leads or prospects in the horizon. Taking a job as a messenger delivering small packages takes him into an area where his daughter Alice discovers him riding a motorcycle to her complete shock and dismay.With the help of two former employees Michele decides to redo the new apartment where he and Elsa are forced to live after selling their own more palatial home. They are approached by tenants in the housing complex that see an affordable way to get their apartments more livable. Elsa in turn finds another parttime job as a secretary for an executive of a shipping company something that will make her vulnerable to the advances of her younger boss. Elsa and Michele's union seem to be heading for divorce or at least separation. Fortunately they find that in spite of all the things that have got in their way they cannot live without one another.Silvio Soldini whose Pane e tulipani impressed us is at it again with this story that recalls other films about the same subject. What distinguishes this picture from the rest is the well written story Mr. Soldini and his collaborators created for his audience notably the intense performances by Margherite Buy one of the best actresses working in the Italian cinema today and Antonio Albanese who makes a dramatic turn from his usual comedic roles. The director takes us to meet a couple during a crisis. We are drawn into their plight because both Elsa and Michele are real people whose pain is about to consume them. Fortunately for them they find strength in their predicament when some other couple would have packed it in as their predicament becomes all too evident.Genoa is captured in all its splendor by cinematographer Ramiro Civita. The music score plays well in the background the work of Giovanni Venosta. Ultimately it is Mr. Soldini's triumph for involving the viewer in a human situation that is not too far fetched and it feels real by the intense portrayal of the two principals and an excellent supporting cast.".

Crank and Duplicity and worst of all Surveillance were just making me feel sick or tired or both  sick and tired. Then I took a chance on one of those movies with a single box on the Blockbuster shelf. It had the usual ivy garland decoration that meant it had at least shown in some festival or other.I was reluctant to make the effort to view something at the end of a long engineering workday that required me to put my good glasses on and read subtitles and get into the rhythms and melodies of Italian. I'm accustomed to Spanish and French Japanese Chinese but Italian? Did I really want to go there? I am so glad I did.This movie reminds me of the French relationship movie from the 70s Cousin Cousine. It's an understated but starkly realistic look at two married people rediscovering their meaning to each other after a sudden dramatic change in their circumstance. The man something of a schlub has lost his job  forced out a company he cofounded. He is accustomed to being the boss and being powerful and now he's nothing.Even in his family dynamic with his daughter especially he tries to remain in control and be tough. His beautiful and brilliant wife has just earned an advanced degree in art history and is involved in a major project of her own devising.

	schema:reviewBody "Howards End is certainly one of the best films of the last decade.  I have seen this film several times over the past 7 years and each time I find myself in complete awe.  I love how its intricate story gradually unfolds layer by layer involving us more and more with the characters.  Howards End also boasts breathtaking cinematography by Tony PierceRoberts and a rousing and rueful musical score by Richard Robbins.The ensemble cast is perhaps the best reason to see this film.  Emma Thompson won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance and deservedly so! This is her best performance and her best film in my opinion.  I loved watching the character development in her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel as she transforms from an openminded intellectual to a classconscious social climber.  What's remarkable is that we still feel for her greatly as she is going through this transition.  She still remains a sympathetic character up until the very end when she slowly comes back to her senses.Anthony Hopkins also gives one of his best performances as the cold and hypocritical Henry Wilcox.  So many scenes shed different lights onto his character.  The scene where he proposes to Margaret stands out in particular.  There is plenty of erotic tension but at the same time it almost feels like he is making some sort of impersonal business venture with her.  Vanessa Redgrave is a presence to behold as the fragile Ruth Wilcox.  Her performance may be brief but it leaves an indelible mark particularly in later scenes when Margaret visits Howards End.  Helena Bonham Carter should have gotten an Oscar nomination for her performance.  She really has great depth and passion that is wellsuited to her character.  The rest of the supporting cast is superb.  Even the minor characters like Nicola Duffet's Jackie Bast and Jemma Redgrave's stonyfaced Evie Wilcox are noteworthy.Howards End is one of the richest most nuanced films I have seen.  It is beautifully shot wellacted and exquisitely directed.  It deserves to be considered a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "The literary period piece is a difficult genre to master requiring a difficult balancing between restraint and flowing emotion.  Few films effectively achieve this as beautifully as  MerchantIvory's astounding HOWARDS END making it probably the best period film of the 1990's.  The film juxtapositions the intellectual emotionally unhindered Schlegel sisters against the restrained imperious Wilcox family and for good measure mixes in the differing attitudes toward class emerging early in the century.  What could quite easily have been a dry study in the cultural dynamics of preWWI England becomes an enveloping tale thanks in no small part to the performances by Hopkins Emma Thompson and Vanessa Redgrave whose Ruth Wilcox remains enigmatic after every viewing.

	onyx:emotionText "The literary period piece is a difficult genre to master requiring a difficult balancing between restraint and flowing emotion.  Few films effectively achieve this as beautifully as  MerchantIvory's astounding HOWARDS END making it probably the best period film of the 1990's.  The film juxtapositions the intellectual emotionally unhindered Schlegel sisters against the restrained imperious Wilcox family and for good measure mixes in the differing attitudes toward class emerging early in the century.  What could quite easily have been a dry study in the cultural dynamics of preWWI England becomes an enveloping tale thanks in no small part to the performances by Hopkins Emma Thompson and Vanessa Redgrave whose Ruth Wilcox remains enigmatic after every viewing.  The emotions ringing through by film's end  not to mention its astoundingly pointed social criticism  give the film its power a power missing even from Forster's rambling distant novel.  And this story is nestled amongst some of the most beautiful art direction music and cinematography to ever grace the screen.

From the opening credits superimposed over Vanessa Redgrave's skirt sweeping through the wet grass and flowers around Mrs. Wilcox's beloved Howards End through to the final image of rural bliss the cinematography is perfection.  The costuming is amazing the screenplay is adept and the acting is stellar to say the least.  To have Emma Thompson Helena Bonham Carter Vanessa Redgrave and Anthony Hopkins in one movie together is to see a true synthesis of talent not to mention James Wilby and Samuel West.  The scene where Leonard Bast goes walking into the field of blue flowers is breathtaking. I recommend this film to anyone who loves Forster and who loves painterly cinematography.  Also it is full of the finest performances by all of the actors involved.".

However I disliked this movie on first viewing several years ago. In retrospect I can see that I was not reacting to the movie but my intense dislike for Anthony Hopkins' character.I watched it again the other night and was absolutely blown away by it. What a film! Emma Thompson won Best Actress for her performance and she did her usual terrific job but frankly I was more impressed by the performance of Helena Bonham Carter. The style of the film is magnificent.This is a story like most of E. M. Forster's about the injustices of class distinctions. However with a subtlety that I missed on my first viewing this film is also about karma what goes around  comes around and a story of social progress. This film is set in a time when society is coming out of the Victorian age and into the Edwardian. You see contrasts of the past thinking with the progressive thinking all through the movie. A visual metaphor is repeated over and over the turning of cranks whether it be on a newfangled morse code machine a vintage car or the wheels of a mighty locomotive. I believe that this represents both karma and progress forces which Forster sees as unstoppable as the laws of nature.This is an incredible story and an incredible piece of filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here is another example of what the British are best at in filmmaking. Based on E.M. Forster's novel Return to Howards End' this film is more or less a set piece in the strictest periodpiece tradition and thus in style is somewhat akin to that great TV series Return to Brideshead' and even Robert Altman came up trumps with his splendid Gosford Park' which most definitely takes its wellearned place alongside such classical pieces of this genre. Likewise Howards End' relies heavily on British actors who have worked their way up through live theatre it is here that you get the best interpretations the best performances admirably shown in so many films made on both sides of the Atlantic. If Vanessa Redgrave has long since been a legend among British actresses Emma Thompson is no lesser performer and as to the pedigree of Helena BonhamCarter there can be no arguing. Anthony Hopkins is at least up to the mark in his always sober readings in these kinds of films.The BonhamCarter family were well known in the fashionable circles of 1930's London highsociety life for their extravagant soires and philanthropic sponsoring of young artists especially musicians similarly to the Sitwell family from their Chelsea home. Thus it is hardly surprising that Helena BonhamCarter finds these kinds of rles admirably suited to her  A Room with a View anything Shakespearean among other select comedies'. Prunella Scales is a grand old lady of theatre cinema and television and I can remember her offerings back in the late fiftiesearly sixties especially on radio programmes. Beautifully filmed in mostly Oxfordshire and in several places in London the film also has a few scenes on the coast possibly Dorsetshire or more probably the south coast of Devon surprisingly not included in IMDb's very detailed listing of locations. Richard Robbins' music seemed to be heavily influenced by Philip Glass at times which seemed a misfit though it was nice to hear a few snatches by Percy Grainger as well as a version for four hands on the piano of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony possibly one of those tremendous transcriptions which Franz Liszt carried out.The dialogues are mostly exquisitely delivered with that peculiarly British panache and timing though slightly spoiled in this recent reviewing as there were some untimely cuts on the copy in question. However the story holds its line and is faithful to E.M. Forster's original concept. He has long been one of the greatest of British novelists with such works as A Passage to India' Where Angels Fear to Tread' and A Room with a View' to his credit for serious readers of real literature.This film version maintains that seriousness for people interested in real playacting.".

What a great trip back to early 20th Century Britain.  The film moves briskly but in some ways we're experiencing some time gaps in a slow slow manner the outdoor scenes are great and almost multisensory.  This highly atmospheric film also includes a great ensemble cast headed by Emma Thompson.  The film never underestimates the intelligence of the audience and forces us to confront even our own class discriminations!  Well worth a VHS or DVD rental sorry I can't give any comments on DVD extras as I borrowed this free from our local library.  Keep a copy of the book handy and notice the masterful interweaving done by Ruth Prawar Jandhlava.  Life when fully realized is about much more than consumerist illusions and brief ownership by a selfish few.

	schema:headline " Howard's End or the Beginning of a New Order ...";
	schema:reviewBody "It is quite interesting that the French title says Return to Howard's End as if this addition pointed out the inexorable path of life that would allow the central character Margaret Shlegel Emma Thompson to own the very house she was once deprived of. Indeed when Ruth Wilcox Vanessa Redgrave left in her deathbed Howard's End to her new friend Margaret the Wilcoxes couldn't believe she had all her mind so they burnt the paper. Yet a series of separate episodes converged to the final inheritance making up for the first injustice. The French title might mislead by making think the film focuses on Margaret while it's about a whole ensemble powerfully representing British classes circa 1910. And as the original title suggests the focus is Howard's End not the estate but the symbol of the aristocracy's rural roots. The film fittingly opens with Ruth Wilcox wondering alone in the park with this kind of intimate connection we feel in the places we grew up in. And the sadness that inhabits her heart is palpable. She's obviously misunderstood since no Wilcox understands Howard's End too busy socializing and partying during that very night.At the same night Helen Shlegel Margaret's sister Helena Bonham Carter falls in love with the younger Wilcox son but it wouldn't outlast the night. The opening incident is amusing but like every detail in the film not insignificant it informs us that the Shlegels are of a German background from their father they are welleducated middleclass bourgeois highly fond on arts and intellectuals. A few months later to make up for the whole misunderstanding caused by her sister Margaret finally meets Ruth Wilcox in the neighboring house in London and a brief but poignant friendship begins. Ruth discovers Margaret's social life but also a woman of ideas of artistic taste not blinded by wealth like the Wilcoxes so she can see the value of Howard's End And Margaret falls immediately in love with the house during a visit where she also catches the eye of Mr Wilcox Anthony Hopkins as the shy wellmannered but quite abrupt businessman again a polar opposite to Emma Thompson's temperament but isn't that what makes their interactions so irresistible? When Ruth Wilcox dies with her final wish Mr Wilcox feels like he owes a gesture to Margaret some help to find a house. They end up marrying each other in probably the most awkward proposal from any film. Their union celebrates the constant symbiosis between the old aristocracy and the new enlightened bourgeoisie but the portrait of the British classes would have been incomplete without lower people. And this is where the Basts enrich the film. Sam West is Leonard Bast a young and educated clerk leaving with Jackie a vulgarian we suspect to have a troubled past. Bast strikes as a taciturn sickly and insecure man and after another incident involving a lost umbrella the Shlegel sisters grow rapidly fond on him especially the fiery Helen. But victim of their good intentions the sisters ask Mr Wilcox for advice he suggests Bast leaves his company before the bankruptcy. Not only Bast leaves his job but the previous company prospers and the second fires him. Bast who was poor ends up in a worse situation. Helen can't accept Wilcox' lack of remorse and brings the ill fated Bast and his wife to the Wilcox daughter's wedding party. And while indulging herself to some punch drinking Jackie recognizes Mr Wilcox and his gay old habits. The dynamics of the film is constantly driven by incidents it's all about the serene and honorable standard of the British upper classes perturbed by wakeup calls. This one illustrates the pervert interactions between the rich and the poor the same Wilcox who didn't shed a tear for Bast for the poor are the poor and one's sorry for them didn't care of abusing an underage woman. Margaret forgives Wilcox but Helen can't forgive herself to have caused Bast' descent to poverty she stays close to him. So close that we're not surprised a few months later to find her pregnant for the ultimate plot device that highlighted the British system's greatest sin hypocrisy. Helen is in the same position than Jackie was because of Wilcox yet Wilcox forbids her to stay in Howard's End. The rich demonstrates an incredible zeal when the poor degrade British values while their noble status launder all their faults. Wilcox no matter how well mannered and intentioned he is wouldn't allow Helen to stay. And while his marriage comes to a deadend a failure to communicate it's like Ruth's own spectra commanded the irresponsible Charles the most foolish thing to do. Enthralled by his new ownership Charles confronts Bast and inadvertently kills him leaving his father in a desperate need of Margaret more than ever. The loop is looped and Howard's End reveals itself to be more than a story of inheritance and property it's a magnificent Oscarwinning screenplay made of sumptuously interlocking stories that paint an insightful and incisive portrait of the British classes their interactions and perceptions. And the ending translates into a fictional story the very future of Britain an aristocratic house left to a bourgeois and who's going to benefit of it? The son of a poor man. Howard's End is not just a riveting story carried by superb performances Emma Thompson totally deserved her Oscar as the sweet caring but strongwilled Margaret it's also the magnificent epitaph of an old order in the same intensity and human resonance than Gone With the Wind like only the IvoryMerchant could have produced. Speaking of them I'm glad I watched it after The Remains of the Day for the magnificent chemistry between Hopkins and Thompsons probably the defining onscreen duo of the 90's both nominated 4 times in this very decade made up for their previous inhibitions.".

But if you really sit back and watch the story unfold you will become engrossed. The crafting of the story by Merchant Ivory is impeccable. They tell the story so visually that you may not notice how physically alike Margaret Schlegel is to Ruth Wilcox in carriage and deportment but the lightbulb goes off when the housekeeper of Howard's End mistakes Margaret for Ruth. The story itself is so quiet and brilliant that you don't realize something so very profound has happened until the credits roll. Every performance is amazing but Emma Thompson she won the Best Actress Oscar and Vanessa Redgrave stand out. Their scenes together are so full of nuances that it's hard to take it all in during a first viewing.".

Even that early time there were many who saw Germany as a potential foe.These two Schlegel sisters played by Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter befriend the Wilcoxes a family of newly rich plutocrats headed by Anthony Hopkins who seem to be a version of Lillian Hellman's the Hubbards lite. Their mother is the class of the family and she's played by Vanessa Redgrave who is in poor health.While BonhamCarter is rejected by Hopkins's son James Wilby as a suitable wife for marriage Vanessa befriends Thompson finding her to be a kindred intellectual spirit in a house full of moneygrubbers. In fact before she dies she writes an unsigned note asking that a cottage that's in her family's name called Howards End be given to the Schlegel sisters. When Hopkins and the rest of the family find the note after she's dead it gets torn up and burned. Unsigned it has no probative value in any event.But as fate would have it Thompson and Hopkins get into a relationship and they soon marry and she tries to polish some of the rough edges off him. Especially in regard to snobbery. Hopkins is the kind of man who wants no reminders of where he came from. Particularly with another of the Schlegel sisters friends a young clerk named Leonard Bast played by Samuel West trying to make his way in the world as the Wilcoxes have.Emma Thompson won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Howards End that year and the film also won Oscars for ArtSet Direction and for adapted screenplay. Though Thompson won the Oscar my absolute favorite in this film is Susie Lindeman as Mrs. Dolly Bast. She's so incredibly common and obviously holding him back you can't blame West for eventually getting involved with BonhamCarter which leads to tragedy.The team of Ismail Merchant producer and James Ivory director succeed again at bringing the look and manners of Edwardian England as seen by E.M.

	schema:reviewBody "The very carefully considered style of the E M Forster adaptations became a trademark for the MerchantIvory productions covering three of the six novels that substantially conveyed outmoded worlds full of luxury and privilege yet are somehow repellently distasteful.  Howard's End' is a good case in point drawing on Edwardian affluence via inheritance and commerce liberalminded progressive women and the undertrodden working class that supports them.  Forster tellingly borrows the name of the brothers August and Friedrich Schlegel leading German poets critics and philosophers in the first half of the 19th Century whose work formed the basis of German romanticism.  With his Schlegels' binationality of British and German but not the 'dreadful sort' as Forster is keen to stress he addresses his aversion to xenophobia in the years leading up to the First World War.  Stephen Farber argues that Ivory's film technique has the possible limitation of failing to do justice to the mythical dimension of Forster's novel that employed the primeval symbolism of a wychelm to echo England's past.  In the film a spreading chestnut tree complete with pigs' teeth substitutes for the wychelm and serves no more significance than as a marker on the way to the garage. Yet Primeval Man is clearly alive and well nearly a century later with the world stage replaying the events of one of mankind's sorriest episodes culminating in the carnage of the Great War. Wars terrorism famine HIV SARS and other mysterious killer bugs stalk the Earth whilst the Serbian Prime Minister is assassinated in the Balkans.Confusion over an umbrella leads a young man teetering on the edge of social and financial obscurity into an altogether different world beyond his dreams.   In a fatalistic manner the feminine household of the Schlegels full of art and literature collides with the masculine and commercial house of Wilcox ultimately making neither easy bedfellows nor a home for the other.  In his desire to better himself through literature Leonard Bast Samuel West inadvertently stumbles into this world and ends up developing an unwise relationship with the waywardly enchanting Helen Schlegel Helena BonhamCarter.  It is after all Helen in the original story who discusses death with Leonard and adapts Michelangelo with the prophetic Death destroys a man the idea of Death saves him.  Some familiar chords are struck here with the 'sense and sensibility' of Jane Austen's Dashwood sisters in the novel of that phrase when Helen censures Margaret Emma Thompson for her betrothal to all that the younger sister deems cold and stifling.  The comparison is further illuminated by Thompson's portrayal of the restrained elder sister in Ang Lee's masterful film of Austen's novel three years later.  The double standards of male behaviour are realised at the wedding of Margaret and Henry Wilcox Anthony Hopkins as the inebriated gatecrasher Mrs Bast Nicola Duffett recognises the gentleman groom from her former life whilst he in turn will not have the unwed and expectant Helen stay at the empty Howard's End'.   The arrogance and bigotry of the Wilcoxs and the interference of the Schlegels for their disadvantaged friend eventually conspire in his demise.It is possible to draw a parallel of Charles Wilcox's attack on Leonard Bast with Jordan's culture of crimes of honour with the killing in August 2002 of a pregnant and unmarried woman by her brother after being encouraged by family and friends and of the stabbing of a daughter by her father as detailed in Norma Khouri's Forbidden Love' a fate that befalls some 5000 women a year.  How can it be that these abominable acts are a product of a society that is governed by harsh inhumane religious rules?  What twisted sense of perspective says it is right to destroy two lives to address a bizarre sense of shame arising from a naturalistic occurrence where correct' protocols were not followed?   The sad conclusion has to be drawn that though the rest of us suffer from his devastation Primeval Man lives untouched by evolution and is in no danger of extinction.Vanessa Redgrave is touchingly charming as the nave Mrs Wilcox who bequeaths her beloved Howard's End to Miss Schlegel though in none too an official manner which leads to the plot's convolutions.  Incidentally the actress has recently received a Tony for the Broadway revival of Long Day's Journey into Night' and contributed her considerable thoughts on Anthony and Cleopatra' for Faber's excellent Actors on Shakespeare' series published in June of last year.  Thompson's superlative performance justly earned her an Oscar yet perhaps the greatest of her career are to be found in her unrequited housekeeper in Remains of the Day' in 1993 and in her exceptional tour de force as the bluestocking dying of cancer in Mike Nichols' brilliant if uncomfortable Wit' in 1999.  Hopkins is awesome as the shrewd businessman unable to connect with people whilst Joseph Bennett as Paul Jemma Redgrave as Evie James Wilby a veteran from other Forster adaptations as Charles and Susie Lindeman Lilian's Story' and recently onstage in Hammerklavier' his twittering wife Dolly are all perfectly too ghastly as the detestable offspring.  BonhamCarter improves on her Lucy Honeychurch in the earlier Room with a View' to provide the disruptive free spirit of Helen that so changes every life she comes into contact with whilst West's Leonard is a memorable study of the downtrodden that the gods have determined to destroy.  The film also garnered Oscars for Ruth Prawer Jhabvala for her screenplay and Luciana Arrighi and Ian Whitakker for art direction whilst Richard Robbins and Tony PierceRoberts were nominated for original music and best cinematography.  The same production team collaborated in the following year's admirable Remains of the Day' that frustratingly missed out at the Oscar and Bafta awards.The overarching theme for E M Forster as etched onto the title page of the Penguin edition is Only connect. and the skilled filmmakers have succeeded splendidly in this adaptation in spanning the bridge to connect the viewer to the characters in their distant world.".

The story initially focuses on Helena Bonham Carter's Helen a middle class lady who is involved with the upper class Joseph Bennett but unable to marry him because of his issues with his family. By chance Carter's sister Margaret Emma Thompson meets the ailing matriarch of Bennett's family a very subtle and gentle Vanessa Redgrave who sees something special in the classy Margaret.

Carter and Thompson's friendship with a struggling clerk Samuel West causes all sorts of issues especially when West's common wife Nicola Duffett comes to a wedding gets drunk and reveals a past with Hopkins. This becomes a story then not only of a family deception but the ties that bind all mankind either through obligation unexpected human interaction or in Hopkins and Duffett's case a brief lust that tears away at him because of the differences in their social standing. West struggles not only to try and find a new position after his suddenly ends but with his feelings for Carter as well and his disgust in his marriage to Duffett. The socalled polite upper class becomes murderous in a shocking twist towards the end and this explodes into many questions of what exactly is good breeding and who has it.Powerful performances by a magnificent cast gives this family drama a mesmerizing feel just as dramatic as all six seasons of Downton Abbey whittled down to two and a half hours. There are comic bits here and there that prevent the film from becoming too staid and the setup of gentle matriarch Vanessa Redgrave making you care about what happens to her will require the need of Kleenex near by as her light fades and the story moves into new directions. Hopkins playing a very conflicted man shows all the human dimensions that makes this character very real whether grieving over a wife he really didn't spend too much time caring about it seems in life facing his own ordeal as an adulterer or unable to forgive himself both for cheating keeping the truth away from Thompson and lastly realizing what a bunch of greedy selfish offspring he's raised. Prunella Scales is very funny in a small part as Carter and Thompson's no nonsense aunt. Carter and Thompson are wonderfully cast as sisters and while Thompson has the meatier part Carter is impressive as well. She's moved on from A Room With a View to showing here all the tricks she'll later pull out in her character parts in Tim Burton movies. Thompson deservedly winning an Oscar is an actress of such gifts and from the moment you meet her she's somebody you'll want as a friend as much as Redgrave did. She faces tragedy with such dignity being independent and resourceful yet willing to stand by her man no matter how bad things become because she sees the truths that most humans are blind to. It's the writing surrounding these characters that make Howard's End a joy to revisit and while the country home may not be immense like Downton Abbey you can see why Redgrave adored it and would only want to see it in the hands of somebody she knew would treasure it like she did.".

It is a film I have grown to like more and more over the years.This isn't dull and overly quiet Edwardiania. Unlike Greece England has no true mythology says Margaret Schlegel Emma Thompson during the film. Yet Edwardian England and the literature it spawned is almost a 20th Century English mythology.

	schema:reviewBody "E. M. Forster began his novel Howards End with the epigram Only connect words which have been interpreted as a plea for a greater degree of imaginative sympathy between people of different social classes and just as importantly between people with different attitudes to life. The book tells the story of three Edwardian families the Wilcoxes the Schlegels and the Basts. Although Leonard Bast and his wife Jacky are from a workingclass background there is not much difference in socio economic terms between the other two families both part of the wellto do bourgeoisie. There is however a big difference in their outlooks. The cultured artistic and intellectual Schlegels of German extraction represent old money. Forster borrowed their surname from the Schlegel brothers German writers and philosophers. The Wilcoxes by contrast represent new money. The father of the family Henry is a selfmade businessman and he and his three children are far more interested in business and making money than they are in culture or the arts. The Howards End of the title is the Wilcoxes' family home a large farmhouse belonging to Henry's wife Ruth who is more in sympathy with the artistic outlook of the Schegels than the rest of her family. She becomes a close friend of Margaret the oldest of the three Schlegel siblings. In the meantime Margaret's younger sister Helen has befriended Leonard Bast a clerk in an insurance company who shares her reverence for high culture. They meet at a lecture on Beethoven. The story then follows the complications arising from these two friendships. This film was the last entry in the cinema's great Forster cycle of the eighties and early nineties a period which saw filmed versions of five of his six novels. It was the third adaptation of a Forster novel by Merchant Ivory Productions following A Room with a View and Maurice. In my view it is together with A Room with a View the best film of the Forster cycle for a number of reasons. The first is that the MerchantIvory style of filmmaking with its meticulous concern for period detail and its gentle unhurried method of storytelling seems admirably suited to the works of Forster. David Lean's grand epic manner was never an ideal match for A Passage to India a novel which although it deals with political questions concentrates on intimate personal relationships rather than the great historical events which formed the subjectmatter of Lean's other late works. Charles Sturridge tried to imitate the MerchantIvory method in Where Angels Fear to Tread but could never quite bring it off. The second is the remarkable number of great performances which James Ivory was able to elicit from his cast. The film only won one acting Oscar Emma Thompson for Best Actress but there were a number of other acting contributions of equal quality. Anthony Hopkins was perhaps not going to win a second Oscar so soon after The Silence of the Lambs the previous year but to my mind he deserved Best Actor far more than Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman. Whether he deserved it more than Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven is perhaps another matter. Hopkins succeeds well in his difficult task of bringing out the two sides of Henry's personality. On the one hand he is arrogant snobbish and autocratic but on the other Hopkins needs to imply a hidden more likable side to him if the audience is to accept him as Margaret's husband. The two marry after Ruth's death. Helena Bonham Carter was wellknown around this period for her acting in period dramas she had appeared in two earlier Forster adaptations A Room with a View and Where Angels Fear to Tread. There is a nice contrast between her Helen passionate impetuous and rash and Thompson's calmer more measured Margaret. Helen has a strong social conscience which Margaret seems to lack and at first comes across as the more sympathetic of the two sisters yet Helen's wellintentioned interventions in other people's lives can have disastrous unintended consequences. As for Thompson she gives an object lesson in the art of portraying a quiet reserved character without making her dull or uninteresting. Thompson and Hopkins were to act together in another MerchantIvory drama the following year The Remains of the Day. Other excellent performances come from Vanessa Redgrave as Ruth Wilcox James Wilby as Henry and Ruth's pompous overbearing older son Charles and Samuel West as Leonard Bast. Bast is a tragic figure he is clearly highly knowledgeable and intelligent but because of his humble social origins is unable to put his intelligence to good use and is patronised and mistreated by those who consider themselves his social betters. He is also held back by his wife who shares neither his intelligence nor his aspirations. The third reason why the film works so well is the way in which it brings out the themes of the excellent novel on which it is based and makes them relevant to the 1990s without ever labouring the point. The story might be set in the 1910s yet its themes of the contrasting values of business and culture of unemployment of wealth and poverty are still relevant even today. Henry Wilcox might be a figure from the Edwardian era yet in 1992 his values would have seemed very familiar to those who had just lived through the boom years of the greed is good eighties. Leonard Bast recalls those who lost their jobs when that boom turned to bust. Even Helen the woolly but wellmeaning member of the liberal Guardian reading classes is a familiar figure to modern viewers. British heritage cinema and the work of MerchantIvory in particular is sometimes criticised as a mere exercise in sentimental nostalgia with no relevance to modern times. Howard's End serves as the best possible refutation of that sort of criticism. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the finest films ever made a testament to director James Ivory's unique sensitivity and genius. Of course he started with a great novel by E. M. Forster which always helps. But the screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvlala does it complete justice as was always the case with her magnificent writing for the screen. I recently watched this again for the first time in years. My seeing performances of this story began with a London stage production long ago where Gemma Jones was so brilliant in the role of the younger Schlegel sister played here by Helena Bonham Carter. This tale is so powerful and dramatic that it lends itself to novel stage and screen with equal facility. The story is bitingly savagely critical of the hypocrisy and social injustice of England a century ago. This film's luminous centre is given it from the very first opening travelling shot where Vanessa Redgrave is seen and followed as she roams in the twilight through her beloved garden at her house Howard's End which she had inherited from her brother who died and where she was born. Ivory avoids needless lighting and we can barely make her out sometimes as she looks lovingly upon the flowers the tree branches and smells the redolent air taking in the scents of early night. She stands outside looking into the drawing room through the open bow window and is absorbing the adored atmosphere of the home she loves above all else in the world. Although she dies rather early in the film Redgrave as Ruth Wilcox is radiant mystical supernatural in her mysterious performance and she gives that inescapable tone of an underlying reality of a concealed fate beneath the surface of events which make this film so utterly magical. All of the major performances are sensationally brilliant. Anthony Hopkins is so convincing as a crisp matteroffact man of business who is in denial of all deeper feelings. Emma Thompson is at her most glorious as the infectiously irreverent and joyously alive older sister to the more serious Helena Bonham Carter. But in their scenes together they convey the carefree and heedless sisterliness of a joyful and playful household they chatter together like magpies who have known each other since birth they play they joke they romp and truly they have captured on film exactly what such people could be like in those days. I knew groups of sisters like that as late as the 1960s and even the 1970s before that terminal social decay set in which destroyed all real joy in people's home lives and eradicated all such spontaneity and innocent fun in the drawing room. Every scene of this film reeks of authenticity and screams out 'I'm really happening!' Or at least 'Such things happened once!' Every scene of this film is composed so perfectly the costumes are so exquisite the art direction and production design are sensational beyond even the words of E. M. Forster to describe. The music is chosen so sensitively. Every breath is choreographed in this sumptuous spectacle of a lost world. As you watch this you keep thinking there is only one James Ivory. And he truly is an ivory in the lapidary sense for he and everything he touches are carved by the gods.".

Ivory avoids needless lighting and we can barely make her out sometimes as she looks lovingly upon the flowers the tree branches and smells the redolent air taking in the scents of early night. She stands outside looking into the drawing room through the open bow window and is absorbing the adored atmosphere of the home she loves above all else in the world. Although she dies rather early in the film Redgrave as Ruth Wilcox is radiant mystical supernatural in her mysterious performance and she gives that inescapable tone of an underlying reality of a concealed fate beneath the surface of events which make this film so utterly magical. All of the major performances are sensationally brilliant. Anthony Hopkins is so convincing as a crisp matteroffact man of business who is in denial of all deeper feelings. Emma Thompson is at her most glorious as the infectiously irreverent and joyously alive older sister to the more serious Helena Bonham Carter. But in their scenes together they convey the carefree and heedless sisterliness of a joyful and playful household they chatter together like magpies who have known each other since birth they play they joke they romp and truly they have captured on film exactly what such people could be like in those days. I knew groups of sisters like that as late as the 1960s and even the 1970s before that terminal social decay set in which destroyed all real joy in people's home lives and eradicated all such spontaneity and innocent fun in the drawing room. Every scene of this film reeks of authenticity and screams out 'I'm really happening!' Or at least 'Such things happened once!' Every scene of this film is composed so perfectly the costumes are so exquisite the art direction and production design are sensational beyond even the words of E. M. Forster to describe. The music is chosen so sensitively. Every breath is choreographed in this sumptuous spectacle of a lost world. As you watch this you keep thinking there is only one James Ivory. And he truly is an ivory in the lapidary sense for he and everything he touches are carved by the gods.";

Story of two sisters and how they choose separate pathsone leading to radicalism and exile in Germany the other taking a more conventional road.Emma Thompson won a deserved Oscar as Margaret the sensible older sister who finds love late in life. Helena Bonham Carter is Helen the younger more passionate sister who embraces truth as radicalism. Anthony Hopkins is Wilcox the ruthless businessman who marries Margaret after the death of his wifea luminous Vanessa Redgrave.Two events set things in motion here the death of Ruth who has befriended Margaret and the stolen umbrella that brings Leonard Bast Samuel West into the sisters' lives. The two events begin the rift between the sisters. As Margaret is drawn into the family life of Wilcox she distances herself from the intellectual pursuits of her younger days Helen on the other hand is drawn into the Basts' lives and becomes more and more radical.The period detail is flawless as expected in a MerchantIvory film. The acting is terrific across the board and the adaptation of the Forster novel is perfect. The film looks at such tensions as the industrial revolution vs agrarian England intellectualism vs truth academia vs business etc. And there is always the English question of social standing.Thompson is great as Margaret. She's funny talkative sad and honest. Bonham Carter is also very good as the younger more direct sister. Hopkins is solid as the callus business man of the Empire. Redgrave is a marvel as the fading Ruth. Her opening scene wandering through the dusky garden is wonderful and sets the tone for city vs. country.James Wilby always underrated is detestable as the older Wilcox son. Samuel West is terrific as Leonard. Prunella Scales is funny as the sisters' aunt. Jemma Redgrave is the nasty Evie. Nicola Duffett is sad as Jacky Bast. Adrian Ross Magenty is the bookish brother. Simon Callow has a cameo as a lecturer. And Susie Lindeman is funny is the dim Dolly.Just a beautiful film. It's mythic and gentle and haunting. Indeed myth is yet another topic here. The country folk embed pig's teeth in tree trunks so that the bark can be used as a cure for toothache..... Filled with great moments and great acting from Thompson Redgrave West Hopkins and Bonham Carter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Merchant Ivory's 1992 masterpiece Howards End is based on E.M Forrester's novel about snobbery and friction between the English classes. The story concerns itself with the middleclass Schlegal sisters Margaret Emma Thompson and Helen Helena Bonham Carter. Seems Helen had once put it into her head to fall in love with Paul Wilcox Joseph Bennett the son of an affluent family presided over by stalwart patriarch Henry Anthony Hopkins and the fragile and whimsical Ruth Vanessa Redgrave. The romance is short lived and considered an embarrassment amongst the Wilcoxes who marry off Paul to a woman of his own social standing. However upon Ruth's death Henry pursues a romantic relationship with Margaret that eventually blossoms into marriage. Prior to her death Ruth had left the family's country estate  Howards End  to Margaret in her will.But Henry and the family have decided that this will never do and do not tell Margaret about her inheritance. Henry's family including Paul his other son Charles James Wilby daughter Evie Jemma Redgrave and daughterinlaw Dolly Susie Lindeman do not approve of their father's dalliances with Margaret and even less of the resulting marriage. Enter Leonard Bast Samuel West  a poor cockney working in a bank. Through a series of misadventures he befriends Helen  a pairing that will eventually lead to his demise. Leonard is instructed by Margaret and Helen to decamp for another position at the insistence of Henry  who has ulterior motives that concern his own indiscretions with Leonard's wife Jackie Nicola Duffett.Ruth Prawler Jhabvala's brilliant screenplay never allows the pace of all these intrigues to lapse interweaving lust desire contempt and disaster into a seamless and exhilarating blend. James Ivory directs with panache for elegance and stylishly glamorous film making in the vein of the very best from Hollywood's golden age.Sony Classics originally made Howards End available in a bare bones anamorphic transfer that was very nicely rendered. Now Criterion has put out its own deluxe edition at a more than deluxe price. The transfer  while being advertised as newly remastered is on par with the previously issued disc  showing only marginal improvements in film grain reduction and perhaps a tad more saturation in colors. Colors on both editions are bold vibrant and nicely contrasted. Blacks are deep velvety an solid. Whites are on the whole clean. Minor dirt and scratches appear but do not distract. The audio is 5.1 Dolby and represents a very stirring palette of music and effects. But this is primarily a dialogue driven film so don't expect your speakers to get a work out. Where Criterion's edition excels is in its extra features two comprehensive making of documentaries that tackle different aspects of the production deleted scenes an audio commentary and theatrical trailer. If that justifies the nearly triple price tag that Criterion is asking then I suppose the new edition is worth every penny. Both versions come highly recommended by this reviewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Pariah on television and I thought it was a TVmovie made in the early 90s.  I was quite shocked to then discover that it had been made a recently as 1998 after both American History X AHX and Romper Stomper.  Had it have been made earlier I would have forgiven its amateurish feel and to be frank embarrassing handling of the plot and story line.A good way of seeing how ineffective this movie is is to compare it with the things it is trying to emulate.  The story itself for those unaware is lifted directly from The Crow by J O'Barr.  If you want to see the same plot idea handled in an incredibly powerful subtle and truly masterful way then read the comic not the film.  I'd class Pariah's handling of the neoNazi aspect as being more like Romper Stomper in the way it superficially deals with the matter.  However Romper Stomper does it so much better.To focus on the movie itself it's all very poor.  The acting is poor the scripts are poor the directing poor....the whole thing is just poor.  Some scenes had me flinching with embarrassment they were so bad.  Despite the fact that I'm slating it I still gave it 410.  If it's on television and you have nothing better to do then watch it it'll pass the time it's not that bad.  But if you enjoy the violent neoNazi romanticising movie then watch Romper Stomper as it's better.  If you enjoy the revenge theme then read or to a lesser extent watch The Crow.  I don't really want to draw any comparisons with AHX as that movie is in a different league and is one of my alltime favourite movies.  AHX is the thinking man's Romper Stomper....I wouldn't even want to say what AHX is in relation to Pariah.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw Pariah on television and I thought it was a TVmovie made in the early 90s.  I was quite shocked to then discover that it had been made a recently as 1998 after both American History X AHX and Romper Stomper.  Had it have been made earlier I would have forgiven its amateurish feel and to be frank embarrassing handling of the plot and story line.A good way of seeing how ineffective this movie is is to compare it with the things it is trying to emulate.  The story itself for those unaware is lifted directly from The Crow by J O'Barr.  If you want to see the same plot idea handled in an incredibly powerful subtle and truly masterful way then read the comic not the film.

Romper Stomper American History X Green Street Hooligans  they all run the gambit from exploitative fun to depressing cautionary tales with ease. Some even do both!With such a great track record of good movies you could be excused for thinking every movie about baldheaded racist scumbags causing trouble would be good. Then you'd accidentally find yourself watching Pariah.Pariah follows the story of a man who joins a skinhead group to stalk and kill all of them in revenge for the gang rape of his black girlfriend that ended in her suicide. You might ask yourself one would a skinhead  someone who inherently believes people of color are less than human  want to have sex with a black woman even if forced? The question is never answered. I guess the writers didn't know how to make you hate the characters unless they used a woman's emotional pain and eventual suicide as a plot device. Pretty sure those other movies I mentioned didn't have rape scenes and worked perfectly anyway.There's a scene that works early on where the boyfriend cusses out his mother for trying to get him to read the bible  but we never see her again and that's about the last chunk of character development our fair protagonist gets.He crafts an elaborate revenge plan wherein he disguises himself as a skinhead infiltrates the group and proceeds to... do nothing the rest of the film. I guess the implication is he's going to trick them all into getting themselves killed or something? But that doesn't happen. Instead nothing happens.The film makes the avantgarde experimental and oh so artistic move of having absolutely nothing happen the entire rest of the film. There's a lot of scenes of the Nazis behaving badly being scumbags arguing with each other doing drugs and drinking beer swearing at each other some more not bathing and generally being creepy loathsome jerks. The film is so obsessed with executing these scenes it forgets things like basic act structure or even basic storytelling.Nothing happens in this movie. There's no build up no pay off no revenge no tragedy no pivotal events nothing. The protagonist isn't even the protagonist after the thirty minute mark becoming just another empty character in a film populated by them.The ending of the film which I will not spoil for conveniences sake comes out of nowhere and resolves nothing paying off for a moment in the film you could easily be forgiven for forgetting about.The film meanders around aimlessly with no plan plot or end goal. It's only purpose seems to be to show how awful and scummy it's main characters are  which I could have easily guessed since they're Neo Nazis. Apparently someone felt it necessary to make a movie to tell us about how evil and nasty Nazis are. Which is like making a movie to tell us water is wet.Roger Ebert pushed this film as a better version of Fight Club. Which is just about the stupidest thing any film critic has even written that's been published. Even if you only saw Fight Club on a broken VHS tape on a tiny blackandwhite television it's still a better movie than Pariah.It's a film with no tension conflict of payoff or any kind despite it's shocking and upsetting opening which Pink Floyd's The Wall pulled off far better despite only devoting a few seconds to it. This is a film that just gives up and never bothers to finish itself.It would all be forgivable if this was the only movie of it's kind to tackle it's subject matter but it wasn't even the first! This movie came out six years after Romper Stomper.This film goes nowhere does nothing and has no kind of climax or payoff of any kind. Even if there weren't dozens of other better movies in this genre this film still wouldn't be worth watching. Don't bother with this turd. Go rent American History X instead.".

Because I think as an Action Drama  it's quite good. Now here is my history  I am a big fan of the following films The Crow Unforgiven Pulp Fiction Bad News Bears originaland Blade Runner so I am more predisposed toward edgy films that push the envelope. I have seen Romper Stomper  fan American History X  soso although Ed Norton was quite good The Believer  not bad Bad Lieutenant  not a fan Crash James Spader version  loved it South Park  loved it PI  quite inventive etc....On purely technical terms  i actually listened to the director's commentary  based on budget this film is a minor miracle. I don't know of another film for under 100000 that comes close to matching the audaciousness of this film  there are gun battles street fights a fight with 50 people carjackings etc... Right in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard! The only other low budget film that comes close is Blood Guts Bullets and Octane.Acting  I actually think most of it is pretty good. I grew up around the punk scene and skinheads  I'm not bashing anybody but the skins I've known are not the most subtle people in public. I do think some actors are better than others. Really think Dave Ward Angela Jones and Aimee Chaffin are excellent. Music  awesome. Great Soundtrack. Really really great. Camerawork  In some stretches it's brilliant some parts  okay. A little uneven but daring. Sets Sound basics  overall pretty good  it's not a film shot in one location which is more impressive...I think if people on the site take out their emotions on whether or not they are a skinhead  and actually judge the film itself compared against Clerks Pi El Mariachi Blood Guts Bad Lieutenant Kids Brothers McMullen etc. okay I'm running out of really low budget films to reference  this film stacks up pretty darn well. If you compare it to American History X 9 million  no it's not that glossy but it has better action.Overall  I think it's a solid effort and that if this director was given a film like Smokin' Aces Shoot 'Em Up Crank etc... people would be hailing him as a great action director. Is he the next Scorcese  doubtful. Is he Ed Wood or Uwe Boll  hardly.My long winded two cents.".

I have seen Romper Stomper  fan American History X  soso although Ed Norton was quite good The Believer  not bad Bad Lieutenant  not a fan Crash James Spader version  loved it South Park  loved it PI  quite inventive etc....On purely technical terms  i actually listened to the director's commentary  based on budget this film is a minor miracle. I don't know of another film for under 100000 that comes close to matching the audaciousness of this film  there are gun battles street fights a fight with 50 people carjackings etc... Right in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard! The only other low budget film that comes close is Blood Guts Bullets and Octane.Acting  I actually think most of it is pretty good. I grew up around the punk scene and skinheads  I'm not bashing anybody but the skins I've known are not the most subtle people in public. I do think some actors are better than others. Really think Dave Ward Angela Jones and Aimee Chaffin are excellent. Music  awesome. Great Soundtrack. Really really great. Camerawork  In some stretches it's brilliant some parts  okay. A little uneven but daring. Sets Sound basics  overall pretty good  it's not a film shot in one location which is more impressive...I think if people on the site take out their emotions on whether or not they are a skinhead  and actually judge the film itself compared against Clerks Pi El Mariachi Blood Guts Bad Lieutenant Kids Brothers McMullen etc. okay I'm running out of really low budget films to reference  this film stacks up pretty darn well. If you compare it to American History X 9 million  no it's not that glossy but it has better action.Overall  I think it's a solid effort and that if this director was given a film like Smokin' Aces Shoot 'Em Up Crank etc... people would be hailing him as a great action director. Is he the next Scorcese  doubtful. Is he Ed Wood or Uwe Boll  hardly.My long winded two cents.";

It was like a neighborhood teen gathering his friends and filming overdramatic racism. I can't begin to talk about how horrible the acting was. This movie was about as real and in your face as a waterpistol.It's not even worthy to be compared to American History X which was a great movie. Romper Stomper was alright. However I still believe the most insightful smart intelligent powerful Skinhead flick is The Believer. Which was also a lowbudget film but with a vastly complex storyline and amazing acting let alone actor. Ryan Gosling as the main character Danny Balint in The Believer I believe blows all the previously mentioned movies out of the water.Want a good movie? Check out The Believer.".

It is true that the film is just plain ugly to look at and the overacting is sometimes embarrassing. But perhaps the critics are being a bit unfair by measuring it next to films like American History X and Romper Stomper. If you put it next to a highlyproduced Hollywood film like A.H.X then sure this one will look sick in comparison. Or if you put it next to a truly fantastic piece of cinema like Romper Stomper a film that actually played in art house cinemas around the world it just isn't fair. The only thing these films have in common is their subject matter skinheads. Period. Pariah lacks the artistic merits of these legitimate films. But when looked at in the trash film context then this one becomes at least entertaining. Perhaps watch this one in the same way that you would watch Toxic Avenger or Shaft or Class of 1984 etc.. Of course the way they portray skinheads in this movie is nauseating offensive and highly inaccurate. But lets face it there are so few films made about the punk and skinhead scene that when something comes along we just have to see it. Anyway look at the way punks are portrayed in Class of 1984. Murderous criminals! But like Pariah that flick is good for a laugh. In short look at this one while you're hanging out and drinking with friends. You have to admit this trash film does deliver the goods when it comes to violence. It is stomachturning in some places. And if you want to see a good thoughtprovoking film about skinheads see Luna Park the one about the Russian skinheads. But don't expect a lot of action there. By the way remember Skinheads Second Coming of Hate with Chuck Conners?? Now there is a classic. Pariah is almost good compared to that one! A.C.A.B.".

The only thing I hated was the movie was more about homophobia and gay bashing.Not that I support Nazi skinheads but I don't understand why they were so threatened by gays instead of the groups of black and Asian gangs in the neighborhood.There was an interesting remark made in the DVD extra features that mentions that there is more violence within their own ranks then there is violence towards others.I loved the scene in the movie when a huge group of gay men got together and bashed the skinheads back.I have never seen that before in a movie and they deserved the beating.It was nice to see a bit of payback from the gay community.Ironically the most vicious gay hating skinhead David Lee played by David Lee Willson has come out as a gay man in real life.I read a really cool article about this actor and how hard it was for him to play such an evil hateful role. A lot of people felt the acting in this movie was horrible.Yes some scenes were badly acted and a few of the actors were really bad but it was their first time and this was the director's first film I believe.To me it seemed like real life and not the worst acting i've seen in a film. However David WilsonDamon Jonesand David Oren Ward gave the best performances.Sadly I just learned actor David Oren Ward died tragically which is a shame since he was both talented and very handsome. The shocking rape scene was really well done but I didn't like how she treated her boyfriend afterwords since he was helpless to save her.And then to kill herself afterwards was cowardly and not believable.Yes it was traumatic but I have never heard of rape victims taking their own life because of it.What the skinheads did was rottenbut then so was what the group of black men did to her and her boyfriend.And then later the same group of blacks targeted the white girls.I am sure it probably happens a lot alsobut they don't seem to be depicted as bad guys which is a total double standard.At that point I was waiting for the skinhead group to get even with them for shooting an innocent kid who was only lured into it because he was mentally challenged.And they were also protecting their female members from being nearly assaulted which any gang would do no matter who they are. In Pariah only 2 or 3 of them seemed like skinheads.At one point I was beginning to think they were not a group of skinheads but a bunch of unstable street kids.They all came from dysfunctional familiessome were abuseda few were either mentally retarded and others just homeless and some brain dead from all the drug abuse.They were more like street punks who were discarded and who just wanted to fit in and belong. Another really good movie that is similar but not really about skinheads is the 1984 movie called suburbia.I read it was coming to DVD finally and I am looking forward to seeing it again.It reminded me of pariah but an 80's version.".

Andrei Myagkov simply delivers a character who undergoes significant yet somehow believable transformation from a shy nerdy young doctor to a bold at times arrogant yet at the same time romantic man.  A great comic performance by Yuri Yakovlev as the jealous fiance of the heroine alone makes the film worth watching to the last moments.The 3rd element is the music and poetry.  The songs are an important part of narration not just there for a backdrop. The song lyrics and the poetry are by some of the most prominent Russian poets of the Silver Age and are just plain beautiful. In short this an amazing film one of those that can be watched over and over.Finally if you don't speak Russian check this film on DVDNTSC. I recently got it and was very impressed by the quality of translation offered by the subtitles which provide translation of the songs as well as the dialogue.".

A lot of phrases and scenes are learned by heart some of them became aphorisms.The basis of the plot is rather funny.

Moreover the tenements are identical and even the key fits to the apartment door. Here starts the real fun then the drama emerges out of the comedy gradually growing and replacing the fun. Perhaps it's the perfect and fine balance between comedy and drama and the accurate development and transformation of one genre into the other which wouldn't make one bored with this movie and would make him wish to watch it again and again.I would recommend to nonrussian spectators other Ryazanov's movies as well and also those of Gaidai made in 60's and 70's.".

As a consequence the same buildings are put up in Artica as well in a southern desert before surprised camels. The Soviet reality is the basis of the plot with identical buildings in different cities. Also the New Year tree rather that the Christmas tree is Soviet. However as the story unfolds the Soviet reality recedes into little visible background. An exception is a line in one of the songs if you do not have a dog your neighbor cannot poison your dog.Russian are the beautiful poems which are made into songs. There are also some views of Leningrad but actually only a few with the St. Isaac Basilica shown several times from different sides.The cast and the technical crew are largely Russian but not only. Obviously Armenian Georgian and Jewish names are listed. The actress playing Nadya has been imported from Central Europe Barbara Brylska is a Polish actress well known also from a number of other movies made in Poland as well as in other countries. The appeal of the film is truly universal ! This is the reason why viewers from countries so disparate as Latvia Ukraine and China like this film so much not to mention Texans. The lovejealousy quadrangle two mothers friends of Zhenya and colleagues of Nadya could have lived in many countries around the world. Even the story of the same address could have happened for instance in Germany where practically every city and town has Bahnhofstrasse and Poststrasse. Finally the atmosphere of this film is unique  a word which very rarely can be used discussing films. We have seen other films directed by Eldar Ryazanov all of them good but none comparable to this one. All that takes place in the film is plausible it could have happened in reality. At the same time there is the feeling of poetic unreal and sublime. These two basically opposed reactions to the film coexist somehow in the viewer this simply does not happen in movies films directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski excepted. Irony of the Fate is a truly wonderful film alive 30 years after being created it will enchant future generations as well.".

There's a lot of dialogue so your Russian needs to be up to scratch if you see it in the original and it's a long film but worth every minute.";

I watch it every 31st December with my family and when I'm feeling down I will put it on even in the Summer despite the movie being about New Year's Eve and it'll instantly make me feel better.The film however most probably wouldn't be understood by the average foreigner. Let me explain..Zhenya and his friends have a tradition of going to the banya like a public bathing place as a tradition every 31st of December. The celebration of Zhenya's engagement leads to all four men getting completely drunk. The dilemma however is that one of these men has to fly to Leningrad to celebrate New Year's Eve with his wife. By mistake they send Zhenya to Leningrad. Being completely blacked out Zhenya does not remember the flight or him getting a taxi when already in Leningrad. Coinsidently the street on which Zhenya lives in Moscow exists in Leningrad as well. Zhenya barely able to walk enters the apartment building and makes his way up onto the 4th floor and opens the door with his key and without hesitating makes himself comfortable and falls asleep on what he thinks is his bed.A few minutes later Nadya a beautiful Russian woman enters this same apartment  only it is really hers. Naturally she is shocked to find a drunk stranger asleep on her bed. And her fianc who arrives shortly after isn't thrilled to see drunk Zhenya either. The chemistry between Nadya and Zhenya grows as events begin to unravel...The average foreigner will probably ask  How is it possible that the apartment building and the apartment itself is identical to the one in Moscow? How could he even open the door with his key? In Soviet times buildings were built almost identically. There was no individuality. Flats looked the same. The furniture was the same. And by luck the key matched perfectly as well although not surprisingly.Anyway this is a brilliantly funny at times sad film. It is a must see to anyone who is at least mildly interested in Russian people culture or just the Russian way of life.".

This was my first time seeing it  without that cultural hyperfamiliarity  and it was very easy to see why it's so popular  it's hugely entertaining. It's about three hours long but hardly felt like an hour. There's a perfect absurdist farce premise of a man who ends up in an identical prefab apartment with his own at the same address which also it has been pointed out could easily be taken as a comment on the sameness of Soviet architecture of the time. That farce plays out fantastically but then after the clock has struck 12 on New Year's Eve with our protagonist in the wrong city we keep following these people and become invested in serious hopelessness of their situations. In essence it takes what could be a good basic bedroom farce arms it with legitimately likable interesting characters we want to follow and more or less keeps them in a room overnight. The small cast is a blessing here. It's a winning formula of goofiness crossed with seriousness. The jealous Ippolit for instance looks ridiculous showering drunkenly with his clothes on but when he goes out that way into the freezing night saying that perhaps he wants to catch cold and die the feeling of seriousness dissipates. Overall incredibly likable and entertaining. The music is good and the theme of not boxing life in with rules and accepting happy accidents is welcome.

	schema:reviewBody "The Irony of Fate or Enjoy Your Bath! is a romantic comedy set in the 1970's in an urban landscape in Soviet Russia. Parents need to know that it is not very suitable for children. Many characters drink a lot of alcohol and get drunk some smoke. There are references to extramarital relationships. There is no sexually explicit content. However you can see some kissing scenes and stuff like that. It is arguably one of the greatest works of director Eldar Ryazanov. The acting is also good. And the songs are the best of course. Leonid Brezhnev the leader of the Soviet Union was a fan. He even referred to this movie in his report at the XXVI Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. But it is not a piece of soviet propaganda. On the contrary this movie is like an anecdote from the Brezhnev era.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just got back from a New Year's Eve party where my Russian host gave a screening of The Irony of Fate a movie I had never seen before. Apparently everybody in Russia watches it every year on New Year's eve and it is easy to see why. This movie is a terrific romantic comedy that is touching thoughtful and hilarious. It is tough to describe the plot without dumping some spoilers but the main idea is that a young man from Moscow on his wedding day goes to a public bath with some of his friends he explains several times in the movie that it is a tradition has a few drinks and accidentally ends up on a plane to Leningrad. He is so drunk that he does not realize he is in a different city and gets a taxi ride to what he thinks is his own apartment. He goes in and falls asleep only to be discovered by a beautiful woman who actually lives in the apartment. What happens next has to be seen to be believed.The plot seems far fetched but is clearly a satire of the cookiecutter life that people led in the old Soviet Unionall the apartments were the same I guess to the point where a guy would not realize that he was not in his own place if sufficiently drunk. From there the movie is surprisingly realistic and the chemistry between the leads is outstanding. This movie is a great view into Soviet culture and an awesome evening of entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an awful movie. Here's the story the shy middleaged surgeon Zhenya Lukashin lives in Moscow and plans to marry for the first time in his life. He tells his girlfriend Katya that he was going to marry another woman a few years ago but on the very last moment he fled to Leningrad because he didn't really want to be married. Jerk alert! He halfheartedly tells Katya that he won't do that to her.On New Year's Eve he goes to the sauna with his friends and gets drunk. He soon forgets that he has a fiance. One of his friends has to go to Leningrad to celebrate New Year with his significant other. He and Lukashin are so drunk they fall asleep while the other two friends don't remember who is supposed to fly. So they stuff Lukashin into a plane.He arrives in Leningrad and is helped off the plane by a grumpy fellow passenger. He annoys and embarrasses another passenger with his stupid drunk behavior and takes a cab home. He almost pisses himself and calls for his mother before miraculously opening the door with his own key. He has no idea what happened and falls asleep. the context here is that the Soviet state built lots of identicallooking houses gave the streets in different cities the same names and that people had similarlooking stuff in their homes. Never mind that this is the definition of an industrialized country.Somewhat later the home's owner Nadya returns. She is blonde tall slim and pretty. She is shocked to find a drunk stranger in her bed and tries to remove him but barely manages to make him understand what happened before her own fianc Ippolit arrives. Ippolit is serious and oldfashioned. He doesn't believe the story about how Lukashin ended up in Leningrad and opened Nadya's door with his key. He thinks Nadya is cheating on him and leaves in anger.Nadya and Lukashin get to know each other and fall in love. Nadya turns out to be a teacher of Russian language and literature and tells that she had an affair with a married man for 10 years. Ippolit loses all respect for himself and is entertains suicidal thoughts. As for Katya we don't even learn what happens to her.I used to like this movie when I was younger but now it makes me sick. The actors who play Nadya and Zhenya are blonde and angeliclooking while Katya and Ippolit are depicted as dark sour oldfashioned and repulsive. The message is clear it's a virtue to be at the mercy of your impulses like a leaf in the wind. It means that you're a child of Eden whose soul hasn't been corrupted by our sick society. Conversely being sober conscientious concerned and reliable trying to control yourself and your life having expectations from yourself and from others makes you a miserable sellout who needs to be put in their place. Expect a friendly punishment from your friends who are trying to help you. It's for your own good. Never resist any impulse whether from within or without whether your own or other people's. Whatever comes your way be nice and go along with it.The movie contradicts itself by depicting society as controlling and repressive and forgetting about this fact when it suits the story. In 1970 the Soviet government made passport checks mandatory on planes so it was impossible to travel with somebody else's ticket in 1975. Even before that drunk individuals weren't allowed to travel by plane. And why didn't Nadya call the police when she discovered a drunk stranger in her bed? Also it's impossible for somebody this drunk to sober up in 2 3 hours.There's nothing original about the story. Weak clueless selfish losers have always tried to make themselves look humble sensitive spiritual artistic and philosophical while trying to make hardworking and responsible people feel stupid and guilty for being boring.In my opinion the only good things about his movie are the song Over my street by Alla Pugacheva and the poem in the end. Everything else is saccharine mindnumbing propaganda for stupidity selfishness and depravity.".

No wonder that the characters of this movie look like jerks they celebrate the European New Year's day till their eyes roll out. What will be left for Christmas the 7th of January? Dust and bones apparently. It can be a very good point of the film. But I don't think it was done to underline that. It was done to underline emptiness.If you want to kill time in a most suicidal and sadistic manner go for this empty drag. Nothing personal. But if you want to see real Russian characters colourful rich strong and charismatic go for Vesyolye rebyata KinDzaDza Solyaris and Ostrov.2 out of 10 with 1 out of 10 reserved for the sequel.

Film Noir being one of my favorite film genre's Brick follows the same story structure oddball characters right down to the very smart and quick paced dialogue of a 30s40s hard boiled detective thriller. The twist that lifts it above parody and even a mere homage is the presentation of these elements with high school kids in Southern California. The direction by Rian Johnson is very expert and confident in telling the story giving the audience smooth and quick editing along with skewed and distorted camera angles. He manages to maintain suspense throughout the film only in a couple of parts letting it drag the scenes with the Drama Queen are some of the weakest. The actors are great the most memorable being the villains Pen and Tugger. Rather than just being atypical baddies their portrayals give them depth sympathy and at the same time a degree of likability. Kudos also goes to the actor who played Brain the partner of Frye who is nearly flawless in his somewhat small role. John Shaft himself Richard Roundtree shows up as the Vice Principal but it is obvious they only had the budget to hire him for one day. I have to say this isn't a classic film by any means I merely decided to give it such a high rating because it attempts something different and succeeds fairly successfully. I've been tired of the mundane films that get released every year and for once this is something that is completely different the use of archetypal characters in the setting and delivery not expected. It's a low budget film but it is obvious to me that that this filmmaker will be heard from again. Keep an eye out.".

Next we jump to 2 days before to follow Brendan Joseph GordonLevitt an intelligent cynical high school student selfexiled from the cliquish world of jocks stoners and socialites. He is stoically heartbroken 2 months after being dumped by his girlfriend Emily Emilie DeRavin who left him to pursue that world. A frightened phone call from the missing Emily asking for help and filled with incoherent references to a brick and the pin prompts Brendan to launch back into high school society. He does this in the movie detective style of Sam Spade The Maltese Falcon shaking things up with a relentless directness punctuated by welltimed acts of cunning. Once found Emily recants and asks Brendan to forget everything she said. Of course we know from the opening scene that things aren't going to go well for Emily and by this point we also know that Brendan isn't likely to back off from anything.After Emily's death Brendan starts looking for answers in earnest slicing through high school society and the underbelly of suburban California like a weedwacker. Much like the detectives played by Humphrey Bogart in The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep this battered toughguy keeps shaking the tree until the answers he wants fall out. His search leads him to the rich femme fatale Laura Dannon Nora Zehetner an underworld kingpin Lukas Haas and a handful of assorted thugs in a completely amoral teenage world. Battered physically and emotionally he maintains his cool while playing all sides against each other in an effort to achieve some justice for the girl he loved.In Brick writerdirector Rian Johnson pays homage in wonderful style to the classics of noir fiction. Setting the story in the world of highschoolers allows him to make use of classic detective story characters without seeming redundant. We have a beautiful seductress with ambiguous motives a dangerous vamp played brilliantly by Meagan Good which sounds like a porno name for some reason a crime boss and his hired muscle and even a Vice Principal who fills the role of the police captain. Of course Brendan is the classic loner private eye moving through a world of scum but never allowing the dirt to get under his skin.Language is both the strength and weakness of Brick. Johnson drew heavily from the fiction of Dashiell Hammet creator of Sam Spade when writing the film and that spare 1940's style permeates the dialog. Suffice to say that these kids do not talk like highschoolers. That's fine because a stylized manner of speech suits these extremely cool stylized characters and sets the proper mood. On the other hand while the story of Brick is not wildly original it is an excellent riveting piece of noir fiction which deserves to be appreciated on its own merits and not just in reference to old Bogart movies. The Bogartesque lingo is entertaining but it occasionally distracts from the story. Also the linguistic style may simply be confusing and offputting to audiences not familiar with the older films on which it is based.Interestingly none of the principal cast members were familiar with the literary and film sources from which their characters were drawn. This is remarkable because their characterizations are so dead on and given without a trace of the selfconscious irony that so often passes for wit. Joe GordonLevitt in particular deserves to be a star after this performance. He appears in every scene of the film channeling the best of Humphrey Bogart.Brick won a special Jury Prize at Sundance and my understanding is that it has in fact been picked up for distribution. I suspect that despite its quality it may have difficulty finding an audience. I hope I am wrong because it was by far the best film I have seen this year. 5 out of 5 stars.".

Next we jump to 2 days before to follow Brendan Joseph GordonLevitt an intelligent cynical high school student selfexiled from the cliquish world of jocks stoners and socialites. He is stoically heartbroken 2 months after being dumped by his girlfriend Emily Emilie DeRavin who left him to pursue that world. A frightened phone call from the missing Emily asking for help and filled with incoherent references to a brick and the pin prompts Brendan to launch back into high school society.

When I first read the synopsis of Brick at Sundance I was immediately interested in seeing it. Film Noir set in a high school. I started hearing really terrible reviews of it and almost did not go until the very last day I could. I am so glad I did. It is a very unique film such a refreshing one for people who have seen it all. So if you want something new and different you will definitely enjoy this. Others may find it is too overthe top for themit took me several minutes to understand what the characters were even saying at first in their language that mixed old film noir slang with the new generation of slang. Its very dark and the sound design will even make a person feel uneasy. The director linked sound and image in ways I have never seen completely enthralling me from beginning to end. This movie is not a relaxing ride. oh! but there are great comedic and ironic moments as well! I think a lot of the criticism I heard of this film was that it was too incomprehensible and unbelievable. I personally really got into the world of this film and it had me on the edge of my seat until the very end. It was so enjoyable to buy into the rules of the film noirhigh school drama world and its characters. I did not even recognize the lead character as that kid from 3rd Rock until the end! I hated 3rd Rock but I absolutely loved and believed in his character here. I loved it! One of my top picks at Sundance this year. sorry I have never written a review...I hope this reveals something about the movie. I really really hope that it gets released soon! It is one of those interesting movies that could really be a cult classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film I have been highly anticipating for over a year. After first hitting the festival circuit in January of 2005 it went through the cycles finally getting a stateside limited release at the end of March 2006. Buffalo I ask you now to open your eyes to a masterpiece of cinema as Brick finally debuts at the Amherst Dipson.Brick is a not a film as much as a symphony where each instrument is tuned to the beat of the conductor. Each frame is carefully orchestrated and composed to perfection. The dialogue is metered and spoken with a contemporary Shakespearean beat. WriterDirector Rian Johnson has created poetry with his first feature length film. It may be tough to understand the lingo and overall speech used but as the film advances you begin to know the characters and the words just make complete sense.We open with the stare of our protagonisthard and piercing yet on the verge of tearseyes slowly welling up as he peers down on a motionless body facedown in a tunnel's steady flowing stream. This is film noir at its best wrong men and notorious women. Our leader into this underbelly of society has recently rolled on his boss to skate clean of a drug deal he was involved with. The cops allow this plea and decide to keep him in their pocket with what happened as leverage. He stays low nose clean until an old love brings him into her world as it's spiraling out of control. Using all his resources around the city he begins his search to find her and make sure she is OK. He does this for his own means with a stoicism that hearkens back to Bogart's Sam Spade.WaitDid I tell you that the city this is set in is a suburban high school? Johnson has flipped the genre on its head to brilliant effect. Brendan our medium into the story is played to perfection by Joseph GordonLevitt as a senior at the school who has alienated himself by ratting on his drug supplier. The viceprincipal is using him to gain intel on the dealings around school but Brendan will have none of it. He needs to find out what happened to his old flame Emily and see what she got involved in. Enlisting the help of a colleague Brendan plays his enemies off each other to gain access to the mob boss and dope runner The Pin I hear he's supposed to be old like 26 whom Emily has wronged. The truth must be found at all costs either to assuage some personal guilt to rescue love to do what's right to get the bad guys or maybe all the above. The search for answers leads to betrayal and secrets uncovered and I was there for the entire ride.Brick is not the 21st century's answer to Alan Parker's Bugsy Malone. This isn't a satire on mob life with children playing men. This is a reawakening of the genre a subversion of what you expect of it but played straight as a razor. None of these actors break character and lines like this echoing a hardened criminal telling off an overzealous officer No more of these informal chats! If you have a disciplinary issue with me write me up or suspend me and I'll see you at the ParentTeacher conference are delivered with straight faces and a piercing confidence. The wit is there and you will laugh to the seeming absurdity but the weight of the story holds strong. Wellplaced humor helps you realize the gravity of everything even more. Levitt shines in the role and proves to be the best upandcoming actor of his generation. Following pitchperfect turns as a violent teen in the wonderful Manic and as a teenage hustler vagrant in Gregg Araki's disturbing yet unforgettable Mysterious Skin Levitt is making bold choices and continues a great run with Brick. He is flanked with solid support from Lost's Emilie de Ravin as his lost love Lukas Hass as The Pin with loyalty straying muscle Noah Fleiss Matt O'Leary's The Brain Brendan's lifeline to what's happening as he sinks deeper and Nora Zehetner flawlessly playing the femme fatale which one can never be sure whether to trust. Also the accompanying score of piano and brass jazz fits perfectly to the atmosphere especially on a late scene closeup shot of Levitt and Zehetnerfaces close up lips with an atom of air between them and a single tear slowly following down the contours of her faceuncannily mimicking the infamous shot of Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca.Any cinephile with 8 to spend will regret missing an opportunity to see this film. If you love film noir of the 50's 60's and 70's check Brick out while you can. Doubtful that it will stay up more than 2 or 3 weeks it will be coming to DVD on August 8th however go out and see this gem. It will not be everyone's cup of tea but whether you love it or not it holds a place on the timeline of cinema as an experiment in stripping down the essence of noir and showing it in a new and no longer angelic world of children on the cusp of adulthood. Here's looking at you kid.".

What gives BRICK its filmic authenticity much different from realism is its language  the language of Chandler and Hammett but reimagined from the lips of contemporary teens.The effect is staggering.

But to see them in this noir glow is to give them an exciting new life ... to see them again for the first time. There are plot twists and surprises aplenty here although familiar once you realize the inspirations for the film. But familiarity is more than compensated by a superb cast and not generally noted in these comments excellent music. Contemporizing the soundtrack keeps us on our toes and makes a significant contribution to the tension of BRICK.A terrific debut!".

Who's duping who? We don't know until the very end in this fastpaced hipster lingo drenched wild revival of the classic Black and White Film Noir. Joseph GordonLevitt yes the kid from Third Rock is a brilliant herofoil as Brendan the bitingly dry quickwitted scrappy and yet reluctant detective trying to walk his way through a web of lies more lies murder and lots of missing drugs. His character is bright he can read a situation like a psychic on crack turn things to his favor in seconds and play people as deftly as he is ultimately played himself. ...And he can take a punch. The plot turns this way then that keeping you constantly guessing as to where it will take you next. As soon as you think you know what's going on you don't. Nora Zehetner is a beautiful and beguiling femme fatale. The Brian Matt O'Leary who is constantly feeding Brendan his facts and keeping him on track knows his stuff but never let's you know how. Rian Johnson has written an amazing script and directed it into a whirlwind experience of near misses painful betrayal and lovelove lost. The lingo takes a second to catch. I'm reminded of Swingers had it been as thrilling as it was funny. The words fall into place and give the film a slick quick delivery like the best exchanges between Bogart and Bergman Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake. Take all that and drop it into a dark starkly brutal modern world... In a high school of all places. There's even some quirky humor thrown in though most of the laughs from the audience were really nervous release from all the tension built into the story. A must see.".

They finally show Brendan in some pain although he probably should have died from his untended to internal injuries a third of the way into the film and the profoundly moving and carefully kept secret revealed at the end was hardly a secret and not very meaningful. The use of a single key word as a title has become rather annoying but there is a common street term for excrement used in the movie that would have served just as well.".

Locations are no budget and ineffective. The movie is not engaging with 15 minutes I realised this was a major mistake and at best will make you smile. Characterisation is bad. But all that is just not the real bottom line it's damn boring and acts as a very long joke in cinematic reference. There is nothing brilliant about unless the whole production was underaged which would be admirable. Total rubbish  avoid at all costs. and I am writing this comment JUST because someone here must sound the siren amongst all these favorable reviews.

I hadn't heard much about the movie so I was wondering 'is this an unfunny farce?'. I guess it isn't a farce it's supposed to be a noir. It's a disaster.Unbelievably pretentious dialog and 'hipster' speech. I thought that kind of talk died in the 1970s.The mindset of the teenagers trying to put forth this 'world' they supposedly live in in a high school setting just doesn't fly. It's like a very very bad high school play painfully aware that these are just kids trying to be something they're not never have been and never will be. Even high school at it's worst was never that bad. Seriously this film gives you respect for the portrayal of high school in Beverly Hills 90201 which at least had some believability to it even if you didn't like it. In most films with good or bad acting I'm generally not aware that they are acting. Not the case here.Pretension takes an even worse form in the wardrobes. I didn't check the spoilers box and I'm new at this so I'll be vague. All I'll say is that I stopped the film and gave up at the introduction of a character who was dressed too stupid for me to watch. those reading this who have seen the film probably can guess who I'm talking about lets just say he made the film a CAPErYou've got to have some respect for the audience This director clearly doesn't. As for those who say that people who didn't like the film 'didn't get it' ie modern film noir compare this to 'Match Point' made the same year. This film is just a very tired ripoff of whatever it was trying to reference.The saddest thing is since the film had popularity there may be outsider kids who try to model some of this style in their own high schools and it's going to take them down another notch they cant afford".

The high school setting is a backdrop that isn't really used at all. None of the activities or dynamics of a high school appear anywhere in the film. Instead we get scenes where the Vice Principal whom they call the VP calls the protagonist into his office as if he were a police commander talking to a renegade officer. It just doesn't work.

	schema:headline " Black and White and Gray All Over";
	schema:reviewBody "Billy Bob Thornton has the perfect face for film noir.  His craggy drawn features lead up to sunken but large and staring eyes and cheeks that look to be made out of plaster.  Particularly when shot in black and white his face becomes a landscape of shifting shadows while he doesn't move a muscle.  He is able to give the impression of a man at war with himself even while sitting perfectly still and staring ahead.  He's Jeremy Irons only without that unsettling accent.  The Coen brothers take great advantage of their stars' granite physiognomy throughout The Man That Wasn't There constructing several shots around Thornton staring into a point just slightly away from the camera impassive as an Easter Island head moving only to smoke an everpresent cigarette while the obligatory noir voiceover narration runs.  His voice is perfect too a kind of calm measured rumbling which describes incredible events but never seems amazed by them. Thornton says I don't talk much and it's true he doesn't do much either but he is still fascinating and commands our attention.The Coens take great relish in the noir conventions even beyond the 1940s setting and the black and white photography let's face it we're so used to '40s movies in black and white that color would look a little weird.  The story follows classic lines with a few wild divergences Thornton's character is a barber in one of those small postwar California towns that Hitchcock was so enamored of.  He comes up with a scheme to raise some money which naturally spins a little beyond what he anticipated.  That's all I can say in good conscience and the plot goes pretty far afield I mean REALLY far afield catering to fans both of Dashiell Hammett and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers.  But really you know what to expect if you've ever seen one of these movies before greed dark secrets and murder in a world of fedoras cigarette smoke snapping lighters and deep moral turpitude.  A world where nothing or no one is what they seem and the only sure thing is that in the end some sap is gonna get it.As good as Thornton is he can't carry the movie alone.  Fortunately he is surrounded by a topnotch cast including a lot of familiar Coen veterans and it is this that really makes this movie work.  Michael Badalucco puts in a hilarious turn as Thornton's gabby brotherinlaw Frances McDormand is effective in her relatively few scenes as his brittle wife and James Gandolfini plays yet another boorish tough guy to a turn.  Practically shoplifting the movie is Tony Shalhoub playing a fasttalking Sacramento lawyer who doesn't so much speak as summate.  His discussion of Heisenberg is almost worth the ticket price alone.  Christopher Kriesa and Brian Haley get a lot of mileage out of their brief appearances as a pair of slightly dim cops aren't they all in these movies?Joel Coen who directed makes sure that the movie is consistently interesting to watch too.  Black and white photography being mostly about shades of gray noir is perhaps the only genre that benefits from the relative primitiveness of its visual technology.  Coen therefore sticks with it unlike the colors he used in the '30s themed O Brother Where Art Thou? which managed to be both more fanciful and less surreal than this movie.  He uses the lightandshadow character of black and white to great effect here carefully crafting his images to make best use of it.  In fact if the movie has a fault it's that the images are a little TOO carefully crafted.  The purest noir was cleverly filmed but it allowed its cleverness to seep into the background.  You have to watch a few times to pick up on how sharp the filmmaking is.  Coen is unable to hide his arty cleverness and so in the end fun as it is to watch the movie is a bit too pretty to truly capture the essence of its forbears.

	onyx:emotionText "Billy Bob Thornton has the perfect face for film noir.  His craggy drawn features lead up to sunken but large and staring eyes and cheeks that look to be made out of plaster.  Particularly when shot in black and white his face becomes a landscape of shifting shadows while he doesn't move a muscle.  He is able to give the impression of a man at war with himself even while sitting perfectly still and staring ahead.  He's Jeremy Irons only without that unsettling accent.  The Coen brothers take great advantage of their stars' granite physiognomy throughout The Man That Wasn't There constructing several shots around Thornton staring into a point just slightly away from the camera impassive as an Easter Island head moving only to smoke an everpresent cigarette while the obligatory noir voiceover narration runs.  His voice is perfect too a kind of calm measured rumbling which describes incredible events but never seems amazed by them. Thornton says I don't talk much and it's true he doesn't do much either but he is still fascinating and commands our attention.The Coens take great relish in the noir conventions even beyond the 1940s setting and the black and white photography let's face it we're so used to '40s movies in black and white that color would look a little weird.  The story follows classic lines with a few wild divergences Thornton's character is a barber in one of those small postwar California towns that Hitchcock was so enamored of.  He comes up with a scheme to raise some money which naturally spins a little beyond what he anticipated.  That's all I can say in good conscience and the plot goes pretty far afield I mean REALLY far afield catering to fans both of Dashiell Hammett and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers.  But really you know what to expect if you've ever seen one of these movies before greed dark secrets and murder in a world of fedoras cigarette smoke snapping lighters and deep moral turpitude.  A world where nothing or no one is what they seem and the only sure thing is that in the end some sap is gonna get it.As good as Thornton is he can't carry the movie alone.  Fortunately he is surrounded by a topnotch cast including a lot of familiar Coen veterans and it is this that really makes this movie work.  Michael Badalucco puts in a hilarious turn as Thornton's gabby brotherinlaw Frances McDormand is effective in her relatively few scenes as his brittle wife and James Gandolfini plays yet another boorish tough guy to a turn.  Practically shoplifting the movie is Tony Shalhoub playing a fasttalking Sacramento lawyer who doesn't so much speak as summate.  His discussion of Heisenberg is almost worth the ticket price alone.  Christopher Kriesa and Brian Haley get a lot of mileage out of their brief appearances as a pair of slightly dim cops aren't they all in these movies?Joel Coen who directed makes sure that the movie is consistently interesting to watch too.  Black and white photography being mostly about shades of gray noir is perhaps the only genre that benefits from the relative primitiveness of its visual technology.  Coen therefore sticks with it unlike the colors he used in the '30s themed O Brother Where Art Thou? which managed to be both more fanciful and less surreal than this movie.  He uses the lightandshadow character of black and white to great effect here carefully crafting his images to make best use of it.  In fact if the movie has a fault it's that the images are a little TOO carefully crafted.  The purest noir was cleverly filmed but it allowed its cleverness to seep into the background.  You have to watch a few times to pick up on how sharp the filmmaking is.  Coen is unable to hide his arty cleverness and so in the end fun as it is to watch the movie is a bit too pretty to truly capture the essence of its forbears.  Perhaps realizing this the Coens tweak the conventions mercilessly and inject a streak of humor that is funnier for being played so straight there are lots of funny lines but don't be surprised if you are the only one in the theater laughing. Actually don't be surprised if you are the only one in the theater period.  The movie does require a bit of patience the pacing is intense but quite slow and the story wanders like a drunk driver.

	schema:reviewBody "I found this to be a pretty interesting film by the Coens'.  I was well aware of the ability to do noir as evidenced by 'Blood Simple' as well as manylayered dialoguedriven narratives as in 'Miller's Crossing.'  But what I found intriging about this movie was that it was about inconsequence. Billy Bob Thornton's character Ed Crane is similar to William H. Macy's in 'Fargo.'  Both have unsatisfying positions in lowly lives.  Both had received their jobs by marrying into them Ed at the  Barber Shop and William's at the car dealership.  The difference is whereas the kidnapping plot is sought out in Fargo the blackmailing plot falls into Ed's lap by sheer choice luck? fate? Ed's just a guy who wants to improve his lot in life nothing too different then you or me.  His wife's affair simply gives him the opportunity to do so.  He didn't mind the infidelity it is after all  a free country.  But of course if she was faithful there would be no noirish plot to pursue correct?  Quiet ambition drives Ed.  After the drycleaning attempt goes sour he sets his sights of Scarlett Johansenn's who is quite remarkable character's piano playing ability in hopes of becoming her manager and making enough to get by. Thornton's Ed Crane really is the man who wasn't there.  He sits nearly brooding quietly observing life laconically.  I actually found this movie quite sad.  In the end the only one who cares about his story is a men's magazine.  And that's another big difference from 'Fargo in which the pregnant Frances McDormand curls up with her husband and you feel as if everything is just right in the world.  That feeling is definitely lacking from The Man Who Wasn't There. Some viewers in the theater I saw it at said it was the funniest movie they've seen all year.  Sadly I think they're missing it.  Most of the humor is typical Coen's deadpan but it is mostly generated from a tone of unease and tension.  It's clever but you waon't be slapping your knees like in Raising Arizona or The Big Lewboski. Instead you'll just be intrigued by the wonderful story that the Coens who have become quite the master of their craft have weaved in this beautifully textured perfectly cast and incredibly nuanced film.".

But suffice to say every action generates a consequence and even plot threads which had been apparently been dropped eventually resurface with tremendous almost painful irony and remind us that noir is an unforgiving genre unkind to its characters cruel to the extreme. If at times the story seems a tad long it's in the subplot involving Scarlett Johansson who coats the movie with a Lolitaesquire persona as her character essays a tentative affair with Crane however even that storyline feeds into Crane's retribution at the end.Gorgeous black and white textured use of deepfocus this is a movie Gregg Toland would have loved to have his hands on had this been 1941 instead of 2001. THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE could be called stylistic in its frank depiction of textbook noir James Cain comes to mind but the Coen brothers make it work all the way through with smart direction scenes that smolder and a touch of their own unique humor interspersed here and there.

	schema:reviewBody "The task of art today is to bring chaos into order.  Theodor AdornoThe Coens start by selecting genres and then colliding them. So while a film like The Big Lebowski merges film noir with stoner comedies and Burn After Reading merges the 1970s conspiracy thriller with 1930's screwball The Man Who Wasn't There instead takes the tropes of 194050's noir and mingles them with 1950's UFO flicks and early science fiction B movies.Billy Wilder's noirs are homaged here but the chief influence is Hitchcock the film taking place in the same town as that of Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt the film's lead character sporting the name Edward Crane Psycho and the film's title seemingly alluding to The Wrong Man.Their genres selected the Coens typically cook up some reoccurring visual motif which links the genres being homaged. Here saucers wheels and smoke replace the bowling pins and tumbleweeds of Lebowski the hats of Miller's Crossing and the circles and hoops of Hudsucker.Though their films are played with a straight face the Coens' films are all postmodern comedies or pranks on the audience. For example though treated as being serious genre works Fargo was farce pretending to be fact the Coens seeing how far they can go with the audience and the supposedly serious True Grit is a parody of Charles Portis' parody both intentionally with no true grit. Even a more outlandish film like O Brother Where Art Thou? is an elaborate prank the film a metaparody of both the film within Sullivan's Travels and Homer's Odyssey. Ironically most people take these films dead seriously and as deep art.But regardless of the genres being homaged at their core every Coen film alternates between noir and screwball comedy the chaotic nature of the screwball genre meshing with the tragic indeterministic nature of noir. Noir being screwball without the comedy. Think Woody Allen's Melinda and Melinda in which the same plot is told twice once as comedy and once as tragedy the point being that life is itself an absurd pointless comic tragedy.The feeling of pointlessness which permeates every Coen flick is itself the chief tenet of postmodernism which denies absolute truth revels in nihilism relativism surface rearrangement sarcasm homage pastiche irony and adheres to French philosopher's Jacques Derrida's understanding of language in which words and images have no meaning and are viciously selflimited. If you believe theorists who predict that postmodern art before it is fully supplanted by the era of cyber interactivity is destined to reach the point at which it mirrors the universe it believes in  total randomness utter nihilism ie the universe of noir and an aesthetic of schizophrenia in which cinema degenerates to a string of references not only increasingly divorced from a reality which is itself lost but repeatedly digested by amnesic consumers  then surely cinema has already reached this point. Indeed the Coens like Woody Allen Charlie Kaufman and Todd Solondz now exclusively make films about the world being about nothing other than cold cosmic causality. I list these directors though not because their oeuvres are almost entirely about the meaningless of all things but because they all play formalist games about this nothingness. Trapped in an intellectual dead end they are unable to do anything other than serve up delightfully inventive ways to tell stories about...the pointlessness of telling stories.In any case The Man Who Wasn't There marks the point at which the subtext of all Coen films starts being brought to the forefront. From here on we would get The Ladykillers No Country Burn After Reading and A Serious Man all films in which the Coens turn away from the world and soliloquise over the vacuity of existence and the cruel hilarity of the universe.Like the Coens' best films though Man is helmed by an actor who refuses to allow his character to be turned into a mere victim or buffoon. Here Billy Bob Thornton plays Edward Crane a stoic small town barber who gets embroiled in a noir plot which like most noirs is designed to highlight his utter uselessness as a man.More than a noir victim though Crane embodies the Superfluous Man living life without purpose or direction and moaning about the way hair always grows back no matter how much he cuts. Where does it come from he asks us. Why doesn't it stop? The ubiquitous hair of course embodies Crane's impotency. By the film's end he thus becomes dejected The facts have no meaning Crane mopes realises that he makes no difference in the world and becomes resigned to the fact that he may as well be invisible or even dead as hair ultimately grows on without him.Like A Serious Man much of the film is spent mentioning things like Schrodinger's Cat and The Uncertainty Principle the point being that things change when observed that free agency is an illusion that everything Crane does is nullified by an opposite circumstance and that we're all better off just abiding with the flow. The Coens even throw in a long monologue in a prison cell in which a rambling character sums up the very point of Heisenberg and Schrodinger for us. It's outdated existentialism everything directly spelt out.Aesthetically the film is great filled with moody blacks and whites stark popart images and beautifully lit smoke. Thornton comes across as a morose Bogart his character endearing next to the Coens' usual cocktail of motor mouthed oddballs and dangerous fat men. The film's use of black and white and UFOs is also very clever. It was shot in colour and then had its colours removed suggesting Crane's own disappearance or existential fade out whilst the UFOs and the constant threat of alien abduction foreshadow Crane's fated vanishing.810  Stylish but heavyhanded and thin. Watch Ray's In A Lonely Place to see pessimism done right.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ed Crane is a barber who quietly wants more from his life.  When he meets a man with a business proposition he decides to go for it. He suspects his wife is having an affair with her boss and anonymously blackmails him  however things in noir are never straightforward and blackmail leads to murder and a series of events are sparked off around Ed.I must say I'm surprised this is as high up the imdb charts as it is but I'm not surprised by the lukewarm reception it had from multiplex audiences. This is a slow moody homage where things just happen rather than a neat startmiddletidy finishbad guy dies' type thing.  The Cohen brothers have a reputation for the old quirks and here is no different  mixing the steady noir narration with talk of haircuts and bingo makes for a strange if humorous mix.  The plot is good but the noir feel mixed with weird goingons may alienate many audiences.Thornton is a perfect choice  his features fit well in the black and white shadows and his voice suits the noir narration.  McDormand is good and Gandolfini gets another good role and does well.  The support is very good  Badalucco Shalhoub Polito are all very good.  Some elements of it are like a spot the TV face  we have Benrubi from ER Higgins from Ally McBeal and Abundas from Six Feet Under all in small roles.  It's even nice to see a cameo from McDonald.Overall this isn't as funny as it was billed simply because it is a noir. As such the Cohens mix the familiar themes of that genre with all new subjects and create a great effect.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a difference a good director makes! Billy Bob Thornton who was sadly misused in Bandits gets to recover himself in his brilliant characterization of Ed Crane in this film directed by Joel Coen. His performance is so detailed and subtle that he uses his face to great advantage in the closeups while the narration goes on in the background. The use of black and white heightens the atmosphere of this 40sstyle film noir. The brilliant cinematography is incredible in the use of shadows and dark tones that enhances the story to such an extent. Frances McDormand is incredible in the film as well. And what could one say about James Gandolfini? He gets better and better all the time. The atmosphere of the era is captured even in the small details. It's very refreshing to see the Coen brothers get over their last disaster of State and Main with such panache aided of course by their star Billy Bob Thornton and the ensemble cast and a great and ironic story.".

Its story about a man who makes an error of judgement that sends his life into a downward spiral will of course be familiar to noir fans but in this case the adverse consequences are so farreaching that they also go on to devastate the lives of a number of other key characters as well.Ed Crane Billy Bob Thornton is the laconic chainsmoking barber with a blank stare who mans the second chair at his brotherinlaw's hairdressing business in Santa Rosa California in 1949. His reticence and apparent lack of enthusiasm also spill over into his personal life where he seems to derive no joy from the parties or bingo sessions that he attends with his wife Doris Frances McDormand who's a heavy drinker and works as a bookkeeper at the town's largest department store Nirdlinger's. She and her boss Big Dave James Gandolfini who married into the business and claims to have been a war hero have been having an affair for some time.One day at the barber's shop near closing time a stranger called Creighton Tolliver Jon Polito calls by for a haircut and after removing his toupee tells Ed that he's trying to set up a drycleaning business which is guaranteed to be profitable but he needs a silent partner and 10000 capital to go ahead with the project. After giving the matter some thought Ed successfully raises the money by blackmailing his wife's lover and immediately passes the cash on to Tolliver.From that point on things go from bad to worse as Ed realises he's been scammed kills Big Dave in self defence and sees Doris arrested for murder and cooking the books at Nirdlinger's. The numerous developments that follow are full of wonderful twists black humour and tragedy and lead inexorably to the story's deeply ironic conclusion.In typical Coen Brothers' style the movie's characters are full of interesting eccentricities the dialogue is smart and succinct and there are also a couple of entertaining subplots involving UFOs and Ed's fascination with a teenage piano player called Birdy Scarlett Johansson. Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Ed Crane is flawless as he manages to make his difficult character very real and convincing. The supporting players are also terrific especially Frances McDormand James Gandolfini and Tony Shalhoub who plays a highpowered defence lawyer whose considerable talent in only surpassed in magnitude by his incredible arrogance.".

	schema:headline " Great neonoir film by the Coen brothers";
	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen too many films by the Coen brothersEthan and Joel Coen... in fact this and Intolerable Cruelty are the only ones I've seen. I decided to see this after hearing many positive things about it and finding out that it's a tribute to the old 'noir' films of the 40's and 50's. I love noir films and neonoir films are often great as well. So I decided to see this film and I'm am very happy that I did. The plot is great... something that we all can relate to and yet very recognizable for noir... which is quite impressive since many noir films suffer from the plot being of limited appealthe P.I.detective who gets the case etc.. The pacing is excellent. I wasn't bored for a second. The atmosphere of the film is great... very dark and moody even in the humor. The acting is great... Thornton McDormand Gandolfini Johansson Shalhoub... everyone is great. Billy Bob Thornton's character is easy to relate towho hasn't felt that their life wasn't going anywhere at one point? and his narration as well as flawless performance is part of what makes the film noir... his character talks very little but the voiceover and his subtle actingwhich includes very little dialog is great and he carries the movie perfectly. The characters are all wellwritten... there was only a short period where I didn't entirely understand a characters actions but this was more because I hadn't thought that much about this particular character than a lack of credibility characterwise. The story is great... it has some very interesting twists and it holds your interest and entertains you for the entire runtime of about 1 hour and 45 minutes. The humor is good but there is fairly little of it in the filmconsidering that this is what the Coen's are wellknown for... well part of it anyway but all of it fits perfectly. Much of it is dark like the rest of the film. I watched this on a DVD which I borrowed from the library and when I was about to start the film I noticed that there were two disks... one in blackwhite and one in color. I thought for a while considered which would be better but then I remembered that this is a homage to noir films... and possibly more importantly the directors intention is to make something that looks as if it could have come from that period where those films were at the peak of popularity... and why would I want to go against the directors intention on a film? That would negate the very point of watching it. All in all if you're a fan of the Coen brothers directorial style or neonoirfilm noir you'll most likely love it as much as I did. If not maybe you can just enjoy the great acting and atmosphere. And if not that the film probably just isn't for you. I recommend it to any fan of the Coen brothers and of film noirneonoir. Fans of any of the actors might also like it. Just be prepared it is quite dark and many will not like it simply for that. If you believe you can sit through this film you definitely should consider it. 810".

There's this weird TV channel that screens it just about every other week and I seem to always happen to be in front of the screen at the time by mere chance.

This is not hyperbole.Not that it's not good already.  Joel Coen who in O Brother Where Art Thou showed himself to be one of the few living directors capable of fully exploiting colour shows himself here to be one of the few living directors capable of fully exploiting light and shade.

It sounds academic but it works the Coens never use an idea if they can't make it breathe.As a rule firstperson narration breathes life into books but kills films  with the exception of one genre film noir.  And the Coens understand why it works when it does in this rare exception.  Like most noir protagonists Ed Crane Billy Bob Thornton is almost perfectly uncommunicative neither his conversation nor his actions tell us anything about him.  We need direct access to his very thoughts put into words to be able to understand what's going on and to appreciate his story.

	schema:reviewBody "This newest film by the Coen brothers is a masterpiece by all standards in my opinion. Once again the Coens have succeeded in doing what they have done in all 8 of their previous movies making a simple story more interesting than you could ever imagine possible!Billy Bob Thornton adds to the noir atmosphere with his superb emotionless portrayal of the barber of the title Ed Crane. Essays could be written just on the way he smokes his cigarette! Of course the Coens have recalled other faces from their little black book of actorswe'lluseagaininsomesmallpart. Jon Polito is truly very annoying in a good way in his role as someone trying to sell a dry cleaning idea to Thornton and you never thought dry cleaning could be interesting?. Whereas Tony Shalhoub is a humorous addition as the ridiculously confusing attorney. How can we also forget Mrs Joel Coen aka Frances McDormand. As Thorntons wife she excels and towards the end shows real emotion and acting prowess as seen previously in Fargo and Blood Simple.The fact that this film was shot in black and white is a first for the Coens and adds a 1940's atmosphere that no color film could do. The denouement is an excellent study of Crane's life with his emotionless voice over accompanying it.Overall this film is an example of what film should be. With the crew and cast an example of what a film cast and crew should be. How This film was nominated for no Oscars is criminal especially Thornton. However the Coens had their usual Cannes reception to fall back on Cannes is the only one that counts for REAL movies anyway!. Winning the directors prize shared for Joel Coen although as always with the Coens where Joel goes Ethan follows so the credit is really to both of them.1010 In my opinion the Coens best work.".

Every film is about the filmmaking process the whole process that includes how we tuck it away and use it in our lives.So all their films are about this process. They apparently only let the actors see the miniscule part of that process that they need to know. Billy Bob for instance clearly believes that the film is a story about him and the material on the DVD confirms this fiction. But the brothers laugh at Bob's insignificance just as they laugh at Ed's. Last time around they jerked Clooney's chain in just the same way as events in the story jerk his character.This is all metafilm and part of the game is to tease out threads and images and characters and names. The joke is all on the reuse of this stuff. We base our life on these images and we can only do so because we do not know that we do. The more we examine it the less natural they seem so that guy Fritz or Werner tells us. The real narrator is the lawyer.I'm darn glad these guys were around. But at a certain level of exposure they've made their point. But they are young men yet and someday they might turn all this oneiric mastery to actually change us. Change us that is in a more profound way than simply showing us what slaves to the filmed image we are.The Black and White is not. Rather it is shot on color stock then printed as BW on color stock. I believe it is done this way as a matter of keeping with economies of scale but a serendipitous effect occurs  on the screen but not the DVD which just turns everything to dark green. But on the screen the result is rather like the whites and greys of snow. These appear white from far away but in fact are millions of points of color. A big white movie screen will do this anyway as a result of the refractive physics of the silica. But the effect is greatly enhanced using black on color stock. Subliminally hypnotizing and  some theorize  the phenomenon behind many UFO encounters.".

It almost doubles as the theme you just have to tweak the last part. The closer you look the less there is. The Coen Brothers' latest offering plays like a David Lynch piece that never made it off the shelf. At face value is a film with some of the most talented actors around today with the smallest yet most dynamic role going to James Gandolfini. Upon closer inspection however is a film that isn't there. It is tediously long bogged down in narration has no redeeming characters and fumbles through excessive uninteresting subplots. It is as if there were four different editors all in conflict about where and when to end the movie. Billy Bob Thornton's main character has all the enthusiasm of a dying Eeyore. Something seemingly haunts his character but we never find out his interests in life or anything about his past and thus have little interest in his future. So he falls into some extreme bad luck and is finally convicted and killed not to mention everyone else. His bad luck is over the top however and we as an audience cannot relate to it in a context other than a weird Coen Brothers film. Further we have little sympathy for him when he dies because he was never alive. The other characters which are virtually all killed off have the same lack of a lust for life. Why Thornton's character is the main focus remains a mystery because he is actually the most boring of them all. You can always count on great quirky performances in a Coen Brothers movie but unfortunately there is little more than confusion and uninspired surrealism beneath the black and white surface of this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 2002 Cohen brothers film is a delight. The Man Who Wasn't There combines everything I like in the Coen brother's unique way of telling a story. From the comic of the situation witnessed in the famous O Brother Where Art Though 2000 to the originality of the scenario seen in Barton Fink 1991 not to mention the singularity of the characters and their lack of control over the situation in the excellent Fargo 1996 all those hints have been gathered to built this well thought story. Joel and Ethan directed and wrote this picture about a bored and boring chainsmoking barber admirably played by Billy Bob Thornton best role for this underrated actorwho blackmails his wife's boss and lover for money to invest in dry cleaning. As you sense the plan goes terribly wrong. I believe this story is a pretext to show us how little is our grip on the reality of our lives. And to demonstrate how justice easily becomes a comicopathetic masquarade when given by men. On the contrary true Justice eventually lies in the wrinkles of men's destiny. As a conclusion you are better off expecting a landing of an alien spaceship than a fair and clear trial in a court of law. Whether we agree or not to this demonstration it does not take away the pleasure of watching these terrific actors putting into play the original and dark scenario of the two brothers. Billy Bob Thornton is a master portraying to perfection Ed Crane the laconic barber. Since Dead Man 1995 I don't recall a lot of movies where directors have capitalized on his enormous talent. Frances McDormand Doris Crane is as usual fantastic. We remember her in Wonder Boys 2000 and of course as the sheriff in Fargo 1996. Here she plays wonderfully the barber's wife going from bitterness to sorrow. Some characters can be seen as cliche like Freddy Riedenschneider the lawyer played by the good Tony Shalhoub however they are all enjoyable to watch James Gandolfini is terrific as Big Dave and Jon Polito very colorful as Creighton Tolliver not to forget the very talkative and sincere Michael Badalucco as Franck Raffo or the great job done by Scarlett Johansson in the role of Rachael 'Birdy' Abundas the not very straight and quiet adolescent you would expect. The Black and White picture is more an artistic exploration from the Coen brothers and I don't think has anything to do with the chosen period late 40's. However the black and white picture is very well shot by Roger Deakins and impose tremendously well Billy Bob Thornton's character and therefore never becomes a burden for the audience. The Man Who Wasn't There does not belong to any genre in particular. The Movie is made of a myriads of genres and characters that the Coen brothers have managed to master throughout their career of story tellers. The movie is a film Noir but not only it is a dark comedy but not only it is a light thriller but not only it is shot in black and white but still have colorful characters it tells a simple story of a laconic barber but there is more to it eventually Justice will prevail but not the way we think it will. In the end it is a unique movie and in times where everything seems to look the same this movie becomes a true jewel.".

The movie gets you terrifyingly and melancholically inside the head of a guy for whom the simplest tableandchairs stuff is ceasing to make sense. And the brothers use Carter Burwell's variant on Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata in a way that's as crazily persistent and ceaselessly effective as the insanely repetitive romantic theme from Godard's CONTEMPT. Not even Godard has used late Beethoven so aptly. Like BARRY LYNDON another movie whose central question is What kind of a man are you? THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE has an elusive smokelike plangency.

	schema:reviewBody "The Coen Brothers have their place in the cinematic lexicon. They're the clever jokesters of the movies and have given us many great movies. However I really wish they would evolve. Sure their films are a lot of fun but they generally end up as nothing more than an entertaining joke. Only two of their films in my opinion achieve anything more Barton Fink and Fargo but even they only walk a few steps past that line.The Man Who Wasn't There for a long time suggests that it might end up being the best Coen Brothers movie. It seems to have depth past the cynical parodies and absurdities. Unfortunately after about one third of the film has past it loses focus and runs towards easy jokes and cutesy quirks as if it were a burly man who almost revealed something about himself after a night of heavy drinking. In particular the UFO subplot really should have been cut. And they didn't need the young pianist's seduction near the end. It felt forced. Sure what results in the film is very entertaining but it felt like something profound was about to be revealed.The film is a quality product as you would expect. Billy Bob Thornton is great. He gave two of the best performances of 2001 the second in Monster's Ball. His character is interesting but that is one of the major areas that the script pulled back on before it could say enough to make it fascinating. Francis MacDormand is great but she has far too little screentime. The Brothers obviously wanted to focus on Thornton but it should have centered less on him than his relationship with his wife. A flashback nearer the end of the film hinted at that depth once again but it was not pursued.I haven't said too much good about the film though I've already scored it in my summary. Truth be told The Man Who Wasn't There is an enormously entertaining and funny film. It contains some of the Coen Brothers' subtlest humor. It helps to be a classic Hollywood lover especially of film noirs. The name of the store for instance Nirdlinger's is a reference to Double Indemnity. It's also worth seeing for some excellent black and white cinematography. It's always been obvious that the Brothers have wanted to make a film in BW and here it is. It is a glorious achievement in that particular aspect of the art of filmmaking.".

It was a small. black and white screen but I was stunned by this Medieval movie that had nothing to do in terms of atmosphere or filming with the classics from Hollywood Ivanhoe The Adventures of Robin Hood... that I loved so much and still do. And then... it disappeared for 40 years!!! I bought it on DVD in 2010 and fell in love with it all over again.I did not remember the plot at all but I had kept in my mind images of the dark corridors of the Teutonics' castle and of the malevolent knights in black and white slowly haunting it.There is a specific mood in this movie and this is probably why some reviewers did not like it. There is a real attempt at recreating a long gone world. I found strange to accuse the characters of naming God every ten seconds. This is the Middle Age for God's sake and HE is everywhere. OK the plot goes in a lot of directions but it remains easy to follow and it reinforce the epic aspect of the story how big events are affecting individuals. What is striking is that the movie tries to put you in the shoes of the people who lived at that time. Unlike Hollywood which still loves today to show the past through a politically correct and contemporary revision.The cinematography is beautiful and I particularly loved the long lateral tracking shots which are numerous. On some aspects Krzyzacy reminds me of silent movies notably the shot of Jurand on the devastate snowy scenery covered with gallows. Never black on white has been more gloomy. Also in a lot of scenes the actors are literally positioned as elements of the sets like some sorts of architectural items. Eisenstein would have been proud.Forget the propaganda the movie was made in 1960. Aleksander Ford had no choice but to show the Teutonics as protoNazis. But if you do some research about the Teutonic Order you see that they manage to share a a lot with the Nazis on a lot of aspects. When I watch this movie I know why Braveheart and all sanitized attempts of that kind make me fume.".

The movie has been made about 1960 on order of communist and paranationalist propaganda to illustrate the role of alliance between Poles and eastern nations in stopping the German expansionism a cold war ran that time Poland had no diplomatic links with FR of Germany which was putting Poland's western borders into questioning.

It doesn't add anything new doesn't advance cinema doesn't bring anything new to the table. It is propaganda just like Alexander Nevsky but at a time when it wasn't really necessary. What was the point in telling people that Germany was bad in 1960? Propaganda doesn't age well in either case.The final scene is epic and amazing on its own. It must be watched just for that.

To his credit he sets out to prove that with his highly agile and forceful style soon making him a formidable boxer who soon claims the heavyweight championship. His personal life is no less noteworthy with his allegiance to the Nation of Islam his friendship with the controversial Malcolm X and his abandonment of his slave name in favor of Muhammad Ali stirring up controversy.

	schema:headline " Solid performances but there was definitely missed potential here";
	schema:reviewBody "The first thing that I am prepared to acknowledge is Will Smith's performance in this film he was impressive and seemed to really get into the character of Ali. Although his acting was excellent in this film I don't believe that he should have been Oscar nominated. Likewise Foxx and several of the supporting characters were also excellent. The film was also wellshot and generally wellmade and from a technical aspect it was a fairly polished product. Unfortunately that's where the praise for this film ends....For me there was far too much time spent on dull aspects of Ali's life such as Ali's various relationships  this aspect of his life got way too much focus and it did at times make the film feel like an overlong combination of melodrama and soap opera. At the same time other potentially more interesting or important areas seemed to either have been ignored or glossed over  there's very little focus on Ali's training no real mention of his family. Considering the film is over 2 and a half hours long I expected there to be a reasonable amount of boxing andor training but we're probably treated to about 30 minutes of boxing if that and then 2 hours of melodrama and soap opera. I'm sure a lot of what I describe as 'melodrama' and 'soap opera' type events did occur in Ali's life but these elements don't make for an entertaining film and should have been kept to a minimum.All of the above isn't helped by the fact that the screenplay felt like it was put together in a haphazard way  the writers would shift from one aspect of Ali's life to another in quick succession barely giving you chance to digest what you've just seen.Although from a technical perspective this film was generally well put together and polished I did feel that the camera work during the boxing matches was pretty poor and as a result I didn't feel quite as involved in the action as I did when I've watched other boxing films. This came as a really big disappointment when you consider how poor many other elements of the film were.Aside from the great performances there really isn't much else going for this film. My feeling are that it was an overlong soap opera with a bit of boxing thrown in here and there. If you want to see a good boxing biopic then I would recommend Cinderella Man. Muhammad Ali may be the Greatest but this film certainly isn't.".

	schema:headline " The Biggest Modern Day Character Challenge I can imagine...";
	schema:reviewBody "Some people never liked Ali. He is one of those characters who is so strong most people are forced to either love him despite his weaknesses or hate him. He was one figure in American history who never really needed anybody. He was a conscientious objector against the Viet Nam war yet he is honored by presidents of the nation he refused to capitulate with in crimes against humanity. His story is that vital to America. When Ali was still a teenager he tried his best to prove his personal excellence in a society prejudiced against black people. He won the boxing gold medal at the Rome Olympics in 1960 yet he came home to Louisville and still wasn't good enough buy a sandwich at a white restaurant because he was black. He then decided if the gold medal wasn't good enough for America then it wasn't good enough for him. At this point in his life when he had nothing else he took the gold medal and threw it in the river. He observed the wrestler Gorgeous George and admired the way he used the negative energy generated by those who disapproved of him as fuel to become the top attraction and make fools of all those who were against him. He wanted to make people boo him. He proclaimed himself as more beautiful than any creature on the planet. He told the world he was the greatest who ever lived. The more they booed him the more energy it gave him. He didn't have a mentor or a manager. He assembled a group of Louisville investors to bankroll him all by himself. He knew exactly what he wanted from the world reached out and took it. He made a crown out of it. Nobody gave him anything and nobody can ever take that away. He discarded the name of a great white civil rights leader during the civil war and reasoned that if he was really free to be what HE was then he should take a name that he thought was a natural black person's name. It didn't make sense for others who came before him to fight and win the rights to do whatever they wanted if they were then going to do nothing but turn around and say Thank You. He decided in order to validate the fight for freedom his role was to be free. Muhammad Ali is played by the maybe the only person in the universe who would dare to even attempt it and he succeeds marvelously not just in a marginal way but in a big big way.This film isn't just swagger or an imitation of Ali. This is a deep sensitive poignant and romantic story about one of the greatest public figures of the twentieth century. This man truly is a poet and he's lived the life of a poet. To a great extent Muhammad Ali made his life a manifesto of truth about the American experience. Of all the stories of the twentieth century in America this was one of the most important ones to tell. This film has characters galore from Jamie Foxx as Bundini Brown who keeps chanting float like a butterfly sting like a beeee! when everyone in the world thought Ali was going to die at the hands of Sonny Liston Jada PinkettSmith as Ali's devoutly religious and adoring first wife MichaelMichele playing Veronica Porche a beautiful jet set model with whomAli had an affair to a strong performance by Mario Van Peebles as Ali's conscience Malcolm X who forces Ali to think against himself and his adoring Black Muslim following in the interests of right and wrong.This film has irony choreography conflict humor drama and accurately portrays the highest highs of any public figure I've seen in my lifetime as well as some of the most bitter defeats.This is about male psychology. This is about female psychology. This is about a religious movement in America. This is about a culture in America and many cultures in America and their struggles to live together and treat each other right and fairly while trying to do the right thing as concerns their own conscience.The most glaring weaknesses of any sports film ever made are in the sport scenes themselves. This is the strongest point of this film and also makes it the greatest sports film ever made.I've been a boxing fan since I was eleven. I was a part of crowds who gathered around Muhammad Ali before he became champion. I know what he looks like face to face. I've watched his boxing films dozens of times and I'll tell you that the scenes in this movie are perfect reenactments of what actually happened in the ring. This couldn't have been done in less than dozens of takes per scene. They throw punches exactly like the fighters in the real fights. They're in the same part of the ring when they throw those punches. They react to the punches the same way. They even get knocked down in the correct parts of the ring in exactly the same way as the fighters who were in the original fight.I'm not going to comment on whether it should have won an Oscar for best picture best actor best supporting actor best direction best photography best choreography or other features in the film. Maybe it's better that it didn't win those awards in that year because this film is bigger than any year.This is the sports film that all others will be judged by from here on out by anyone with any sense of realism and art in movies.This is one for the ages.".

	schema:reviewBody "Muhammad Ali is a heroic character with legendary wit humanity and boxing skill. Always a fighter and always a lover Ali's life is a subtle and clever story of dignity strength and compassion. And Ali himself wrote that story. This film profoundly reminds me of an autobiography Ali wrote several years ago with the help of a friend. Never afraid to do what needed to be done to get where he wanted to go Ali was never a stranger to controversy flambuoyance acid wit and an outspoken promotion of truth  even when most of his own fans couldn't see it. This film captures the champ's many battles not the least of which are the internal battles he wages with himself over politics his ego money and his own destructive patterns in relationships with women. But thankfully it does so in a respectful way which does not compromise the man's heroism nor does it spare the audience of the laughter mischief and joy Ali became so well known for. Michael Mann's film has relatively little boxing in it and is in no way a chronicle of Ali's career. A better choice for that subject is The Greatest  httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0076111combined starring Ali himself or one of the many documentaries on Ali. This film is about how and why Ali is who he is and how he drove himself and everybody around him to reach phenomenal heights. It features the beginnings of Ali's career and follows him through the most difficult part of his career when he fought the US government over the Viet Nam war fought his own religious establishment over his outspokenness and even fought against hypocritical promoters he relied on who were bent on exploiting the third world. Too intelligent to just be a prize fighter too passionate to just shut up and too faithful to give up his religion when it gave up on him Ali just kept on driving. The film ends after Ali's fight against George Foreman in 1977 so it does not cover his entire career and does not discuss his more recent activities. His life since retiring from boxing is equally interesting in my opinion but since Mann wanted to depict the most dramatic and challenging aspects of the Ali legend I can't blame him for his choice of time frame.The cast is very strong. Will Smith gives a fine performance wonderfully recasting Ali's wonderful facial expressions gestures physical style and speech pattern Jamie Foxx Ron Silver and Mario Van Peebles are all excellent in their supporting roles. And the boxers are all very believable. They even look like the people they play. Smith doesn't really look anything like Ali and you are occasionally aware mainly through Smith's imitation of the greatest's very unique speech that you are watching an imitation but this does not in any way detract from the film.Highly recommended for those interested in reallife drama and heroism the civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s and the intelligent and political side of American sports. NOT recommended for fans of boxing movies and action films. This is a slow moving intense drama and neither a feelgood film nor a slugfest.".

Will Smith gives a fine performance wonderfully recasting Ali's wonderful facial expressions gestures physical style and speech pattern Jamie Foxx Ron Silver and Mario Van Peebles are all excellent in their supporting roles. And the boxers are all very believable. They even look like the people they play. Smith doesn't really look anything like Ali and you are occasionally aware mainly through Smith's imitation of the greatest's very unique speech that you are watching an imitation but this does not in any way detract from the film.Highly recommended for those interested in reallife drama and heroism the civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s and the intelligent and political side of American sports. NOT recommended for fans of boxing movies and action films. This is a slow moving intense drama and neither a feelgood film nor a slugfest.";

A conglomerate of great acting great direction and a great story has made Ali a landmark film.  This film is socially important because it raises up one of the most notable and underappreciated figures of the twentieth century Ali.  Many considered Ali just a boxer with a big mouth but this film finally exposes him for what he truly was one of the greatest civil rights leaders of our time.  The film makes subtle but amazinglydone comparisons between Ali and other civil rights leaders notably Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and highlites Ali's influence with theirs. This theme is climaxed in the beautiful scene of Ali Will Smith running down streets in Africa with local chidren chanting his name.  At this moment in the film we understand as viewers that Ali did not fight for fame or fortune but he fought for his rights and the rights of all black people in the United States and the world.  No other film has exhalted Ali's influence in such a way.  It was beautifully done.  Ali will become one of my favorite films of all time and I believe will be remembered years from now as the crowning achievement of both the main actor and the director.  I applaud their efforts".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many critics out there who have given this film negative reviews on the basis that the film didn't succeed in giving the viewers a focused look at how significant and grand Ali was.  I understand completely the motivations and arguments behind those negative reviews.  However I must say they misunderstood what the movie was trying to do.  Because most thought Ali would be a standard biopic the film was expected to cover a sprawling canvas of a largerthanlife figure of charisma known as Ali from childhood to present with deft focus on his life.  This was NOT director Michael Mann's goal.  Mann's ultimate objective in my humble opinion was to create an intimate portrait of a man whom the public saw only as a cultural icon.  To give him a soul behind that grand persona.  To reveal him as a fellow man among men how he lived how he behaved in his personal life how he sat how he looked how he talked every little insignificant moments of his life in the film were there to give the public an idea a glimpse of him as a fellow human being and not as an icon or a symbol.  That is why the movie was an absolute masterpiece.  Although Will Smith's performance in the film was hypnotically amazing I must say the real star of the movie for me was Michael Mann.  From the first 10 minutes or so of the montage sequence in the beginning of the movie Mann absorbed me right in with his achingly beautiful intimate and minimalistic photography and compositions.  I still see the imagery in my head going on a loop and forcing me to play back the memorable images my eyes were exposed to as if they were photographic printing paper.  The movie was so beautiful and poignant I found myself weeping during the many moments of introspective scenes with Ali looking on towards the horizon or vacantly into nothingness as if internally struggling to find his identity.  Before I stop myself in rambling on and on about how much I'm in love with this film and Michael Mann's directing style I should note that there is a sequence in the movie where you won't resist in emotionally breaking down.  The sequence in question is the jogging sequence in Africa where Ali runs past nonchalantly through a village and looks at children's murals on concrete walls of himself.  I WILL NOT spoil this because I want you viewers to go through the same shock that I had.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ali is a film that both succeeds and fails at the same time. Will Smith's performance was very solid yet I never was able to shake the feeling that on screen it was Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali and not simply Muhammad Ali.  Perhaps that is through no fault of his.  He truly does a great impression of the fighter.  The script is again decent centering on several facets of the star's life that go beyond the sports pages. However overall the whole project has a rather distant feel. The viewer rarely is truly captivated by what is occurring. Michael Mann's characteristic documentaryesque filming style works well in parts but services to alienate the viewer in others.  Yes it feels as though you are almost watching a documentary in many cases as if the viewer is a bystander to the circumstances at hand but this is a work of drama not a documentary. I wish someone had told Mann to stop shaking the camera and shifting to view Ali between the standard stock of blurred reporters for a few seconds and do a more typically dramatic shot. With Heat and The Insider Mann managed to pull off this style successfully. In Ali he does not. In many cases conversations begin to rise but then only dissipate before anything really gripping has been said. Simply put this film could have used a few more motivational speeches along the lines of a Rocky film. Perhaps it wouldn't have been as accurate but it would have serviced a more dramatic story at least one where the viewer really felt involved. Ali goes through two wives in the film and in neither case do they even serve to get very angry with him. Voices begin to rise and then either the woman or Ali leaves the room. The scene ends without any heavy emotion other than stern faces being shown. He's divorced a few minutes later.  The fight scenes also have a lack of emotion.  The film style is interesting and visually stimulating but it could have used a few it's over Rock!' lines here and there to punctuate things.Mann's standard use of music again fails in many cases here. Whereas in historical films like Forrest Gump period music is used to punctuate a dramatic score in Ali it is almost the sole backing track of the film. There is scarcely any musical score involved. When it is used it often seems like it was just pieced together from leftovers to provide ambience. In a few key dramatic scenes the pop ditties being played although sometimes fitting lyrically really end up being a distraction. The death of Malcolm X is a prime example.  Ali's close friend has just been killed and you're just waiting for a rising orchestral number however cliche and standard it may be that's what you're looking for but instead you get a period song that at this point in the film is beginning to sound like half a dozen others before it. In several cases Mann's musical style does work Ali's jog through the streets of Zaire being an example the closing number another but the technique fails overall.I've mostly criticized this film which should not be the only viewpoint because cinematically it is a fine work. There doesn't need to be another Ali film made as this will service his legacy nicely. It has flaws but I point out these flaws taking for granted just how good much of it is. The banter between Ali and Howard Cosell Jon Voight who completely disappears into this role is classic and work by Jaime Foxx and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X is solid as well. Michael Mann knows how to handle a film and I would rather watch a subpar outing from him than most of what Hollywood produces any day.  He's just done better.  Some script work and a better musical score could have pushed this good film to greatness.710".

Yes the fight scenes are boring I never thought I'd say that about a movie but I did for Ali.The fact that Will Smith was nominated for an Oscar for this movie is offensive.  He acts the same as he does in almost every one of his other movies cocky and funny though he was a lot less funny in Ali making him just cocky.  Oh well I guess Smith uses an accent in this so maybe that's why... ...maybe not.  Boring movie only redeeming factor is Jon Voight and that's only because Jon Voight's in a movie where he doesn't look or sound like Jon Voight.  Bad movie 510.";

	schema:reviewBody "I personally think this movie was one of the best of last year. As a biopic it might be interesting to compare this movie with Beautiful Mind that other biopic that won too much awards. I often thought about what if Ron Howardtogether with his writer made Ali how would that movie be? Because Ali's life can be told in a very Beautiful Mind'esque way.Show how Ali became the greatest then let his world fall show how he begins suffering from his disease until he has to stop boxing and end the movie with some sort of heroic end moment maybe an award show where Ali get's an award like sportsman of the decadecentury whatever I don't actually know if he ever got something like that but it's just an example. Can you see where I'm going?Now if you look at Ali how this movie turned out you see it's a complete different movie. They don't show Ali getting sick they show only 10 years of his life the 10 years that transformed him from a Good boxer to a Legend.By limiting it's storytime to these 10 years I think Michael Mann succeeded in not making Ali sentimental. When we leave the theater we don't feel pity for Ali because he had such a hard life like we did have in a sense with John Nash in B.mind. We leave the theater in a state of awe. The movie shows us how Ali became a legend. How he struggled and fought and we never pity him Ali is to powerfull a personality to pity we respect him and given that Ali is very much real and alive in the real world we can't help but to look up to that person.However the movie doesn't glamourize Ali it doesn't make of him a flawless largerthanlife hero. By portraying his troubled relations with his many girlfriendswifes how he more than once let himself be used by others etc. the movie shows Ali was human. It doesn't shy away of his questionable relationship with The Nation of the Islam for instance. Just as Ali in real life probably wouldn't hide those facts.Now to come to the practical aspects of this movie...because Ali is truly a magnificent film. Of course Smith plays Ali incredible and if you compare him to footage of the real Ali when he was about 2030 years you see just how close he comes to recreating Ali. But next to him we also have Jon Voight Jaimi Foxx Mario van Peebles all playing so completely incharacter that you hardly recognize them as actors. Then there is Mann's directorial power. From the brilliant opening 10 minutes to the truly aweinspiring moving scenes in Africa at the end Mann carefully directs this picture never making it dull but also never forcing plotlines. He tells the story so subtle you won't ever feel like he thinks that you as an audience can't understand something unless it's explained in big bright words. If someone breaks down in tears he won't compliment this with violins in the background softfocus or whatever he just shows a person breaking down. And I like this style incredibly well especially in a biopic like this.So to come to a conclusion Ali is indeed a masterpiece. Not as instantly accesible as the Insider or Heat and not as conventional as Beautiful Mind but in it's own right one of the not THE greatest Biopic's yet made.".

My only criticism of Mann in this film is that a few of the scenes outside the ring lack narritive drive with one of the characters saying something to another character and having the camer a linger too long on the characters moody look  but this is a minor flawThe serious flaw is something everyone else has pointed out and is something that I quickly noticed while watching ALI  The script is too overlong . I hadnt read the readers comments untill I sat down to write this review so my views werent prejudiced but most of the reviewers are spot on  fight scenes feature as do politics  religion  Malcolm X  government spooks and Alis marital life and I cant help thinking the whole film would have worked better if it had just focussed on Alis boxing career . As it is ALI isnt a film Id watch over and over again like RAGING BULLIt does have a positive point in its favour  The cast . If I hadnt known what part Jon Voight was playing Id have sat through the film wondering when he was going to turn up because hes totally unrecognisable but hes very good in his role . Ron Silver is almost unrecognisable but good as is Mario Van Peebles    but best of all is Will Smith as Muhammed Ali . Okay I could nit pick but that would be unkind and pedantic so all Ill say is Smith deserved his Oscar nod".

Most of the main events of Ali's life are skimmed and long extended scenes are given to nothing like Ali dancing. I did not buy Smith he looked like the Fresh Prince trying to pretend he was Ali. Never did I once buy him as Ali. Voight was pathetic as Cossell and the actors that were brought in to play such characters as Sonny Liston were poor.

	schema:reviewBody "He ' floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee' and the world says he was the 'greatest'. Of course I am talking about Muhammad Ali the world's most famous boxer. The movie to celebrate his life was an exceptional piece of cinematography. With an outstanding cast and hypnotic story 'Ali' brings to life the controversial and popular boxer that we all love. This movie can be enjoyed by anyone whether they like boxing or not.The Champ Is Here! With wit and athletic genius with defiant rage and inner grace Muhammad Ali forever changed the American landscape. Fighting all comers Ali took on the law conventions the status quo and the war  as well as the fists in front of him. Ali both ignited and mirrored the conflicts of his time and ours to become one of the most admired fighters in the world.What an unbelievable role by Hollywood superstar Will Smith. He was fantastic in the role of Muhammad Ali. The work that he must have had to put into become 'Ali' would have been so grueling. I remember reading that Smith had to go through heavy amounts of boxing and weight training to feel like a boxer and then also look at Ali as a youngster from footage and then become him. That he did in only the way that Will Smith can. He was so good that the academy saw the role to be worthy of an academy award nomination. It was a shame that he did not win it.The other roles in this film were also of a high quality. I found Jon Voight's role as the outlandish sports commentator Howard Cosell to be brilliant. At no stage can you pick that it is him. I am sure that what we see of Cosell from Voight is the true man of the time. It was also interesting to see Will Smith's real wife Jada Pinkett in the same movie. She was good as one of  Muhammad's love interests.The story to this film was interesting as it had many fascinating facets to it. I found the way that we see Muhammad's interaction with the many women in his life to be written and portrayed well. I also enjoyed the way that Ali stood up for himself outside of the ring with a poignant time in the film being when Cassius Clay rejects serving in the US army to fight in the Vietnam war. In addition to the fighting scenes that were interweaved brilliantly to help balance this film's story. A lot of the praise must be given to the main man behind this film director Michael Mann. He did an amazing job bringing 'Ali' to life. He was also a producer and a writer so he had a big role in making 'Ali' the film it was.Also having real boxers appear in this film made the movie all the more enjoyable as you believe the fighting is real. In fact the boxing scenes in this film are of the finest quality. Will Smith put a lot of himself on the line by really fighting as a boxer. He was up against fighters such as Malick Bowens Michael Bentt James Torney Alfred Cole and Charles Shufford. I am certain that these men could pack a good punch so Will was very willing to put his health on the line to make this film 'believable'.I must make mention of what a personality Muhammad must have been. He was very opinionated but also stood up for what he thought was true. I remember one comment about Ali being that he was 'a loud mouth' and that was so true. I mean the way that he must have fired up his opponents before a fight  by his blind arrogance is truly amazing. Again praise must be given to the way that Will Smith captured Ali's personality to be really coming 'the greatest'. It is a shame that Muhammad's life has been affected by the horrible 'Parkinson's disease'. Yet I am sure that he is giving a great battle against this.Ali is another film based on a true story with a role that one performer makes his own. Smith is now in the class of actors such as Jim Carrey who became the crazy Andy Kaufman Denzel Washington who became Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter the fine role taken on by Academy Award winner Hilary Swank who became the controversial figure of Teena Brandon in 'Boys Don't Cry' and Julia Roberts who was Erin Brockovich in one of the best performances of her career. This role was great from Smith as it can and will show many people of my generation how great a legend Ali really was and is. This movie gives us all an important lesson. That we can be anything we want against adversary and for the only person who counts  that being you!CMRS gives 'Ali' 4 very good film".

	onyx:emotionText "He ' floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee' and the world says he was the 'greatest'. Of course I am talking about Muhammad Ali the world's most famous boxer. The movie to celebrate his life was an exceptional piece of cinematography. With an outstanding cast and hypnotic story 'Ali' brings to life the controversial and popular boxer that we all love. This movie can be enjoyed by anyone whether they like boxing or not.The Champ Is Here! With wit and athletic genius with defiant rage and inner grace Muhammad Ali forever changed the American landscape. Fighting all comers Ali took on the law conventions the status quo and the war  as well as the fists in front of him. Ali both ignited and mirrored the conflicts of his time and ours to become one of the most admired fighters in the world.What an unbelievable role by Hollywood superstar Will Smith. He was fantastic in the role of Muhammad Ali. The work that he must have had to put into become 'Ali' would have been so grueling. I remember reading that Smith had to go through heavy amounts of boxing and weight training to feel like a boxer and then also look at Ali as a youngster from footage and then become him. That he did in only the way that Will Smith can. He was so good that the academy saw the role to be worthy of an academy award nomination. It was a shame that he did not win it.The other roles in this film were also of a high quality. I found Jon Voight's role as the outlandish sports commentator Howard Cosell to be brilliant. At no stage can you pick that it is him. I am sure that what we see of Cosell from Voight is the true man of the time. It was also interesting to see Will Smith's real wife Jada Pinkett in the same movie. She was good as one of  Muhammad's love interests.The story to this film was interesting as it had many fascinating facets to it. I found the way that we see Muhammad's interaction with the many women in his life to be written and portrayed well. I also enjoyed the way that Ali stood up for himself outside of the ring with a poignant time in the film being when Cassius Clay rejects serving in the US army to fight in the Vietnam war. In addition to the fighting scenes that were interweaved brilliantly to help balance this film's story. A lot of the praise must be given to the main man behind this film director Michael Mann. He did an amazing job bringing 'Ali' to life. He was also a producer and a writer so he had a big role in making 'Ali' the film it was.Also having real boxers appear in this film made the movie all the more enjoyable as you believe the fighting is real. In fact the boxing scenes in this film are of the finest quality. Will Smith put a lot of himself on the line by really fighting as a boxer. He was up against fighters such as Malick Bowens Michael Bentt James Torney Alfred Cole and Charles Shufford. I am certain that these men could pack a good punch so Will was very willing to put his health on the line to make this film 'believable'.I must make mention of what a personality Muhammad must have been. He was very opinionated but also stood up for what he thought was true. I remember one comment about Ali being that he was 'a loud mouth' and that was so true. I mean the way that he must have fired up his opponents before a fight  by his blind arrogance is truly amazing. Again praise must be given to the way that Will Smith captured Ali's personality to be really coming 'the greatest'. It is a shame that Muhammad's life has been affected by the horrible 'Parkinson's disease'. Yet I am sure that he is giving a great battle against this.Ali is another film based on a true story with a role that one performer makes his own. Smith is now in the class of actors such as Jim Carrey who became the crazy Andy Kaufman Denzel Washington who became Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter the fine role taken on by Academy Award winner Hilary Swank who became the controversial figure of Teena Brandon in 'Boys Don't Cry' and Julia Roberts who was Erin Brockovich in one of the best performances of her career. This role was great from Smith as it can and will show many people of my generation how great a legend Ali really was and is. This movie gives us all an important lesson. That we can be anything we want against adversary and for the only person who counts  that being you!CMRS gives 'Ali' 4 very good film";

	schema:reviewBody "Ali a movie about Muhammed Ali regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time had all the potential for being a great movie. Ali has always been bigger than life...loved by the people...loved by the media for his blatant arrogance...loved by many women...his life alone would have supplied any movie with enough material to make it a 'good' movie at the very least. The problem with Ali is that the story jumped from one portion of his life to another the transition wasn't smooth...it was more erratic than anything else. Will Smith's portrayal of the living legend was good but definitely not Oscar material like some critics would suggest. There were a few times where he seemed uneasy almost nervous and there were scenes where the other supporting characters would take over the scene Don King for example. Jon Voight's portrayal of the venerable Howard Cossell was surprisingly good and right on the money. Other cast members like Jamie Foxx who played Drew 'Brundini' Brown one of Ali's trainers was equally impressive he surely made the most of his supporting role and displayed his versatility since he's always been cast in a comedy. The movie overall lacked cohesiveness I did like Michael Mann's camera work...the constant movement of the camera in most scenes depicted the turmoil confusion..and it mirrored the political upheaval of the 60's. It would have been nice if the movie started with his gold medal win in the 1960 Olympic games...which would have set the tone for the whole movie. And for all the 'Rocky' fans out there the boxing scenes were a little played out...it almost looked boring....since most of us are used to the 'Rocky' style of movie boxing. Overall Smith played Ali well...but his lack of versatility and the erratic transition of the story was the movie's downfall.".

Today he is considered a hero. Why? What did he do besides become champ. Other fighters have done that like Joe Louis. Who also by the way enlisted in the army after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. He didn't refuse like Muhammad Ali and try to use the excuse that he was a Muslim Minister. Joe Louis was a hero and the greatest. This movie is just saying I'm Muhammad Ali. You took my title from me but I got it back. I thought this movie would be about Ali's life and career. This movie shows terrible fights too. It depicts his fights with Liston. Oh and by the way in Ali's rematch with Liston how come there's no mention of a phantom punch? The movie shows the punch land. It doesn't show the crowd yelling fix after the fight. That really made me dislike this movie. The movie shows Ali's fights with Jerry Quarry and Ernie Terrel. Who cares about those fights. Those are such bad fights. If they wanted to show good fights why didn't they show his fights with Frazier. They only show AliFrazier I. The fights that ends it all is his fight with George Foremen. It stops right there. They don't even show his whole career. They don't show his spectacular fights with Ken Norton or his loss at the hands of Leon Spinks. They don't show him regain the title when someone beats him. What is it with Will Smith? He is a terrible Ali. He looks and sounds nothing like him. He tries to sound like him but he comes off sounding gay. This movie is not good. Muhammad Ali even hated it.".

Sadly it doesn't catch nearly enough of them focuses on the wrong things and ends up a bloated ponderous exercise in preachy filmmaking.For a basic plot summary Ali opens with Cassius Clay Will Smith defeating Sonny Liston Michael Bentt to become the boxing heavyweight champion of the world. Shortly after this event Clay falls in the Muslim Brotherhood befriending such figures as Malcolm X Mario Van Peebles  Herbert Muhammad Barry Shabaka Henley. He also begins a romantic relationship with Sonji Roi Jada Pinkett Smith that is often tumultuous due to Ali's interpretations of the Muslim faith. Entering the prime of his fighting career Ali is then drafted into the Vietnam War which he refuses to participate in. As a result he is stripped of his boxing license and not even able to leave the country. After years of fighting the U.S. government Ali is finally able to be reinstated where he gets the Fight of the Century with Joe Frazier James Toney and then the Rumble In The Jungle against George Foreman Charles Shufford.Judged purely on filmmaking and directing Ali isn't even a threestar effort. It is overly preachy when it comes to the political stuff and director Michael Mann uses such a weird style. About every 20 minutes or so there is an extended musical sequence all of which besides maybe the opening one only serve to grind the intensity of the film to a complete halt. Every time the action starts to progress again...it's back to another strange interlude.There are two other problems with the film that are quite glaring1. There is nothing at least in terms of style that director Mann really gets right during the film. The political side of things is definitely important to the Ali story but in this case it is preachy and overthetop. Then when it comes to the boxing fare there are too many historical inaccuracies to consider even those scenes a true success. Maybe those who know nothing about Ali won't care but those who have a little background will be appalled to hearing Ali's famous poem used before the Frazier fight instead of Liston or seeing Ali  Frazier getting buddybuddy with each other before their fight in reality Frazier couldn't stand Ali until very late in his life when some amends were made.2. For a movie titled Ali this should have focused on the entirety of Ali's life. That would have made for a much better story. Ali had a very interesting childhood and also had some genre defining moments late in his life as well. Those areas weren't even sniffed in this adaptation which is a shame as the film instead to give so much valuable time to the politicalreligious side of things.I'm sure by now you are probably wondering why I can even give this film three stars. Well the main reason is because Will Smith turns in perhaps the greatest acting performance I have ever seen...bar none. He IS Ali in this picture plain and simple. The times sadly rare as they are where Smith is given the chance to rant and rave like Ali once did are easily the best parts of the film. His interactions with Howard Cosell played by Jon Voight are also special.Also the fight scenes are probably the most welldone boxing action I've even seen in a film. The fights manage to be both dramatic and realistic at the same time which is no easy task in such a violent yet also very tactical sport.Overall though Ali is first and foremost a disappointment. Even a threestar rating probably holds some personal bias of how much I simply WANT the film to be better than it is. While Smith's iconic Ali performance will certainly stand for ages it's sad that it has to be surrounded by such sloppy filmmaking. I would suggest When We Were Kings or Facing Ali for a much better nod to Ali's unique career and culturedefining role in American society.".

The strength of the movie lies in the characters and the convincing way they are portrayed. Waldemar Torenstra is very convincing as the charismatic and Deanesque Frank that makes the other male characters but not their performers pale in comparison. Karina Smulders is delicious with her big naive gazing eyes. In fact the whole cast turns in solid performances and the young and old versions of the characters are very much in line with each other. All in all it's not an epic movie like de Tweeling director Ben Sombogaard previous movie but it increasingly takes you by the throat as the story unwinds and relationships become clearer. A pity we did not see more of Rutger Hauer though.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fantastic film. The trailer for this film tells of a passionate love affair between two people who can't be together. OK the film is about these two people but it is about so much more! The bond between these four people who met on a plane in 1953. The secrets some of them kept for 55 years. The expectations of starting a new life in a new country. And the scenery is amazing. I love New Zealand and I thoroughly enjoyed the background in the film. I recommend this film to anyone. Although fair to say I guess it's more of a girl's film. It's an epic drama there are no car chases or high tech gadgets. This is what a film is supposed to be. And the 130 minutes fly by! Also pay attention to the beautiful song at the end.".

The story has real power and all twists and turns feel very natural. You get a real good feel about all the characters involved and their motivations. They all evolve together to the end of the movie. Special mention for me are two of the main characters Frank and Ada. The erotic tension between these actors is one of the most intense I've ever seen in cinema. If you like well told drama with great acting this is the movie for you. Forget the trailer go to see the real thing!".

It was so refreshing to see other actors and actresses than we see in so many Dutch films. Waldemar Torenstra Anna Drijver Karina Smulders and of course the other actorsactresses were really at their best! When I read the plot outline I was expecting some sort of chickflick but it turned out to be a story with much more depth than I was expecting. the way the story unfolds itself is very clever and Ben Sombogaart deserves a big compliment for this. Then the setting New Zealand is perfect for this story. The laidback people in contrast to the strict catholic dutchies was very interesting to witness. and of course New Zealand is a beautiful country which leads to great shots! This all makes me very happy that I came over my prejudices and went to see the film! I wouldn't have wanted to miss it and I can recommend it to everyone!".

This movie has to be seen with the historic background in mind  early 50's in postwar Holland the recent loss of Indonesia as colony war broken families and a recent flood disaster. There are a few references to these events. In this time a lot of Dutchies migrated to New Zealand Australia Canada and the USA incl. my relatives. Young people wanting a new start after the WWII war. Some of them were born and raised in Indonesia suffered from the Japanese camps and when they were forced to relocate to postwar Netherlands after Indonesia's independence the Netherlands was like an unknown country for them. This movie's Frank is an example of such a young man. Lost and looking out for a new life with no attachments to his mothercountry.All main characters have their personal baggage from these tragic events they experienced during their young years. Marjorie is a little of an exception to this. Which translates in the plot. The storyline really tells subtly and in complexity how this generation walked away from their past leave it behind and looking out for a prosperous future in their chosen promised land. I give this movie an 8 out of 10. Production is solid as is the acting. Scenery adds up to this feeling of promised land.".

I even decided to write this review. I agree fully with an other review that the trailer does not reflect the movie the latter is much more intense! and Ada what a great actress Karina Smulders is the stars came off the screen!

There is a natural non selfconsciousness about her performance that is very appealing. The other members of the cast are also very wonderful.

How many of those decisions became regrets? It doesn't really matter because yesterday happened but it is interesting to consider the interconnected backstage of existence. And then tremble at the great unknown that is your parent's past. There's just so much we'll never know. And that's mostly OK. Bride Flight is a film that I admired because its leading characters were not only exquisitely defined but their stories felt distinct and complete almost separate within a greater whole. These people kept things from one another and yet they were all so pivotal to each other. The dramatic irony fires on all cylinders. And the ensemble has absolutely excellent chemistry to pull it off. You never doubt the natural unfolding of events because every glance they give or catch is so engaging. New Zealand serves as a breathtakingly epic backdrop to this romance that jumps back and forth on a timeline much more gracefully than so many other examples. When it does jump back you start to become very happy certain rigid social customs have been left behind and that's a testament to how fully yet subtly its realized. This was a pleasant surprise to watch.".

Its a romantic drama that takes it beyond just the romance shared between two of the characters and makes it about the relationships these four people have with each other throughout their lives. It goes beyond a love story and makes it a story about life the relationships we have with the people around us the choices we make and the regrets and satisfactions that come from those choices after we've lived out our lives and reached old age. I'm not really into chick flick love stories but the fact that it is more about life in general and the outcomes from our choices made the movie a lot more relevant to me. The four principle characters are absolutely fantastic! Their acting is superb and each one of them makes you fall in love with them in their own unique way. The ending is emotionally touching as the three women look back at the man that changed all their lives in a way they never thought possible and ride away together reminiscing on the lives they've lived and their relationships together.

This was especially true as the characters and storyline was being established. Despite this distraction as the movie progressed we all found it to be quite engrossing. There was some very rich character development excellent plot lines and a magnificent beautiful setting in New Zealand. The story begins in post World War II Holland in the 1950s as three young women Karina Smulders Anna Drijver and Elise Schaap are boarding an airplane for New Zealand to join their new husbands and start a new life. One of them is Jewish and the trauma of the holocaust will have a very subtle cast on the film. On board they also meet Frank Wakdenar Torenstra  a young man somewhat of a free spirit also seeking a new life as a farmer and ultimately a wine maker who will play prominently in their lives. The story captures the frontier life in New Zealand at this time the conflicts of religion passion friendships and good old fashioned romance. There is also a theme of an important family secret that hovers in the story and should be one that you have seen and thought about in other settings. In alternating time sequences we get to know these people as their lives progress to a point 40 or 50 years later. There is a coming together at the conclusion of the film which is poignant and quite moving. This is the story about these people but the background atmosphere is the post war settlement of this small beautiful land.

But it was a great story beautifully put together in an epic drama that deserves many viewers perhaps even outside of The Netherlands. I presume it must be difficult to continuously switch between the different years that form part of this movie therefore my compliments to the editor because he managed to do a really great job successfully. In addition the New Zealand scenery adds beautiful pictures and seamlessly fits into the overall story.Although all characters at the end of this movie assemble for a sad occasion the audience's feeling at the end of the movie is not of sadness but of joy because the film tells a story of how one can turn sad decisions in one's life into good things for the future.".

Honestly with a few exceptions I am not very impressed by the Dutch cinema was this another Dutch movie? Then the story started to roll and got me more in its grip. The acting was getting better sometimes real good. What I think is a pity is that the storyline is filled with flash forwards that do not add much to the story which is all about the life of Dutch immigrants in New Zealand in 1953 and farther. The film could have been much better if the story was told chronologically and ended somewhere in the 70's or 80's. Now there are two actors for each character and for me also knowing the old respectable actors from the old days this was sometimes quite disturbing. I found it hard to intermingle a character I saw Willeke van Ammelrooy not the character that grew old and looked little alike with the younger woman she once had been in the film. I had strongly the impression that the known actors where mostly used to put known names on the billboards. Their parts are relatively small and of little importance for the basic line of the story.".

Not the same old typical girl meets boy boy falls for girl they get married the end. This film went above and beyond that plot and had many twists which added to the adventure. I was entranced to the screen!The flashbacks throughout the film kept things constantly changing which I liked cause I didn't get bored halfway through ADHD. The film started out in the 50's era after the war which reminded me of the movie Pearl Harbor kind of and progressed through the lives of 4 characters that met on the plane. I would see this again and again as The Notebook foreign replacement. It was worth viewing. An added bonus Waldemar Torenstra is a fabulous actor and also SUPER SEXY. I am in madly in love and would welcome him to perform in American films any day! ".

Though some comparisons will be made to the Notebook its story has so many more layers then the notebook that there should be no comparison to it. The stories presented in the film are not only more believable but stories that everyone can relate to because they may all happen to us sometime in our life. From a filming perspective I thought they did a great job balancing the different times in their life going back and forth without confusing the audience. Another great part of the film was how they took advantage of the amazing and diverse scenery of New Zealand. Anyone who was fans of the amazing cinematography of The Lord of the Ring trilogy will love the cinematography of this film. Anyone who loved Atonement will recognize with this film as well since it has WW2 sentiments and is a period. This movie will defiantly be a contender for the Best foreign film award this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "I very much enjoyed this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. I believe the trick to reviewing adaptations is to compare them with the book and not to any earlier filmed offerings. While I love the 1995 version there are some parts of this adaptation that are as good as sometimes better than that film.A strong point is the casting of Elinor. While she acts with great maturity Hattie Morahan looks as young as Elinor should. Her portrayal of the character is excellent  her facial expressions so subtle yet so clear. Just as Col. Brandon looks as if he's been shot on hearing of Marianne's presumed engagement her Elinor manages the same thing hearing of Lucy's history with Edward. I also approve of her having her painting as an occupation  Marianne had her interests so Elinor should have hers. Poor Elinor though is always picking up the pieces of Marianne's mistakes  after warning Marianne to behave more discreetly she is left to fend off Mrs. Jennings' insinuations just before her sister gets the letter from Willoughby.Marianne is just as good  Charity Wakefield looks the innocent seventeen Marianne should be. A touch I love is the way her hairstyle is curly where the sensible Elinor's is straighter yet after her illness the style becomes more subdued. She captures the naive character perfectly  genuinely can't see anything wrong with her open approval of Willoughby. And she and Mrs. Dashwood not only act in similar ways but look as though they could be mother and daughter. She does act like a teenager would  I don't know if I would call it selfish  but when Willoughby causes her such heartbreak she asks Can we go tomorrow? in the way a teenager believes the world revolves around her.I'm not keen on Willoughby. I always thought the point of Willoughby was that he was supposed to bowl Marianne over and charm everybody else. He isn't handsome rather he seems to be at that awkward phase some teenagers go through before they mature into stunning adults and he just hasn't got there yet. At times he comes across as smarmy and even arrogant. When he is rude to Mrs. Jennings' enquiries over where he and Marianne slipped away to unchaperoned he isn't justified  considering how improper such an outing was. When  in another scene  Marianne leaves the room in tears he doesn't seem remorseful but almost looks pleased. While I felt for Marianne at the ball I was glad he was made to feel uncomfortable. The 1995 film gave rise to comments from some viewers about how they wished Marianne had ended up with Willoughby  seeing this version I wouldn't wish him on anyone.I am glad that the duel was put in  it is skimmed over in one line in the book so it's easy to miss  because it shows that deep down Brandon does have the passion and deep feelings that Marianne wants in a partner.The minor characters are wonderfully cast  the footman has such pride in being able to give Marianne some post after all her pestering Mr. Palmer conveys bored displeasure in one look. Lucy Steele does the innocence so well yet I hated her within a couple of scenes  so many of her words have double meanings which hurt Elinor. At the dinner party in episode three there was much tension  realising Mrs. Ferrars Robert Fanny John the Steeles and the Dashwoods were about to dine together I knew it would be a hellish evening before the food was even served. Fanny is terrifying in some scenes  her interrogation of Anne Steele whose accent came right off the page was like a shark circling a boat. Her tightly styled hair is period perfect and so right for her character  no mercy. I think a mention should be made of Mrs. Jenning's scathing line about her daughter's intelligent  on pointing out Charlotte's embroidery she remarks Seven years at a great school and that's all we have to show of it. The good lady seems to walk out of the book when she offers food and drink as cures for a broken heart.The look of the film is excellent too. The shells in the opening sequence and the crashing waves give a suitably spartan feel while the clothes and soft furnishings look correct for the Regency period particularly the soft colours  Miss Grey has just the Grecian look of a Regency fashionplate. The party scene looks like it's lit by candlelight  often evening scenes in period films are unrealistically bright. There are also some beautiful landscape and scenery shots.The only downside is that certain parts feel a little rushed  Brandon's mysterious departure from Delaford is filmed so abruptly it looks hurried not mysterious  and the ending is over a little too quickly. I'm sure they could have stolen a minute or two of screen time from Willoughby and Marianne's unchaperoned trip to add it to the end but other than that I found the adaptation very satisfying.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jane Austen sells well these days which goes a long way towards explaining the appalling number of film adaptations let loose upon us over the past years. This miniseries part of this and last years' 20072008 batch that includes a lousy Mansfield Park an adequate Northanger Abbey and an uneven Persuasion dwells in the long shadows of the 1995 adaptation. On the one hand it goes to considerable lengths in trying to avoid any resemblance it does this by including scenes that were absent there most notably the last encounter between Elinor and Willoughby where he explains his conduct and excluding where possible scenes that were present there by having the film begin with a steamy sex scene for which there is no reason other than the hope of whetting the appetite of the viewers by casting as Elinor an actress as unlike the brilliant Emma Thompson as possible and whose idea of conveying dramatic tension seems to be to open her eyes very wide and sometimes also her mouth slightly. On the other hand though the adaptation has been taking over ideas that occur in the 1995 film and not in the book like turning Margaret into a well rounded and likable character which in the book she is not this is understandable everybody loves cute little girls with lots of curly hair like Edward's proposal to Elinor being received with a crying fit which was not a very good idea to begin with. Talented actors loving attention to period details and National Trust mansions do not by themselves a good film make. This miniseries has chosen to show Marianne falling rather early in love with Colonel Brandon. This is not only not true to the book where it is at no point implied that Marianne holds feelings for him other than esteem and gratitude it also waters down and distorts the core message of the story. If Marianne can overcome her feelings for Willoughby so quickly and easily then they were not the deep love we had been hitherto led to believe but just the trifling infatuation one especially parents would ordinarily expect from most seventeenyearolds. Then her deep distress and the illness that almost cost her life are but the tantrum of a spoiled child denied a treat. Accordingly there is no lesson to be learned of the story no proper appreciation of Elinor's selfcontrol no triumph of sense over sensibility. Admittedly most people these days expect to be entertained not educated by books and films unless it were about sex but Jane Austen deserves better treatment than this. Andrew Davies has certainly come a long way since his celebrated 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and not all of it seems to have been good to him.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big Austen fan and read all the books. I love the 1995 Ang LeeEmma Thompson rendition of Sense  Sensibility and so was excited for a new version.

Absolutely no reference to Willoughby's eventual regret over Marianne nor to Edward's explanation to Elinor about his engagement to Lucy.Too much was left unexplained as if they just assumed everybody already knows the whole story. And it's a real shame because it took away all the subtle poignancy of emotion the characters experience while navigating the delicate social mores of Regency England e.g. Elinor's having to perform the necessary social functions despite her emotional upheaval Marianne's scandalous correspondence to Willoughby in London. This is particularly true of single women like the Dashwoods who with no fortune or male protection hold a very precarious position in society. It's a primary theme throughout Austen's work and in this novel most especially.Perhaps more likable if you've never read the book but it could have been so much better if they had stayed faithful to Austen's timeless original story.".

	schema:reviewBody "This serial like Pride and Prejudice and Emma by the same scriptwriter is my favorite rendition of its novel. In the first hour it's my favorite by far in the rest just my favorite.The first part which required the most invention introduces the protagonists and unfolds the story quite compellingly later the pace and the choice of incident become more iffy as though the intended runtime had been shortened during shooting some closely spaced scenes have a similar tone without enough contrast between and some minor characters are introduced and then abandoned. Why the ocean is there I don't know it points up the two sisters' different moods but has a way of making some scenes seem like Emily Bronte. I also don't understand why the families are introduced in poses as for portraits this tends in the opposite direction from the seascapes towards satire which seems out of keeping with the general approach.I take it the scriptwriter has adopted a darker view of the period since his earlier Austen dramatizations those were charming and merry the latest two leave out the funniest lines turn the funny characters into unfunny ones and seem bent on pointing up the sad plight of women in men's toils. This of course is one of Austen's subjects but I believe her characters never say outright as Marianne does here in some such words Are we only men's playthings? The sentiment is apt but the perspective seems a little awry .In any case where this production exceeds its predecessors is in the casting especially of the Dashwood family. Its Elinor is the only one I've found right and Marianne who has been done well by before is conveyed more fully here. And they're just extremely likable by the end I was ready to marry both of them myself. Also the family seems a real family with relationships that could only be products of having lived under the same roof for years. And the production is sensitive to the qualities of the actresses cast e.g. having Janet McTeer as the mother it gives her credit for more sense than the novel does. This elides the point that she's the person from whom Marianne inherits her romanticism on the other hand this is clearly portrayed as a byproduct of her youth and so no further excuse is needed.The male principals I thought better cast also. The best of all is Willoughby although until his last scene with Elinor I didn't see where the production was heading with him. Always before he's seemed like another Wickham but here he isn't he's wellmeaning in his own mind but too weak to carry out his better intentions. Marianne practically throws herself at him and from our one look at Brandon's ward we can imagine she did the same he plainly doesn't have the strength of character to have rejected them. The novel gives him a break the serial doesn't he says he didn't know about his exgirlfriend's indigency because he'd forgotten to give her his address but she could have gotten it if she'd tried and Elinor believes him. Perhaps the scriptwriter didn't or thought the audience wouldn't anyhow in the novel Elinor's final judgment on him is more severe that his only motive throughout has been selfishness. I was sorry this speech was eliminated but it would have been superfluous since one infers the same from the actor's reading of the scene. As for the other beaux this Colonel Brandon comes nearer the mark than the others in being younger and more reserved Edward is better too but not so much so he's like a synthesis of the former Edwards and another actor I can't place rather in the Hugh Grant line but more skillful at it. I don't fully get the character but then I didn't in the book either.The sisters however are something else again. Here at last is an Elinor I can believe inabout the right age long used to being the voice of reason in her family and of being accepted as such from necessity rather than choice practical circumspect longsuffering but with her spirit alive and unspoiled. A nice touch is the indication at one point that someone so unfailingly right in her advice can sometimes be a drag to live with.Of the prior Elinors I thought Emma Thompson's was an expert portrayal as one would expect but the actress's core characterthe one all her characters are built aroundis a mild neurotic of a type I don't see as having existed before the 1920s and certainly not in Austen's time. Moreover the rhythm of that character is a distinctively 20thcentury rhythm and Austen's prose had to be wrenched to make it fit Thompson did so with considerable skill. but the result was a translation more than an interpretation. Then there was the age issue Thompson's Elinor was a middleaged spinster Austen's wasn't. The Elinor of the earlier BBC serial seemed closer in some ways but still not right she looked rather like a clumpish Cinderella and gave some of her lines inflections that sounded cold and cutting in a way not the character's.Yet as impressed as I was by the new Elinor by the end I was even more impressed with Marianne. She's played as young until she grows up with all the silliness stubbornness and excess that are part of the baggage of that time of life. And of course the sexuality. Few scenes have been more erotic with less happening in them than her forbidden tour of the house she imagines will be hers. Both of the prior Mariannes were fairly accurate except for the air that Kate Winslet's characters always have of being spoiled university girls and both quite alike in being romantic above all this Marianne has more dimension as well as more suggestion about her and reminds me of girls I've known.".

	schema:headline " Deficient characterizations mar otherwise fine acting and production values";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the essentially unique and appealing aspects of Jane Austen is that the hallmark of a good person is constant awareness of the feelings others are experiencing and the desire never to cause those feelings to be painful or embarrassing. Part I of this new Sense and Sensibility fails to capture this important quality there are several instances in which each of the good characters are profoundly insensitive to the feelings they are triggering in others. This version doesn't realize that in Austen good manners have moral significance because they protect feelings. Part II is better and avoids this problem.The first problematic moment in Part I is Edward Ferrars' abortive nonproposal scene with Elinor. In this scene Edward clearly creates a moment that he must know will cause Elinor to feel she is about to receive a proposal  and yet he disappoints her. The key error is that Margaret is in the room when he enters and she scoots out when it appears he has come to propose. The fact that Edward lets her leave without stopping her is what ruins it by so doing he allows not only Elinor but also Margaret to think a proposal is coming. By letting Margaret think this it is inevitable that Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood will know. Thus Edward has compounded his error by making it impossible for Elinor to decide to keep the entire encounter a secret. It is inevitable that his rejection of her will be known to her mother and sisters thereby aggravating her discomfort. In the book there is no such scene at all and in the 1995 film the analogous scene occurs as Edward approaches Elinor in the stable where she is saying goodbye to a favorite horse. In that scene just at the moment where he might be expected to indicate he is about to propose he instead raises the subject of his education in Plymouth  baffling but very clearly not the beginning of a proposal. The second is the loss of an opportunity to show that Marianne is sensitive to the feelings of Elinor. This is done in the 1995 film at the dinner at the Middletons in which Sir John and his motherinlaw are teasing Elinor over having a beau whose name begins with F. In the film Marianne is acutely sensitive to Elinor's discomfort and defuses the situation by abruptly offering to play music. This scene has the slenderest foundation in the book a mere line or two in chapter 7 but it works well in the 1995 film. The Marianne in this version never shows such concern nor demonstrates an appropriate and mature way of protecting Elinor's feelings as does the Marianne in the 1995 film. The third and by far the worst incident is where the Dashwoods are at their cottage and Col. Brandon is seen coming up to the house. Marianne jumps up drags Margaret out and goes for a long walk leaving Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood to cover for her. We are shown Col. Brandon sitting for what appears to be hours waiting for Marianne to return while Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood presumably tell white lies about her absence. Brandon is thus subjected to embarrassment and disrespect as it must be very clear to him that he is being snubbed and the other women are all dragged into aiding this. Eventually Brandon gives up and leaves. We might expect that on Marianne's return Elinor would reprove her  as in Jane Austen's novel Emma Mr. Knightly reproves Emma for her insult to Miss Bates during the picnic on Box Hill. But in this version Marianne's twisted ankle and the appearance of Willoughby are tacked onto the end of her overland excursion to avoid Brandon so that Marianne reenters the cottage in Willoughby's arms and all the focus is on the new romantic young man. Marianne's misconduct to Brandon never gets reproved by Elinor or by Mrs. Dashwood nor do either Elinor or Mrs. Dashwood complain that Marianne has not only treated Brandon badly but also themselves by putting them in a position where they had to pretend falsely that her absence was merely a coincidence. Finally as regards the character of Edward the version presented here excepting the non proposal scene discussed above is pretty much the character Austen wrote but I have to say that the character as presented in the 1995 film is far superior to the one in the book and in this version. In the 1995 film from his very first entrance Edward is acutely aware that the Dashwood girls have lost their father and must be grieving and he is also aware of his sister's grasping insensitive character and he does what he can to make amends for it by such actions which are not in the book as declining to take a room that is one of the girls' and by helping to restore the spirits of Margaret. In favor of this version the casting the acting and the production values are all excellent. The people are very believable. The problem is that the good people are not nearly as admirable as the people Austen created. Judging from Part I only this version takes characters who are genuinely concerned for the feelings of others and reduces them to people who pretty much just care for themselves with an overlay of thinking that good manners must be performed because well that is the done thing. In Part II the characters are consistent with the way Austen wrote them but several key scenes are cut and the feel is a bit rushed. The proposal scene at the end is very well done. Overall I recommend it but this version doesn't present the characters with the richness Austen offers.".

In fact I can't imagine a better Elinor and the rest of the Dashwood family was close to ideal. As usual the BBC found lovely settings though the cottage is too basic to be believable and too close to the sea ! Austen's concept of a cottage was a great deal more than this four reception rooms downstairs I believe. The problem is the screenplay which trivialises so much of the novel fails to understand some of its basic premises and relies on visual titillation at the expense of the dialogue that was much more in evidence in the BBC's generally superior previous attempt. The moral of the story both implied in this adaptation and explicit in the book is to do with the dangers of excessive sensibility and not editing your feelings in order to conform to social conditions. It is not to do with what you do being more important than what you feel as Marianne puts it during her sudden Stepfordwife transformation to rationality. Her illness is not physical and certainly has nothing to do with the ridiculous scene in the rain Davies has devised it is in her mind. The whole point of the story is to show the danger of overindulging one's feelings and disengaging from society. Davies read the book again and even if the book is to be changed at least be consistent. The end product here was I believe a dumbing down of one of the most miraculous stories of the very early nineteenth century.".

To say that this production is one wild nailbiting rollercoaster ride is putting it pretty mildly.To follow Hattie Morahan's warm kind brave and hypnotically beautiful Elinor through to her dismal and heartbreaking deadend in life via a seeming neverending series of emotional whacks... that's storytelling of the most profoundest kind.And then into that truly stunning few moments where eyes are absolutely GLUED to Elinor's quivering back... that's moviemaking beyond awesome.I've dutifully watched the movie version too now. These REALLY go well together. The movie is intensely beautiful to look at and has great crowd scenes. Highly worth watching for the alternative take on the Marianne story I liked it without necessarily preferring it. Each version has some dialog that greatly helps understand points in the other.No review I've read yet has mentioned the great voiceover commentary on the DVD. Director producer and four leads. Nice happy family that one is. Hattie Morahan is selfeffacing almost to the point of invisibility but she has a truly great laugh we hear often. Remarks by Edward and Marianne and Willoughby are warm funny and at times really insightful and leave one liking each of them a lot.Plus we hear just how the director and producer arrived at many of their outcomes adjusted things postproduction set up the scenes in the many houses and the studios struggled for continuity and came up with that proposal scene  told in that selfeffacing and often funny British way but they're true talents.And Janeites please get this the team makes it increasingly clear that there are several hours of unused scenes still in the can. They are not offered here on this DVD. So a 4or5hour director'scut version? Okay. You know what to do...".

This version had what are known as high production values ie it looked good and was wellacted. However Jane Austen's dialogue and characterisation really lost out when compressed into three episodes. Andrew Davies would rightly say that 21st century television is a very different medium from an early nineteenth century novel. In its own terms therefore as a TV drama it was quite good as bonnetfests go. However if you had never read the book you would have probably thought that much fuss has been made over a fairly uninteresting story. I guess you could compress Sense  Sensibility still further until people would believe that Jane Austen was first published by Mills and Boon.On the plus side at least they got the characters' ages right. In the 1995 version Emma Thompson was 36 but playing a nineteen year old. However good she was she was far too old for the part.".

I think he would have been good as Willoughby who should surely be more handsome than Edward. Dominic Cooper is not good as Willoughby. His looks are wrong his speech tends towards Estuary English in places and in others he does not speak clearly.

The climax felt more soap operaish and also more uneven with the slightly jarring attempts at humorous over the top characterizations clashing with the more subtle feel of the piece.

The writing is quite dumbed down the majority of the characters have not been fully fleshed out and in general the production seems quite rushed. Given that there is a longer running time than the Ang Lee version I expected MORE development not less. While the casting of Elinor in this adaptation is more believable than the older Emma Thompson in the Lee version I believe that is the only improvement to mention. And to be honest I believe Emma Thompson while perhaps not quite looking the appropriate age for the part did a superior acting job. The actor cast as Willoughby is completely wrong in nearly every way. The director has apparently decided to go the romantic route as the moronic director of the most recent Pride  Prejudice did in his depiction of Regency England. I regret that I wasted three hours on this as I had been waiting for it to arrive for more than a year.".

There were parts that have been cut from previous productions notably the duel scene from Thompson's and yet in those the story did not seem as strangely disjointed and haphazard as this one. It still shows fine acting and beautiful sets and captures a bit of Austen but I did not empathize for the characters the way that the book demands  they did not come to life that much.".

	schema:reviewBody "In newly 19th century England a family of three daughters is put into turmoil when the father dies. You see the young ladies are the offspring of the man's second marriage and the main inheritor of his estate is his son from the first one. This leaves poor Elinor Hattie Morahan Marianne Charity Wakefield and their much younger sister Margaret along with their mother with far less means of existence. They are forced to move out of the family home and seek smaller accommodations in the country. Alas also their prospects for a good marriage are likewise dimmed as they have no sizeable dowries. Nevertheless upon their move to a charming cottage in the countryside the girls meet two marriageable men. One of them Colonel Brandon is a thirtysomething wealthy landowner whose stillsingle status is the result of a broken engagement long ago. However he is instantly smitten with the musically gifted outspoken Marianne. Yet the age difference may prove to be a barrier. Elinor too meets a most eligible man Edward the brother of their catty sisterinlaw but here again something is amiss. He becomes extremely close to the more reserved Elinor only to remove himself from the situation for some unknown reason. Enter Willoughby. He is a handsome man who gallops into their lives on the day he rescues Marianne from a sprained ankle. Marianne's heart is lost to this gentleman but he may have some big secrets to hide. Will the sisters meet a good fate or a bad one? This is a very nice miniseries with some attractive stars and some nice settings and costumes. The actor playing Colonel Brandon especially bears a striking resemblance to Liam Neeson and will set hearts to flutter. Yet to anyone who has seen the Ang Lee film with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet this one pales in a close comparison of the two. There is no sweeping score no gorgeous cinematography no amazing art direction and no Hugh Grant. That is not to say it does not have its moments or that it will not please most fans of Austen who would be content to see a new version every year for the rest of their lives. In such light do try to catch this new adaptation either on Masterpiece Theatre or when it is released on DVD if you are a devotee of Jane's works. You will hang on every word and feel great contentment as the film fades to black.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this mere hours ago and I couldn't get it out of my head. I'd like to start off by saying that I read the book and then saw the 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility and couldn't imagine what could top it. It's simple this miniseries.Within minutes I was saying that I liked this adaption better than the 1995 movie. I mean no disrespect to Emma Thompson who wrote and starred in that movie but this was a lot better. There were a few flaws in the film that I hadn't really paid attention too before until I saw this version. The main one being the age of both Thompson who played Elinor and Alan Rickman who played Colonel Brandon. Both were far too old to be playing Elinor who is supposed to be 19 and Brandon who was 35 in which Thompson was in her thirties I believe and Rickman was 49. The problem wasn't so apparent until I saw this version.The age problem for Rickman in particular helped convey in the movie that Marianne should have wound up with Willoughby instead of Brandon. The point Austen wanted to make in the book was that Marianne's idea of Brandon being too old was silly seeing as 35 isn't that old. Shallow viewers of the 1995 version would be bothered by the more obviously older man who looked to be in his fifties marrying a teenager.The main thing that won me over in this movie was the portrayal of the men Edward Colonel Brandon and Willoughby. Hugh Grant in the 1995 film was good but at times he seemed too awkward and insecure. Dan Stevens played Edward as having a bit of a sense of humor like in the book but still a private man. I instantly liked him. But honestly it was Colonel Brandon and Willoughby when stood out the most.Willoughby is often forgotten to be the villain of the story this miniseries made it clear from the start that he isn't a good man. Purists might not like the opening scene of Willoughby seducing Eliza but I thought it worked well particularly when Willoughby showed Marianne Allenhelm. It reminded us that Marianne is treading through dangerous waters and has no idea of who she is dealing with. In the 1995 film Thompson left out the scene with Willoughby explaining his actions to Elinor after Marianne is jilted by him. My thought there was that Thompson felt that would draw too much sympathy for Willoughby but I think that was a mistake. This miniseries included the scene and showed more of Willoughby's selfish character. I felt no sympathy for him at all. In fact I found it hard to believe a word he said. As it should be.Colonel Brandon is often forgotten about by scholars and that is shame because he is one of my favorite heroes. This adaption did him justice because not only did David Morrissey look the part but Brandon was given more screen time. Unfortunately both Austen and Thompson didn't show much of Marianne's journey to falling in love with Brandon but this one filled in that gap. At last we were finally able to see why Colonel Brandon was meant for Marianne instead of Willoughby. When she said that Brandon was a truly romantic man I squealed because I'm sure Austen meant the same.Beyond the men I will say that the Elinor Marianne and all of the other characters were done incredibly well. I found nothing lacking in any of them with the exception of Mr. Palmer who was much more amusing in the 1995 version but since he was a minor character I wasn't offended.In short Thompson's version was good but this one outshone hers. Sense and Sensibility had more complicated plot which is why I think a miniseries like this was better suited for it on screen since more time can be devoted to it. If you want to watch the best version of Sense and Sensibility this is for you. I also recommend reading Colonel Brandon's Diary by Amanda Grange if you are as smitten with his character as I am.".

	schema:reviewBody "The book Sense and Sensibility is a great one. It is beautiful poised and poignant and just a joy to read. Out of the adaptations of the book I have two favourites. One is the 1995 film with Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson which was visually stunning and impeccably acted by the whole cast. The other adaptation is this one. I do marginally prefer the film but this miniseries is mighty fine.This adaptation of Sense and Sensibility isn't without its problems though. There are some scenes that felt rushed particularly the ending and Colonel Brandon's departure from Delaford. Also Dominic Cooper's performance as Willoughby was uneven. Cooper is a good actor and has charming presence but compared to the Willoughby in the book and the Willoughby in the 1995 film this Willoughby seemed somewhat unlikeable and arrogant and the complexity of his feelings for Marianne I felt could have been explored more.However this is much to love about this miniseries. For one thing it looks beautiful. The costumes are lavish the scenery is sumptuous and the photography is crisp. I especially liked the shots of the cottage and the sea. The music is truly pleasant to the ear romantic lyrical and whimsical the sort of effect Patrick Doyle's score in the 1995 film had on me. The script wasn't too bad really it had a sense of intelligence about it even if it had some questionable modernisations on occasion.The acting with the general exception of Cooper's Willoughby is excellent and ideal for the characters they play. Hattie Morahan is a mature and subtle Elinor and Charity Wakefield is beautiful innocent and tragic as Marianne. They are solidly supported by a superb Janet McTeer as the mother a dashing Dan Stevens as Edward Ferrars and a suitably sincere David Morissey as Colonel Brandonan improvement over Alan Rickman Rickman was good but Morissey fitted the character better. Overall this is a fine miniseries perfect to go with the 1995 film and it manages to be solid as an adaptation. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "this 2008 movie of sense and sensibility is a very pleasing one. i really enjoyed the characters especially Elinor's. Hattie morahan is a more believable Elinor in manner and age. it seems as if she had taken on the mother role of her family and was the voice of reason leaving the other characters to dwell in their fanasties with Marianne's romantic ideals and the mother's inability to accept their position upon the father's death. i loved this portrayal of Edward Farris much better altrhough i could still see a lot of Hugh grant's mannerisms in Dan Stevens version of Edward. Dan Stevens does an excellent job of making you believe his character and liking him and admire his morals while all the time hoping he unites with Elinor. although i really liked the role of col. Brandon in this version i still like Alan rickman's portrayal..he speaks so beautifully and so much like the men of education of that era. i love the way he speaks.i really liked this movie and after listening to Andrew Davies explanations or comments on this version you come to appreciate even more such as the comments of the choice of the cottage the dashwoods come to live in.overall i loved the ending to this version much better.it was nice to see that the girls found what they were looking for especially Marianne. the 1995 version left you feeling there was something missing from Edward's declaration of love for Elinor..watching the deleted scenes at least gives you better closure with their romance.i loved this movie version that i ordered it before it was releasedwell here in Canada anyway. i heartily invite people to watch this movie".

Dan Stevens does an excellent job of making you believe his character and liking him and admire his morals while all the time hoping he unites with Elinor. although i really liked the role of col. Brandon in this version i still like Alan rickman's portrayal..he speaks so beautifully and so much like the men of education of that era. i love the way he speaks.i really liked this movie and after listening to Andrew Davies explanations or comments on this version you come to appreciate even more such as the comments of the choice of the cottage the dashwoods come to live in.overall i loved the ending to this version much better.it was nice to see that the girls found what they were looking for especially Marianne. the 1995 version left you feeling there was something missing from Edward's declaration of love for Elinor..watching the deleted scenes at least gives you better closure with their romance.i loved this movie version that i ordered it before it was releasedwell here in Canada anyway. i heartily invite people to watch this movie";

But along the way they have a police inspector snooping around and Dr. Hill is back.This is a reasonably stylish but crazy sequel to the very good original. Keeping with the tradition of the original it sticks to the black campy humour we loved and also being soaked in blood  gore.The story is pretty much the same as the original with West's freaks of nature causing havoc again. Though just like the title implies it parodies the film 'Bride of Frankenstein' but the repetitiveness' this time really shows throughout the film. It has some plot holes that aren't explained on from that of the first film but it didn't fault the story the humour or pace of the film.The director this time around was the producer from the original Brian Yuzna he brings some nice added touches and a morbid sense to the film though it might have been much better if Stuart Gordon held the realm.The performances are good with the everreliable Jeffrey Combs delivering the eccentrically insane Herbert West Bruce Abbott as the sympathetic Dean Cain Claude Earl Jones as the mischievous police detective Fabiana Udenio as Cain's concerned girlfriend Francesca Danelli and finally David Gale as Dr West's Nemesis the deviously evil head Yep that's right of Dr. Carl Hill.The atmosphere is truly stunning from the dark basement filled with enthusiastic experiments and West's bizarre creations to the coldness of the eerie mortuary and hospital.

Like the previous titles mentioned Stuart Gordon's ReAnimator is a true classic in the field of horror so I was very careful with my expectations towards this film. Yet several elements showed that it could be a very good film. Jeffrey Combs returned as his memorable Dr. West character and also Dan Cain and Carl Hill are present again.  well at least his head is...  Brian Yuzna took the seat of the director. Good sign I thought. He knows what he does when it comes to horror. And this film proved itself to be good. It can never reach the level of the original but the complete cast and crew seems to realize that. They just tried to make a sequel worth watching and in that viewing... they succeeded.TINY SPOILERS FROM HERE ... Dr. West is even more fantastic  and that means more crazy   to achieve his discovery of reanimating dead bodies. He keeps convincing Dr. Dan Cain to assist him by claiming he can bring back Megan to live  Dr. Cains love interest from the first film  West found Megan's hart in the hospital and they shall create a new woman with it. Great !!! Also the head of the infamous Dr. Carl Hill gets reanimated and he's only after one thing. Nail Dr. West and avenge his dissection ! By this he gets assisted by another doctor. Thing are even getting more difficult for Dr. West when a fanatic detective follows him around... The bride of ReAnimator a clean tribute to Frankenstein is 90 minutes of pure fun. Horrorfans won't be disappointed at all. It's a logical sequel to the original but also a film that could stand to itself. As far as sequels go this is a good effort. Now after 13 years a second sequel is about to come. Beyond ReAnimator  also directed by Yuzna and starring Combs  is claimed to be a worthy addition to the series as well. I haven't seen it yet but I sure will when I get the chance.".

Trying to hit on all the same points the original had Yuzna delivers the expected excessive gore mixed with plenty of black humor and oneliners. Some of the humor this time is pushed a little too far out ahead and at times this feels like a dark comedy. The returning Combs and Abbott are solid as West and Cain and it is nice to see the further exploits of these two characters. Fans of the first film will probably enjoy this but sadly this sequel is missing the tension of the first film and it really doesn't have anything new to offer that hasn't already been done in the original. Where this film amuses and entertains the original also shocked and scared you at the same time. The slick production and crazy finale with West's body experiments getting loose make this a watchable sequel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Herbert West Jeffrey Coombs is at it again! Having not learned anything from his experiences in 1985's ReAnimator the mad scientist continues to simultaneously play both doctor and God. Culling spare body parts from the local university West promises to his loyal buddy Dan Bruce Abbott to restore the love of his life Megan who you may remember as being played by Barbara Crampton in the original. It seems Meg's heart continues to beat and while Dan is distracted by a new love Fabiana Udenio and a dying patient Kathleen Kinmont Dr. West is determined to reunite the two lovers by any means necessary because well what else are friends for? Taking the reigns from director Stuart Gordon Brian Yuzna Return Of The Living Dead III has his work cut out for him. Following up a certified cultclassic such as ReAnimator is no easy task and yet Yuzna's followup Bride Of ReAnimator works hard to maintain the same level of zany good times as delivered by its predecessor. Retaining the pitchblack humor of the original almost to a fault Yuzna's film is steeped in tragedy revenge and outright insanity. Coombs is in top form as Dr. Herbert West while Abbott is admittedly given little to do beyond tearing himself between his various loves. No matter because the film is endlessly entertaining and utterly twisted. The special effects are quite the spectacle unto themselves boiling over into a wacky and truly delicious final act.If there's one gripe to be had with Bride it's that the film lacks a cohesive pace. More often than not story is forsaken for the sake of various undead antics and shenanigans see the wifebeating detective hot on Dr. West and Dan's trail for reference. Sometimes the film tries a little too hard perhaps but that's part of its charm. It's all or nothing with Yuzna and his hypedup take on H.P. Lovecraft's mythology does not disappoint. Those seeking a gloriously gory and at times touching horror story would do well to find themselves hitched to Bride Of ReAnimator.".

Graves reanimates the head of Hill but refuses to do his bidding and chucks it in the bucket. A move he will come to regret.The hokum goes into overdrive for this sequel. There's more atmosphere and more potential to be really scary. It's never fully realized as the film is too blackly funny to be frightening and feels a little limited in scope being set mostly in only two places. But there's more going on in the climax as all the factions and body parts come together. The allusion to Frankenstein is much more apparent and the Freudian subtext of 2 men creating life without the use of a woman adds a curious depth to the mayhem. I know that the reanimated corpses are supposed to be darkly comic but I find their wild gesticulations and howling to be curiously upsetting.You could call Bride of ReAnimator lots of negative words like corny cheesy dumb etc. But you'd be missing the point. Yes it's a bit too pulpy to truly echo H.P. Lovecraft's original work but the numerous zombies monsters and demons are something I reckon Howard Phillips would love.Gore fans will really dig the blood and makeup effects. There's loads of gruesomeness and severed limbs and guts spilled all over the place. It's the kind of thing Fangoria magazine would have had an 8page feature of. Plentiful amounts of puss and nastiness from the KNB Effects Group and Screaming Mad George respectively.

This movie is neither instead we get a semi natural continuation of the first film which attempts to slip in more of the original Lovecraft Novella which ultimately neither film lives up to. Sure characters that had little to no hope for life return with out a bat of the camera's eye but this is a horrorcomedy people not The Godfather Part II type of sequel and I'm willing to ignore this to an extent. it never got on my nerves anyway. Escapes the horror movie sequel trap quite well.2.

This is really a shame although I do admit if you are not a fan of the first film you probably may as well skip this one. I also strongly recommend that those of you who have not seen ReAnimator backtrack and watch it first as it definitely would or maybe I should say should heighten your enjoyment level of this film.Bride of ReAnimator is an excellent chunk of horrorcomedy which gets over looked when standing next to its beefy pappy. Personally I found that elements of the film surpassed the first atmosphere and gore fx being the most clear ones. I really have to hand it to the fx design team because this is currently one of my favorite horror films as far as creatures. The many experiments highlight the film when ever they appear and the Bride herself is an excellent piece of gore design.As far as the atmosphere goes it is surely darker then its predecessor in this respect. Perhaps only the climax of the film truly shows the best aspects as for the most part it reflects a similar attitude to ReAnimator if slightly watered down. However at the end we are treated to multicolored lighting fantastic zombies smoke and some well used gauze used to invoke the dress of the Bride in Bride of Frankenstein. Not to mention the earlier stated creature effects.At any rate this is a very worthy followup to a horror classic. Perhaps the script is not as strong the quotable lines fewer and farer between and supporting characters more forgettable. But admit at least naysayers that if nothing else you loved it when Dr. West yelled My God! They're using tools!710".

	schema:headline " Almost as good as the first";
	schema:reviewBody "It's rare that a sequel tops the original but this one ties to come close. It also uses the same whimsical music and opening titles of anatomy drawings as the original film did.Starts off 6 months after the first film ended with Drs. West and Cain once again played by Jeffery Combs  Bruce Abbott hiding out as medics during a war in South America.  West thinks this is a great place to lie low and continue his experiments after all the heat that was placed on them during the first film.After their quick little South American adventure they return to Arkham Hospital as if nothing has ever happened.  I can suspend disbelief at this obvious plot hole in the script because it gets better.Gore highlights includeWest reanimating a corpse's eyeball with some fingers and watching it run around the house until a nosy Det. Chapman Claude Earl Jones splats it on the couch without realizing it.  Not bad.  Det. Chapman believes West has had something to do with his dead wife coming back to life.  Chapman knows because he's the one who beat her to death to begin with.Dr. Graves Mel Stewart Arkham Hospital's new chief pathologist stumbles onto the purpose of West's green fluid and injects Dr. Hill's head which has been exhibited for the last 6 months in a circus carnival with some of the fluid thereby reanimating it.  Hill then gives Graves some instructions that Graves will later regret.Chapman goes down to the basement and after is struggle is killed by West. West then reanimates Chapman and Chapman goes wild.  He now looks a lot like his deadalive wife and attacks West and then Cain who has gone down there to see what's going on.  West then chops Chapman's arm off and in the process Chapman gets loose.  West then attaches Champan's arm to a dead dog. Hilarious!West's big project is to sew various female body parts together and create a new 'bride' out of them.  A Frankenstein's monster.  Nice reconstruction scene as Cain and West sew the various body parts together.  It's all done with excellent special effects by Screaming Mad George who also did the special creature effects for PREDATOR.  In the meantime Hill instructs Graves to sew bat wings onto his head so he can fly around.  It's really funny and ridiculous as we see this head floating around with wings flapping underneath it.  The zombies from the hospital are then set loose and they go over to West's house and mayhem ensues as they crawl and stammer around all over the place.  The 'bride' comes to life and all kinds of freaky body parts from the graveyard next door come to life about the same time.  We even get some cool effects again by Screaming Mad George as the 'brides' body parts don't take and she falls apart with guts falling out of her torso as her head rolls off onto the floor.  Then there's a cavein and everybody gets buried in the underground tomb.  Well...almost...  You'll have to see what happens next because this is some really over the top stuff!!This is a pretty surprising followup to the first film since I was expecting a disaster here although the Artisan DVD is lacking the extras you'd expect from a sequel like this.  It's also fullscreen non anamorphic without any widescreen option.  Still it's a worthy followup to REANINAMATOR that far surpasses the lameo FRANKENHOOKER which dealt with the same theme and was released around the same time as this one.7 out of 10".

I can suspend disbelief at this obvious plot hole in the script because it gets better.Gore highlights includeWest reanimating a corpse's eyeball with some fingers and watching it run around the house until a nosy Det. Chapman Claude Earl Jones splats it on the couch without realizing it.  Not bad.  Det. Chapman believes West has had something to do with his dead wife coming back to life.  Chapman knows because he's the one who beat her to death to begin with.Dr. Graves Mel Stewart Arkham Hospital's new chief pathologist stumbles onto the purpose of West's green fluid and injects Dr. Hill's head which has been exhibited for the last 6 months in a circus carnival with some of the fluid thereby reanimating it.  Hill then gives Graves some instructions that Graves will later regret.Chapman goes down to the basement and after is struggle is killed by West. West then reanimates Chapman and Chapman goes wild.  He now looks a lot like his deadalive wife and attacks West and then Cain who has gone down there to see what's going on.  West then chops Chapman's arm off and in the process Chapman gets loose.  West then attaches Champan's arm to a dead dog. Hilarious!West's big project is to sew various female body parts together and create a new 'bride' out of them.  A Frankenstein's monster.  Nice reconstruction scene as Cain and West sew the various body parts together.  It's all done with excellent special effects by Screaming Mad George who also did the special creature effects for PREDATOR.  In the meantime Hill instructs Graves to sew bat wings onto his head so he can fly around.  It's really funny and ridiculous as we see this head floating around with wings flapping underneath it.  The zombies from the hospital are then set loose and they go over to West's house and mayhem ensues as they crawl and stammer around all over the place.  The 'bride' comes to life and all kinds of freaky body parts from the graveyard next door come to life about the same time.  We even get some cool effects again by Screaming Mad George as the 'brides' body parts don't take and she falls apart with guts falling out of her torso as her head rolls off onto the floor.  Then there's a cavein and everybody gets buried in the underground tomb.  Well...almost...  You'll have to see what happens next because this is some really over the top stuff!!This is a pretty surprising followup to the first film since I was expecting a disaster here although the Artisan DVD is lacking the extras you'd expect from a sequel like this.  It's also fullscreen non anamorphic without any widescreen option.  Still it's a worthy followup to REANINAMATOR that far surpasses the lameo FRANKENHOOKER which dealt with the same theme and was released around the same time as this one.7 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "I have loved the original ReAnimator since I first saw it as a demented little boy way back in 1986. So naturally I was quite excited when I got the chance to see the sequel when it premiered on Cinemax in 90 or 91. Although I was satisfied with Bride of ReAnimator when I initially viewed I some how managed to avoid seeing it again for the next decade. I am not quite sure why that is especially considering I have been enjoying the original on dvd for quite some time now. Looking back I think it's because I had the realization that as I have grown older and my tastes have matured things that were great when I was kid are often terrible these days rendering films that were merely oky even worse. In other words I was afraid of watching Bride and just hating thereby tarnishing the legacy created by the still fabulous original. To get to the point I recently decided to take a chance and I broke down and bought Bride on dvd. Going into it with my expectations totally lowered since I couldn't remember much from watching it 10 years prior I was pleasantly surprised by this worthy sequel to one of my all time favorite horror flicks. Sure Bride still somewhat pales by comparison but it would be safe to say that it compares to the original the same way that the competent Halloween 2 stands up to it's classic predecessor. In other words this isn't a great flick but much of the magic that made the original work is still here and the film has a few surprises of it's own. I won't go into the plot because everybody else on here has already explained it and besides I find the plot to be one of the areas where Bride is most lacking. I will instead try to concentrate on the things I like about this film namely some snappy and extremely DRY oneliners hilariously overthetop gore effects and another great turn by Jeffrey Combs as the titular reanimator. Bride relies on the mix of outrageous horror and dark comedy that defined the original this time leaning just a little more towards the comedy side without becoming a parody of the first one. With stronger direction and more a more fleshedout screenplay I believe this one could have had the potential to be as good as the originalbut who wants to see classic overshadowed? Bride of ReAnimator stands well on it's own and as a nice afterthought to the original it should please most fans. I also highly recommend the featureloaded dvd release and although some would argue this film  gets a slightly grander dvd treatment than it deserves who can really complain about a plethora of special features?".

	schema:reviewBody "Though Bride of ReAnimator does not match up to the original it comes quite close. This one strays even more from Lovecraft's original short story turning more toward Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. It also should be noted that Bride... actually out gores the original making it a real treat for gore hounds.The plot is as follows Herbert West and Dan Cain have both recuperated from the chaos at the end of the first ReAnimator and are doing experiments on the dead again. This time rather than experimenting on whole bodies they decide to mix and match individual parts and eventually take on the task of building a women completely out of the parts of various corpses. Unfortunately for the heroes Dr. Hill is resurrected as a talking head and eventually acquires bat wings to help him deal with mobility problems. There is also a new love interest for Cain played by the same women who played Alotta Fagina Austin Powers and a nosy detective who has an idea of what West and Cain are doing.Bride of ReAnimator is much more of a comedy than ReAnimator which usually works in its favor but is a detriment in some parts. The actors are mostly from the original and execute their parts nicely. It is the special effects that often times carry the film. These effects done by the same crew who worked on Evil Dead 2 are really exceptional and help make the movie so enjoyable. Bride... also has a great plot good directing and great dialogue. On the down side the movie does not really pick up until the end and there are too many subplots.Bride of ReAnimator is a great movie for all viewers who can stomach gore. My rating 8 out of 10".

Lovecraft intended when he wrote 'Herbert West  ReAnimator' then this sequel is a million miles further on from that world. Many sequels' titles start with the words 'Return of' or 'Revenge of' but Brian Yuzna producer of the first film and director of this one has opted for the far more campy and more classic 'Bride of'. Lovecraft may be spinning in his grave  but in this sequel we see the insane doctor building himself a bride from the parts of various other women! Cue lots of bloodthirsty gore and a rather skewed sense of humour and we're on course for another splatter flick in the style of the first film! Both the leads have been rerecruited for this sequel and so both Dan Cain and Herbert West are involved in this new set of experiments. In the aftermath of the events of the first film West finds the heart of Cain's now deceased girlfriend. Meg along with the head of Dr Carl Hill the villainous doctor from the first film. West convinces Cain to help him build a new woman with Meg's heart at the centre...meanwhile Dr Hill plans his revenge and the fact that he hasn't got a body isn't stopping him...Going into a film called 'Bride of ReAnimator' you cant expect anything resembling high quality  and it's a good job because this film is anything but. The film has a real 'made for TV' feel to it even though it wasn't and the low quality cinematography blends well with the silly story questionable acting childish effects and buckets of blood and gore. In true sequel style everything is done with more gore this time around and in true Brian Yuzna style  it's all very disgusting. The bride itself is of particular note for being sickness inducing while the rest of the effects aren't very nice either. Jeffrey Combs returns in the role that made him the cult star that he is and he once again does well with it. Bruce Abbott stars opposite him and the pair do basically what they did in the first film. David Gale also returns to the series and he does well as a severed head. Having a severed head as the main villain is a very amusing idea and the film really does make the best of it. Every moment that the head is on screen is funny and it certainly sets it apart from most other horror movies! Overall if you didn't like the first one this is unlikely to do anything for you but it's great fun for fans of the original!".

In the end there's no culmination. Just an army of living dead raising as the beauty bride of reanimator breaks the capsule with reagent and it spreads to the other side of the wall between the lab and the crypt. Terror to watch! The only good part is the one shutting talking cutoff head with apple. 2 out of 10. Nothing to recommend! Third reanimator is much better than this one. And this is Yuzna's worst movie. Almost as bad as it gets! Sorry!".

First Wives Club takes a more constructive and intelligent approach to the problem and does so with much hilarity.  I don't see how anyone can be offended by something as fun as this.  I also find a comparison to Birth of a Nation to be very stretched particularly since the attitudes in First Wives Club are not as dangerous and as I have reiterated several times they are not intended to be serious.

	schema:headline " When Bad Stories Happen to Good Actresses";
	schema:reviewBody "It doesn't matter that the reviews of the book version of THE FIRST WIVES CLUB were generally good. It doesn't take away from the fact that it's nothing more than a thinly disguised bad story with a potentially wicked setup that has seen better days and which not even the good chemistry of the three main performers can save.On learning of the death of their onetime college friend Cynthia SwannGriffin Stockard Channing in an alltoobrief cameo due to the abandonment from her husband three recently divorced women Annie Paradis Diane Keaton Elise Eliott Goldie Hawn and Brenda Cushman Bette Midler come together to get back at their former husbands by essentially taking away their freedom. Sounds familiar? In 1989 Roseanne Barr and Meryl Streep starred in SHE DEVIL a bad but compared to this trash a classic movie adaptation of the novel of the same name in which a middleclass wife on being dumped by her husband for a successful romance novelist decides to destroy her home her family and take away her husband's freedom by starting her own club for women in the same situation as she. Even farther to 1980 9 TO 5 told a similar story about three coworkers Jane Fonda Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton who band together to make mincemeat of their male chauvinistic pig of a boss played by Dabney Coleman and essentially prove to the entire office that woman make work more efficient. And even farther to 1939 to a classic and the mother of all desperate housewives THE WOMEN brilliantly told the acid tale of how society women lose their husbands to social climbers and while Mary Haines Norma Shearer does what no feminist would do  go back to her unseen Stephen  it is still a powerful tale of women their men and how they survive in a Darwinistic society where bitches eat bitches for lunch while playing bridge at 5 PM. And at the same time gave many of its actresses all icons from Joan Crawford to Paulette Goddard to Rosalind Russell to the great Lucille Watson roles to sink their teeth in something that has essentially gone South in the Hollywood of today.But not to digress even though I am talking of the same essential theme THE FIRST WIVES CLUB should have been a much better movie than it is. All of the elements are there to make its comedy not only dark but biting cruel politically incorrect contrary to its PC nature and not tack on the saccharine cloying mess that pretends to be an ending. At the same time there has to be something to like about in these three women Annie comes across as vaguely sympathetic a more intellectual version of Mary Haines but her shrillness is so overthetop and her transformation from klutz to business entrepreneur so unbelievable it's not possible to feel for her. Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn do better with what little material they've been given while still being little more than caricatures. Hawn at least does poke fun at Hollywood's treatment of actresses which may also be at her own persona which has as Elise Eliott says refused to age but other than that there's not much bite in her resolve to do her husband in.Then we have the supporting characters none which fare any better. What is Bronson Pinchot doing as yet another affected character stupidly named Duarto Feliz? Don't writers do their research in writing about characters with Spanish names? None of the younger women are written as little more as props though at least Sarah Jessica Parker has a couple of lines that hint of a different version of Carrie Bradshaw. The husbands... well... they're essentially unrepentant jerks and while in THE WOMEN they remained invisible there was the idea that in that story they were actual people. That inexplicably Dan Hedaya's character suddenly does an aboutface at the end seems made to satisfy at least a part of the audience who would want to see at least one of the women retain their partner. And what's with Annie having a lesbian daughter if it doesn't tie into anything else in the story? That lesbians hate men and make great allies to jilted women everywhere?

	onyx:emotionText "It doesn't matter that the reviews of the book version of THE FIRST WIVES CLUB were generally good. It doesn't take away from the fact that it's nothing more than a thinly disguised bad story with a potentially wicked setup that has seen better days and which not even the good chemistry of the three main performers can save.On learning of the death of their onetime college friend Cynthia SwannGriffin Stockard Channing in an alltoobrief cameo due to the abandonment from her husband three recently divorced women Annie Paradis Diane Keaton Elise Eliott Goldie Hawn and Brenda Cushman Bette Midler come together to get back at their former husbands by essentially taking away their freedom. Sounds familiar? In 1989 Roseanne Barr and Meryl Streep starred in SHE DEVIL a bad but compared to this trash a classic movie adaptation of the novel of the same name in which a middleclass wife on being dumped by her husband for a successful romance novelist decides to destroy her home her family and take away her husband's freedom by starting her own club for women in the same situation as she. Even farther to 1980 9 TO 5 told a similar story about three coworkers Jane Fonda Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton who band together to make mincemeat of their male chauvinistic pig of a boss played by Dabney Coleman and essentially prove to the entire office that woman make work more efficient. And even farther to 1939 to a classic and the mother of all desperate housewives THE WOMEN brilliantly told the acid tale of how society women lose their husbands to social climbers and while Mary Haines Norma Shearer does what no feminist would do  go back to her unseen Stephen  it is still a powerful tale of women their men and how they survive in a Darwinistic society where bitches eat bitches for lunch while playing bridge at 5 PM. And at the same time gave many of its actresses all icons from Joan Crawford to Paulette Goddard to Rosalind Russell to the great Lucille Watson roles to sink their teeth in something that has essentially gone South in the Hollywood of today.But not to digress even though I am talking of the same essential theme THE FIRST WIVES CLUB should have been a much better movie than it is. All of the elements are there to make its comedy not only dark but biting cruel politically incorrect contrary to its PC nature and not tack on the saccharine cloying mess that pretends to be an ending. At the same time there has to be something to like about in these three women Annie comes across as vaguely sympathetic a more intellectual version of Mary Haines but her shrillness is so overthetop and her transformation from klutz to business entrepreneur so unbelievable it's not possible to feel for her. Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn do better with what little material they've been given while still being little more than caricatures. Hawn at least does poke fun at Hollywood's treatment of actresses which may also be at her own persona which has as Elise Eliott says refused to age but other than that there's not much bite in her resolve to do her husband in.Then we have the supporting characters none which fare any better. What is Bronson Pinchot doing as yet another affected character stupidly named Duarto Feliz? Don't writers do their research in writing about characters with Spanish names? None of the younger women are written as little more as props though at least Sarah Jessica Parker has a couple of lines that hint of a different version of Carrie Bradshaw. The husbands... well... they're essentially unrepentant jerks and while in THE WOMEN they remained invisible there was the idea that in that story they were actual people. That inexplicably Dan Hedaya's character suddenly does an aboutface at the end seems made to satisfy at least a part of the audience who would want to see at least one of the women retain their partner. And what's with Annie having a lesbian daughter if it doesn't tie into anything else in the story? That lesbians hate men and make great allies to jilted women everywhere? I didn't get it I still don't get it and it didn't work for me.It just proves that a bad screenplay filled with unsympathetic characters will kill the central idea in a story but also that an equally bad direction with odd takes and bad editing will further the damage. Stockard Channing's death scene is so badly filmed it might as well been an afterthought from another movie that somehow found its way here.

I think that the major reason that the movie is unappreciated by too many critics is because it's a woman's picture. It's designed to be a very light comedy that brings in women and their families to generate box office. Whatever its genre however the movie works in every way it's intended to work. The sets are great the costumes are perfect and the acting is really funny and also touching when it needs to be such as when Sarah Jessica Parker says to Bette Midler Brenda this outfit might look really good on you... why don't you try one on in YOUR SIZE! Midler's fury suddenly deflates and she exhibits pathos. Lots of funny lines and facial expressions and overthetop emotion and the directing was I think very precise and well done.".

The only difference was that it dealt with three women instead of one.The basic premise is that four women graduated from college together full of idealism. Later in life their idealism is destroyed as their respective husbands walk out on them  and each of them handle it in a different way. One destroys herself with alcohol another constantly complains and tries to hang onto her son while another remains oblivious to the fact that anything is wrong. The forth one throws herself off of a building and it is this event that draws them all back together. They realise that they had given their respective husbands the best years of their life and this has been discarded by them so they decide to get back at their husbands and destroy them. Basically it becomes a similar plot to that of SheDevil.There is nothing that really stands out in this movie that I really wish to discuss. It looks at the frustration that women face in divorce and though this may be a rare case women can be just as vicious in divorce proceedings as can men. If we look at Liar Liar we see a woman milking the man for all that she can get  while here the men have used the women and thrown them away. I agree that men can be bastards but so can everybody.I guess the purpose of this movie was to try and bring us into the women's point of view  but the theme can be genderneutral with the exception that men or men that I have known will simply wallow in their misery while women will carry on. Even then that statement is not entirely true as everybody reacts to a divorce situation differently. I was going to make a comment that it was based on a book written by a female while the screenwriters and directors were male meaning that the female psyche is not portrayed as well as say a film by Amy Heckerling. But this film does no such thing and is really a movie about people being thrown away and then climbing back up to the top.In conclusion I will say that this is not an outstanding or impressive movie and though entertaining after the first few minutes it is nothing that I will really talk about that much.".

	schema:headline " Possibly one for the undemanding sisterhood or not even them Hawn and Midler partly redeem a very pedestrian outing";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is I think more one for the sisterhood than anyone else. I don't mean that in any derogatory sense but whatever buttons it presses rather pass us guys by. It is something of a mishmash redeemed in part by rather good and definitely entertaining performances from Bette Midler as the abandoned wife of a Jewish merchant and Goldie Hawn an ageing Oscarwinning film start who has also been abandoned by her film producer husband. Making up the threesome is Diane Keaton who is never my favourite actress I'm sorry to say as the doormat wife of an philandering adman. The trio is brought together by the suicide of the fourth member of their college group the abandoned wife of a wealthy Wall Street moneyman who hurls herself to her death from the balcony of her Central Park apartment. The trio she leaves behind had all promised to stick together through thick and thin on their graduation day but in the event had lost touch. Meeting up again after all those years at their friend's funeral they get roaring drunk afterwards 'catching up' with Hawn and Midler admitting they have been traded in by their husbands for younger model and Keaton still in denial and insisting she and her husband are only temporarily separated obviously soon to be in the same boat. One thing leads to another and the trio decide to form a First Wives Club in order to get revenge on the husband's who discarded them. And so on. The story itself isn't really important it could be a roaring success in some director's hands and a dire disaster in those of another. That's the thin with films derived from books they are entities in themselves. They are not a silver screen realisation of some novel or other. There have been many poor films based on cracking novels and even works of nonfiction. And there have been great films based on very poor material and films which consciously set out to be a faithful 'film of the book' tend to be pretty poor. In the hands of director Hugh Wilson and based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel this is no great shakes though it has to be said that a pretty average film is shot through with several gems  great scenes great acting and great oneliners  from Midler and Hawn. But overall as I suggest this is one for the sisterhood. Given its soul and 'message' yes I'm afraid there does seem to be a message of some kind although one pronounced in such a halfhearted fashion I do wonder why they even bothered the sisters might well love it. There are curious elements which add absolutely nothing to the film but makes sense if this is as I suspect it was intended to be some kind of sanitised sisterhood tract. Why make Diane Keaton's daughter a lesbian? There is no reason not to of course and I have many gay and lesbian friends and colleagues. But what was the purpose of having this lesbian character in the film. It seems purely grafted on to no effect. Then there is the character of Keaton's character's mother what purpose does she have in the film? Beats me. The inclusion of Maggie Smith as the queen bee of New York society with a very dodgy American accent even to my Brit ears seems more like an attempt to attract the punters and gain a little spurious 'class' for the film. She plays hardly any part in the film except as a cackhanded plot device and even that might have been achieved with a small rewrite. Me I'll remember the good bits involving Midler and Hawn but I wouldn't have been heartbroken had I fished another 3 DVD out of my supermarket bargain bin rather than this one and never seen it.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is I think more one for the sisterhood than anyone else. I don't mean that in any derogatory sense but whatever buttons it presses rather pass us guys by. It is something of a mishmash redeemed in part by rather good and definitely entertaining performances from Bette Midler as the abandoned wife of a Jewish merchant and Goldie Hawn an ageing Oscarwinning film start who has also been abandoned by her film producer husband. Making up the threesome is Diane Keaton who is never my favourite actress I'm sorry to say as the doormat wife of an philandering adman. The trio is brought together by the suicide of the fourth member of their college group the abandoned wife of a wealthy Wall Street moneyman who hurls herself to her death from the balcony of her Central Park apartment. The trio she leaves behind had all promised to stick together through thick and thin on their graduation day but in the event had lost touch. Meeting up again after all those years at their friend's funeral they get roaring drunk afterwards 'catching up' with Hawn and Midler admitting they have been traded in by their husbands for younger model and Keaton still in denial and insisting she and her husband are only temporarily separated obviously soon to be in the same boat. One thing leads to another and the trio decide to form a First Wives Club in order to get revenge on the husband's who discarded them. And so on. The story itself isn't really important it could be a roaring success in some director's hands and a dire disaster in those of another. That's the thin with films derived from books they are entities in themselves. They are not a silver screen realisation of some novel or other. There have been many poor films based on cracking novels and even works of nonfiction. And there have been great films based on very poor material and films which consciously set out to be a faithful 'film of the book' tend to be pretty poor. In the hands of director Hugh Wilson and based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel this is no great shakes though it has to be said that a pretty average film is shot through with several gems  great scenes great acting and great oneliners  from Midler and Hawn. But overall as I suggest this is one for the sisterhood. Given its soul and 'message' yes I'm afraid there does seem to be a message of some kind although one pronounced in such a halfhearted fashion I do wonder why they even bothered the sisters might well love it. There are curious elements which add absolutely nothing to the film but makes sense if this is as I suspect it was intended to be some kind of sanitised sisterhood tract. Why make Diane Keaton's daughter a lesbian? There is no reason not to of course and I have many gay and lesbian friends and colleagues. But what was the purpose of having this lesbian character in the film. It seems purely grafted on to no effect. Then there is the character of Keaton's character's mother what purpose does she have in the film? Beats me.

The former of course is known for having gained all her wealth power and fame from exploiting the wealth power and fame of her husbandexhusband and the latter is noted for gaining all her wealth power and fame from her malebashing bigotry. The film embraces both of these icons with equal selfrighteousness.THE FIRST WIVES CLUB film expects us to accept the notion that divorce in America is decidedly promale designed to cheat women. This it seems is especially true if the women are white welleducated upperclass and socially prominent. While most people would be hard pressed to see such women as society's victims the film takes it for granted that they are and expects us to never question that notion. If you don't you will likely enjoy the film greatly. If you have even one working brain cell in your head you should be rightly amazed at the gall the filmmakers have to so blatantly insult your intelligence.The film deals with three former college chums now middleaged wives who coincidentally are facing divorce all at the same time. The three are Goldie Hawn Diane Keaton and Bette Midler  three absolutely wonderful actresses. Because the system is so antifemale the three have to resort to blackmail kidnapping extortion and racketeering in order to wrestle the family wealth out of the hands of their dimwitted husbands. It is notable that in the cases of Keaton and Midler's characters they claim to deserve their husbands' money because they helped and supported them early in their careers. Meanwhile in Hawn's case her husband worked as her business manager and helped her become a leading film star but she claims that she is the bread winner in the family and therefore he is entitled to nothing. The film is so dullwitted that it presents these conflicting plotlines and is totally oblivious to their obvious irony. The film's logic is clear What's his is hers what's hers is hers and what's theirs is hers.Battle of the sexes comedies can be great fun but only if both sides are evenly matched and equally clever  think Kate and Spencer Doris and Rock or even Lucy and Desi. This lame film tries to stack the deck by pandering to feminist stereotypes Women are better but victimized men are evil but stupid. The irony is that by the end of the film the men are the sympathetic victims and the three leading actresses come off as smug monsters thus the tacked on ending wherein they donate their illgotten loot to open a shelter for abused women  apparently you can buy off guilt.The really sad thing about this sorrowful little mess of a movie is that it wastes the talents of the three terrific leading ladies.

First of all I did not go to see this movie about three women who plot revenge on their husbands for having committed the unspeakable crime of leaving them for younger women or rent it. It happened to have been playing on a tour bus I was on and try as I might I could not ignore it. I have resolved on the basis of this movie never to ride another tour bus if any movies whose titles or content I do not know in advance are playing. I found this a thoroughly disagreeable film.Looking at it I found myself thinking of a review by the late Richard Grenier of the movie MASH. Writing in the October 1981 issue of Commentary Mr. Grenier said ...I have never watched an ostensible comedy with such stony grimness... and this for the simple reason that I found it to be inspired by no humor... but entirely by cruelty malice and an inordinate craving to humiliate. It would have been like laughing at a dog running frantically in circles driven mad by a tin can some boys had tied to his tail. And also being asked to admire the boys. As noted the center of this film is the relationship between three women Goldie Hawn Bette Midler and Diane Keaton whose husbands each leave them for younger women which in the context of this film is the unpardonable sin. The heart of the film is their elaborate revenge plots all of which seem wildly disproportionate  rather like setting an arson fire to a hobby shop that sells you a model airplane kit with parts missing. Continuing from Mr. Grenier What makes the movie even more repellent is that the torment our heroes inflict on their adversaries is administered so smugly with an air of overweening sanctimony as if anyone who stands in their way deserves what he gets. But enough. I have wasted too much time on this ridiculous film already. Let me close with one final Grenier quote which applies perfectly here ...every foot of this film is marked by...smug hooliganism.... Its most essential trait is the complacent assumption that if one is in the right...one can commit any brutality any cruelty any humiliation. If one is right human dignity no longer applies.".

Does Miss Midler get to sing The wind beneath my wings?You'll have to watch it to find outbut if you're rather hoping she does then The first Wives' club may well be right up your street.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the film purely by accident a couple of years ago on a plane when I was travelling to Hong Kong and this was shown on screen.The First Wives Club is mainly based on a book of which I am not that familiar with and is a very antimale take on 3 women who get together and plan their revenge against their hubby's after they mistreat them. The script was poor the performances were belowpar given the standard of the three female leads Midler Hawn and Keaton and for a film supposedly trying to promote gender equality it fails because it portrays the male characters as sleazy money grabbing chauvinists.This comedy movie is also so devoid of actual laughs the wisecracks were typically oldfashioned sexist and the narrative derivative and this coming from a woman. If society is ever going to become more equally tolerant and acceptable of men and women then it needs to start by getting rid of profeminist concepts which celebrates the triumphs of femininity but ridicules and criticises masculinity. We have things such as women studies for eg and yet if men were to have male studies they would be slated for that too.I didn't really care one bit about the characters because they were all stereotypes of men and women and in truth I don't mind watching TV shows and films with a predominately female slant to it just as long as its treatment of its male counterparts is on an equal playing level and vice versa with the women. But with movies such as The First Wives Club they are misleading and wrongly perpetuate the notion that all women are great and all men are heartless scheming cheating lying toe rags.Such a shame that with a stellar cast in Goldie Hawn Diane Keaton and Bette Midler the film sends itself up to be malebashing farce as opposed to one that highlights the positives and negatives of both men and women through these characters and addressing the argument of the battle of the sexes in a open minded and fair way that doesn't make all women out to be the good guys and the men the socalled bad guys.The ending was a bit of a farce because the men end up going back to their girlfriends and wives despite their behaviour and going out with other women that Hawn Midler and Keaton take them back.Whilst this will not rank in my top ten worst movies ever list i've seen much worst in my time this ultimately is a flawed movie which to be honest having seen it once I have no intention of ever seeing it again".

Embarrassingly corny flick. Were the three female stars going through menopause which can only explain the bad decision the three gals made in agreeing to star in this crappy comedy.I mean any comedy from the 1930s 1940s and even the corny 1950s were much more clever than this treacly stillborn yawnfest. Speaking of yawns can someone explain to me the appeal of Goldie Hawn? She plays the same kind of character in every film ditzy babe in this case overthehill ditzy babe. She has no range whatsoever. And this is set against Keaton and Midler who also play clichd characters. And Maggie Smith is totally wasted in a pointless character.Everything in this product is pure corn. The gals exacting revenge on their philandering husbands is so unconvincing and simplistic that I groaned nonstop in abject embarrassment. Who wrote this thing a 12 year old? The ending is particularly awful with everyone joining a party in honor of the first wives club including the husbands they just emasculated. And in the closing shot we see the three women sing and dance in the middle of an empty street which is a true lowpoint in corniness.Diane Keaton one of my favorite actors has been making a lot of bad movies these days. She should be more choosy with the kind of scripts she's being offered. After THE FAMILY STONE and now this I'll probably stop watching all of her new films.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the late 1980s exploitation giant Cannon Films released a series of directtovideo action flicks called 'ActionAdventure Theater' which sported the endorsement of 'B' movie icon Michael Dudikoff. These four movies were cheap zerobudget knockoffs from smaller European producers that had no chance of being widely marketed in the United States.'Un Ponte per l'inferno' AKA 'Bridge to Hell' is the lone title in this series with an historical context set in Yugoslavia during World War II. The film was written and directed by Umberto Lenzi whose career was in freefall at this point and would soon include more lowbudget stinkers and hack television credits. Italian cult cinema fans are usually aware of Lenzi who became a master of the giallo through such charmers as 'Orgasmo' and 'Seven BloodStained Orchids' while milking the war genre in 'Battle of the Commandos' and 'The Greatest Battle.' After becoming a recognized talent during the 1960s and 70s however Lenzi seemed to lose his mind taking part in the deplorable 'Eaten Alive' and 'Cannibal Ferox' besides other trashy horror films.Lenzi was clearly out of options in his directorial career by the time of this film as its cheapness is apparent from the beginning. The action takes place in Yugoslavia during the time of German occupation and focuses on three escaped POWs who are trying to reach the allied forces in Italy Lieutenant Bill Rogers Andy J. Forest a U.S. air force pilot Sergeant Mario Espozi Carlo Mucari an Italian soldier and Blinz Paki Valente an Austrian who has deserted the Wehrmacht. With help from an Orthodox priest the trio is led to a band of partisans who need pilots to fly their two remaining airplanes and bombard German armaments in the hillsides. The POWs meanwhile learn from nunturnedpartisan Vanya Francesca Ferre of priceless gold chalices that are enshrined in her order's St. Basil convent. After running two aerial missions successfully the POWs decide amongst themselves to steal the treasure. They exchange their flying services for weapons and get help from Vanya to find the chapel unaware of their plan.The premise of 'Bridge to Hell' is terribly weak and there is nothing in the script or production values to keep things afloat. It is all just a pretext for several lame action sequences in which a tiny partisan group fights hundreds of Germans and mows them down without breaking a sweat. Most of these sequences are badly acted and interspersed with stock footage from betterfinanced productions. This is obvious from how the film's characters are shown in tight locations and never integral to what is 'happening' nearby. There are times aplenty when continuity and editing skills are forgotten leading to hilariously bad moments. The photography by adult film cinematographer Luigi Ciccarese is also overexposed and has washedout color it seems to have been downgraded in order for the aging stock footage to look more cohesive with Lenzi's own work.There is nothing in the plot to generate dramatic tension and the film quickly becomes a ridiculous poorly thoughtout cycle of gunfights aerial maneuvers and running through forests as in trees not Andy J.. The aerial bombardments by these POWs involve two shod biplanes that seem like relics from World War I and bombs that are thrown from the planes by hand!. No matter how old or new the planes are the idea of two such aircraft taking on a swarm of advanced German fighters which the stock footage clearly shows is ridiculous. Partisans on the ground stave off dozens of Germans with a few machine guns when in real life they wouldn't have lasted for more than two seconds. There are also crazy plot gaps such as when German attack dogs emerge from thin air and are gone as quickly as they came. Additional treats are the horrible audio quality and synthesized music by Fabio Frizzi that is pretty much a single theme repeated over and over again like the plot. The very small pluses in this film are occasional touches of humor Forest and Mucari bet a Rita Hayworth photo and a broken pocket watch during bombardment and the presence of Francesca Ferre who draws attention rather easily.One can never expect much from directtovideo films but it's clear that Umberto Lenzi hardly tried to make this film entertaining. Assuming he knew how cheap this movie would be the director could have written a script that focused on character and did away with grandiose visions like 'The Greatest Battle.' But for one reason or another Lenzi fooled himself into thinking that 'Bridge to Hell' could achieve those heights with the right amount of cleverness. This is largely why 'Bride to Hell' will stay buried in a tall mountain of 80s shlock with little to no artistic merit.Turkey 0 stars out of 4".

Umberto Lenzi seems to be working well with his Yugoslavian crew and actors in that the action scenes are all fairly exciting in a deliciously hammy way.  There's plenty of funny miniature effects which are filmed in a very similar closeup way that Antonio Margheriti and Michael Curtiz filmed their miniatures.  However the plot is completely laughable repetitive and ultimately dull.  Young American actor Andy J. Forrest who looks kinda like a serious Jim Carrey goes through his lines with a Jimmy Stewartsounding dubbed voice while leading a couple terrible actors across the Yugoslavian countryside killing endless Germans.  In one scene Forrest and co. run into a bunch of resistance members and in the next scene help them fight Germans only to escape and... run into more partisans and help them out too!  This goes on for over 90 minutes and grows tediously overlong near the end descending into outright slapstick comedy as Forrest steals plane after plane and crashes every single one.There's a lot of really annoying things going on here.  First off the Germans dont really speak English OR German they merely say Schnell over and over again which basically means Fast.  Is that really the only German word they knew?  Also several scenes are thrown in for no reason like a shot of a bunch of German attack dogs which never go on to actually attack anything.  Add to the list the completely idiotic action scene at the end involving 3 people fending off about a million German soldiers completely effortlessly.  In some parts of the said battle the three main characters will be busy planting explosives while machine gun fire is heard and endless Germans die and fall off the bridge.  As entertaining as this was it was totally goofy and unbelievable actually predating TROMA'S WAR. Fabio Frizzi's score is acceptable synthesizer garbage much like Luigi Ceccarelli's scores but sounds totally outofplace in World War Two movie!Umberto Lenzi's made close to halfadozen war movies and his late 80's efforts are by far his least impressive.  Watch DESERT COMMANDOS or THE GREATEST BATTLE instead.  Sure their plots suck too but they arent half ascorny as this one.".

Watch DESERT COMMANDOS or THE GREATEST BATTLE instead.  Sure their plots suck too but they arent half ascorny as this one.";

	schema:headline " Umberto Lenzi sinks to a new Low with a Cheap WWII Action Piece";
	schema:reviewBody "When one looks at director Umberto Lenzi's war films it's really hard to define his style. His early efforts were strong and showed excellent potential they were lowbudget stories which emphasized characters over largescale action in the 1970s he produced two messy epics with starstudded casts and in the 1980s he released Wartime now Bridge to Hell both incredibly cheap plot less action pieces with little or no redeeming qualities.The story of Bridge to Hell is simple and often times Lenzi tends to forget the point and lets it wander off in any direction which seems convenient. A group of 3 Allied POWs treks across wartorn Yugoslavia trying to reach the Allied lines in Italy. Along the way they learn of a secret treasure which the Yugoslav partisans are hiding from the Nazis and decide to steal it for themselves. The bulk of the film's 90 minute runningtime is comprised of shootouts between the exPOWs and German soldiers tanks and planes. The film's conclusion leaves the story unresolved and feels tacked on but then again there really is no appropriate way to end a film such as this.As the saga unfolds it becomes full of holes and lacks any flair the three escapees run into a band of partisans and help them in their fight in exchange for weapons and a guide. Then they continue their journey only to run into more partisans and repeat the cycle. It's obvious that the writers were running out of ideas when two of the main characters crash a plane go on their way only to steal another plane and crash yet again. Several times continuity is disregarded for convenience's sake early on in the film it is clearly established that the Partisans lack an air force  later on the heroes witness a huge partisan aerial bombardment! There is a scene of vicious German attack dogs running around in a field snarling like they're rapid but they never go on to attack anything. At one point in the film one character yells of nearby German fighters Those Messers are shooting at us! but shots of the planes reveal them to be unarmed transports flying in formation and minding their own business.The special effects and action scenes in general have a very cheap look and feel. Lenzi splices closeups of his own actors into a continuous reel of stock footage from films like Battle of the Eagles and When the Bell Tolls. What makes matters worse is that this isn't goodlooking stock footage most of it centers around really really funny miniature airplanes looking just as bad if not worse as the miniature work in Japanese war movies from the 1960s. Some shots lack sound effects so one can see the miniature fighters' machineguns blasting away but hear nothing.To top it off Lenzi throws logic out the window as the characters blast away at legions of German soldiers without bothering to aim their weapons. In response the Germans run around in a frenzy without bothering to shoot back and fall down dead in every direction. One German officer tries to sound an air raid siren in one scene and when it doesn't work he claims Sabotage. Moments later when German planes attempt to take off and chase a stolen fighter plane they can't take on fuel. I really don't understand why it's not as though the Partisans and fugitives coordinated the escape it was a spurofthemoment decision! German soldiers advance cautiously onto a bridge dodging bullets as we hear plenty of explosions and gunfire  but the good guys aren't firing back at them! These are the most obvious errors but there's plenty more to go around.Dubbing reaches a new low too. To add insult to injury some of the actors share a common voice  one German soldier sounds just like one of the main characters! When the German soldiers speak German it's obvious that their voices were dubbed in because there is an annoying metallic rasping sound.It's hard for me to understand how Umberto Lenzi could make four serviceable films over a 10year period and suddenly seem to fall apart at the end of his career. Maybe it's not his fault maybe he only a minimal budget to work with and this was the best he could crank out. It's unfortunate to see a fair director go under this way  all this film is good for is a decent tearing down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bridge to Hell 1986  out of 4 Italian WWII film has three Allied POWs trying to make it across Yugoslavia to safe lines in Italy but along their journey they learn about a treasure being hid from Nazis so they decide to steal it themselves. The story is rather weak and director Lenzi seems to forget what the actual story is at times because the movie is constantly going off in different directions and we get scenes that don't appear to have anything to do with the actual story. Just take a look at one sequence where a bunch of guard dogs show up for no apparent reason unless that said reason ended up on the cutting room floor. The film was obviously done on a very cheap budget as there's very little here that would make you think that you were actually watching a war movie. We do get a couple big battle scenes with a lot of explosions and gun fire but it all looks rather cheap. We also get the mandatory plane crash quick edit of pilots jumping out and then quick edit of an explosion. The entire movie is pretty much built around stealing this treasure but this too never really gets resolved and by the time the end credits start you wonder if you're missing something or if the production simply ran out of money. Lenzi had pr oven himself to be a good director but he doesn't really do much here as we get no style no clear story being told and worse of all is that there are many times when the movie just drags along. None of the lead actors are all that good and it doesn't help that the dubbing is rather bad.".

But still being a big fan of his movies I decided to buy this one on UK DVD and give it a try.It was late night when I began to watch it and I was pretty tired but I set myself to trashmode and pressed play. I was right it was really trashy but in a quite enjoyable way. Plot was pretty bad and there was some scenes that made no point but hey it's a zerobudget Italian WW2movie so I didn't expect anything more. One thing above the others is something that I have to mention here the musical score by Fabio Frizzi was really nice.So if you want to just watch a war movie with great cast awesome script and billion dollar budget you'll be definitely disappointed. Otherwise if you enjoy trashy Italian style stuff this may be the movie for you.Not the Lenzi's best but definitely not the worst either. I'll give Bridge to hell 7 out of 10.".

Predictable but entertaining cheese with few meatballs and a modicum of sauce sums up Make Them Die Slowly director Umberto Lenzi's lackluster lowbudget World War II thriller Bridge to Hell that was lensed on location in scenic Yugoslavia. The bridges look terrific the Germans are appropriately villainous and firefights are inevitable. The standardissue heroics and the tongueincheek mentality qualifies Bridge to Hell as shallow lightweight actioneer that follows a heroic trio deep into enemy territory. A U.S.A.A.F. pilot Lt. Bill Rogers Andy J. Forest of The Kiss of the Cobra a former Italian pilot Sgt. Mario 'Pazilbo' Espozi Carlo Mucari of Arabella Black Angel and an Austrian who has deserted the Wehrmacht Blinz Paki Valente of Abissinia. constitute this fearless threesome. Indeed they are heading for the Allied lines when they encounter a platoon of partisans who require their talents. The American and the Italian are persuaded to fly the skies in a couple of vintage World War I biplanes and bomb the Germans the old fashioned way. Yes they drop the bombs by hand but one biplane is put out of commission. Lieutenant Rodgers flies against 20 German fighters and sets out to bomb a train. This juvenile warasadventure nonsense adds a romantic subplot when the amorous Italian falls for the partisan babe. After the partisans agree that our heroic trio has held up their end of the bargain the partisan chick escorts them toward Allied lines. Along the way they loot a monastery of St. Basil's Treasure and demolish a German occupied bridge. During the bulletriddled bridge scene the German deserter catches a couple of bullets from his own men in a display of irony. This leaves the American and the Italian. They drop the partisan babe off with her comrades and take off in the Nazi transport truck with a locked box full of treasure. When they open up the box guess what they find. Lenzi directs Bridge to Hell as if it were a Spaghetti western in olivedrab fatigues. The aerial bombardment scene resembles the Korean War epic The Bridges at TokoRi and most of writer  director Lenzi's narrative recalls Inglorious Bastards except the outcome is a lot rosy for the survivors. Characterization is onedimensional and Lenzi fails to give this World War II film any relevance to the rest of the war. Arguably the haircuts are archaic. The performances are tolerable but the dubbing is absolutely atrocious. Happily Lenzi keeps things clicking through this traditional 90minute war epic. This World War II movie is barely memorable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set primarily in Yugoslavia during World War II Bridge to Hell is the story of Lt. Bill Rogers Forest a U.S. Air Force pilot who was shot down and escaped from a POW camp and his compatriots Sgt. Mario Espozi Mucari and Blinz Valente a former German soldier who deserted and decided to join the good guys. Along their perilous travels to reach the allies in Italy they end up teaming up with a small band of Partisans including Vanya Ferre. What ensues are a bunch of battles between our heroes and the Nazis and not much else. There's also a subplot about St. Basil's treasure and how to find it and what to do with it. Will our heroes finally reach the BRIDGE TO HELL and if so why would they want to cross it? Bridge to Hell is a rather staid World War II actioner. It's not a bad movie per se but it's runofthemill and certainly not Lenzi's finest hour. Lenzi was doing a lot of movies like this in the final third of his career and nothing about Bridge to Hell stands out in any way. His prior movie The Wild Team 1985 is very similar but instead of being set during WWII it's an explodinghutter in the jungle. The main problem is that it's all very samey  rural locations various different missions that involve shooting blowing up planes blowing up trains blowing up bridges and stock footage of all of the above. Instead of just a bunch of random Nazis there should have been one superevil Nazi bad guy. As we've seen countless times before when there's no strong central villain the movie suffers and Bridge to Hell is no exception.Not that all the aforementioned shootingandblowup missions are all bad  there's a very cool train explosion and it was nice to see our heroes dropping bombs on the baddies by hand from out of a biplane  but some more meat on the bone as it relates to character development suspense or surprises would have been nice. Also in the win column are prepolitical correctness bits of dialogue such as the above quote and the fact that Rogers consistently calls his Italian buddy Spaghetti. That's his nickname for him and not only does Espozi not care it perhaps makes the bond between the two men even stronger. Okay we might be reading into that just a tad bit too much but we really hate political correctness. Also they were in the midst of a war zone so there were no safe spaces to run to.

This intro is not included on the Inglorious Bastards 2 Hell Heroes DVD collection where Bridge to Hell can currently be found. The VHS tracking lines did find their way into the collection however. In the end Bridge to Hell is goodnatured but dull and not exactly a mustsee.".

It was very cheesy and the storyline was very loose the characters all seemed like they came straight out of a comic book and it had scenes that went nowhere. However I found the Yugoslavian setting and the plot device of Yugoslav partisan activity during the war years very interesting which is not something often seen by US audiences. Then again knowing Umberto Lenzi's work I sort of knew what to expect. So if you are looking for historical accuracy technical accuracy great casting and acting and a great storyline look elsewhere but if you just want cartoonish combat action and lots of explosions with the added bonus of seeing some lovely Bosnian scenery you've come to the right place!".

First they put their flying skill to use flying biplanes in support of resistance actions later the group tries to make their escape and find themselves fighting across the countryside. Good Italian war film that keeps up interest because it just keeps moving. I like that the film doesn't get bogged down. My initial reaction was that perhaps it was too rambling a film but thinking about it afterward I found that I like it more than I thought. The bridge of the title is Nazi held bridge that the Allies have been trying to destroy and failing but which our heroes need to cross to get home and which they need to destroy to have any hope of actually getting away. I'm guessing the film incorporates footage from other bigger budgeted films and while its not always perfectly matched it does help to add weight to the proceedings. Over all it's a good way to spend a night on the couch.".

Based on the memoirs of Helene Hanff the book contains the letters from which they read throughout the film this is the story of a single New York woman named Helene Hanff Anne Bancroft who builds a fortyyear friendship with some people who work in a bookstore in England. The movie begins during WWII as Helene a writer is searching for outofprint books and frustrated at the poor selection in the city's bookstores starts writing letters to the Marx brother's bookstore in England. Through her letters she not only becomes a frequent customer but eventually becomes quite close with all of the bookstore's employees. And through their letters they share experiences over the years which the viewer witnesses through a juxtasposition of two different cultures American and British. I like the technique used in this film. The interaction between Helene and her British friends occurs only through letters so rather than have the characters write a letter and then dub what is written eventually the characters just face the camera and say what they would have written with the camera cutting back and forth for each others response at times as though we suddenly become the recipient of their conversations. The film also has a wonderful cast with Anne Bancroft as Helene Anthony Hopkins as the generous Frank P. Doel Judi Dench as his wife and Mercedes Ruehl as Helene's neighbor. It is a wonderful story.".

	schema:reviewBody "'84 Charing Cross' from the address of the used book store in London takes place over roughly 20 years from 1949 to 1969. Watching it today I became totally immersed in the story and I found out why later because it is based on the real story of Helene and Frank. I always like movies based on real people and closely identify with the idea of a seemingly random event triggering a new and perhaps lasting friendship. Helene Anne Bancroft a New York Jew and struggling writer loves English literature but cannot find suitable and reasonablypriced books that she wants in NYC. She finds a simple ad in a publication writes to the bookstore in London they send her two of the three books she seeks for a total of 5.30 and the story begins in earnest from that point. Bancroft Helene and Hopkins Frank are magnificent here in this wonderful little movie of two people quite different living worlds apart but who become lifelong friends. One of my new favorites!!The rest of my comments contain SPOILERS for my recollection please stop reading if you have not seen the movie.  The correspondence between Frank and Helene who became a somewhat successful TV writer carried on for 20 years from 1949 to 1969 and was published in 1970 which eventually led to this movie. During that time he sent her photos of his family she sent 'care packages' of food to them in postwar rationing times she requested certain books he found and sent them. One planned trip to London had to be cancelled because of 2500 of emergency dental work for Helene. Then in 1969 she gets a letter that Frank had died after an attack of appedicitis and later that the bookstore would be closed. When she finally was able to make her trip we see her walk into a now vacant space but she smiles as she recalls 20 years of correspondence with Frank and the other workers there.The movie actually begins at the end as she is on a plane and awakes to sunlight through her window as she approaches London. Then as she enters the vacant store the movie flashes back to 1969. When the movie ends we see her in the store the completion of that earlier scene.  No extras on the DVD but it has a good picture and sound.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this film for the first time as a chance to see an Anne Bancroft film I had not seen before. Bancroft and Hopkins are both excellent in this. And more than almost any other film they have to be excellent their performances are the only thing this little film hangs on.Everything about this film violates almost every screenwriting 101 type rule. The two main characters communicate primarily through letters. Characters address the audience directly. There is no real conflict. Change occurs only with the natural passage of time in the characters' lives. No heroes no villains. No romance no violence no adventures just two people one a writer the other a rarebook dealer living their lives and caring about how the other leads theirs.And yet the film works. Over the span of the 20 years portrayed in the film the audience gets to know and like both of the main characters and their compatriots as well. And just getting to know them and their unique friendship makes it all worthwhile.Also the portrayal of the privations of the postwar U.K. of rations and food shortages is done very well. Michael Palin amongst others have addressed the tragicomic aspects of postwar rationing in the U.K. but in this film it is poignant how even a poor American managed to make the entire bookstore's Christmases worthwhile with a welltimed shipment of Danish food.".

	onyx:emotionText "I recently saw this film for the first time as a chance to see an Anne Bancroft film I had not seen before. Bancroft and Hopkins are both excellent in this. And more than almost any other film they have to be excellent their performances are the only thing this little film hangs on.Everything about this film violates almost every screenwriting 101 type rule. The two main characters communicate primarily through letters. Characters address the audience directly. There is no real conflict. Change occurs only with the natural passage of time in the characters' lives. No heroes no villains. No romance no violence no adventures just two people one a writer the other a rarebook dealer living their lives and caring about how the other leads theirs.And yet the film works.

	schema:reviewBody "84 Charing Cross Road is a wonderful enchanting film about the differences and similarities between the Brits and the New Yorkers over the years. Helene Hanff really was a special writer. She gave an identity to 84 Charing Cross Road to last a lifetime. Her letter writing relationship between a bookstore and herself is one of legendary stories to become part of London and New York. Sadly she died 5 years ago. I am sure that 84 Charing Cross Road will always remember the writer Helene Hanff who inspired such a legacy. Anyway the film has a wonderful cast like Anne Bancroft who is ageless in the role. Sir Anthony Hopkins as the bookseller. Dame Judi Dench as his wife and Maurice Denham in a supporting role. Also I have been to London three more times since I wrote this review and sadly this time I made the effort to visit 84 Charing Cross Road sorry folks it's a Pizza Hut and I had dinner there tonight anyway. THere is no plaque. I still think Anne Bancroft was superb now that she's gone. So has Maurice Denham since I last wrote this review. God Bless them wherever they are.".

	schema:headline " A beautifully made film that captures it's era";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie before I read the book it is based on. I usually see films based on books in this way but this time I wish I had read the book first. There are letters in the book that should have appeared in the movie to flesh it out a bit more. Even so it is one of the most affecting movies I have ever seen. It starts with a middle aged woman in a plane flying to London Anne Bancroft. When she gets to the place she has been seeking it is an abandoned storefront. She looks around wistfully as the first letter is read in her voice in the background. Magically the film transports us back to the late 40's in New York and to the correspondence between a woman living there and the man who is the manager of a bookshop at the title address in London Sir Anthony Hopkins. The letters are read with great warmth and style and the opening up in the film is well done and appropriate to the story. As the years advance we are caught up in both of these people's lives and their correspondence. Due to events that look contrived in the movie but make more sense in the book Helene Hanff leads a life of the lower middle class and much as she would like to there is no chance for her to afford the trip to London. So London is brought to her in both the great books she buys from the bookshop and by reading about the lives of Frand Doel and his family and the other people who work at the bookstore. One of the most affecting scenes deals with the letters she receives from the other employees thanking her for the food parcels she sends to the employees for holidays. I look something like Bill Humphries the cataloger and his scene with his Great Aunt brought me to tears. As the years pass there are some changes but the relationships endure. Many people have called this a love story but the movie gives more evidence of this than the book ever does. I don't believe in that angle. Frank Doel was just part of Helene's feelings of London and not a romance on her or his part. My only real criticism has to do with the end of the film. The book does not lead you to the same ending and it is very helpful to read the sequel to 84 Charing Cross Road called The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street. She did not call a few days after Frank died to find the cost of a trip to London to go there. If they had filmed it from the book it would have been just as compelling. She decided to publish the letters as Frank had died and the reprint of the book by Reader's Digest and the fact that a London publisher decided to publish the book over a year later gave her the impetus and the finances to go to London. Having said all that it is a great film with amazing performances all around. This is just about the only time I have ever said the book is better. If fact I would encourage people to read all of Helene Hanff's works. She was an astonishing writer and someone I wish I could have known.".

	schema:reviewBody "84 Charring Cross Road is a luscious intelligent delicate epistolary love story.It isn't for everybody. Viewers who require movies to shovel piping hot sexandviolencedrenched plot down their gullets won't get this movie it will pass right over their heads.If you are the kind of observant sensitive person who can see someone sitting on a park bench and intuit their biography from the way they wear their scarf hold their bodies and read their newspaper you will hear all that this movie is saying and it will move you to tears.Helene Hanff Anne Bancroft is a single New Yorker of mixed Jewish and Christian family. She is a nononsense lover of life cigarettes hard liquor and books. She is the kind of reader that every writer dreams of writing for  she is like a sponge soaking up every word she is like a bell when an author's words strike her she rings. She is like the very best of interlocutors. Writers dream of having a reader like this to interact in dialogue with their works.When Hanff can't find a book she needs locally and that she can't find a book she needs locally tells you something about her expansive tastes  she lives in Manhattan after all not a shabby place to book shop Hanff begins writing to a London book shop Marks and Cohen staffed by one Frank Doel. Doel meets her needs. That's in 1949. Their exchange of letters lasts decades into the future.The film lovingly and deftly chronicles the decades' changes in fashion not just in clothing but also in architecture. Both Helene and Frank are living in distinctly 1949 dwellings when their exchange begins and are living in more modern dwellings toward the end of the story. Hair styles current events the sound of rock music heard from a passing radio act like clocks to remind the viewer of the passage of time in this relationship.That chronicling via visual cues of the passage of time is just one of the many ways this movie communicates that may be too subtle for many viewers. What the film is saying in these details is this these two people and their acquaintances and colleagues who participate in this correspondence are investing time in each other in a drastically changing world. As the world spins precariously around them from the postWW II rationing in Britain to the introduction of the miniskirt Helene and Frank continue to be there for each other.There are so many other ways in which this movie tells a wondrous rich tale that have nothing to do with conventional ways that films communicate. There are no conventional love scenes or fight scenes. What there are are scenes that in painstakingly crafted detail by painstakingly crafted detail build up a story as rich as full fat cream.By the end of this movie the observant viewer will know Helene and Frank in a way that very few movies allow viewers to know their characters. The observant viewer will have participated in these people's real lives in a way that feels almost like watching a home movie.Watch Frank react to being asked to participate in a conga line. Watch the joie de vivre that Helene brings to ordering gifts from a Danish catalogue. Listen to Helene talk about books. Watch Frank as he goes about the business of meeting his customer's needs.The two loudest scenes in the movie are the scene in which Helene goes to a movie theater and watches Brief Encounter a classic film about a brief extramarital affair. While watching this movie Helene fantasizes about finally visiting London. That scene and that choice of movie tells you much about how Helene feels about Frank. Similarly carefully watch a scene in which Frank reads aloud a Yeats poem which ends Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. There are so many movies about people who are nuts about sports. Movies about people who love guns or war or cars.84 Charring Cross Road is the best movie I know about unbridled passion for books for words and the kind of intimacy that can take place when one person who loves words makes contact with another who shares or at least appreciates that passion.If you don't get this movie I really think you can become a better more sensitive more aware person by watching it again and trying to hear all it says. To the person who really listens 84 Charring Cross Road is one of the richest movies I know.PS the film is perfectly cast and every performance is spot on. Anthony Hopkins has never been more sympathetic. Anne Bancroft was born to play Helene Hanff. Judi Dench Mercedes Ruehl Oscar winners all around  how can you go wrong?".

	schema:reviewBody "For many years Charing Cross Road in London was a nucleus for book enthusiasts particularly for book collectors and bibliophiles. Rare and secondhand bookselling is not one of the more glamorous areas of collectibles trading as many aspects involve lowerend as well as higherend selling. Unlike auctions of master paintings and collectible jewelry which often receive much press coverage antiquarian bookselling often occurs in quiet librarylike shops. Customers and proprietors alike speak in low tones amid dimlylit corridors. 84 Charing Cross Road brings viewers into the world of antiquarian bookselling and purchasing as no other film does.Anne Bancroft who played Mrs Robinson in the Graduate is a writer habituating the exciting world of the New York scene. To quench her everpresent thirst for reading she decides she wants to acquire books of an antiquarian nature fine editions which have a bit more elegance than cheap massmarket editions. She also wants to read books of classic English literature rather than simply the latest NY Times Bestseller. She visits her local secondhand bookshops in New York and none of the proprietors carry the books she seeks because she is told they do not have enough demand among NY book buyers. She then hears about a rare and secondhand book firm in London on Charing Cross Road and writes them hoping they might have the kinds of books she seeks. One of the main purveyors although not one of the owners of the firm is Frank Doel played with an understated civility by the incredible Anthony Hopkins.Thus begins a correspondence between a humble book firm in London and an informal client in New York. As the correspondence progresses she begins to learn more about and understand better the people whose livelihoods center around books. The scenes are mainly split between the contemplative world of the London bookshop and the loud and raucous city that is New York. Even the interactions between characters on each side are quite different. Helene the American is often smoking and boozing with friends while those at the shop quietly but seriously go about their business. Helene the American and Frank the Brit correspond in English but almost immediately we sense the wide difference in their respective letterwriting styles their palette of colors quite diverse. The American is direct blunt and easily conveys her frustration if a book arrives which does not please her. On the other hand the Englishman Doel writes in an overtly congenial tone very lowkey and almost formal and courteous to the point of nearhumility. He is never upset or putoff at the occasional brashness of his counterpart's letters but always attempts to make things right if his client is not entirely pleased with her purchase.Then in an interesting turn Helene learns of the food rationing that is occurring in Britain largely as a result of the war. She resolves to help the struggling employees of the book through a black market coming out of Denmark. The employees become elated when a special package arrives for them. As a result Helene and Frank become close in ways almost like a reader and a book their images and understandings of each other only through words on paper never through voices or body language. However although they learn much about each other's lives throughout the correspondence they never meet but only can imagine each other's worlds.84 Charing Cross Road is almost like a play with the correspondence often spoken in voiceover as the driving catalyst of the story. The piece is more a character study of the participants rather than having a real plot. But it is one of the few films I know of which celebrates the world of antiquarian booksellers and their prospective book buyers. Unfortunately since the rise of the internet and the struggling economies in both America and Europe the presence of secondhand and antiquarian bookshops have been markedly reduced in many urban areas. Charing Cross Road which used to boast many booksellers now has only a handful which is strangely predicted by the film at the end.".

It's been on many many times and I know my mother loved this movie but I never saw it who knows why. But having discovered Dame Judi Dench who has a somewhat minor part I wanted to see her in this movie. Well I was mesmerized! There was no snap and pop here just the quiet story of a book lover and a bookseller who live on 2 different continents and who are total opposites or so it seems but who form a friendship through letters  what today's youngsters would call snail mail. She's a dyedinthewool New Yorker with a New York accent as thick as a deli sandwich. He's a dyedinthewool Englishman whose accent isn't as thick but who is British through and through. Yet they both share a passion for books. This gentle true story based on Helene Hanff's book is told mainly through their correspondence and what a terrific correspondence it was.Letterwriting unfortunately is a lost art. As convenient as Email is it's not quite the same as a good oldfashioned letter. This movie reminded me of that and of the 17year correspondence I shared with my best friend he has since died. I'm told I have a talent for letterwriting and I have 2 friends with whom I share this talent. I used to think those friends should get a computer but now I see I was wrong. Email is expedient but letterwriting is so much more longlasting.One of the reasons I stayed with the picture was one scene Helene goes to the movies remember this was 1950 and what are they playing? My alltime favorite movie Brief Encounter. I couldn't turn away after that and I'm glad I stayed with it. This is one movie I definitely will add to my DVD andor VHS collection. It's a keeper for sure.".

Julie Hagerty and a sinister Mark Margolis are well cast in their respective roles but the threadbare narrative jumps beyond their characters before we are able to gain a greater insight into them.Barely a scene rings true throughout the film and the consistently hollow dialogue immediately suggests an imperfect grasp of English on the director's part. The delivery and intonation in many conversational scenes is uneven and none of the characters convincingly relate to one another. Technically too the film disappoints. The lighting is off particularly in external shots and the sound is tinny  all testament to a meagre budget. The editing is just as careless  a shot near the end of the film shows Bridget's son as an infant despite that fact that he should be well into adolescence by that point.Kollek certainly had a couple of interesting if unoriginal ideas for this movie but at every turn he is undermined by a preposterous story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Miike makes another yakuza picture. It's not especially groundbreaking and it's certainly not one of Miike's deeper films but it is extremely entertaining. That's mostly because of the main character Kunisada Miike regular Riki Takeuchi who is the most psychopathic character in Japanese movies since Tatsuya Nakadai's evil samurai in Sword of Doom. Kunisada's mob boss his surrogate father is ambushed and murdered though not before nearly strangling his assailant to death the hitman only lives because he cuts the dead man's hands off as they clench around his windpipe. Simultaneously Kunisada almost as if through a psychic bond breaks out of jail and starts to go against the rival gang. The only problem is that the boss's death isn't necessarily a bad thing from his own gang's perspective. They and their rival gang try desperately to make a truce. Unfortunately for everyone except for a small handful of loyal comrades Kunisada won't stop until everyone around him is dead. The film suffers from Miike's major flaw as a filmmaker a lack of coherency. There seem to be dozens of named characters and it becomes very difficult to sort out who everyone is. I had to watch key scenes a second time to piece it all together though I had most of it straight by the end of the film. But even if you never quite figure it out Miike's patented breakneck action sequences are so outrageously done that the film is more than worth watching. Watch out when Kunisada finds a rocket launcher!".

	schema:headline " If you've seen Agitator or Kikoku you know exactly what to expect.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rekka is a movie that deals with the theme of backstabbing and diplomacy of the new Yakuza clashing against the violence and honor of the old Yakuza a common theme in Miike's undertheradar gangster movies. It begins when the protagonist's father the leader of a crime family is killed. Before he knows what's happening the new boss of his gang is already making agreements and accepting the murder to avoid a fullscale gang war. Needless to say the son isn't happy so he seeks revenge on the rival crime family. Knowing this the new boss tries to get rid of him so that he can enjoy his new place in the Yakuza hierarchy.On its own this is an exciting modern Yakuza thriller filled with bloodshed and intrigue. But if you're already a Miike fan you might be let down by a few details.Rekka follows a pretty distinct formula. It has the same plot ideas nearly the same characters some of the same actors and the same filmmakers as Agitator and Kikoku which came out later. While Miike changes up the style and feel of each one it still looks like he made three different versions of the same movie. Shigenori Takechi the screenwriter of all three has to be the laziest guy in the film industry. You see the same characters doing the same things only with different names and settings. Like the other movies the protagonist is a seemingly invincible and honorable guy who just can't seem to get killed no matter what he does. There is a charismatic and equally invincible hitman chasing him. There are greedy and cowardly superiors that only he can stand up to. There is a dethroned and deceased father figure that he wants to avenge. And of course there is a love interest that appears for a few minutes combined and has no personality or reason to even be in this movie.The way that this movie is different is that the feel is a little more intense and modern than the other two. The visuals and camerawork are comparatively better and do a much better job of grabbing your attention. It is not as slowpaced and complicated as Agitator clearly the best of the three and it's allaround better than Kikoku the worst. The ending is the most unique part. For better or worse it is incredibly strange and I know that some people will like it. Rekka appears to have the largest budget of the three movie and is the easiest to understand it's definitely the one to show to your friends. Like those two other movies there are no insane shocker moments or incredible gore effects that will stick in your head forever. Rekka has almost nothing in common with Ichi or Fudoh for example so new fans of Miike's work might not get what they expect. But it has more than its share of violence just not enough to make your head spin.On it's own Rekka is definitely not a waste of time and my criticism doesn't sound fair at all. However the feeling is ruined when you've seen Agitator andor Kikoku. Seeing these movies after each other in a short span of time left me with a feeling that I got from Graveyard of Honor another MiikeTakechi product. But in that case it only took one movie to make me feel uncomfortable by giving me the same message over and over again.".

Like the other movies the protagonist is a seemingly invincible and honorable guy who just can't seem to get killed no matter what he does. There is a charismatic and equally invincible hitman chasing him. There are greedy and cowardly superiors that only he can stand up to. There is a dethroned and deceased father figure that he wants to avenge. And of course there is a love interest that appears for a few minutes combined and has no personality or reason to even be in this movie.The way that this movie is different is that the feel is a little more intense and modern than the other two. The visuals and camerawork are comparatively better and do a much better job of grabbing your attention. It is not as slowpaced and complicated as Agitator clearly the best of the three and it's allaround better than Kikoku the worst. The ending is the most unique part. For better or worse it is incredibly strange and I know that some people will like it. Rekka appears to have the largest budget of the three movie and is the easiest to understand it's definitely the one to show to your friends. Like those two other movies there are no insane shocker moments or incredible gore effects that will stick in your head forever. Rekka has almost nothing in common with Ichi or Fudoh for example so new fans of Miike's work might not get what they expect. But it has more than its share of violence just not enough to make your head spin.On it's own Rekka is definitely not a waste of time and my criticism doesn't sound fair at all. However the feeling is ruined when you've seen Agitator andor Kikoku. Seeing these movies after each other in a short span of time left me with a feeling that I got from Graveyard of Honor another MiikeTakechi product. But in that case it only took one movie to make me feel uncomfortable by giving me the same message over and over again.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like many people I was first turned onto the works of the great director Takashi Miike in the movie Ichi the killer. After viewing that film I was instantly hooked to his take no prisoners style. Takashi Miike is a man that truly stretches the boundaries of violence and audacity into an art form. Several months later I was surprised to see Deadly Outlaw Rekka sitting on the shelves of my local Best Buy. Due to the rarity of Takashi Miike's films I bought it without hesitation and I'm glad I did. Japanese film star Riki Takuechi or as i like to call him cool hair guy from Dead or Alive plays the roll of Kunisada a grizzly yakuza hell bent on revenge for the death of his boss. As the story unfolds the audience becomes ensnared in webs of love betrayal sorrow and revenge. Though lacking in the unbridled violence that originally drew me in to these kind of movies the gritty and often times zany style of Takashi Miike remains ever present. Overall Deadly Outlaw Rekka is a fantastic film that is a must have for fans of Takashi Miike or just really great action films and worthy addition to any movie collection!".

He takes the usual cliche riddled Yakuza story and turns it into something out of the ordinary. If you have seen Dead Or Alive andor Ichi The Killer you will know what I am talking about. SPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERT The film opens with a Yakuza Boss being eliminated by a couple of thugs. We find out that this is the father of cool ass kicker Riki Takeuchi. Now Takeuchi aka Kunisada is out for his own justice against the opposing Yakuza clans. There is double cross after triple cross. The great Sonny Chiba has a cameo as one of the yakuza bosses. The film does drag for about 35 minutes. However the script is interesting enough as well as the characters themselves. The final twenty minutes have to bee seen to be believed. Takeuchi and his Connected brother are a two man army as they obliterate their opponents with grenade launchers. I still don't understand the ending!??? SPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERT At the end we see the Yakuza bosses talking about the deaths of Kunisada and his connected brother. Then  something out of Star Wars!? a hologram image of Kunisada's dead father appears and says Rock N' Roll!!!!???? HUH? Anyway this being a Takashi Miike and Riki Takeuchi film I am a little bit more biased in Miike's sense of film making and I give this an eight out ten. Very cool and violent.".

Oh there's bound to be a brutal fight scene or execution around the next corner but there isn't anything that makes you care about what's going on. Okay I don't watch a Miike film for the characterisation but at least ICHI THE KILLER had tons of incident and AUDITION's slow build worked when matched with THAT ending.This one's predictable in the extreme I couldn't care less about the characters and the whole 'stone face' type of acting is just a bit dull. Miike tries to spice things up with a sex scene here and a mutilation there but it isn't enough for much of the running time I was simply bored. DEADLY OUTLAW REKKA does have the same kind of hustle and vibe as the early gangster films of Beat Takeshi but it lacks their finesse and raw power. Attempts to make it feel like an oldfashioned grindhouse movie of the 1970s don't really gel either instead this movie is both slight and forgettable.".

Moore feels shame and decides that it would be better to leave. Thus he falls in with evil toy manufacturer John Lithgow in another fine role and this is when the fun really starts.

Having viewed the movie this year 2016 I feel proud to have made a small contribution to a film that tells a timeless story with considerable integrity. David Huddleston who passed away recently was the perfect casting for Santa Claus.";

Nevertheless more and more Santa Claus The Movie fans are coming out of their shells and letting their voices be heard about director Jeannot Szwarc's delightful holiday odyssey which follows the overimaginative elf named Patch on a journey of discovery as he becomes the first among Santa's Elves to experience in depth the full spectrum of the human condition. The visual effects are quite stateoftheart given that we are talking about a movie that was made in 198485 long before computergenerated imagery ever became so much as a gleam in the eyes of those wizards at Industrial Light  Magic! Derek Meddings makes an excellent effort in supervising these spectacular sequences aided by David Lane and Roy Field he leads a team of magicians whose work is best described as  WOW!!! The performances cannot be faulted either. Dudley Moore as Patch himself conveys the spirited wonder and tragic naivete of a child just learning the dark side of play John Lithgow portraying the instrument of that dark side chomps the scenes with overobsessedness and David Huddleston radiates the wisdom of the Multiverse as the Knight of Christmas. One of the reasons I founded KringleQuest.com was to increase public awareness of the films of the Salkinds since Alexander's death nearly 7 years ago the Salkind film library  which encompasses his preSuperman films from 1945 to 1977 including the two Musketeer movies and Crossed Swords based on The Prince and the Pauper plus Supergirl the neverreleased Where is Parsifal? and of course Santa Claus The Movie are all languishing in various studio vaults throughout the world abandoned by their original copyright owners. This to me is wrong. In the United States no motion picture should be abandoned because its copyright has expired and this I fear is what is happening with the Salkind Library. Perhaps by increasing public awareness of this senseless treatment of film maybe more fans of Santa Claus The Movie will emerge and save this very special film. Which as you might expect was what I had hoped to accomplish with KringleQuest.com all along. So fellow elves anyone out there willing to lend a hand and help an Elf Without Jingles rescue a very unusual Christmas movie? I'm here if you'd like to learn more. The email address is above.

And said Bolshevik played by none other than William Hopalong Cassidy Boyd? Needless to say I had to see it.I like DeMille's silent films considerably better than his sound ones and The Volga Boatman is certainly a lovely film to look at. William Boyd and Elinor Fair look splendid the historically inaccurate but lushly gorgeous gown by Adrian are breathtaking. Communists commune White Russians waltz the night away and the Volga looks very Volgaish in spite of being in California.The movie begins with a disclaimer stating that the film takes no sides. For the most part this is true. Both sides are shown to have their heroes and villains. The problem is the behavior and motivations of the characters make the movie seem like a French Revolution film that got the wrong costumes delivered by mistake. The mob scenes in particular made me feel like I was watching a reel of Orphans of the Storm! Oh well this is DeMille.DeMille hired Russians as consultants and actors but discarded any advice that they offered on authenticity. The fact that boatman had not been used on the Volga in 50 years did not dissuade him. The fact that some modern viewers would see this movie as an authentic portrayal of Russian life is disturbing to say the least. My source by the way is Behind the Mask of Innocence by Kevin Brownlow The plot involves Feodor Boyd the titular boatman. Elinor Fair is Vera a princess engaged to marry Prince Dimitri Victor Varconi. Vera and Feodor meet by the riverbank and there is definite chemistry much to Dimitri's annoyance. When the Revolution comes Feodor rises in the ranks of the Red Army and soon finds himself in the uncomfortable position of having to execute Vera personally. What will he do? Well the movie is available on DVD so it's easy to find out.The sincerity and charm that Boyd would display so memorably as Hopalong Cassidy serve him well in this part. DeMille asks a lot of his leading men to make the sometimes very silly scripts believable must have been a job and a half. Being a DeMille leading man also required a certain amount of upper body strength. Please note the whiplash inducing spin that Boyd gives Fair before their first kiss. That's a DeMille specialty. The same technique was later used by Yul Brynner in The Ten Commandments.By the way movie buffs should look for Eugene Palette Friar Tuck in The Adventures of Robin Hood in an uncredited role. He is part of the Red Army firing squad.The Volga Boatman is a historical curio and pure brain candy. It is a fun movie to watch and it's certainly worth seeing Boyd without his cowboy hat he and Fair give rather good performances and Varconi does a good job as the morally weak Dimitri. But as for the history... Well best put that out of your mind and enjoy the ride.".

It makes quite an interesting contrast with the films made on the Russian Revolution by the great Sovietera filmmakers such as Eisenstein Dovzhenko and Pudovkin yet it would be rather unfair to compare it directly with movies that had a much different goal.DeMille's feature primarily uses the 1917 setting in Hollywood fashion simply as a fascinating background to the main humaninterest story of loyalty and love. Yet the relative lack of bias is quite apparent with both admirable characters and scoundrels being found both among the Whites and among the Reds. DeMille even unexpectedly tries his hand at comedy on a few occasions and it usually works well enough.The two main characters are very interesting and they are brought to life effectively. As Princess Vera Elinor Fair believably portrays her aristocratic poise and haughtiness while successfully showing how she could also sympathize with and admire the boatman Feodor in spite of her beliefs. As Feodor William Boyd keeps it simple but convincing making his Red hero onedimensional in personality but complex in his sense of right and wrong. The third main character Prince Dimitri is much more straightforward but Victor Varconi does well enough in bringing out the coldness that belies the weaknesses inside him.Though the story emphasizes the complicated ways that these three are brought together in the course of events it does provide some interesting glimpses into the historical setting as well. DeMille was in his element in recreating the Volga setting along the banks of the Sacramento River and that and all of the settings are used effectively. The constant use of the boatmen and their painful lot in life is an effective image for the condition of the majority of Russians under tsarist rule. All in all as long as you don't compare it with the great Russian film classics about the same era The Volga Boatman is an enjoyable movie to watch.".

Boyd as a DeMille discovery and contract player was in many of DeMille's films for his own studio after Paramount and before his 3 year stint at M.G.M.  DeMille loved Russian affectations at the time even to wearing Cossack shirts when on his country home called The Paradise Ranch. The longstanding tradition of eschewing accurate wardrobe in order to appeal to a more contemporary audience is very noticeable in this film. The designer Adrian chose or was directed to choose decidedly late 1920's fashions for this film.  These are not the high waisted hobble skirts of the period and do not resemble photographs of the women of the Russian royal family whose fashion sense seemed to be closer to the turn of the century rather than 19141918.  The scenes in which the upper class men and women are pulling the wagons through the mud in their evening clothes reveals the short hemlines and tstrap high heeled shoes so popular in the nineteentwenties.  That the women's clothes are beautiful is beside the point.  DeMille was a populist and rather liked being in the forefront of fashion so that the Volga wardrobe doesn't contribute to the realism of the film.".

Unfortunately we only read one of the best lines of dialog ever written. Despite the fact that Bill Boyd's Feodor's rich baritone voice was a generous mixture of northern Oklahoma and north Hollywood accents I enjoy imagining what he could have done with the line We've waited 500 years for freedom you can wait five minutes to die.As a devoted fan of the movies particularly movies having some historical content The Volga Boatman remains a highly appealing and watchable film for me because it focuses on timeless human relationships and not the stale political tracts which can be supplanted. In addition DeMille's technical craftsmanship is most ably demonstrated in the beautiful composition of each scene. Mr. DeMille went on to direct Technicolor extravaganza's but this handtinted silent classic is one that stands out as an example of DeMille at his cinematic best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cecil B. DeMille was a strange chappy full of contradictions. A notorious antitrade unionist and later HUAC stooge and yet certainly up until the early 1930s he held a bizarre love for Soviet Russia. The Volga Boatman is his only picture that reflects that love and is among his stranger efforts which as anyone who has seen Madam Satan or Four Frightened People will know is really saying something.The Volga Boatman is one of a number of pictures DeMille made with his own independent production company whilst on a period of absence from Paramount. It was around this period that DeMille began to lean towards the epic as his main area of expertise. Of course his run of biblical extravaganzas began at Paramount with The Ten Commandments in 1923 and there is the massive Joan of Arc in 1916 but it is in this midtolate 1920s phase that the epic became for him the norm.This all made good sense for DeMille. When it came to directing the masses few directors did it better. His crowd shots are a blend of aesthetic stylisation check out how he uses the musicians in the foreground to form a circle with the ceiling arch in the Jaroslav ballroom scene and pure realism. DeMille always humanised the crowd by dropping in closeups of individuals such as the children shown in the opening scene. His use of space is also on top form here with framing and distance showing characters' isolation or their position in the group.But in all those years of directing smallscale dramas DeMille had also honed his ability to film human relationships. Editing patterns were becoming ever more fluid anyway as silent cinema developed and DeMille had developed a knack of showing characters' views of each other and of situations without resorting to intertitles. The Volga Boatman has few words but is full of meaningful glances moody closeups and subtle gestures. A good example is the scene where the three leads first meet  all that really happens titlewise is Victor Varconi repeatedly yelling Wipe it off! but the various angles and reaction shots between the characters speak volumes and set up their relationships for the entire picture.This was DeMille's first collaboration with screenwriter Lenore J. Coffee and his first without any input from Jeanie MacPherson. If you have seen a lot of DeMille's silents there is quite a noticeable difference. Gone are MacPherson's rambling moralist narratives and ridiculous  albeit poetic  personal philosophies. Coffee while clearly not as mad as MacPherson seems rather bland by comparison and his words lack sparkle.The acting too is not so special. Elinor Fair appears completely unable to emote realistically and makes a poor lead. William Boyd is at least able to convincingly look mean and cunning but very little else. Villainously handsome Victor Varconi turns in the best performance but I have seen better from him. Meanwhile Julia Faye and Theodore Kosloff provide cheerfully hammy comic relief although the parts they have been given aren't very funny.When you look at the DeMille pictures from the early 1920s while there is sometimes good drama something appears to be missing as DeMille strives for something grander trying to shoehorn in big scenes. The Volga Boatman works because DeMille at last strikes his happy medium of showing the intense drama against the backdrop of largescale action. His direction is on fine form here and he is only let down by his collaborators. Mind you in his role as exacting and allpowerful producer DeMille could perhaps be blamed for accepting such a lifeless screenplay and cast. His poor judgement in these areas in many ways defines the style of his later pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Volga Boatman is one of the best DeMille films I have seen. The historical inaccuracy is really inconsequential. After all Braveheart was quite clearly fictionalised history and with far less excuse for being so than The Volga Boatman because it was quite simple to check the factuality of the film's incidents. Remember that when DeMille was making his film the two Russian Revolutions were less than a decade in the past. In 1926 The ultimate consequences were really not fully apparent Lenin had died and Stalin and Trotsky were still involved in a power struggle. Thus wisely DeMille does not attempt to create an historical document. Rather he uses the turmoil and tumult which was so much a part of the Russian context to create a story which is a reflection on the themes of Courage Sacrifice Love Justice Choice and Responsibility to one's values. Viewed from that perspective this film is fully successful and marvellous to watch.The acting is excellent. For me the standout performance is that of William Boyd. I never really cared for him very much as Hopalong Cassidy but here! Handsome tall muscular with deeply expressive eyes and radiating charisma he gives a performance one won't soon forget. He plays a character Feodor who could easily become a cypher instead we see a figure who rises above ideological differences and finds that his values always had a source in nobility and love. And sometimes those deep roots of character are more powerful than he expects them to be in unexpected ways.It is through his relationship with Vera Elinor Fair that he discovers these unexpected demands. Fair beautifully plays the noble and heroic Vera. One of the best moments being the scene in which Feodor is meant to execute her. Another is the parallel scene in which Feodor is to be executed. Her final choice before the Tribunal is made with dignity and compassion.Prince Dimitri Victor Varconi is the great rival of Feodor. Interestingly DeMille never turns him into a villain. In fact DeMille keeps his word. He does not take sides. Both political factions have characters who engage in brutality. Note the actions of the Red Peasants when they storm the castle of Vera's father. Shortly afterwards Dimitri's own men strip Vera and are clearly prepared to rape her before he intervenes.Marusha brilliantly played by Julia Faye demonstrates this moral ambiguity shown by the characters. She wins us with her charm early in the film when she strikes a pose on a wagon. wow! She is courageous enough to become part of Feodor's army. But she wants Vera killed She discovers Feodor's ruse to save the Princess and participates in the chase to run them down. Near the end of the film she suggests that the women be condemned to pull the barges and enjoys the contempt with which they are treated. In the end she is humiliated herself in a rather minor but embarrassing way. It's difficult not to like her even if the character is frustrating at times.Allinall this is topnotch DeMille entertainment!".

In the end she is humiliated herself in a rather minor but embarrassing way. It's difficult not to like her even if the character is frustrating at times.Allinall this is topnotch DeMille entertainment!";

	schema:reviewBody "This film's main theme is such a clich and so simple What would you do if you are told that you only have 23 months to live? How would you deal with things? Would you fight and do everything in your power to perhaps experience that curing miracle or would you accept things as a matter of course... and wait for death to come. This film really makes you think. The main character marvelously performed by Melvil Poupaud is not really a sympathetic man is he? Or is he? Aren't you master of your own life especially when you have a short time left... He obviously wishes to solve some personal problems relations with people around him which he doesn't find as they should be in an accelerated black and white way. To create something clear and defined before dieing... Obviously his life had been a mess. But relations are also about giving and taking and about accepting imperfect things in relationships. Throughout the movie you get more sympathy with Romain. The telephone call with his sister whom he had told some unkind things just before is moving. 'It isn't about you it's about me. Didn't Fassbinder tell us Each man kills the thing he loves... Do you want to protect others by not saying you are going to die... This is altruism in an egoistic way isn't it? The film is a melodrama but in my case it made me think... And that's the purpose of a good film isn't it? All the characters are well typecast and performed. At times the film is even moving but a tearjerker it never becomes... It's not a new Love Story. Romain's Pardon a sorry softly spoken with nobody around and never addressed to the person it was meant to was a moving moment in the film. Also the fact that Romain being gay and his gay life style is no theme for the plot in the film is absolutely refreshing. Homosexuality should just be one of the many facts of life in the lives of many. Joris Amsterdam".

Of course the subject of the movie saying goodbye to life isn't new neither original. But sometimes it isn't the story itself but the way it is told that makes it worthwhile. To my opinion Ozon is a very good storyteller. I think tenderness and the love for people and for life itself must have inspired him a lot. Some scene's could be seen as provocative and politically incorrect but the way they are woven into the story makes them credible and the way they are filmed makes them just beautiful.

The film follows his journey. It does so with a care and a beauty that is marked by particularly beautiful shots I would mention in particular the shots of the pink roses wilting the children in the playground reflected in the caf windows the interest in old faces and of course the devastating final scenes at the beach. The interplay between this film and Rohmer's work is fascinating recalled also through the actress Marie Riviere who stars in The Green Ray which also finishes with a sunset over a beach. Whereas Rohmer's sunset suggests hope for the future and the inherent ambiguity of the image Ozon's functions to suggest finality and closure and at the same time the fixity of the image  a photo once taken records for ever. The final moments are incredible  and by these I mean when the credits are rolling and we hear the sound of waves washing over the beach. The inevitability of death and the cycle of life are transmitted to us through sound rather than image. Ozon's oeuvre is developing in all sorts of interesting directions and this piece points again to his place not just in the contemporary French cinematic landscape but his important engagement with European cinematic heritage here Truffaut Fassbinder Varda Rohmer Bergman to name only the most obvious references.".

	schema:headline " Another Francois Ozon gem";
	schema:reviewBody "Francois Ozon is one of my favourite French directors. His artistic renditions of the human drama contribute significantly to what makes French films so worth seeing. This is his second instalment of a trilogy about death that started with the emotionally enthralling understated Under The Sand.Previously he has covered different genres like comedy 8 Women and thriller Swimming Pool. While these films have found a wider audience I find the dramatically subdued exploration of grief and mortality in Under The Sand and A Time To Leave much more interesting and satisfying.In A Time To Leave Romain finds his own way to deal with imminent death. Unlike most of his previous films Ozon uses a male protagonist. He appears to be selfish and egocentric  not overly likable. Perhaps like an essay on the human condition it is revealing to observe how he interacts with people and attempts closure on his 'final journey'.The film has a bit of a wandering Zen feel about it. There is no sentimentality and Romain does not burden anyone. It appears that he wants to tidy up loose ends before his passing in an attempt to find peace within himself.Legendary actress Jeanne Moreau playing the grandmother has as strong a screen presence as ever 55 years after her debut. It is only with her that Romain seems to open up emotionally and we get a glimpse of his warmer side. These scenes were very moving and felt like the emotional core of the film.Like Under The Sand A Time To Leave doesn't seem to be making any particular point. Neither are evangelical or proselytising a world view. Nor are they gratuitous contrived or flamboyant. Each of them is like another essay about the human condition done with great artistry. There are no grand sweeping statements  just one person's story. There is such understated confidence intelligence and skill in Ozon's direction. Highly recommended.".

They only saw the homosexuality and the nonsense story about a girl who can't have children with her husband so she asks a guest in a restaurant to have a child with her and said it was just trying to shock the visitors. But I agree with those who say it was not the main point of the movie. I think it just tried to say that these people live on our sides and that they're the same as we are.I accept for some people the movie can sound a little bit like a clich or another story about dying. But for me the feelings were different. It was interesting to see a man who bears his secret on his own because he can't open to his family and isn't brave enough to tell his boyfriend. Then he visits his grandmother and decides to tell her because as he says she's also close to death. When he's with her he opens to her and also to himself. The scene where she confesses that tonight I'd like to leave with you was the most beautiful and most emotional for me. Well the story has it's mistakes but maybe the plot is not the most important thing there. I just didn't care about what the director wanted to show but about what he's actually showed. For me it was a story about a man who goes through the first shock anger and desperation to the acceptation of the destiny with a smile on his lips.I liked the movie very much and I think the actors did an unbelievable job.".

	schema:reviewBody "time slips away and the light constantly fades... the Cure Seventeen Seconds from the eponymous album 1980.Here comes Franois Ozon once again with a longanticipated vehicle and a prickly topic which has been used countless of times in cinema with varying results a person who has an incurable disease and who's going to die soon. She's got only a few months even weeks to live. How does she react? How does she live her last moments of life? This is the thrust of Ozon's latest opus Le Temps Qui Reste 2005 and it is a remarkable movie in which Ozon eschews what could have caused the fiasco of the film pathos. There's no whiff of it in Romain's slow way towards death. According to his author it is the second opus of a trilogy begun with Sous Le Sable 2000 and which will close with a third film about the death of a child. It's true that Le Temps Qui Reste has a few common points with Sous Le Sable both end with a sequence in which the main protagonist is standing on a beach but the difference between the two films lies in the fact that in Sous Le Sable the viewer and Charlotte Rampling weren't fully sure about Bruno Cremer's death. Maybe did he abscond maybe did he leave Rampling whereas here we are absolutely sure about the terrible truth Romain is going to die in spite of the words pronounced by the doctor aiming at bringing an inkling of hope. Besides the sequence at the hospital is credible. A doctor has to tell his patient that there is a glimmer of hope although he pertinently knows the tragic exit. The sequence which comes after where we can see Romain sitting on a bench looking around him also rings true.So Romain is a young photograph in his early thirties. He's homosexual and lives with his lover in a quite comfortable flat. His life shows all the signs of professional and sentimental success. But one day everything falls apart when one day he learns that he has a generalized cancer. Where Ozon retains the attention is how he shoots the evolution of his main character. The author of the fabulous 8 Femmes 2002 has once said that he didn't care about the New Wave although he puts Eric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol in his straitjacket of favorite filmmakers. Well I don't care for it either apart from notable exceptions. Among these exceptions there's Clo De 5  7 1961 by Agns Varda probably one of the most accessible movies of this movement in spite of the gravity of the topic. The topic is the same as Le Temps Qui Reste and the psychological evolution of Clo is more or less the same as Romain's. Ingoing at the beginning of their tragedy mature at the end as death comes closer. In Romain's case Ozon presents him as an obnoxious brazen and egocentric young man who only lives for his job. Then he has an argument with his family an evening the sequence of the dinner is quite incommoding and then with his lover. He decides to visit his grandmother Jeanne Moreau and his stay at her house constitutes the crux of the film. He finds himself with a person who lives the same situation as him. He tells to her because me and you we are close to death. In Varda's piece of work it was a young soldier Antoine who helped Clo to accept her disease and so made her fearless facing death because he saw death very close to him too the context was in 1961 during the Algerian war a dirty war the equivalent of Vietnam for the USA. In Ozon's flick Romain's stay at her grandmother's altered him he tries to reconcile himself with his family his lover and is even ready to make a baby to a family the young woman is played by Valeria BruniTedeschi who held the main role in Ozon's precedent film 5x2 2004. After that Romain seems to have become another man he has accepted to belong to the world that surrounds him and appears to be at ease and relieved amid it see the last almost timeless sequences when he's by the sea. So if the first part of the film was disturbing the second one has a placating whiff. Romain's visit to his grandmother is the central and crucial moment between the two. Ozon's camera knows how to capture the situation the feeling the gesture the look and the director has a real genius to let the what is left unsaid show through.As Romain slowly but surely makes his way towards the adamant death there are flashes of his childhood which arrive in his mind. Maybe they help him to accept his own death. Moreover it is often said that old people behave like children. In a way Romain also behaves like a child at least in the beginning of the movie then there's still time to become a grownup.Le Temps Qui Reste is a small cracker which maybe won't cater for all tastes because of its thorny topic. But it has the merit to put aside formulaic or corny ingredients. As for Ozon more power to him although it's very likely that like some of his fellows Patrice Leconte he'll still have to wait for a long time to receive the honors he deserves".

So if the first part of the film was disturbing the second one has a placating whiff. Romain's visit to his grandmother is the central and crucial moment between the two. Ozon's camera knows how to capture the situation the feeling the gesture the look and the director has a real genius to let the what is left unsaid show through.As Romain slowly but surely makes his way towards the adamant death there are flashes of his childhood which arrive in his mind. Maybe they help him to accept his own death. Moreover it is often said that old people behave like children. In a way Romain also behaves like a child at least in the beginning of the movie then there's still time to become a grownup.Le Temps Qui Reste is a small cracker which maybe won't cater for all tastes because of its thorny topic. But it has the merit to put aside formulaic or corny ingredients. As for Ozon more power to him although it's very likely that like some of his fellows Patrice Leconte he'll still have to wait for a long time to receive the honors he deserves";

Personally would love it more if there are shots of the photos taken by Romain as he went along in the process of making peace with himself edited in the opening shots of the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Francois Ozon's wonderful new film is remarkably free of either sentimentality or despair despite dealing with the most pessimistic of subjects that of a young man dying of inoperable cancer. Romain is an extremely handsome and successful young photographer who happens to be gay though Ozon never makes his sexuality a key issue. At the film's outset he is told he is dying of cancer. His initial response is to tell noone and to lash out first at his sister and her children and then at his lover. We know nothing of Romain before the diagnosis except for some flashbacks to his childhood other than that his behavior is almost certainly out of character. It is after a visit to his paternal grandmother a superb cameo by Jeanne Moreau that he begins to find in himself an acceptance of his impending death and a reconnection to the world he will soon leave.Romain is beautifully played by Melvil Poupard who is virtually never off the screen. Ozon minutely observes Romain's every waking moment and Poupard responds with a wonderfully frank and ultimately very moving performance. As the film progresses he seems as if he is about to dissolve before our eyes as if he is going to fade into oblivion. There are wonderful little touches. With his small digital camera Romain records images from his life almost always unbeknownst to the subject. Is he doing this for himself or for those who will be left behind? Or both? He says he does not like children yet children and childhood seem to be a recurring motif in his final days. He constantly sees and interacts with himself as a child. Of course all of this has the potential for bleakness or cloying sentimentality. What is remarkable is Ozon's ability to steer clear of both. Nor is the film a cold and clinical portrait of a dying man but a warm sometimes funny and always touching affirmation of a life.".

When we first meet him he is making disparaging remarks about what he thinks about the clothes he has been commissioned to photograph. He is also seen with Sasha his gay lover during a sexual encounter where Romain inflicts pain to his partner. During a family dinner with his parents and his unmarried sister Romain is downright rude and cruel to Sophie a sibling he had loved dearly during their childhood.When Romain collapses during a shoot he is taken to a hospital where a doctor has the results of the tests that were performed. It's clear there is something wrong with this young man. The doctor tells him about the inoperable tumor that is killing him and can't be operated. Romain's life begins spinning out of control as he must face a moment that will not take long to take his life.Sasha leaves him because he can't take the abuse and pain being inflicted upon him by Romain. The job in Tokyo collapses and Romain must start taking stock of his life and what is going to happen to him. Since he doesn't tell his parents and business associates he decides to go and see his grandmother. Although the news devastates the older woman she shows an inner strength as she doesn't want Romain to see the way the news has affected her.Before arriving at the grandmother's place Romain stops at a rest stop where a kind young woman Jany engages him in conversation. She invites to visit again on his way back. During his return trip to Paris he stops on the opposite side of the highway where the husband of Jany works. Jany happens to pass by and goes to Romain. She has a proposition for the young man. Her husband is sterile and he can't give her a child. Jany proposes a no string attached sexual encounter with Romain who doesn't agree to anything. Later on while in Paris and watching his health deteriorate Romain has second thoughts and goes back to meet Jany with a counter proposal one in which he wants Bruno the husband to participate as well.Francois Ozon does it again. He does wonders with this new film that in a way as others have commented reminds us of Agnes Varda's film Cleo de 5 a 7 in which a young woman must reflect on her life as the news of having contracted a killer disease will end her life. Romain too must take into consideration what he has done with his existence up to this point as he tries to make amends that unfortunately come too late to ask forgiveness to the same people that he has hurt with his nasty attitude. The only way he can redeem himself is by agreeing to give Jany what she wants most in life a child that will be perhaps the only positive thing Romain will have done in his life.Mr. Ozon gets a splendid performance out of Melvil Poupaud who as Romain makes a tremendous impression on us. His Romain goes from arrogant to being humble and kind as he watches his life come to an end. Jeanne Moreau plays Romain's grandmother with restraint. Ms. Moreau's character shows a strong woman whose life is near the end see her young grandson in quite a predicament. Valeria Bruni Tedeschi who was seen in Mr. Ozon's 5X2 makes a valuable contribution.The hypnotic musical score serves the movie well. We hear themes from Charpentier Arvo Part and Valentin Silvestroy in the background blending effortlessly with the action. The distinguished camera work of Jeanne Lapoirer is also an asset. Ultimately Mr. Ozon continues to amaze us with his vision and with his style.".

	schema:reviewBody "LE TEMP QUI RESTE Written and Directed by Francois OzonTo a great extent the premise of French director Francois Ozon's latest film LE TEMP QUI RESTE reads like a daytime drama storyline. An attractive 31yearold photographer is told he has an extreme cancer that has spread through his body. It cannot be removed and though treatment is an option he does not have a strong chance of survival. He has but a few months left to live. What elevates this film above the potential for clichd melodrama is the way the photographer Romain played by Melvil Poupaud reacts to this news. He has little time to resolve his life and relationships. He has little time to fully embrace who he is. Yet he does not make peace with everyone in his life one by one. Instead he avoids the whole damn thing. Only as he avoids he manages to find the foundation of these relationships and begins to understand their significance how they have helped shape the man he is. He puts his life into perspective his way and finds out that all this time despite his selfish existence he has also been a part of something much bigger.LE TEMP QUI RESTE is thankfully brief as no one wants to spend too much time watching someone die. It does however make the most of the time it has. When Romain first learns the news he avoids sharing it with anyone in his life from his family to his boyfriend to his employer. As he sits at a family dinner and people ask what is new in his life it is painful to watch him say nothing especially as he continues to withdraw. Poupaud's performance humbles Romain as he goes from cocky and assured to constantly being overwhelmed by his own grief. He looks afraid to say that he is dying to make it real to place that pain on anyone else. Instead he buries it and suffers silently. You want so much for him to reach out to the people who clearly love him that when he doesn't you just want to wrap your own arms around him. When he finally does share the news his choice of confidante is calculated. He chooses to tell someone who can understand because as Romain so plainly puts it she too will be dying soon.Along with Romain the viewer has some resolution some peace brought back to a time of chaos. Romain spends so much time convincing himself that the people around him do not need nor deserve to know about his condition because their relationships are so complicated. Only his solitude brings him the clarity necessary to remember how these relationships began. More importantly these memories are the ones he associates most cleanly with nave unchecked happiness. With death imminently waiting for him the search for happiness that he gave up on is rejuvenated when he sees how close he was to it all the while. Romain's memories come to him at random moments and their nature demonstrates the talent of Ozon as writer and director. They are simple memories that may have seemed all too simple at the time they took place but these memories went on to bring Romain closer to others and himself. And as the memories come more frequently he learns to integrate them into his current reality. Thus when he goes he goes having lived a short but full life.Death is a construct an inevitability a mystery a fear to face. In LE TEMP QUI RESTE it is also a process that is nothing more than the last clue to understanding your life. In Romain's final moments death becomes necessary to complete the journey a journey that would mean nothing at all if it weren't ending to begin with.".

	onyx:emotionText "LE TEMP QUI RESTE Written and Directed by Francois OzonTo a great extent the premise of French director Francois Ozon's latest film LE TEMP QUI RESTE reads like a daytime drama storyline. An attractive 31yearold photographer is told he has an extreme cancer that has spread through his body. It cannot be removed and though treatment is an option he does not have a strong chance of survival. He has but a few months left to live. What elevates this film above the potential for clichd melodrama is the way the photographer Romain played by Melvil Poupaud reacts to this news. He has little time to resolve his life and relationships. He has little time to fully embrace who he is. Yet he does not make peace with everyone in his life one by one. Instead he avoids the whole damn thing. Only as he avoids he manages to find the foundation of these relationships and begins to understand their significance how they have helped shape the man he is.

The naturalistic performances for one capture the audiences' attention and stay far away from Hollywood clichs. The frequent flashbacks to Romain's childhood add a beautiful dreamy atmosphere to the film and furthermore Ozon's decision to be as politically incorrect as possible is very welcome.

	schema:reviewBody "Francois Ozon continues his exploration of death in LE TEMPS QUI RESTE TIME TO LEAVE with somewhat disappointing results. It all began with SOUS LE SABLE UNDER THE SAND where his leading lady played by Charlotte Rampling was a sympathetic character ripping apart at the seams by not accepting the disappearance and death of her husband with whom she had a clearly loving relationship I was given the chance to mourn with her and feel her impossible pain. Moments of imagined sexuality were also especially heightened because I could believe she could mentally displace herself to an extent that both a potential lover and her ghost of a husband could be with her at the same time in an unlikely menage a trois. And that final scene on the beach as she ran towards an inaccessible image was emotionally heartshattering I thought I had seen the most devastating scene ever filmed.In his most recent film Romain Melvil Poupaud a fashion photographer in the vein of the David Hemmings character of BLOW UP faints after a particularly unpleasant photo shoot. He thinks he has AIDS the doctor informs him he has a malignant cancer and has a short time to live  survival is less than 5 . From then on Romain  already a difficult character  proceeds to viciously alienate his sister by insulting her in a family dinner his lover whom he first attempts to strangle in a heightened moment of sex and later throws out of their house with no explanation and goes into a self destructive rampage in a nightclub. The only person whom he opens up to is his grandmother Jeanne Moreau who takes him in and briefly becomes a shoulder for him to cry on. Plus there is a pretty waitress Valeria BruniTedeschi who approaches him with an unusual proposal.It's this proposal  one involving a threesome not too different than the one seen in SOUS LE SABLE except for the fact that this one is real and does culminate in an uncomfortable climax  that allows Romain to commit an act of kindness. Even so this act is rather brittle  he leaves his entire estate to his future son and in the process apologizes sort of to both his exlover and sister  but never does he confront his issue head on. Ozon has one too many shots of Poupaud wallowing in selfpity banging his head against a wall and staring out in silence. Again because his character is such a louse it's too difficult to care of his fate even at the very end when the sun goes down and he goes to sleep... so to speak.LE TEMPS QUI RESTE may sound like a bad movie but it's not. It's almost always gorgeous to look at and has a daring sex scene that would make anyone blush. Flashcuts in which Romain sees his younger self are one of the film's best moments because they recall a time when Romain himself was just an innocent kid beginning to live. Other than that this is one of the many gay movies that veer too close to restrained maudlin as its lead character goes down unnoticed and uncared for. On the plus side it's a quick flick  under 80 minutes not including credits  and doesn't linger too much in the schmaltz that would have made it a DARK VICTORY type of weepie.".

Sasha is gone Romain is growing more unwell and washes down his pills with vodka. There is a slight rapprochement with his sister with Sasha even with Jany and her sterile husband. He shaves his head and grows disturbingly thin memories of himself as a child haunt Romain yet things are more transgressive than solemn and one has the impression Ozon doesn't quite know where to go with this how to carry it to the end.

What should have been a film worthy to follow Under the Sand is really an embarrassing failure for Ozon.Firstly the film isn't that cinematic. Ozon is fixated on closeups which belong to TV soapoperas rather than widescreen French cinema. The use of music is also obtrusive. We don't really care for the dying Romain. We may feel pity for him but his stubbornness and arrogance make him an unsympathetic figure. Yes he is an antihero but it feels like a French clich. Ozon also cuts away from emotive scenes as if they embarrass this film's high art cinema credentials. The reality is Ozon is afraid his material too sentimental.The film's 77 minute length also glosses over many characters. Romain's mother is not really given a chance to show her depth. Moreau's grandmother role feels like the typical French diva. She brings too much baggage to the role and submerges Romain's presence in their scenes.But perhaps the biggest problem of the film is the use of clichs. The subplot of the waitress and her husband is cringeworthy in its soapoperatic naffness and I was amazed Ozon even contemplated this strain. I also felt the main premise of the story was unoriginal  the life affirming nature of heterosexuality. Even the ending which recalls Sand and 5x2 is a clich with the setting sun suggesting death. A film that should never have been done but perhaps a revealing insight into Ozon's eccentricity. All in all a sombre souffl.".

	schema:headline " New age teen comedy that knocks it out of the park.";
	schema:reviewBody "Orange County is a predictable new age teen comedy. Then why is it so great?Southern California surferdude Shaun Brumbder is all about surfing and partying until one of his good friends dies in a surfing accident and Shaun begins to question the point of his life which is all surfing and partying. Then he finds a book that changes his life and he decides he wants to become a writer. The problem? He lives in the rich LA suburban community of Orange County where people are more obsessed with pop culture and themselves than being happy and Shaun feels he needs to get out to go become a writer and study under his favorite author at Stanford University. which is about 6 hours north of where he livesAgain why is this great? First and foremost we have the script. It's smart but still wacky as a teen comedy needs to be. The characters aren't nitwits wander around aimlessly or purposely insult themselves by being complete morons. There's no pointless wandering for a car or bathing in urine. It knows what it is a teen comedy but it's smart enough to know it doesn't have to be grossly offensive or incredibly stupid to be funny. The story has a heart and the wacky antics all support it.Next is the cast. Without the perfect cast this movie could've been a dud. The main character is played by Colin Hanks son of Tom Hanks in his first major starring role and he nails it. He plays the smart surferdude with a dream perfectly and he deals and reacts to his environment and the rest of the superb cast as he should. If you really watch you can find a little bit of his father in him but mostly he is his own actor and a good one at that. He's very natural playing a realistic character. His girlfriend is played by Schuyler Fisk daughter of Sissy Spacek and she's a very positive caring California girl. Her character wasn't as strong as Hanks' but she was mainly meant to be more of his sidekick than counterpart. Jack Black was the reason I saw this movie in theaters and he was as awesome as usual up until recently where's he has just been taking whatever is thrown at him seemingly as the unmotivated stoner older brother Hanks' character Shaun doesn't want to be. He's the worst example in the world and is ultimately part of Shaun's motivation to not become like him. Next are Catherine O'Hara and John Lithgow who both have seemingly come into their prime closer to middle age. They play off of each other wonderfully as Shaun's selfish parents that live the rich LA life and feel like their son owes them something. Chevy Chase is great as the school principle even though the role is small he gets a laugh or two as he is bound to do. The teacher Mr. Burke is played by Mike White who strangely hits home as a California high school teacher more into pop culture than teaching and he also wrote the fantastic script. Also he is just another character in the long line of people hold Shaun down. Leslie Mann and George Murdock have funny bit parts as Shaun's stepparents who are also completely out of touch with the world. Kevin Kline has a great bit part as the author who inspires Shaun to become a writer and tells him exactly what he wants to hear.After that this is just quality filmmaking by good people. Jake Kasdan son of Lawrence Kasdan directed this and his style shines all the way through. I first became a fan of his after his work on the TV show Freaks and Geeks which is rather similar to this movie in that it deals with the wackiness of teen life in a knowing way. The writer Mike White also wrote a few episodes of Freeks and Geeks which if you haven't seen I highly suggest you do as it just hit DVD. Kasdan knows where to put the laughs but he also knows how to moderate them and not make it a wacky teen orgy fest like the American Pie movies which are motivated only by teen libidos rather than real ambitions. The movie has a good story and it is well told. In the end there is nothing groundbreaking in Orange County. It's a pretty straightforward teen movie with a realistic plot and great performances. With another American Pietype cast with emphasis on the goofiness this movie would've been a lowgrade teen sex flick. Instead we have a real story about ambition and teen life with a few falls off of roofs and vases falling on heads. 810".

To be honest I had little faith in Jake Kasdan after Zero Effect which had Zero Effect on me but this movie shows he has a real sense of humor and he balances it perfectly with outrageous characters and an untypically goodnatured comedy plot.Shaun Brumner Colin Hanks in a wacky performance is refused entry to Stanford University because his dunderheaded College Counsellor mailed them the wrong the transcripts. He recruits his slobbish brother an even wackier Jack Black and his girlfriend to help him in increasingly desperate and farfetched methods of convincing Stanford to reconsider. It may sound like a dumb story but the characters and situations surrounding it provoke the maximum amount of laughter.The two leads are particularly impressive and show natural comic genius that makes me beg for more from these characters. Keep a look out for loads of cameos from Chevy Chase Harold Ramis Ben Stiller and Kevin Kline. And it's loads better than that crappy O.C. TV show.The DVD is in 1.781 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The extras are great with a commentary from Kasdan deleted scenes which actually should have stayed in the movie and loads of TV spots with scenes especially created. You must get this. Everybody needs to laugh and laugh you will.".

The movie has its share of ridiculous overthetop gags A dean of admissions high on ecstasy for example but it's far more interested in its characters than its jokes a refreshing change of pace for this type of movie.  The material's supported by some very good performances  especially from leads Colin Hanks and Jack Black.Hanks plays Shaun a high school senior who desperately wants to escape his horrible upper middle class life in Orange County for literary pursuits under his favorite writer Marcus Skinner who is a professor at Stanford University.  But his guidance counselor Lily Tomlin botches his application leaving Shaun relying on the assistance of his stoner brother Lance Black and his selfish father John Lithgow.You have no doubt heard that Colin Hanks is the son of famous acting father Tom.  Even if connections got him the job you cannot deny that he puts in a strong lead performance Even if it does have some echoes of his dad's likeable everyman persona.  Comedy stars like Catherine O'Hara Chevy Chase Garry Marshall all put it nice small pieces but it is Jack Black who owns most of the funniest moments in the film.  His mere presence in a scene can make it funny often he brings out laughs with a look or a eyebrow twitch.The film gets a little sappy and formulaic as it heads toward its conclusion Shaun's reaction when he meets his hero is spoton but their conversation about his story feels wrong and the inevitable ending is what you pretty much expect as soon as that initial rejection letter arrives at Shaun's door.  Professor Skinner put it best My one complaint  You need an ending.Orange County needed a stronger more unusual ending to compliment the offbeat but very enjoyable vibe the rest of the of the movie gives off. Still I found myself completely entertained until the end and left really appreciating the fine writing and acting and even wishing the movie was a little longer.

Sometimes you just need those though. The people I work with told me that this was a pretty stupid movie and it is. But I think people shouldn't be in a serious mood for this movie. For an intelligent comedy or a good movie kind of day no. This is not the movie for you but if you need a meltdown after a hard day then by all means give this movie a chance. It's really not that bad and you get more than a few laughs. But still if I were Colin Hank's character I think I still would've wanted to go to Standford. D 710".

Along the way this desire i.e. the plot is outshined by the wacky sidecharacters including two Beavis and Buttheadish surfer pals a drunk mother Catherine O'Hara married to a crippled old man a selfish father John Lithgow married to a gorgeous young trophy and a stoner brother played by Jack Black who's not in the movie as much as is promoted  all vying to outdo each other on screen. When the main character  played by bland Colin Hanks son of Tom  finally arrives at the college of his dreams within ten minutes he's accidentally given the dean of admissions a portly Harold Ramis enough X to blind a horse and to top it off his zany druggedout brother using every stoner clich in the book including the usual WOW! burns the admissions building to the ground. Nothing really matters at this point and yet we have another drawnout and totally useless halfanhour to go. All the things that should have been peripheral eccentricities which end up leaping to the foreground of every scene are symptoms of that disease I already mentioned Anything Goes... Which can be as in this case fatal. That is without that one cure substance... Something this movie has very little of.".

You know how ads nowadays tend to give away all of the jokes?  Not this one.  And for two reasons  1 there are very few jokes and 2 most scenes in the ads aren't even in the movie I'm this guy...I'm not getting into your college... You have to make love to the camera like 'Hey Stanford what's up? You want some of this? You know you do' etc.  not in the movie!The ad campaign makes you think that this is a comedic romp about a kid trying to get into college and the slacker brother who helps along the way. The two could have been a great team Colin Hanks as the straight man Jack Black as the character he is.  But this was not a comedy.  This was heartwarming pablum masquerading as entertainment.Everything comes together in the end in the most predictable of ways. Everyone learns a valuable lesson the sick are healed the heavens part and the soundtrack is on sale at your local record store.  And that's what really matters now isn't it?  I won't give anything away though because the plot will reveal itself immediately.You need to know this though  the movie was written by Mike White.  At first you might think Chuck and Buck...critical praise...independent film.  But he also wrote Dawson's Creek and the film Dead Man on Campus.  And it shows.And as bizarre as this is the song Butterfly by Crazy Town was featured three times with no explanation.  First you have a scene break and suddenly there are these teen movie cheerleaders doing a choreographed dance to the song all looking into the camera like a music video as if to say I want you now 15 year old in the audience.  I was put into this movie to distract you from this films many faults.Later Colin's girlfriend is singing the song to herself with her headphones on in a scene that was only put in the movie to introduce a dog following the formulaic nature of the film the producers must have said people loved the dog in There's Something About Mary... we need a crazy dog too.And lastly Colin meets a new girl who invites him to the obligatory college party. Suddenly Butterfly begins to play and she and her friends go nuts screaming it's our song!  They proceed to do the same choreographed dance as the cheerleaders looking seductively into the camera.  And you watch this and ask yourself why?  What does this have to do with the movie? It's clearly an attempt to sell this song as the lead single of the film.I'm thinking of writing Jack Black to get my 6 back.  He got 2 million for this pile of garbage.  He can afford it.".

Cameos Lily Tomlin Chevy Chase Harold Ramis Ben Stiller Kevin Kline  Dir Jake KasdanNepotism runs rampant  and guiltily so  as does a smorgasbord of bigtime cameos by an incredibly eclectic assortment of onscreen talent in this hysterically funny comedy the first of the new year and easily so far the first mustsee.First things first yes the film stars Tom Hanks' son Colin best known for his stint on tv's Roswell and in one of his dad's Band of Brothers episodes Sissy Spacek's daughter Schuyler and is directed by filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan's son Jake but that shouldn't be a mitigating factor since all three have established their careers already and acquit themselves beautifully here in this rambunctiously outrageous comedy.Colin who has some uncanny characteristics if not his spitting image of his dad stars as Sean Brumder  a beleaguered high school senior who's life is in turnaround in the titular zone of California's L.A. community where he discovers that surfing the good life isn't all that it's cracked up to be especially after one of his good friends drowns in a surfing accident in a tsunami of Perfect Storm dimensions! Sean's wakeup call comes about when he unearths literally a paperback copy of Straight Jacket a Catcher in The Ryeish novel about the teenage condition that he absorbs wholeheartedly to the conclusion that becoming a writer will be his salvation. Sean makes it his life's work to get the hell out of the weighted down idiocy and primping caricatures of his current existence in high school with its share of bitchy cheerleaders i.e. the Gina Gershon lite yet totally sexy hottie Pope  burnouts and airheaded faculty members White who wrote the witty screenplays costars as Sean's literature teacher who believe Shakespeare adaptations to include Gladiator among other mistakes. His solace and key to escape is applying to Stanford University that should be aced with his impeccable transcripts he enlists his guidance counselor Tomlin in a dithering comic display of forgetfulness who unbeknownst to him fails to submit his resume correctly. Sean's homelife only adds to his misery.  His older brother Lance the always welcome breath of anarchy Black having a ball in sloth here a perpetually stoned sloven couch potato and his besotted slattern mom Cindy the wonderful O' Hara who is divorced from his moneyhungry dad Bud Lithgow as an indifferent insufferable stuffed shirt and married to the elderly invalid Bob Beugler Murdock.  The only supportive one he can rely on is his girlfriend Ashley Fisk who shares her mom's freckles and sweet optimism an environmentalist granola and sandals type neohippie who wants to study in one of the community colleges instead causing some unwarranted grief for Sean to overcome as well. When Sean discovers he's been turned down by Stanford due to his paperwork insufficiently forwarded he attempts several times to rectify the job and each time with escalating daisy chain of horrifyingly funny and outlandish sequence of events largely due to the well meaning but idiotic Lance.The film works on a layered balance of clever dialogue an engaging lead a vastly talented ensemble of characters that must be seen to be believed and a who's who of comic talent shining brightly in this highly engaging comedy of errors.  Hanks shares his pop for gift in becoming apoplectic and channels him with his high voice in panic mode and on occasion resembles him in odd angles here and there.  Black showcases his heir to the throne of slobswithheartsofgold as Lance arguably the funniest stoner since Sean Penn's Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High with his unkempt hair Nicholsonian eyebrows at full tilt and the body of Belushi via an Old Testament prophet in this latest incarnation of Gen X seediness.  The laughs are plentiful and often come out of nowhere. White's screenplay is sneaky in its attacks and one liners Lithgow calling his ex Coyote Ugly in one quick breath established a slew of laughter in the audience I attended and Kasdan's assured yet unassuming camerawork allows slapstick on the peripheral  often outoffocus to eventually take over the proceedings at hand. It helps that both White and Kasdan collaborated before on the late greatly lamented tv sitcom Freaks  Geeks. A cash crop in a new year is a promising sign for comedy to come down the pike in quite some time.".

When Sean discovers he's been turned down by Stanford due to his paperwork insufficiently forwarded he attempts several times to rectify the job and each time with escalating daisy chain of horrifyingly funny and outlandish sequence of events largely due to the well meaning but idiotic Lance.The film works on a layered balance of clever dialogue an engaging lead a vastly talented ensemble of characters that must be seen to be believed and a who's who of comic talent shining brightly in this highly engaging comedy of errors.  Hanks shares his pop for gift in becoming apoplectic and channels him with his high voice in panic mode and on occasion resembles him in odd angles here and there.  Black showcases his heir to the throne of slobswithheartsofgold as Lance arguably the funniest stoner since Sean Penn's Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High with his unkempt hair Nicholsonian eyebrows at full tilt and the body of Belushi via an Old Testament prophet in this latest incarnation of Gen X seediness.  The laughs are plentiful and often come out of nowhere. White's screenplay is sneaky in its attacks and one liners Lithgow calling his ex Coyote Ugly in one quick breath established a slew of laughter in the audience I attended and Kasdan's assured yet unassuming camerawork allows slapstick on the peripheral  often outoffocus to eventually take over the proceedings at hand. It helps that both White and Kasdan collaborated before on the late greatly lamented tv sitcom Freaks  Geeks. A cash crop in a new year is a promising sign for comedy to come down the pike in quite some time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Shaun Brumder Colin Hanks is an abnormally bright child. A kid whose schoolwork comes naturally to him and grades were never something to sweat over. But instead of trying to lead an ambitious life Shaun chooses to spend his days surfing and hanging out with his pals. But when his best friend Lonny is killed in a surfing accident Shaun contemplates if this direction is the best one to pursue. He later discovers a novel written by a man named Marcus Skinner on the beach one day reads it cover to cover and loves every minute of it. Upon reading it a dozen more times and practicing writing similar stories on his own he realizes that he has a talent for writing and ultimately that's what he wants to become.Shaun's homelife is a rather strange one. His parents are divorced with his mother Catherine O'Hara being a sensitive needy woman and his father John Lithgow a selfish and unruly cad. Shaun's brother is Lance Jack Black a portly stoner who is rarely seen fully clothed. Lance continues to offer advice to Shaun which he will inherently disregard as rambling with no meaning yet this isn't one of those stories where the dopey character may actually be smarter than we believe. He's just dumb.Our hero's dream however is to get accepted to Stanford and major in journalism. His girlfriend the neighborhood activist Ashley Schuyler Fisk is all support but his chances seemingly plummet downward when his guidance counselor sends the wrong transcript to Stanford. Instead of the bright and dedicated student they should receive the school accepts some ne'erdowell stoner who applied on a whim.Orange County follows Shaun as he tries in every which way to get accepted to Stanford and pursue a life of intellect and creativity. One thing that becomes the top priority on his list is escaping the inherently listless and seemingly mundane town of Orange County where nobody takes anything with an ounce of seriousness and everyone seems to be selfindulgent and careless.This is a film with a big agenda a clear heart but an often misunderstood soul mainly because its headliner Jack Black doesn't deliver the laughs you would expect. Orange County is not an energetic highoctane romp but a sweet and endearing character study that is equal parts sly comedy and equal parts dramatic and deep. A scene comes early on in the film where Shaun is wasting away in a class and his teacher is asking the students if they know anyone who would be interested in speaking to the school about personal experiences. Shaun proposes a writer who has just received a high honor but is quickly oneupped by another classmate who has connections to Brittney Spears. This scene illustrates so discretely and subtly how motivated and turned on we get as a society by popularity and publicity rather than true talent and admiration.Colin Hanks an actor still searching for that breakout role handles the task here beautifully even with the challenge and notable burden of carrying a lion's weight of a film on his back. He's no idiot. His character rarely misses a beat and is a calming and simple pleasure to endure. So is his brother despite his slow uninspiring persona. Orange County has an indescribable beauty and charm to its screenplay one that offers an experience that is fresh and viable and definitely unconventional.Starring Colin Hanks Jack Black Schuyler Fisk Catherine O'Hara John Lithgow and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Jake Kasdan.".

John Lithgow looked like he was physically in pain while delivering his lines. Some of it could be attributed to having a son like Lance but I think he may have realized how bad this one was while he was performing it.  The one bright spot may have been the surprise at seeing Ben Stiller as a LAFD uniform.  A pretty small part and definitely not enough to save this flop. No spoilers here  I left with about half an hour left and snuck across the hall to watch the ending of The Royal Tenenbaums now THAT movie looks good.  I can only imagine that the prep and the schlep realize that the brotherly bond is stronger than anything.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Freak actually pulled off some outlandish and wholly unbelievable scheme to get his lil Geek bro into Stanford.In my humble opinion don't waste 2 hours of your life on this hokey garbage.  If you're looking to find a piece of work that director Jake Kasdan could be proud of try Zero Effect.  And if you're looking to see a better display of our hero Jack Black's acting talents.

I think Colin Hanks is an excellent actor I have no idea why he has all but disappeared in the last 10 years and does a bang up job of being the one kid in school who actually cares about his education all the while being pulled away by his numbskull surfer buddies. Another of the cast who seems to have disappeared is Schuylar Fisk who plays Shaun's girlfriend Ashley. Ashley is the overly positive sweetheart girlfriend who will support Shaun through thick and thin. This is honestly one of Jack Black's funniest performances. He plays Shaun's druggie dead beat brother and when he gets mixed up in Shaun's quest for Stanford hilarity compounds!

	schema:reviewBody "Zapped with Scott Baio borrowed from The Exorcist and Carrie and hordes of other films in the horror genre. The sequel tends to go in a different direction borrowing from teen comedies like Revenge Of The Nerds Some Kind Of Wonderful and Teen Wolf. The outcome is surprisingly better.Similar premise as Revenge Of The Nerds finds a group of nerdy Science Club members being muscled out of their giant Science lab by the jocky Key Club members. The Key's want a place to party and the Science lab is just big enough to accommodate their needs. A hitch arises when the new kid in school Kevin Mathews Todd Eric Andrews a sortof outcast jock persuades the Science Club members not to give in. The rivalry comes to a head when the two clubs face off in an event called The Penguin Run.'In the middle of all this rehashed material emerges a formulaic but sweet love story. This is the main reason I found the film so appealing. Kelli WilliamsThe Practice plays Lucy a shy kindhearted but nerdy Science Club member who falls in love with Kevin on the first day of school.  Kevin spends so much time chasing Amanda a beautiful Key Club member that he doesn't notice Lucy's subtle advances. When Lucy attempts to pour her heart out her awkward insecurities doesn't allow for the words to come the way she intended Before you came here all I cared about was studying and now...' Needless to say Kevin chooses the more confident Amanda. Heartbroken Lucy soon distances herself from him. It is only then that Kevin notices just how beautiful the less attractive girl is.The only reference to the original Zapped comes with the discovery of prune juice bottles stored inside the Science lab wall. Inside the bottles is the formula which gave Baio telekinesis in the original. Kevin Mathews uses the formula to help win The Penguin Run' among other things. Zapped Again doesn't get bogged down in the implications of having telekinesis the way the original film did. It's more like a background thought in this one.Despite what some reviews say about Zapped Again it is not an overtly sexual movie. The amount of nudity in Again equals about one half of a second of screen time. Watch for Linda Blair Lyle Alzado and Karen Black as teachers.".

	schema:headline " It keeps you reasonably entertained for 90 minutes which is its purpose";
	schema:reviewBody "The only reason I watched Zapped Again was because I had again watched the original Zapped! after 19 years see my review for Zapped!. From some of the reviews in video books and on the IMDb I was prepared for an unmitigated disaster. Surprisingly I found myself reasonably entertained for an hour and a half.First of all I should say that Zapped Again isn't a great movie. Its origins and status as a low budget directtovideo movie clearly show. The plot is very superficial the constant double entendres especially the wiener jokes get a little annoying and the standupforyourfriendsanddon'tgowiththepopularcrowd moral that pops up in every teen film has been conveyed much more effectively. Even the special effects are worse than the original Zapped! which actually came out seven years earlier.But in spite of all of this I didn't think this was half bad probably because I went in with lowered expectations. One reason was because the movie doesn't rely on strong profanity sex scenes or grossout scenes to entertain its target audience the way so many other teen movies do. In fact this is basically a PGrated movie with some nude scenes incongruously thrown injust like the original Zapped!. I'm no prude and I have to agree with the reviewer who said that the movie is gosh darn wholesome but not all moviesor even all teen moviesrequire racy elements. Maybe this IS too much like Saved by the Bell but it does have PGrated material and those nude scenes the only reason why this is rated R.I should devote a separate paragraph to Kelli Williams who plays the hero's love interest by the way her mother Shannon Wilcox plays the hero's mom in the opening scenes. I had never heard of her before watching Zapped Again I never watch TV so I hadn't even seen her on The Practice but let me tell you she helps this movie immeasurably. You see her character is supposed to be a science nerd just like Felice Schachter in the original Zapped but Kelli lights up the movie every time she appears onscreen. Not only is she the perfect sweet nice girl I always had a weakness for those characters but she plays this part without overacting or resorting to caricature she gets it just right. Although roles like this are never meant to win Oscars Kelli takes this little part in a directtovideo flick and actually does something with it. Although I'm sure she'd like to forget all about Zapped Again the movie is much better for her presence. I'm not surprised that she went on to her present success on The Practice.The acting is actually better than in Zapped! which is one main reason why I liked Zapped Again better. However I thought that the types thatsome of the characters were supposed to represent were inconsistent with those characters' portrayal and actions. Kevin played by Todd Eric Andrews acts just too cool to be an outcast nerd I can't see why he would have any social problems. As for Kelli Williams as Lucy I just couldn't accept her as a nerd girl although I certainly don't object to her presence here. Not only does she look too good for the part but her attempts at nerdy intellectualism fall flat and the two scenes where she inexplicably wears glasses and just as inexplicably takes them off look like weak attempts by the filmmakers to establish her character. They should have just had her play a straightforward nice girl which she does admirably. Linda Blair doesn't cut it as the hottest teacher in the school not only does she not look sexy enough but her character is also just too nice.Still I thought that Zapped Again was a halfdecent movie especially because the acting was better than Zapped! maybe because 1989 was a more exciting year than 1982 and had that hip attitude?. Hey it kept me entertained and sometimes I like to take a break from the Criterion Collection and watch something that does nothing more than entertain you.If you demand that all teen movies and sex comedies have refugees from WB Network shows big budgets and great soundtracks always a big selling point with teen films then you'll hate Zapped Again which by the way is more a remake of Zapped! than a sequel. But as long as you lower your expectations and as long as you don't expect a late 80s teen classic like Heathers or Say Anything you might get a little something out of this.".

Linda Blair doesn't cut it as the hottest teacher in the school not only does she not look sexy enough but her character is also just too nice.Still I thought that Zapped Again was a halfdecent movie especially because the acting was better than Zapped! maybe because 1989 was a more exciting year than 1982 and had that hip attitude?. Hey it kept me entertained and sometimes I like to take a break from the Criterion Collection and watch something that does nothing more than entertain you.If you demand that all teen movies and sex comedies have refugees from WB Network shows big budgets and great soundtracks always a big selling point with teen films then you'll hate Zapped Again which by the way is more a remake of Zapped! than a sequel. But as long as you lower your expectations and as long as you don't expect a late 80s teen classic like Heathers or Say Anything you might get a little something out of this.";

It's a film to make you laugh .  Not so much at its jokes but the movie itself.  Sure the plot isn't Oscar material.  Maybe the acting isn't superb.  But the movie is hilarious.The whole plot is uproariously preposterous.  The movie goes against a lot of teenflick principles.  The hero isn't very geeky.  The nerdy girl waiting on the sidelines is quite attractive and at one point the movie goes black and white for a Casablanca scene that still makes me giggle.  The whole prune juice telekinesis thing is never made clear but that's ok because the zapped part in the title only comes up about 3 or 4 times.This movie was made in 1990 but the early 90s were simply the last revels of the 80s.  This movie is an 80s teenflick.  The jokes are 80s and the music is the 80s.  But the 80s were funny.I love this movie it is a great flashback to a less stressful time back when some crazy magic thingy would always save the day. Simply put this movie is a great party movie it features a really cute girl Kelli Williams and it's worth a rent.".

Either the imdb had a glitch or the cast of this movie is trying to save themselves the humiliation of finding themselves on the bottom100 list which I'm sure they will join shortly.To summarize this kid moves to a new highschool where things are pretty lame.  He makes friends with the local Science Club who are being bullied by the Key Club where all the jocks and popular people hang out and the faculty.  Nothing seems to go right until the kid and his new friends discover a formula that gives him superpowertypetelekenesis.  He finds that he can control objects with his mind.  But it only lasts a short time however so they put the power into a bottle of prune juice which he drinks anytime he needs the power.  With his new power and his supercoolness he outwits the faculty and the local bullies gets the girl and saves the Science Club.I could almost accept this pathetic movie for what it is if it was made in the early 80's along with all the other cheesy AnimalHouse and Revenge of the Nerds ripoffs.  But this movie was actually made in 1990 1989 in the credits which is something that is really hard to believe.  The soundtrack is about 10 years behind cool as are the clothes the plot well everything.  The whole movie looks like a terrible twisted version of Saved by the Bell and the cheesiness of the whole thing can be represented by the musicvideolike ending that makes Vanilla Ice look cool.There is nothing positive I can even say about this movie except that the girl is kind of cute.  Don't rent this movie don't watch this movie don't go near this movie.Two words Lyle Alzedo.  'Nuff said.".

Either the imdb had a glitch or the cast of this movie is trying to save themselves the humiliation of finding themselves on the bottom100 list which I'm sure they will join shortly.To summarize this kid moves to a new highschool where things are pretty lame.  He makes friends with the local Science Club who are being bullied by the Key Club where all the jocks and popular people hang out and the faculty.  Nothing seems to go right until the kid and his new friends discover a formula that gives him superpowertypetelekenesis.  He finds that he can control objects with his mind.  But it only lasts a short time however so they put the power into a bottle of prune juice which he drinks anytime he needs the power.  With his new power and his supercoolness he outwits the faculty and the local bullies gets the girl and saves the Science Club.I could almost accept this pathetic movie for what it is if it was made in the early 80's along with all the other cheesy AnimalHouse and Revenge of the Nerds ripoffs.  But this movie was actually made in 1990 1989 in the credits which is something that is really hard to believe.  The soundtrack is about 10 years behind cool as are the clothes the plot well everything.  The whole movie looks like a terrible twisted version of Saved by the Bell and the cheesiness of the whole thing can be represented by the musicvideolike ending that makes Vanilla Ice look cool.There is nothing positive I can even say about this movie except that the girl is kind of cute.  Don't rent this movie don't watch this movie don't go near this movie.Two words Lyle Alzedo.  'Nuff said.";

	schema:headline " Another successful Simon Odd Couple story";
	schema:reviewBody "Neil Simon is consistent. He loves to use and reuse the ODD COUPLE plot with variations in one play or another in the original ODD COUPLE it's female version shown in the early 1990s the sequel film with Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon the play and movie THE SUNSHINE BOYS  where the apartment is a lifelong comedy team partnership and this one. Here it is Marcia Mason and her daughter Quinn Cummings who are always being deserted by Mason's husband or her series of boyfriends who usually are actors. Mason has become determined never again to trust or date an actor. But the apartment happens to be in the name of her last boyfriend and he has made a subletting deal with outoftown actor Richard Dreyfus. Dreyfus is determined to stay in the apartment while in New York he is starring in a production within the city  off Broadway. He and Mason gradually agree to cease their hostilities and to share the apartment but Mason finds Dreyfus weird he is only eating special food and he chants and plays the guitar at night. On the other hand Quinn Cummings finds he's not such a bad guy he helps her when she has a headache relaxing her to sleep. The play that Dreyfus is appearing in the lead role in is Shakespeare's RICHARD III. It is being produced by Paul Benedict a rare big part for that good comic actor but his ideas about the production are upsetting Dreyfus. Dreyfus is approaching the role in the classical Olivier form  the master evil Machiavellian monarch. Machiavellian to be sure in Benedict's version but also gay. As Benedict pushes it it is the story of the Queen who would be King. Dreyfus's performance of the play within the film following Benedict's direction is an everlasting comic joy.The highs and lows of the two warring suite mates follows a romantic course as they gradually fall in love with each other. Will this actor prove to be another one of those typically selfish actors that Mason resents or will he prove to be different to her and Cummings  will he be the real love of her life?A first rate comedy and Dreyfus' Oscar  a well earned one.".

He loves to use and reuse the ODD COUPLE plot with variations in one play or another in the original ODD COUPLE it's female version shown in the early 1990s the sequel film with Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon the play and movie THE SUNSHINE BOYS  where the apartment is a lifelong comedy team partnership and this one. Here it is Marcia Mason and her daughter Quinn Cummings who are always being deserted by Mason's husband or her series of boyfriends who usually are actors. Mason has become determined never again to trust or date an actor. But the apartment happens to be in the name of her last boyfriend and he has made a subletting deal with outoftown actor Richard Dreyfus. Dreyfus is determined to stay in the apartment while in New York he is starring in a production within the city  off Broadway. He and Mason gradually agree to cease their hostilities and to share the apartment but Mason finds Dreyfus weird he is only eating special food and he chants and plays the guitar at night. On the other hand Quinn Cummings finds he's not such a bad guy he helps her when she has a headache relaxing her to sleep. The play that Dreyfus is appearing in the lead role in is Shakespeare's RICHARD III. It is being produced by Paul Benedict a rare big part for that good comic actor but his ideas about the production are upsetting Dreyfus. Dreyfus is approaching the role in the classical Olivier form  the master evil Machiavellian monarch. Machiavellian to be sure in Benedict's version but also gay. As Benedict pushes it it is the story of the Queen who would be King. Dreyfus's performance of the play within the film following Benedict's direction is an everlasting comic joy.The highs and lows of the two warring suite mates follows a romantic course as they gradually fall in love with each other. Will this actor prove to be another one of those typically selfish actors that Mason resents or will he prove to be different to her and Cummings  will he be the real love of her life?A first rate comedy and Dreyfus' Oscar  a well earned one.";

He also sublets the apartment they share to a young actor Eliot Garfield Richard Dreyfuss. They agree to live together even though they hate each other. Naturally they fall in love.Totally predictable but I really enjoyed it! I loved in back in 1977 and I still love it now! Neil Simon's script is basically just a series of one linersbut they ARE funny and Dreyfuss Mason and Cummings deliver them perfectly. They come fast and furious and the movie moves very quicklyit doesn't seem like it's 110 minutes long. Dreyfuss deservedly won the Best Actor Award for this filmhe's 'on' nonstop and is full of energy and fun.Mason was nominated for Best Actress and she's almost as good as Dreyfuss she was a little too whiny for me. Cummings isn't that goodbut she WAS only 10 when she did this. It's just that her character is one of those screen kids that talks and acts like an adultI didn't think having her swear occasionally was cute or funny. Nonetheless she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. The movie was also up for Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture. Also there's a GREAT title song written and performed by David Gates over the closing credits it was also a big hit song back in '77. Also Nicol Williamson pops up unbilled in a short but VERY funny cameo.The only debitthe romance scenes were corny but they do work and some of the dramatic scenes were TERRIBLY written Simon was always better at doing comedy. And he has two thunderstorms pop up out of NOWHERE in this movie during a big romantic and dramatic scene. That was pushing it a little too much! Still the acting carries those scenes through and it's a minor complaint.A sweet very funny enjoyable film. Just don't think about it TOO much. I give it a 9.".

Dreyfuss also had a rather serious problem with cocaine and that too may in part account for his frenetic performance. Marsha Mason is totally irritating no wonder all the men she gets involved with leave her! This movie derives part of its charm from the fact that the two romantic leads are not particularly young attractive or likable which is unusual for a romantic comedy. But that makes it harder for the view to feel sympathetic for the two I quite frankly didn't give a hoot whether or not they got together or stayed together. And although the ending implies that Eliot is so smitten with Paula that he will never leave her I tend to think that eventually he will get tired of this needy immature woman. That little speech she gives him towards the end about how she's grown up doesn't ring one bit true especially in light of what she does a little later that is standing out on the fire escape in the pouring rain in a sheer nightgown clutching his guitar and screaming I LOVE YOU! That kind of behavior you would expect from a lovesick teenager not a 33 year old woman who's grown up. Overall I would say that this a rather silly diversion of a movie.

Nichols had worked out that DeNiro could not Do Joy. No such problems for Dreyfuss. He is amazing as Elliot Garfield. The two leads capture each line to perfection which is no mean feat as nearly every line in this movie is a gag. Even Quinn Cummings is that rare thing a child actor that does not make you reach for a revolver. Even the now dated Gay King Richard routine works still as it is done in such a sweet good natured way. So many great lines my personal favourite..... Capital P Capital U capital TRID The final shots of Mason are an echo of the final shots of the vastly overrated Breakfast at Tiffanys. Also this is one of those rare Romances that men enjoy possibly because Dreyfuss is not exactly George Clooney is an incredible smart arse throughout. and unlike someone like Hugh Grant actually knows when to put the moves on so to speak Hope for all average looking guys everywhere.

Also this is one of those rare Romances that men enjoy possibly because Dreyfuss is not exactly George Clooney is an incredible smart arse throughout. and unlike someone like Hugh Grant actually knows when to put the moves on so to speak Hope for all average looking guys everywhere. A Brilliant Brilliant movie. Please can we have a DVD release with whistle and bells please Rastar and Sony.";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSLet me start by saying I love a lot of things about The Goodbye Girl. The Eliot character is adorable excitable really cute late 70s Richard Dreyfuss. And Quinn Cummings is fantastic. Both their roles are cleverly written. But this film is backwards from a feminist perspective when other late 70's films like Annie Hall were showing women as independent and competent beings wanting to change themselves.This is not the case with the Goodbye Girl. While the film can boast witty dialogue looking at it from a feminist perspective it is just wretched and boasts no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Mason's character is codependent and immature at the beginning of the film and shows herself to be the same way at the end. Mason's initial sass is promising but once Dreyfuss wins her over she falls back into her codependent patterns. I could not could not be happy at the end of this film or feel any sort of contentment with the ending. I can't feel happy at Mason's unbridled enthusiasm she jumps when Eliot calls and has no reservations about leaving her 10 year old daughter to follow him on a movie set. Even though she doesn't go it is clear her priorities lie with her man's interests not her daughter's providing a terrible message that having a man in your life should be your top priority and that you should give up your career or any kind of individual aspirations once you find one.Maybe what bothered me is that Mason gave 100 percent of the power in the relationship to Dreyfussthis is apparent in the end it seems like the future and happiness of both Mason's Paula and her daughter is hinged on the whether Dreyfuss' Eliot is coming back or not. That doesn't leave me happy and it doesn't leave me satisfied and it doesn't leave me pleased that the characters are back together. In contrast Annie Hall with its more complex ending was more satisfying. Annie had grown and changed throughout the movie. I thought this was more a reflection of the late 70's woman or what woman were trying to become in that era.".

I love this movie and I can relate to the Charatcer of Ellot Garfield the most a hard working actor who keeps getting dumped on. This movie is very humorous but has the element of love and compassion that I never saw from Richard Dryfus before he was actually very sexy in this movie believe it or not. I LOVE THE GOODBYE GIRL! This story originated on Broadway as a musical but became a movie in 1977. If you love dancers and actors who fall in love this is the movie for you! It really tugs at your heartstrings and leaves you with that warm fuzzy feeling in the pit of your tummy!".

	schema:headline " Grim and atmospheric medieval film";
	schema:reviewBody "Medieval scholars will probably find substantial problems with the film's depiction of the Middle Ages but to a nonhistorian it certainly feels closer than many other period movies buildings are mostly squalid and insubstantial the weapons and armor of the soldiers are crude and illassorted  Ulric Sean Bean the bishop's envoy has the best of everything while his followers are progressively less wellequipped as they descend the social scale  and it gives a good sense of the unwelcoming sparselypopulated landscapes of medieval Britain. The casting works well too the soldiers are for the most part neither Hollywood prettyboys nor stock grotesques but have the look of real people 'warts and all'.The impression of a brutal bleak time when life was not merely cheap but nearly worthless is reinforced by the look of the film. It's coldly lit and everything is misty and uncertain. This distinctive atmosphere creates a feeling of constantly impending disaster without the need for the cheap frights and minor chords of a horror movie.The characterization is often surprisingly complex Ulric may be a fanatic but he's also a pragmatist who is no crueler than he needs to be. Even his soldiers are not onedimensional brutes but have their own personalities with subtlysketched human traits. The film encourages you to think about the motivation of even the most minor characters. Eddie Redmayne as Osmund does a good job of presenting a complex and conflicted character for much of the film.The weak point where the characters are concerned are the women. Averill Kimberley Nixon and Langiva Carice Van Houten sometimes feel more like plot devices than people. This is not the fault of the actresses who both deliver good performances. It's just that their characters are more constrained by the requirements of the plot.As with any film in which religion plays a major part there's been some debate as to whether the film is pro or antiChristian. To my mind it's neither. All the characters whichever faction they represent are badly compromised. The only value system that it really seems to promote is that of simple humanity. It's no accident that the director gives the final voice over to Wolfstan John Lynch who emerges ultimately as the film's most sympathetic character a somewhat tarnished and worldweary ideal of what it means to be a 'good man'.By and large the film works well in terms of plot and pacing. It doesn't drag and there are few obvious plot holes. Where it falls down badly however is with the ending segment which feels like a hurriedlysketched afterthought. The fact that the director felt it necessary to deliver key material in the form of a voiceover should have warned him that he needed to rethink his approach. The film would probably have been not only complete but also stronger if that whole section had simply been cut.It isn't a standout film but it's certainly an interesting one. It's well made and acted and it leaves you with plenty to think about. Any filmmaker who wants to truly convey the feel of the Middle Ages  brutal and squalid and at once alien and familiar  should watch Black Death and take notes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set during the period of English history when the Bubonic plague spreads death across the land a troubled young monk named Osmund is recruited by a band of soldiers to investigate a village that remains untouched. What they find there will change them forever.Having enjoyed Christopher Smith's previous movies Creep Severance and Triangle I had high hopes for Black Death and was not disappointed. Although the gore of his previous movies is still evident during the battle scenes in which arms are severed by swords and heads crushed by maces it's largely underplayed here with the script placing greater emphasis on the story's themes of faith religion superstition and love. It is this emphasis along with the various twists in the plot which make the choices faced by the characters in the third act of the movie so very interesting.I was repeatedly reminded of the original Wicker Man whilst watching Black Death not only because of the central theme of a devout Christian confronting something terrible which attempts to challenge and undermine his own beliefs but also because of the cold bleak cinematography reminiscent of a seventies horror movie. The entire production is nicely directed and Smith utilises his horror knowledge to keep a constant and oppressive threat running throughout the film regardless of the scene to maximum effect. The visual effects whether for the symptoms of the plague itself or for the various wounds suffered by the characters are also excellent.The cast are universally fantastic although Sean Bean's towering performance  portraying the leader of the soldiers and a man more dangerous than pestilence  steals the movie. Eddie Redmayne does well in the central role of Osmund and manages to make his character's personal journey both interesting and believable whilst Carice van Houten is also memorable in an important role during the second half of the movie.I was very impressed by Black Death and would recommend it to those who enjoy atmospheric horror movies such as the aforementioned The Wicker Man or Don't Look Now as well as those who seek out movies set in or around this period of Britain such as In The Name Of The Rose and The Reckoning. Although parts are grim and even upsetting it's never dull and is definitely a movie worthy of your time and support.".

The supporting cast even though another band mercenaries are memorable and the characters are developed. Comedy actor Tim McInnerny is satisfactory in an unusual serious role as the village head. There's a notable cameo by David Warner as The Abbot. However it's Carice van Houten who steals the show as Langiva the striking necromancer.There's a little too much shaky hand held camera work at times that aside the cinematography is first rate. Dario Poloni screenplay is the icing on the cake as the dialogue feels authentic and unforced compared to the aforementioned other period piece. It explores religious beliefs faith witch hunts occultism and much more.With low expectation's for another period piece I was pleasantly surprised by Smith's vision.

	schema:reviewBody "While some may see this movie as having a not so subtle undertone of 'the greatness of Christianity' I saw it as an interesting exploration of religion itself. The characters in this movie all differ in their religious views allowing you to identify with them based on your own religious persuasion. There is the fanatic the believer the non believer the good the bad the in between etc. The plot itself helps this journey as the characters move from one setting to a vastly different one all the while suffering the same basic experiences. Their initial motivations in addition to their reactions to these experiences all differ along the lines of their beliefs and help either strengthen or weaken those beliefs. This movie shows quite well that people's attitudes to religion have not changed in hundreds of years. God is still used to explain things we do not understand and fear and miracles are still used to recruit and keep believers. Human behaviour also has not changed much. Even faced with the 'black death' one of the worst pandemics in human history people still found reason to divide and fight amongst themselves assigning blame and punishment rather than band together. The way these themes fit in so appropriately with the medieval setting makes it all the more surprising that they can still be applied in today's world. All in all a good movie for open minded people because although the film explores these themes it makes no conclusion. That is left to the audience to determine who was right who was justified and who was wrong who was good and who was evil.".

	schema:reviewBody "Black Death is a hidden gem as others have put it and far from the Hollywood slop it so sharply contrasts. It could not be much more true to its' name which is quite possibly the bleakest title a film can be given while it feels genuine to its period backdrop. Everything here feels true to its' nature. And there is no excess of special effects or melodrama or anything watered down and instead the story is full of substance. In 1348 the young monk Osmund finds himself conflicted at the films start as his secret love Avrill is fleeing their plagueridden city and provides him the choice to meet her in the marshland. Upon asking for a sign for guidance his monastery is visited by Ulrich and his party of Christian fundamentalists. On a mission to a village beyond the marsh in search of a necromancer and any other witches to stamp out he asks for a guide and young Osmund obliges. Thus begins an ugly and gritty crusade across an English countryside that is riddled with fear intolerance and the Black Death. The struggle is personal as well as conceptual. For Osmund it is personal as his love for Avrill causes him to question his own faith due to the charms and tricks of the pagans huge plot twists underly this themeand the brutality of the band he guides. And then the bigger picture the struggle between the Christians and the pagans is tastefully portrayed with an objective narrative. In the film there are cruelties and acts of brutality inflicted from both belief systems. This was perhaps my favorite element to the movie. While personally I rooted for the pagans against the tyranny of the church I found that my brother and I could argue over who was the demonized side and the writing offered no kind of resolution. That the oppression of the church and the clandestine nature of the pagans only fueled one another is probably truer to history than textbooks will ever show this movie portrays the idea brilliantly despite the dark feel. If you think the movie sounds interesting and are interested in it for plot substanceand a gratifying experience check this one out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in 1348 during the time of the first outbreak of the bubonic plague in England Osmund Eddie Redmayne a young monk is tasked to accompany a determined knight named Ulric Sean Bean and a group of mercenary soldiers in learning the truth about reports of people being brought back to life in a small village where the plague has not reached. While Osmund sees this as a mercy mission Ulric believes necromancy is involved and is determined to bring this necromancer to justice. Their journey leads them into various obstacles and darker moments as secrets are unveiled.Despite its grim mood and subject matter this film is an entertaining and generally a thoughtprovoking medieval horrorthriller. Even with the film's low budget it is impressive to look at. The misty landscapes the costumes the filthy details and the sets are impressive. Some of the makeup and soundtrack may seem a tad modern but they are not distracting. While the film is considered a historical horror film it is also a bit of an action flick as it has some energetic gritty swordplay with some blood and limbs flying off. The film takes place around the time of the Inquisition when there was much distrust from the Catholic church and the government toward pagans. Ulric is a zealous warrior driven by hatred. He believes he is serving God through the use of his sword against suspected necromancers. Osmund the monk on the other hand believes that in order to love God one must serve through mercy and love. There are no characters here that are fully saintly. I felt Eddie Redmayne's performance as Osmund really made this film work. His performance feels genuine and he acts as I would imagine a monk would act and talk and he is emotionally relatable. As the film progresses one can appreciate his good range of emotions and acting ability. As for Sean Bean one can't help but feel he is reprising his role as Boromir from Lord of the Rings. He has the same type of hair. He is wearing medieval armor. Again he plays that proud brash character who we know will do somethingbrash. I would love to see him someday play a real calm jovial intellectual character. To the film's credit Sean Bean gets to stretch a bit as Ulric is not completely twodimensional and we do get to know more on how he became the type of character that he is. The rest of the cast who have their own special look and quirk do a laudable job and work together well. The action scenes have a good amount of tension and intensity but the shaky camera effect can be dizzying. There is about one major fight scene which happens midway into the film. Once the main characters make it to the village things get a little more surreal and one realizes that this is not necessarily an action film at least in a conventional sense. I've noticed the characters in the village feel talk and look strangely modern. I'm guessing these villagers still farm for a living but they seem quite clean and manicured. The script is sharply written with good detail in the dialogue. The film attempts to explore how extreme situations can turn people into hateful zealots or a violent fundamentalist. There is a twist at the end which is interesting but somewhat hard to swallow. The film doesn't attempt to give any big answers but it is an interesting exploration of man's dark nature the cycle of vengeance and how good people can turn cruel when evil is done on them.

Music is scored by Christian Henson and cinematography by Sebastian Edschmid.1348 Year of our Lord the bubonic plague is ravaging Europe. When word spreads of an isolated community that is plague free a gang of Gods' soldiers are tasked with seeking it out under the impression it might be a haven to occult dealings.

He takes the soldiers' request for a guide as a sign to find his true calling what he and the soldiers find at the end of their journey however has far reaching consequences for them all.Considering it was a limited release in theatres it's a little surprising to find so many have sought it out on home format release. What isn't surprising given its themes is how it has polarised opinions. Personally I love it this in spite of director and writer cribbing from notable Brit movies of our past. Yet even when in the supposed sanctuary of our home during this latest visit to the film it was met with derision from the lady love of my life! After director Smith SeveranceTriangleCreep has well and truly pulled the rug from underneath us to tantalisingly leave things ambiguous he slots in a coda that muddies things still further simultaneously infuriating another portion of the movie watching populace. I write this because of two reasons the first is to obviously intrigue potential first time watchers into taking the plunge and giving it a go the second is to negate the underselling of the movie by its own director!Somewhere along the way Smith chose to not sell it as a battle between religion and atheismChristians against Pagans but went for the more pleasingly medieval men on a mission aspect which for the first half of the movie it is. Perhaps those sneaky loans from the revered films that have influenced it weighed heavy on the director post the release and critical appraisals? But undeniably it's the second half that carries the thematic thrust. True enough to say that following a chainmail clad Sean Bean and his grungy band of mercs traverse the land fighting off bandits and the plague along the way is good formulaic fun but it's when they happen upon the marshy set village greeted by a ghostly Carice van Houten and a unnervingly smiley Tim McInnerny that the film really hits its stride. Thus opening up debates as the battle for Osmund's soul truly begins and we are asked just who are the good and bad guys here?Filmed out in the forests of Saxony Germany the film looks terrific in the context of the period it is set. The colours are deliberately stripped back and muted this plague ravaged land and persons demand that to be the case. There's some initial annoyance with the shakycam formula during the more uptempo sequences this is something that is becoming a staple requirement by directors of historical pictures but Smith thankfully doesn't over do it and achieves good atmospheric realism throughout. It's interesting to note that the Pagan villagers are clean and sprightly while the Christian soldiers are grimy and grotty life of the medieval soldier was bloody and bloody dirty work . When the excellent Andy Nyman as Dalywag takes a leak up a tree he merely wipes his newly whetted hand on his tunic it's little things like this that keep the film in the realm of realism an awareness of the time indeed. Cast attack the material with good thespian seriousness with Lynch and Harris scoring well as polar opposite characters in the supporting ranks of Ulric's Bean band of not so merry men.It's not overly gory Smith choosing correctly to let us at times fill in the blanks in our head while the fight scenes are very well staged Bean was very pleased with how they turned out. But ultimately it's the themes in the story and period setting that is of the most interest here. What ever side of the fence you sit on as regards religion or how you feel about humanity being depicted so coarsely Black Death will get a reaction out of you. 810".

Shortly after a knight named Ulric played by Sean Bean arrives with a group of fellow soldiers on a special mission ordered by the bishop. Ulric tells the monks that there have been reports of a village that has escaped the ravages of the plague and that witchcraft has been suspected in its preservation. Ulric requests that one of the monks guide the soldiers to the village so that they may investigate the situation.Osmund seeing his opportunity to reach Averill volunteers to accompany the soldiers to the village and so his journey begins. Osmund guides the soldiers to nearby the meeting place he and Averill had previously arranged and they make camp. Osmund uses the opportunity to sneak away to meet Averill only to discover bloody rags and a group of bandits remaining. Osmund then makes a hasty retreat back to camp where he awakes the soldiers who then proceed to kill the bandits. Distraught with the loss of Avrill Osmund continues to guide the soldiers to the village where not everything is as it would first appear...The film contains strong performances from Sean Bean Carice van Houten Davis Warner and Tim McInnerny. McInnerny of course famed for his roles playing upper class buffoons in televisions such as Blackadder was highly believable in his portrayal of a very different type of character and that was gratifying.In terms of both the visual look and in terms of ambiance the film was also very good. The graphic depiction of the plague in addition to the desolated environment set against the relatively lush scene of the unravaged village really aided the haunting atmosphere the film attempted to invoke. The violence and misery of life during the period was also not a subject that the film shied away from and in places verged towards being perhaps too brutal.The major down point for this film was Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Osmund a role he didn't really seem to get to grips with until the final scenes of the film. Another problem was the pace of the film despite not being very long consisting of only 102 minutes the film seemed to drag and last far longer.But those issues aside I enjoyed the film.".

Regarding the aspect of the time set of the movie it is also very well done. An overall good movie great directing not that one would expect anything less from Christopher Smith but sometimes the picture was a bit shaky which kinda bothered me.".

The music even has a similar feeling.The journey through the jungle. The strange quest. The rusting armor and long stretches of silence. All that is missing is Natasia.

	schema:headline " The Horror of the Superstitious Dark Ages";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1348 year of our Lord England is devastated by the Bubonic plague that spreads death in the lands and villages. The young monk Osmund Eddie Redmayne asks his beloved Averill Kimberley Nixon to travel to a remote village after the Dentwich Forest where the Black Death has not reached yet. She tells that she will wait for him in the forest but Osmund tells that he will stay in the Staveley Monastery since he is a man of God. However the emissary of the bishop Ulric Sean Bean arrives in the monastery recruiting a religious man to guide his soldiers and him through the forest and the swamp to the village. They believe that there is a necromancer resurrecting people and protecting the village from the plague. Along their journey they fight against forest thieves and Osmund finds Averill's clothes dirty of blood. When they reach the village they find happy and healthy villagers that have renounced God living in peace and they are welcomed by the leaders Hob Tim McInnerny and the alchemist Langiva Carice van Houten. She shows Osmund the dead body of Averill that they have found in the woods. However during the night Langiva brings Averill back to life and Osmund tries to warn Ulric and his men. But they have already been drugged and sooner they have to renounce God to survive.Black Death is a great film the depicts the horror of the superstitious Dark Ages. The story recalls the 1973 Wicker Man in the environment of the Middle Ages. Christopher Smith maybe is the most promising director of the young generation. His previous movies Creep Severance and Triangle shows that he is improving his work. This intriguing and violent story of religion faith superstitious ignorance and fanaticism has a magnificent screenplay that only reveals the consistent truth in the very end and is supported by topnotch performances. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Morte Negra Black Death".

	schema:headline " Great cast gives even better performance in this haunting tale";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm from Holland and we are not known for our great history of actors let alone the Dutch cinema. Some of you might know Paul Verhoeven Rutger Hauer and Black Book...but that's about it. So when a Dutch actor or actress makes his or her way to Hollywood although some of the Americans despise Hollywood in Holland it's still Mecca for movies it's of national importance. Carice van Houten is our latest Dutch acting jewel who made her way to Hollywood with movies like Black Book Valkyrie Repo Men and the recent Black Death. She is a major reason why I'm writing this review. In this review I would like to point out some good and some weaker elements in this movie. I will not give a summary of the plot I'll just give my view on some things. So I know a lot of things will not be addressed in this review sorry for that just wanted to share some things with you.GOODAfter watching this movie I could only think of one thing this is a great piece of cinema! First of all the cast is very well selected. Eddie Redmayne and Sean Bean share the lead and they are both very strong characters. Redmayne impresses with his performance as a boyish monk who transforms in a hardened revenge seeker during the movie due to the fact that he is torn between his dedication to the church and his forbidden love for a girl. Bean is good as he always is in my opinion. Watching Bean was like watching a Christian version of Boromir brainwashed by faith and dedicated to his goal.And then there was Carice...Stunningly beautiful enchanting and mysterious both lovable and scary and....well I can continue like this. She was just good just so good.Furthermore the plot is a very strong element of this movie as well. Unpredictable and exciting but always keeps your attention until the final narrative. Great setting as well I thought it was shot in UK somewhere maybe Ireland but I didn't expect this movie to be shot in Germany! Kudo's for Germany...BADI thing BAD is a strong expression and does not really apply to anything concerning this movie. Although I have some mixed feelings about the underlying theme the question whether there is a God or not and how to deal with religion in times of the plague. My major concern with this theme in this movie is that at the end there is no real statement about what's right and what's wrong or who was right and who was wrong. For instance our Christian crusaders slaughter everybody who is against their faith in name of the Bishop or God or the Church or Christianity so to say that these crusaders are lovable people...no not really. Than the villagepeople who seem to be nice at first but the more intelligent viewer will conclude that they are not what they seem at all. After they show their real nature they are not that lovable as well. Even the holy monk turns out to be a bad ass revenge seeker at the end!Conclusion God and Christianity suck big times concerning our knowledge of the Middle Ages we already knew that atheists suck as well the sad thing is in real life most Americans will agree on this one and even a man from God himself is not trustworthy.The end of the movie does justice to it's title this is a very BLACK movie.All in all this is a movie you must see. Very interesting and intriguing on many levels with a good plot great setting and even better actors!".

And news just in a bunch of repressive overlords have just seized control of England.Released into an era of poverty pestilence and bad religion Christopher Smiths historical horrorthriller Black Death fits the new Dark Ages like an bloodied iron gauntlet. Rather conspicuously and this more than likely has a lot to do with the global recession it also arrives during a year when there have been a slew of apocalyptic or incenseflavoured films including The Book of Eli Solomon Kane Legion and The Road. No wonder the distributors have already delayed its release three times.Set in 1348 the incense here is allpervading. The Catholics are in charge witch trials are commonplace and the flagellants are beating themselves up over nothing. The graveyards are bursting with bodies. It is estimated that the Black Death felled around 3040 per cent of the population of England between 1347 and 1351. Yet just like in 'Asterix' one small village of indomitable pagans still holds out against the epidemic. Imagine for a moment that Asterix was repositioned in the horror genre. Getafix would be a frightening old shaman much preoccupied with human sacrifice and hallucinogenic potions while Obelix would be little more than a mindless thug in the Leatherface mould brandishing menhirs like granite chainsaws. And oddly enough it's Goscinny and Uderzo's creation that springs to mind during this. Anyway this apparent infallibility isn't as strange as it sounds. The writers have clearly done some homework and may be aware that most English towns actually recovered remarkably quickly from the disease. However such absurdly rude health naturally raises suspicions of devilish pacts and it helps matters not that the village is effectively run by a woman Black Books Carice van Houten selfassured and 'good with herbs' this at a time when female villagers are kind of thin on the ground anyway for reasons of Churchsponsored genocide. Bishop's envoy Ulri an icy Sean Bean and his unmerrie men saddle up and set forth to drag the demon out. As in Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man what happens next pits blind faith against ferocious dogma.Brithorror director Smith has been a name to watch for a while Severance Triangle and he's played a blinder here. This is a powerfully haunting film rivalling The Name of the Rose for period atmosphere and evoking some of the marvellous weirdness of The Devils Aguirre the Wrath of God and aforementioned Wicker Man. It is also reminiscent of a largely forgotten Thirty Years War drama The Last Valley. It's a gory story limbs are torn from sockets brains are scooped out by studded maces. But most arrestingly this addresses everrelevant questions such as 'How do you make a zealot?' 'What makes your God better than my God?' and that old favourite 'Who put you in charge anyway?' I'll leave you with a quote from a heretical villager who under torture is asked why he's chosen van Houten's 'witch' over The Man in the Sky. His reply instant and unequivocal Because she is beautiful. And real. Black Death coming soon to your village.".

The story has since been retold by many authors.In Ovidian tale Pyramus and Thisbe are two young lovers unable to stay together for social issues however the power of love makes they plan an escape to live together the rest of their lives. Thisbe planned with Pyramus that they would flee to a distant monument far from the city Into the woods called Ninu's Tomb and there they would wait for the other and than flee together. Thisbe was the first to get there and she was waiting for Pyramus until she saw a lioness with a bloody mouth scared she ran into a cave to hide and on the trail dropped her veil. The lioness seeing the veil on the ground laid with its mouth bloodied on it smearing the veil with blood of a prey. Pyramus when reached the Ninu's Tomb moments later didn't found Thisbe but saw the footprints of the lioness and the bloody veil of Thisbe on the ground. When he found the veil he believed that Thisbe was killed because of his late and after crying over her veil committed suicide.The film is exactly the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe with their intermediate characters and a little modifications.In The FilmPyramus and Thisbe are also separated by a social matter Pyramus Osmund is a monk and according to his votes could not fall in love with a woman Thisbe  or AverillBoth plan to find in the woods on a monument called Cross of the Martyrs in Dentwich forest which symbolizes the Nilu's Tomb.Warriors on behalf of the Bishop are intermediates in history as well as the village and the Necromancer.When Osmund reaches the place where they planned to meet also finds Averill veil bloodied and footprints and marks of fight on the ground.Wild looters who attacked Averill symbolize the Leone.The suicide of Pyramus is symbolized with Osmund identity loss which in the film has an uncertain end but it is clear that it is no longer the same.A work that everyone should check out and enjoy the horrors of the Middle Ages all the dirt ignorance lack of infrastructure and dependence of the church in the existentialist ideal.The film makes clear how a misunderstood religion whatever it is causes terrible tragedies in which the protagonist is the man by itself.".

But since it starred Sean Bean I figured I give it a try. I have to admit I was impressed. It had a great story line and plot with a creepy and very unexpected twist ending. I was amazed they could fit so much story into an hour and a half. I was absolutely glued to the TV within the first couple of minutes and the fast pace continued to get me more and more hooked. Especially once they entered the village. The acting was perfect. Especially considering how difficult to get good character development in a shorter film with lots of important characters.Please understand that this film is rated R for a reason. It is quite bloody with gory sound effects galore. NOT for the faint of heart. I'm pretty squeamish with that sort of thing so I always appreciate a warning as to the degree of gore so I just thought I'd give one.Just a quick note I'm not a film or theater major. I'm just an average gal who loves movies. So my review may be a bit simplistic compared to others.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie basically turned out to be more than what I expected. I was expecting a decent movie since I liked the director Christopher Smith's previous works but this movie overall is a low budget movie most definitely worth seeing once. This movie has some very well crafted twists that M. Night Shyamalan should learn from. You know those movies where you think you have everything down? Well this isn't one of them just when you might think you know what direction it's going to go and how it's going to end. It will suddenly take the audiences for a loop. So basically a group of Christian demon slayers are on a mission to kill a necromancer with the help of a young monk guide who is on the mission as well for a reason. And they are on this journey while a deadly plague is killing off many people. The thing is usually for a low budget movie like this it takes a while to actually care about what happens to the group. But the direction of this made me sort of care who dies and who lives especially when the movie came close to the end. I like the actor Sean Bean and he was fantastic in this but the other actors and actresses stood out as well. This is a low budget movie that is very much worth the time to see and will be looking forward to this director's next work.7.610".

	schema:headline " The pestilence is coming";
	schema:reviewBody "The Black Death is a very interesting aspect of history a plague that killed a third of Europe's population had a massive social impact during and after the event e.g. the Peasant's Revolt an economic impact leading to people becoming wealthy and owning more land and lead to a change in art afterwards. So it is a surprise that this subject has not been look at more often in film and literature. Director Christopher Smith has taken on the challenge.In 1348 the Black Death is at it's high in England. With people dying all around a young monk Osmond Eddie Redmayne tells his secret lover Averill Kimberley Nixon to hide in the forest where she said she would wait for one week. At the same time a knight Ulric Sean Bean looking like he has just walk in from the set of Lord of the Rings tells the monastery of a village that has avoided the pestilence by turning their back on God and bringing the dead back to live. Osmond volunteers to be the knights guild working for his own selfish reasons. As they travel through the infested lands of England and seeing the impact of the plague on society the group of men end up in a weirdly blissful village led by Langiva Carice van Houten.Early on in Black Death the film is interesting at seeing how the Black Death affected people from the rise of the Flagellants a group of Christian extremists who believed that they need to show their love for God to avoid the by selfharming and hoped God would forgive them. There was the massive impact of death in the countryside and that the wilds of Medieval Europe was like the Wild West where bandits lived in the woods. Smith was not afraid to show that Medieval battles even on a small scale were very bloody and men being ruthless. It was a scene that looked like the filmmakers enjoyed making. I did also enjoy the more natural elements of horror from the eerie near paradise like world the village seemed. Black Death also has a twisted ending.The costumes themselves do not look that believable with Bean looking like Boromir from Lord of the Rings and the weapons look like there are from a cartoon or a pantomime film. This is not the most realistic depiction of the Medieval era. Also after a very fast start in the first 30 minutes the quest elements grinds to a halt when they go to the village. The film does not have the strongest narrative ever and it is a basically a BMovie.The acting is fine and there is a constant theme about faith about how people were willing to break and use it whether it was Osmond who had a forbidden affair or Langiva who uses miracles or the church willingness to torture people. Bean is normally good in any thing he is in and offer gravitas to the film. Ms. Van Houten is a strong actress who does pull off a good English accent. Tim McInnerny is subtle and sinister as a character called Hob who on the surface is softly spoken and a seemingly nice guy but harbours a dark ruthless edge. Even more remarkable because he is known for being a comic actor. Redmayne was okay as the lead but did have a good relationship with John Lynch who was a interesting enough character as Ulric's number two.On a final note there were many critics in Britain who fell in love with this film and gave it four star reviews. Personally I don't know what they were smoking but at most Black Death is a 3 out of 5 there were good moments but overall it is not a great film and properly will not be remembered that much.5.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Scarcely seen in the United States and released on home video to little fanfare Black Death is one of those underrated films that for whatever reason never amounts to more than a tiny blip on the radar of the movie world but whose merits offer a rewarding experience to those who do find it. In many ways Black Death is an alternate take on the same story told in Season of the Witch the Nicolas Cage feature released earlier this year. Like that film Black Death's story takes place in the Middle Ages amidst the ravages of the bubonic plague. And as with Season of the Witch the greatest terrors encountered in Black Death lurk within the human heart.As the ruthless plague kills indiscriminately outside the walls of his monasteryand sometimes within it as wellthe young monk Osmund finds his faith wavering. Torn between his unyielding vows to God and his love for the lovely Averill Osmund prays fervently for a sign. When a knight arrives as the monastery's doorstep in search of a guide into unknown territory Osmund believes his prayer has been answered. Ulrich the bishop's personal envoy is leading his men in search of a village where the plague supposedly does not afflict. It is said the village is home to witches and devils and Ulrich is determined to find the truth. Osmund against the wishes of his abbot agrees to lead Ulrich to what he seeks fearing that whatever the young man finds out there waiting for him it will change him forever. But Osmund is desperate to discover his destiny no matter the price. And so begins a journey deep into a dark blighted wilderness where superstition and religion mingle in benighted forests and the line between faith and madness blends seamlessly together.Black Death is thoughtfully written carefully directed and realistically performed. There is some action and likewise a few scenes of torture and not a few moments of whiteknuckle suspense but unlike Season of the Witch it is not really an action film. Black Death's delicately unfolding plot mines several rich dark veins of human thought particularly the nature of humanity and how we as fragile and very sinful individuals live out the ideals of our religion in a world of chaos and inexplicable suffering. The eternal struggle between Christianity and paganism is played out in an artful uncompromising little epic that is as terrifying as it is heartbreaking as is the undying war within the human heart between good and evil. Directed by Christopher Smith and starring stalwart veteran actor Sean Bean as the crusading Ulrich Eddie Redmayne as the confused Osmund and Carice van Houten as a woman who may be the worst sort of witch Black Death is a startlingly effective film on all counts. Unlike Season of the Witch Black Death leaves many questions unanswered and the plot is nothing if not ambiguous. But it is the thoughtfulness of its mysterious story and that which it inspires in the viewer that makes it such an excellent film.".

Ulrich the bishop's personal envoy is leading his men in search of a village where the plague supposedly does not afflict. It is said the village is home to witches and devils and Ulrich is determined to find the truth. Osmund against the wishes of his abbot agrees to lead Ulrich to what he seeks fearing that whatever the young man finds out there waiting for him it will change him forever. But Osmund is desperate to discover his destiny no matter the price. And so begins a journey deep into a dark blighted wilderness where superstition and religion mingle in benighted forests and the line between faith and madness blends seamlessly together.Black Death is thoughtfully written carefully directed and realistically performed. There is some action and likewise a few scenes of torture and not a few moments of whiteknuckle suspense but unlike Season of the Witch it is not really an action film. Black Death's delicately unfolding plot mines several rich dark veins of human thought particularly the nature of humanity and how we as fragile and very sinful individuals live out the ideals of our religion in a world of chaos and inexplicable suffering. The eternal struggle between Christianity and paganism is played out in an artful uncompromising little epic that is as terrifying as it is heartbreaking as is the undying war within the human heart between good and evil. Directed by Christopher Smith and starring stalwart veteran actor Sean Bean as the crusading Ulrich Eddie Redmayne as the confused Osmund and Carice van Houten as a woman who may be the worst sort of witch Black Death is a startlingly effective film on all counts. Unlike Season of the Witch Black Death leaves many questions unanswered and the plot is nothing if not ambiguous. But it is the thoughtfulness of its mysterious story and that which it inspires in the viewer that makes it such an excellent film.";

But director James Mangold Copland Walk the Line 310 to Yuma always knows how to make a film play and his skills haven't deserted him here. His pacing is brisk and fun and he stages some terrific action including one sequence from Diaz' point of view that did feel genuinely new.Of course this is a star vehicle and whether you enjoy it will depend a lot on how you feel about Tom Cruise. Dismissing his personal life as utterly irrelevant I find him to be a solid and dependable actor who does action better than almost anyone in Hollywood. And here he gets a rare chance to flex his comic muscles and hie's quite funny though too much of the best material is in the trailer. Diaz is pleasant but tries a little too hard to be cute. And occasionally the film itself has the same problem.But overall it's a funny little spy movie. part adventure part romcom. Not destined for any Ten Best Lists but enjoyable summer entertainment.".

	schema:headline " A collage of mayhem action flaws and charm Knight and Day is saved by the leads and unique summer freshness";
	schema:reviewBody "Jumpstarting the Mysterious Plot Summer Season Knight and Day Salt Inception Piranha 3D Knight and Day is quite an interesting thrill ride that's very fresh in the midst of a summer season with very little originality. With the two leads delivering charismatic fun and great performances this movie is propelled by star power intrigue and never allowing the audience to be one step ahead of the flick. The twists and turns may have been a little unnerving and the movie does suffer from being quite vague at times the overall package is a fun one. Unlike most summer clunkers there was some robot movie last year that was dismally pathetic if only I remember the name this one is forgivable for its flaws because of its style loose direction and freshness.Without revealing too much trust me predicting the movie from the trailer will do you no good Knight and Day follows a secret agent Tom Cruise that accidentally involves a bystander Cameron Diaz in the middle of a crazy fight spanning multiple agencies and multiple countries. Written by Patrick O'Neal this script is very unique very refreshing and at times quite offthewall. The story moves very fast but has time for some character development and character revelationseven if they become little blurbs here and there. The only issue is that characters are revealed in such quick and awkward manners but it might be more an editing issue rather than a writing issue.Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise were perfect for their leading roles here. Cameron Diaz has an undeniable charm that has made her not only a major box office draw over the years but one of the few actresses that can carry any movie past mediocrity. At the same time Tom Cruise also has the ability to propel movies with his impeccable charm and subtle timing. So naturally with these two together movie magic is accomplished. Just like in Vanilla Sky even if the editing and obscurity allowed the movie to collapse Knight and Day is jumpstarted and propelled by Diaz and Cruise acting together. Their comic timing is great and can still deliver the emotions when you need them to. Everyone else did a respectable job but they consisted of dozens of small roles.The movie however suffers from one major flaw potential. This movie could have been something very special if it had been given a little more love a bit more budget and better editing. James Mangold is heavily varied in his directing resume Cop Land Walk the Line Identity 310 to Yuma so he has the ability to run an action film unlike the indiedirector of the last James Bond flick. But the movie does this mildly irritating thing in which it sets up potential action sequences but skips them entirely. While the movie does offer plenty of action this irritating directingediting blunder was done at least three times. The fact that it could have done so much more doesn't distract from the overall quality but does unveil its potential. With a budget of over 120 million Knight and Day looks like an action movie that was running out of cash.The action that we do get to see is plentiful and fun. Plausibility and realism takes a timeout as we get insane chases dozens of explosions and plenty of fights. There is very little slowdown very little time for the audience to breathe. The CGI is sometimes a bit much but doesn't distract too much from the movie. Adding to the mayhem is the dozens of plot twists and turns which range from small to changing the flick entirely. Unfortunately it seems like it was edited by someone with a samurai sword and too much sugar in his blood.Bottom Line While it could have been so much more and could have really been something truly special Knight and Day is still an admirable movie thanks to its leadseven if age is starting to catch up to them. With a crazy script edited in a crazy manner this movie is far from your average summer movie and is a mildly refreshing visual trip around the world. No sequel or remake connections here as the plot is unique even if the action is your usual CGIheavy fare. The directing editing and content choices however keep it from truly hitting the big leagues. But if you want something different and sequelfree to watch this summer without screaming for mercy as the movie continues then Knight and Day is your flick. Unique concept unique movie unique flaws.".

With a budget of over 120 million Knight and Day looks like an action movie that was running out of cash.The action that we do get to see is plentiful and fun. Plausibility and realism takes a timeout as we get insane chases dozens of explosions and plenty of fights. There is very little slowdown very little time for the audience to breathe. The CGI is sometimes a bit much but doesn't distract too much from the movie. Adding to the mayhem is the dozens of plot twists and turns which range from small to changing the flick entirely. Unfortunately it seems like it was edited by someone with a samurai sword and too much sugar in his blood.Bottom Line While it could have been so much more and could have really been something truly special Knight and Day is still an admirable movie thanks to its leadseven if age is starting to catch up to them. With a crazy script edited in a crazy manner this movie is far from your average summer movie and is a mildly refreshing visual trip around the world. No sequel or remake connections here as the plot is unique even if the action is your usual CGIheavy fare. The directing editing and content choices however keep it from truly hitting the big leagues. But if you want something different and sequelfree to watch this summer without screaming for mercy as the movie continues then Knight and Day is your flick. Unique concept unique movie unique flaws.";

Very humorous banter action flowed well never a dull moment and the acting and chemistry worked for my wife and I. I'm not sure why there is any comparison to Mr. and Mrs. Smith as I couldn't see any communality other than there being a woman and man in the title character. Anyway if you're looking for an entertaining movie that moves well and is pretty funny then you'll like this film. Not going to make it for an Emmy but certainly delivers on what it was expected to deliver. Didn't mention this but for some reason they had one showing at our Cinemark and so bought some tickets in the morning. Definitely worth the ticket price.".

I as well as you are tired of formulaic Hollywood movies that are disposable and provide little to no new elements to the table. This is the exact opposite of what the final product is of this film. Knight and Day brings many twists and turns it is far from bythenumbers and is easily unforgettable. For starters the action is quite remarkable and pretty darn satisfying. And the movie was just hilarious and had great comic timing. It should mean something when I tell you that the crowded audience was laughing. Not just a few people the WHOLE audience and they took up almost all the seats. Killers a movie that fits under the actioncomedy genre was one that I was looking forward to but was a huge letdown. Knight and Day definitely doesn't disappoint and brings the laughs with the big action. This movie is probably the most fun I've had in a while and this is coming from a very harsh grader and someone that is let down very easily due to high expectations.Knight and Day revolves around Cameron Diaz who is boarding a plane to see her sister April get married. At first she is forbidden to board the plane but then the flight attendant finds a seat for her. And guess who Diaz sits next to? The inevitable Tom Cruise. After having a little talk with the pilot the passengers and the flight attendant him and Diaz seek out to hunt down the antagonists one which is played by Peter Sarsgaard. Although Cruise warns Diaz that the bad guys will say that they are the FBI and will pretend she's in a safe place. However through further investigation Diaz may think that Cruise is unto something. In the meantime the bad guys are looking for the battery and are not too thrilled about who holds its possession.First let's get to the positives. First off I liked that this movie established character development. Most actioncomedy films fail to fully flesh out are leads and then we aren't registered with them. 310 to Yuma director makes us care about these characters and when put in a tough situation we just hope the best. Second of all I thought the script was great. I thought this movie had some really funny oneliners and the film had great comic timing. It couldn't have been better. Thirdly I thought that the performances were great. All the characters did their job and even stood out especially Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise. Diaz and Cruise also had wonderful chemistry and their relationship never felt forced or phony. It came out as very authentic rather than artificial and syrupy. Moreover I thought the film's pacing was excellent. The film is shy of two hours yet feels like half of that. After the film was over I thought there would be at least another hour added. Furthermore I thought the action was awesome. It definitely delivered and this is the best action I've seen in a long time. And lastly the cinematography was just amazing. I loved the scenery and great production values I must add.There are very minimal flaws with this movie. However there are some. First of all I know this film is intentionally nonsensical but some scenes went so overthetop that when it occasionally was meant to be serious it came off as cheesy or laugh worthy fortunately like I said occasionally. Second of all I enjoyed this movie so much that I just wish it were longer. Overall Knight and Day is a great film because of its fresh script great performances amazing action great comic timing breathtaking cinematography and a fascinating direction. And for the first time it's actually not mindless! If you keep your brain on you'll still thoroughly enjoy it. If you were disappointed by Killers don't worry so was I because you will still like this movie. Shoot I enjoyed it so much I think it's even better than Mr.  Mrs. Smith which I liked. Knight and Day is one of those rare movies that just works on every level and is one of those rare movies that is worth full admission. See it at night with a large crowd with a big bucket of popcorn and a drink and you'll have a blast. I enjoyed the movie so much that I wanted it to last from Knight to Day. It comes highly recommended.".

Not really but certainly dozens of sources have been gleefully plundered. A close comparison is early 'Bourne' with Diaz's Franka Potente to Cruise's Matt Damon but with the humor braggadocio and indifference to logic of the original James Bond stories.This couple in adversity like the 'Bourne' one is a linkage that comes about seemingly by accident when Joan Havens Diaz happens to wind up on a nearly empty plane to Kansas City that Roy Miller Cruise hijacks after its crew tries to kill him. Miller is a CIA man or a former one. He's gone rogue or so some say. He's also in possession of some kind of inexhaustible energy source MacGuffin thingie created by a brilliant teenager nerd pal of his called Simon Feck Paul Dano. Naturally everybody wants to get hold of this thingie and later of young Simon. Sarsgaard is a CIA agent called Fitzgerald who's chasing Roy and his boss is a black lady called Isabel Viola Davis. Joan who rebuilds classic American cars is on her way to her sister's wedding. The greatest tribute to Roy's skill and a sign of his attention to the human side of things is that he gets her to the wedding after a few car explosions and chases and dozens of dead bodies. Roy has two main ways of relating to people. He kisses them or he kills them. There isn't time for much else. Cruise carries this off with panache. Diaz is equal to the demands of her role ditsy  but glamorous and sexy  blonde who's also a Charlie's Angel.When the stuff happens on the plane at the beginning it's not remotely believable. It isn't meant to be. How believable is any blockbuster action? How believable is anything anywhere? 'Knight and Day' establishes right away watch how the plane rocks when there's turbulence that this is a garish overthetop comedy. The ridiculous opening sequence clearly establishes that this is an outrageous comedy  and a romance  as much as it's an actioner. The filmmakers are simply betting that the vivacity of the action and the charm of the stars will get you involved and that involvement will grow rather than diminish as the story progresses. The action is preposterous but the protagonists are in trouble so you forget it's silly and start to worry  but you don't forget to laugh and you're meant to. The movie manages to ramp up all three aspects and keep the cocktail stirred. This is a shameless effort to appeal simultaneously to three different genre demographics Comedy Action Romance. And it just may succeed.Is this Ron Miller Tom Cruise a man on a crucial mission  or an outofcontrol nut case? This is the question this movie poses and this is a role that both Cruise's friends and his enemies may find appropriate. . . But to stick with this movie and enjoy its wild actionromancecomedy ride you need to set aside any feelings the actor's couchjumping antics may have awakened and focus on the great movies he has been in observe how well he and ace comedienne Cameron Diaz work together and there's entertainment to be had here.'Knight and Day' is completely empty and pointless but also quite a lot of fun. It's too long like so many of the new pictures and contains such a rich indigestible mlange of action stuff  somersaulting cars exploding on highways shootouts chases fires  and such lush locations including Pamplona at bull run time picturesque Austrian towns Langley and the Orient Express you feel overfed. But then you walk out and it's all pleasantly forgotten except for Tom Cruise's manic smile and Cameron Diaz's look of wideeyed astonishment which are enough to take home from a summer blockbuster in a season when one of the NY Times' lead critics praises Jonah Hex and Pixar's strungout third installment of Toy Story is hailed as a masterpiece.Empty of solid content though it may be 'Knight and Day' succeeds for one thing because it does something woefully lacking in today's blockbusters  alternates the heavy action with quiet times. Here they're usually romantic pauses in which the lady Diaz changes into something more comfortable. Joe Carnahan who has a sense of humor and knows his way around toughguy scenes should have kept this in mind when he made 'The ATeam' a movie that never lets up and consequently leaves you just feeling weary. You remember nothing but Liam Neeson puffing on cigars in a movie he should never have been in. 'Knight and Day' has sense enough to give its leads appropriate roles and let you catch your breath every now and then.In development this movie went through various titles the one it landed with 'Knight and Day' only makes sense at the end and even then won't hit you over the head with its logic. 'K  D' also went through many writers  at least nine. Considering that it's a tribute to director and cast that the whole thing hangs together as well as it does and the different sequences don't just feel like pieces in a disassembled puzzle.Tom Cruise's character is invincible and his accidental partner Joan tends to get overexcited or lose her ability to cope with the gangs of assassins the 90mileanhour car chases and the explosions and Roy resorts to drugging her so he can whisk them both safely away. From being scared and dubious Joan begins to have more and more confidence in Roy and as this turns to attraction she shows startling abilities of her own you've got skills Roy tells her. Indeed. And however preposterous so does 'Knight and Day.'".

Second of all I enjoyed this movie so much that I just wish it were longer. Overall Knight and Day is a great film because of its fresh script great performances amazing action great comic timing breathtaking cinematography and a fascinating direction. And for the first time it's actually not mindless! If you keep your brain on you'll still thoroughly enjoy it. If you were disappointed by Killers don't worry so was I because you will still like this movie. Shoot I enjoyed it so much I think it's even better than Mr.  Mrs. Smith which I liked. Knight and Day is one of those rare movies that just works on every level and is one of those rare movies that is worth full admission. See it at night with a large crowd with a big bucket of popcorn and a drink and you'll have a blast. I enjoyed the movie so much that I wanted it to last from Knight to Day. It comes highly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "To think all of the action that takes place in the Summer blockbuster bait of Knight and Day is because of a special kind of battery. Cameron Diaz works her charm as an auto mechanic her garage primarily focuses on restoring old classic cars. She meets Tom Cruise special agent at the airport gets a ticket on board a flight containing an entire crew and passenger manifest consisting of shadowy assassins attempting to retrieve the batterynot to mention eliminate Cruise who becomes solitary killing machine when Diaz hits the lady's room.The rest of the movie has poor Diaz mixed up in Cruise's global cat and mouse with the company he was once employed with FBI or CIA some sort of governmental entity which trains special agents and assigns them tasks and operations to perform.Knight and Day is standard absurd escapist fare designed to cater to a crowd expecting thrills while munching on popcorn. Cruise's agent can accomplish stunning feats like multitasking when the enemy is after him such as keeping his equilibrium in check despite having to shoot different weapons while on the top of cars as a number of people are firing machine guns in his direction. His motorcycle ride with Cameron as his passenger through the streets of a Spanish city during the running of the bulls and how Cruise constantly avoids certain death while people are chasing him is as preposterous and exciting as it gets. There are plenty of James Bond type heroics for Cruise here but to be honest he's essentially sliding into the vacant chair Sly and Arnold filled during the 80s and 90s. The violence to those Cruise annihilates is shot in a manner befitting a larger viewing audience no graphic bloodshed despite the climbing body count and use of artillery. Knight and Day has the stunning locations typical of a globetrotting action movie such as a train in the Alps or the many places in Spain. Perhaps the biggest action sequence occurs in Boston where Diaz' character lives.Subplots include Diaz preparing for her sister's nuptials and discovering Cruise's parents home they believe he's dead Paul Dano's misfit genius who invented the batter constantly in peril with Cruise his protector although Cruise treats him like a big brother Peter Sarsgaard as the agent out to catch Cruise he's actually the villain who wants the battery and framed Cruise as the rogue agent who betrayed his government and Jordi Moll as Antonio also wanting the battery because of its value using the many Spanish henchmen as his disposal in order to do so. Diaz finds herself kneedeep in espionage inadvertently even one point having herself kidnapped by Antonio so that she can reunite with Cruise when they are separated. One funny scene has Diaz drugged by Antonio with a truth serum so that she can unveil the location of the battery but all it does is cause her to ramble about everything except what he desires it gets even funnier when Cruise storms Antonio's compound to rescue her and she admits they would probably have great sex!. Knight and Day has the usual mixture of romance comedy and ridiculous superhuman abilities of its hero and heroine since Diaz even performs some pretty impressive feats such as driving a car from the back seat while hunching over a dead driver while Cruise is dangling from different areas of the vehicle not to mention shooting a gun while sitting in Cruise's lap as he is driving the motorcycle through crowded streets and alleys with constant gunfire aimed right at them we expect from a movie designed to target a large opening weekend during the summer. Sarsgaard a fine actor is really on autopilot here not asked to do much except connive and plot his strategy for getting the battery. Cruise has several scenes including the flight from Wichita and on board the train where he must combat highly skilled assassins where he must use Jason Bourne type martial arts skills.The use of a knockout drug which subdues Diaz and even Cruise at the end so that Cruise can keep her from hysterics is an interesting device which shows a skewed perspective from the pointofview of the one under its influence how she can visualize in a haze certain moments awakening for brief intervals before finally returning to a lucid state it also allows the director to avoid showing how Cruise gets Diaz out of a seemingly impossible trap with a veritable army of Antonio's men in a warehouse and to an island off the grid.".

	schema:reviewBody "As you know from my reviews I hate romantic comedies. Especially PG13 one's that refuse to take any risks whatsoever and are so family friendly that it becomes ridicules. But when I see stronger performers like Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz I have a little more faith. Now granted not the best actors of our time but I'd rather see them than Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl. So I wanted to give this movie a very fair chance and over all as predictable and stupid as it was I still had a good time watching it. There were some really stupid moments but if something is funny why not laugh? Tom Cruise is great at playing this smooth killer agent and Cameron Diaz was also good as the naive bystander who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when she meets him. What makes this film work in my opinion is the chemistry between Cruise and Diaz they have worked together before in Vanilla Sky. I thought they were pretty decent together then and now they're showing that they can really work together well in a film. They made this stupid story work.Roy Miller and June Havens bump into each other twice at the airport. Completely taken with Miller Havens goes to the restroom and the remaining passengers all attack Roy he calmly informs June that everyone on the plane is dead including the pilots. Believing it a joke Junr plays along until Roy enters the cockpit. Crashing into a corn field Miller delivers Havens home after drugging her and explaining that other agents will visit and that they are planning to kill or imprison her. The next day June is picked up by a group of intelligence agents. Roy arrives and through a long gunfight on the highway kills several agents and saves June. Roy explains that June is safer with him and she agrees to follow him as they go to pick up Simon Feck a genius inventor who created a perpetual energy battery called the Zephyr. As it turns out that Roy is being framed by his former partner saying that he will sell the Zephyr to terrorists. But June must figure out who she can trust in this crazy situation.While the story is beyond predictable and we have to have a lot of suspension in disbelief with it as well I think it's something you can enjoy if you just let go and have a good time. I hate saying this as you know how I feel about this genre of romantic comedy. But it's one of those movies you could get a very good chuckle out of. I loved the scene where Cameron is taken by the FBI for the first time and she gets into a nasty car chase as people are shooting at her and Cruise just lands on top of her car like it's something he does every day and just talks to her calmly. Also the scene between her her ex boyfriend and Cruise in the diner was very funny. Like I said it's the actors that make this lousy story work even if the characters are under developed. I think this movie is an example of mindless fun so just let go and have fun with this one.610".

Cameron Diaz has one of the best grins and Tom Cruise is still a hunk and a charmer they make us enjoy the movie with all its stupid contrived plots and overwhelming action sequences. Me and my friends all loved the movie. I didn't know its genre and hadn't seen the trailers for the movie but went to see it as I am a fan of both Cruise and Diaz. After the dramatic Valkyrie which was in 2008 took a full 2 years for Tom to make another movie! it was good to see Tom back in a mindless action movie. Diaz and Tom team up again after a long time. In 'Vanilla Sky' they didn't have enough screen time together. Director James Mangold knows that this isn't a movie which has to be taken seriously and has made the actors have fun with it. The cgi effects are quite well done obviously and the cinematography is excellent. Most of the locations are just so grand and beautiful. Not to forget the excellent bull chase scene in Spain which was awesome. Carrying a bagful of metal junk to repair her father's old car June Havens Cameron Diaz is on her way to her sister's wedding when she accidentally bumps into Roy Miller Tom Cruise a charming and handsome man. After repeatedly bumping into each other at the airport and finally finding out that they are on the same flight they just flirt with each other. She finds out during the course of a rather entertaining flight that Roy is a rogue FBI agent whose intentions is not exactly clear in the beginning. She is smack in the middle of all the chaos just because she happens to be a witness to something called the Zephyr a perpetual energy source. June has to figure out who she can trust in this crazy situation the FBI or Roy? During the course of the story June and Roy travel all over the globe Massachusetts California Austria Jamaican Islands Illinois Spain among others to keep the Zephyr away from the bad guys. The FBI and many others are after Roy and the Zephyr but it turns out that Roy is being framed by his former partner who wants to sell the Zephyr to terrorists. Will June and Roy make it out of this mess in one piece? There is also a subplot involving Roy Miller's parents. They think that their son is dead but they don't know that Roy is keeping an eye on his parents for their safety. That was done just to give a background story on Roy's character. There are a couple of scenes which were definitely more suited for some other genre Roy disappears from a room when the SWAT team is coming from all the exits of the room and a moment later we are shown him running across the roof top of the opposite building at full speed. That was a scene more suited for the supernatural genre. Well he is more like Superman than an ordinary person here anyway so I can forgive that. Tom Cruise is definitely ageing gracefully he has lost some of his famous boyish looks but his acting still packs a punch. Cameron Diaz looks gorgeous and still has her comedic timing intact. There are a few scenes where she looks old and haggard at times but it is understandable as she isn't exactly the new kid on the block. The movie has equal amounts of nonstop banter between Miller and June romantic tension and an overdose of extremely well choreographed action sequences. Plotwise Knight  Day doesn't offer anything new nor do we expect it to be anything new. It is a tried and tested plot of an agent out to protect something and in this case the thing happens to be a source of infinite energy which could solve the energy crisis around the world. Do we really care about this Zephyr? Not a chance because it could have been anything and still we wouldn't care about it in the least bit. All we want to see is Tom and Diaz create their magic on screen. One scene I really loved is when there is a chase scene and Roy jumps off from a motorbike and lands on the FBI car and tells calmly to June that her dress is beautiful while killing off all the agents! The exboyfriend scenes were also very funny. Tom Cruise still creates the magic and you have to watch this if you are a hardcore Cruise fan the comedy and action provides wholesome entertainment. 810".

That's the end of all the positive comments I have for this film.The negative comments are for just about everything else in this summer blockbuster. It is billed as an ActionComedy. There is plenty of action though much of it is so farfetched and ridiculous. There is almost no comedy. The rapid fire banter between Cruise and Diaz would have been much more effective had it been well written.A quality action movie needs a real force coming from the bad guy. Here the filmmakers instead provide us with a is he a good guy or a bad guy story line with Cruise. Anyone surprised at the real answer? Because of that we don't have anyone to root against. Some generic Spainish arms dealer played by Jordi Molla Blow and the government agent played generically by Peter Saarsgard. Generic is not a word you want associated with your movie.This is Cruise and Diaz together for the first time since the farsuperior Vanilla Sky. They both deserve better than this slop though I feel confident they had a good time with the globetrotting to Spain Austria Jamaica and a few U.S. stops in between. The fun they had filming did not translate into fun for me as a viewer. In fact as they were driving away I kept hoping for an ending like Thelma and Louise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rama's SCREENKNIGHT AND DAY is one of the most fun you'll have at the movies this summer. Fasten your seatbelt and leave the drive at 'Cruise' control. It's nonstop action entertaining mysterious thrilling and full of surprises. What The Bounty Hunter and Killers failed KNIGHT AND DAY excels. The combination of romcom and action is as worth watching as the chemistry between Cruise and Diaz who by the way are not only comfortable with each other they really claim their roles and own this genre like it's nobody else's business.Imagine a less serious Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible or Ethan Hunt with the just the right shot of effective comedy and you'll have yourself KNIGHT AND DAY. In a way it is kinda like the True Lies of this decade. Just like Jamie Lee Curtis June Diaz panics most of the time and just like Arnold Roy Cruise would smoothly save her ass from flying bullets. And Jamie eventually becomes part of Arnold's team. But what makes KNIGHT AND DAY more interesting is its ability to keep you guessing who might actually be the bad guy. I'm not saying action sequences are not gonna be far fetched but this is the kind of movie that you just have to allow to be what it is because it's got enough twists and turns to get you smilin' and satisfied.After Girl Interrupted Cop Land Walk The Line Identity 310 To Yuma and then this I think it's safe to say that director James Mangold's name is synonymous with good quality films. The difference is Mangold relaxes a bit with KNIGHT AND DAY it emphasizes on making Roy Miller seem ten times more invincible than James Bond. There are scenes when Roy and June get captured but after a few minutes of unconsciousness and trying to regain consciousness on June's part Roy suddenly gets June in a safe place all over again. Sometimes it makes you wish you could see what's going on or how Roy gets them out of that situation but you won't mind it at all because that's when the comedy comes in along with the interaction between the two characters that will definitely crack you up.If there's one thing I think could be tweaked is that the runtime might be a bit long but hey I'd rather have this than The Bounty Hunter where it completely doesn't make sense how Aniston and Butler got around to like each other after all their annoying arguments. In KNIGHT AND DAY it's not tough for June to fall for Roy who is always there as her knight in shining armor besides girls love mysterious men. KNIGHT AND DAY feeds on that stereotype so much so that when her opinion about Roy is compromised they've spent enough time together that she can somewhat eventually calculate his moves or at least attempts to. I think Roy is amused by June he enjoys saving her despite going through all kinds of trouble doing so. He admires her attention to family the very thing that he as a spy is forced to leave behind. So there's very little confusion as to how on earth that these two different characters end up in a wacky but convincing romance. It definitely helps to have Cruise and Cameron in the lead. Cruise is charming and badass and it's funny that his character remains polite even in the middle of chaos. Cameron is sexy and irresistible because even when she's panicking she doesn't get to the point in which she'll irritate you.Rama's SCREEN".

	schema:headline " Fluffy Action Comedy with Appealing Cast";
	schema:reviewBody "Although far inferior in both concept and results Knight and Day has its roots in the classic screwball comedies of the 1930's. Cute seemingly coincidental airport encounters connect an attractive blonde Cameron Diaz who is en route to her sister's wedding with a handsome man of mystery Tom Cruise and a series of wildly improbable events ensues. An early scene aboard a nearempty airliner is perhaps the film's highlight as Cruise does battle with unknown assailants while a blissfully unaware Diaz primps in the restroom intent on seducing Cruise. Perhaps if the humor and pace of this scene had been sustained the film would have been more successful. If Cary Grant were the dashing stranger and Katharine Hepburn the unwitting accomplice the film would have been classic.However while they are attractive leads Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are not Grant and Hepburn. Although the pair have undeniable star power and seem to be having fun their eyes were likely focused more on the paycheck than on the superficial script which lacks the witty exchanges of classic screwball comedy. Also appearing for the money is a talented supporting cast that includes Viola Davis Peter Sarsgaard and Paul Dano unfortunately none of these gifted performers have roles that stretch their acting skills. With chases gunfights and rapid cutting director James Mangold keeps the film moving at breakneck speed as the cast chases a McGuffin in the form of a super battery whose importance is often lost in the sometimes confusing proceedings.Although even the classic screwball comedies stretched credibility Mangold's film uses CGI to create sequences that are beyond preposterous. At times Cruise seems to be a superhero with supernatural powers his close encounters are unbelievable even for a Batman or Fantastic Four. As the complicated plot unfolds the characters' motivations seem to shift and the audience is kept guessing as to who can and cannot be trusted and who is working for whom. The action light comedy and appealing performers will hold viewer interest throughout although like cotton candy this fluffy piece will fade from memory before the closing credits finish rolling.".

The hero can pilot planes do motor bike stunts race cars through buildings and against heavy oncoming traffic firing guns playing with computers and pulling stunts all at the same time. He always leaves a trail of destruction and dead bad men in his wake but never gets shot himself.

	schema:headline " Over the top corny but entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "While not a success at US cinemas the film performed very well overseas and is enjoyable romp which does not take itself too seriously. Despite the fact that the film's script went through as many as ten different writers the final script no doubt with the director James Mangold having a pretty big influence is fun and entertaining despite some typical tentpole summer release plot contrivances most notably a crass attempt at playing a plane crash for laughs and silly plot twist at the end of the film that leads to a corny and stereotypical climax.These weaknesses are largely offset by fun performance of Tom Cruise who is very good in the role of a darker shiftier wittier and a more morally ambiguous version of his Ethan Hunt persona from Mission Impossible. He handles himself very well throughout the film and his character makes for a good foil for Cameron Diaz  who has fun playing a car mechanic version of Cameron Diaz. The trajectory of her character in the film is far too obvious but despite this there is a lot of fun to be had watching her get there and the on screen chemistry between her and Cruise is charming and draws the audience along.The plot as I have already mentioned is hardly original but despite the aforementioned problems it is pretty impressive for one that has gone through a whole slew of writers. Normally these scripts come out very bad. Director James Mangold is the individual who deserves credit for fashioning the script into an entertaining and satisfying caper film even if the fate of Peter Sarsgaard the CIANSA type operative sent to apprehendkill the Tom Cruise character and who is pretty good in the role is obvious almost within the first ten minutes of the movie.Action sequences are well handled kudos to second unit director Brian Smrzand the digital visual effects are by and large pretty good being handled by a variety of different companies. Editing is polished  and Jon Powell's score helps keep the proceedings brisk and enjoyable and there are subtlety amusing nods to both Bourne and Bond in the music. Director Mangold as usual marshals all these elements together with style and panache to produce a slick fun final product that while hardly original is very enjoyable and leaves you feeling emotionally satisfied when it is over.This is a film that if you simply allow yourself to lap up the experience will find it to be a fun and entertaining experience albeit hardly a profound one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Funny Pasta western that packs action  thrills  slapdash  slapstick  brawls and laughs . This exciting picture contains Western noisy action  gunplay  fun situations and bits of humor . The film gets the comic remarks from Western parody united the features of typical Spaghetti . Offbeat Western comedy with a hero named Tricky who looks partially Sartana . It is a bemusing SW with lots of mayhem  crossfire and nutty incidents  however  being slightly mediocre . This time the new hero is named Tresette or Tricky Dicky George Hilton who carries a surprise box which displays unexpected and magic resources . He is a elegant gunman and his sheriff companion is called Bambi Chris Huerta  they are hired by a powerful banker  MacPherson Umberto D'Orsi to transport a cash that is being robbed by bandits . Both of whom join forces to deliver a million dollars in gold by traveling in a medicinecarriage through ganginfested lands  while in disguise . As Tricky poses as a seller  along the way he is selling elixirs  magical hair lotions  medicines  and many other things . Being accompanied by the sympathetic chubby Bambi who has a hatted horse called Mr. Thompson . The resourceful hero  freelance gunman  named Tricky Dicky appears to chase nasty gunfighters  as well as to transport a valuable gold stash . The confrontation will be inevitable between the mean cutthroats Nello Pazzafini  villainous gunslingers Salvatore Borghese and  of course  Tricky. Silly slapstick eurowestern Terence HillBud Spencer style . Amusingly starred by George Hilton it is plenty of action  shootouts  tonguefirmly in cheek  doublecrosses  fights with lots of punches  kickass  bounds  leaps  twists and loads of shots . The movie takes parts from Enzo Barboni movies such as Trinity is my name and Trinity is still my name . The film is filled with action  fun  brawls  shootouts and surprisefilled entertainment . It does eventually outstay its welcome  and there are a surprising amount of fights and laughter . This is a regular FaglioliSpaghetti Western in Trinity and Bambino style and that's why there is a cult to idiocy surrealism  silliness  dirtiness with an appropriately goofy tone  customary issue in this subgenre . The picture contains funny gunplay along with fistfight very much in the Terence HillBud Spencer territory . The violence isn't crude but suits the lightweight comedy fun and silly slapstick like the Trinity series . It certainly has an enthusiastic cast  plenty of slapstick  some very impressive gymnastics  especially in the massive fight sequences . The movie is running out of ideas a bit  nevertheless  it is still good enough to be fun . Tricky is a twofisted and tough gunfighter with technical weaponry and a lot of tricks similarly to previous Sabata .Tricky is another hero of second class in the S.W. genre as Sabata Lee Van Cleef and Sartana Gianni Garco . The Uruguayborn George Hilton was a Spaghetti firststar such as  Sartana no perdone  Go kill and come back  Kitosch  They call me Alleluja  Ruthless four  Alleluja for Django  and also played successful Giallio as The strange vice of Mrs Wardh  The scorpion's tale All colors of the dark  My deal Killer . He teams up  as coprotagonist  with the Spanish Chris Huerta  he is one  along with Tito Garcia  Ricardo Palacios  Pedro Snchez and the great Fernando Sancho of the ordinary support characters who accompanied to starring in the multiple SpaghettiPaella Westerns of the 60s and 70s . The movie gets the usual Italian Western issues  such as greedy antiheroes  violent facing off  quick zooms  exaggerated baddies  among them . It appears ordinary secondary actors who are habitual in Italian Western and Peplum genre  such as  Ida Galli or Evelyn Stewart  Nello Pazzafini  Sal Borgese  Fortunato Arena  Goffredo Unger and a moustachoed Rosalba Neri . This bewildering picture gets the humorous remarks from Western parody combined to features of Spaghetti picture and was middlingly directed by Giuliano Carmineo or Anthony Scott  who directed Westerns with Spaghettihero named Sartana  usually played by Gianni Garco and George Hilton . Giuliano Carmineo  alias Anthony Ascott directed various Sartana with George Hilton who replaces Gianni Garco  as Hilton played more natural and roguish than Garco who was cold and peculiar . Giuliano Carmineo realized several Spaghettis  most of them featuring mainly the same cast again  such as Di Tresette Ce N' Uno Tutti Gli Altri son Nessuno Uomo Avvisato Mezzo Ammazzato... Parola Di Spirito Santo original title or His Name Was Holy Ghost Lo Chiamavano Tresette... Giocava Sempre Col Morto that actually was the last time George HiltonChris Huerta and Carnimeo worked on such a western comedy together  The moment to kill Find a place to die  They call him Cemetery  They call me Hallaluya  and the Sartana movies  Have a Good Funeral My Friend Sartana Will Pay  Sartana the gravedigger'69 Sartana's Coming Get Your Coffins Ready  Light the fuse Sartana is coming1971  among others . Giuliano also directed other kinds of genres  as SciFi  Exterminators of the year 3000 Computron Giallo  The case of the bloody iris  Crime thriller  Secrets of a Call Girl  Buddy movie films  Convoy Buddies or Kid Stuff  The Diamond Peddlers . This They Called Him the Player with the Dead or In the West There Was a Man Named Invincible is clearly inferior to his entries in Sartana series . Rating  510 . Average but amusing .".

At first I thought it was just a silly movie but the adult humor became evident and I stopped watching after an hour. I don't have anything against goofy westerns and some of the slapstick made me laugh a few times but if you love westerns and want to share them with kids I'm 18 but I wasn't the youngest one watching so I had to turn I recommend My Name is Nobody.

Besides Hawn is always worth a look.  from ";

It should have been even less. The plot is predictable  Italian male professional married with family has to leave town because of a family crisis. When he can't persuade a woman with whom he had an affair a year previously to come with him on his trip he takes in her place an American woman played by Hawn who happens to be staying with the first woman. The story is an attempt to develop the relationship between Hawn and Giannini. Some of the element of unbelievability comes from the unbelievable boorishness of the latter. Some of it is contributed by the jumps in continuity. And the poor color control of my disc did not help. Oh and did I mention the dubbing? There were some interesting insights into Italian family life and there were some revelations in the last quarter of the movie that in a better director's hands would have portrayed some aspects of Italian family life to much greater effect. The funeral becomes a very interesting occasion.There is brief nudity near the start and near the end of the film.".

Goldie made this one just after Foul Play. Giannini had also been nominated for an Oscar. The trivia says this was going to be a Fellini project so as odd as it is its probably more normal than if HE had done it! This was finally directed by Mario Monicelli who had been nominated for two Oscars for best writing in the 1960s. Overall its pretty good just a shame that Sophia Loren couldn't make it way back when. IMDb thinks the run time is 120 minutes but the DVD from DML is only 95 minutes so this version is missing a whole chunk. i will try to add this run time to IMDb.".

Suddenly he feels a lot of guilt for who he has become  successful spoiled and arrogant. He also brings her to a tourist island but because it is off season everything is closed. Lastly there is a funny scene at the end during the funeral of the father that everyone reveals their spites suspicions and jealousies. All in all it wasn't the typically romantic Italian movie.

Unfortunately it was brutally cut and reedited when it was released here so it never gained the popularity and acclaim that it deserved. It's the story of an American businessman in Berlin who is drawn into a secretive world of conspiracies spies and murder. Everyone in this movie is lying to him with the single exception of the police inspector played by a preGoldfinger Gert Frobe. But it's also the movie that effectively laid down the basic rules of the modern spy thriller the handsome and welldressed leading man who is equally at home with a gun a girl or a drink in his hand the megalomaniacal and shadowy villain with plans for world domination the gadgetry and surveillance the hidden lair etc. Don't be put off by the fact that it's a foreign black and white movie  this is an exciting story told by a master director who has been unforgivably forgotten.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse represents my first venture into the world of Dr. Mabuse. Pigeonholing this movie into a single genre is difficult. It's one part traditional krimi one part spy movie and one part thriller. Combined these elements create at least for me a one of a kind experience that I really can't compare with much of anything I've seen before. I refuse to give the normal plot synopsis. Any plot details or other information would ruin the many twists and surprises found in The 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse. Fortunately for me I went into the movie completely blind knowing very little of what to expect. I would suggest not even looking over the IMDb page as vital information is presented on Mabuse's identity. The acting is good from a cast that even if I didn't know all of the names I recognized from years of watching WWII movies. Actors like Gert Forbe Werner Peters and Peter van Eyck give sold performances. Fritz Lang's direction is as competent as ever. The 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse has style to burn. Considering the movie was made more than 45 years ago it still feels remarkably fresh. The mystery of who Dr. Mabuse is and what his fiendish plan is all about are wonderfully compelling and really pull you into the movie. The jazzy score is impossible to get out of your mind and fits well within the film. In short it's movie like this that keeps me excited about exploring new cinema. If all of my first time viewings could be this entertaining I would be very happy indeed.If The 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse has one weakness it's the slow pace of the second act. The pace grinds to a crawl as the police begin their investigation into the events taking place. While it's fairly interesting and Gert Forbe is a good enough actor there's not enough action in this portion of the film when compared with what came before and what comes afterward. A little more pep in the middle third of the film would have made it a real winner with me. It's a minor issue I have with the film but it's an issue nonetheless.As I wrote previously The 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse is the first Mabuse movie I've seen. After my wonderful experience with the movie it won't be the last.".

Further great performances come from Wolfgang Preiss Dawn Addams and Werner Peters who plays and obtrusive insurance salesman. The movie remains interesting all the time as there's one little twist after another and just when you think that something was predictable another twist is coming up. One noticeable quality of this movie is that director Lang who had fled to the United States in the years of Naziism dares to mention the Nazi times in the movie which allthough only mentioned casually once or twice was more than rare in 1960 a time when popular German movies usually remained as silent as possible about this unpleasant subject.Die 1000 Augen Des Dr. Mabuse is not one of Fritz Lang's masterpieces but it definitely is a highly entertaining and clever mystery that should not leave anybody bored.

It's not that he died shortly afterward he lived till 1976 but he lost his eye sight and by 1964 he was already nearly blind. It feels right that he ended his directing career with a Dr. Mabuse movie. His previous 2 directed Dr. Mabuse movies Dr. Mabuse der Spieler  Ein Bild der Zeit and Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse are among his best and also best known works. He obviously had some real passion and respect for the character of Dr. Mabuse. Why else would he had made 3 movies involving the character over the course of 4 decades. The character is of course also a real intriguing ones. He was one of the first real movie villain in the 1922 movie Dr. Mabuse der Spieler  Ein Bild der Zeit. A character that manipulates influences peoples will all for his own benefits with the help of hypnotic and supernatural powers.Just like 7 of the 8 Dr. Mabuse movies made this movie is shot in atmospheric black  white. Fritz Lang made a few color movies late in his career but for this movie he went back to his beloved black  white. No doubt he did this on intentions to let this movie connect more and better to the previous 2 Dr. Mabuse movie made before this one. After all the last Dr. Mabuse made before this one dates back from 1933.Even though this movie is made 27 years later it's still a direct sequel to to Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse. It makes lots of references to the events which occurred in that movie. However if you haven't seen the previous 2 movies I think you'll also still have a good time watching this movie and understand the events in it. The visual style and style of filmmaking is also mostly the same when compared to the 1933 movie. A style Fritz Lang was of course very experienced in being one of the best directors of the '20's and '30's. Nevertheless the movie is still set in its 'present' day 1960. It makes this a '60's movie in '30's style which also provides the movie with a few clumsiness's and at times makes this movie feel sound and look way more outdated. It therefor can be argued if this was the right approach. No doubt it is also part of the reason why this movie isn't as well known and appreciated as the previous two Dr. Mabuse movies from 1933 and 1922.The cinematography within this movie is especially great and helps to give the movie its own unique atmosphere and old fashioned feeling style.Gert Frbe was really excellent in this movie. He proofs himself once more to be one of the best German actors that ever lived. Ir's fun that many actor appearing in this movie also appeared in the later Dr. Mabuse sequels often in completely different roles including Gert Frbe.It's sort of too bad that the whole movie doesn't have the pace and excitement of the movie its first halve. There is more talking than real thriller or suspense moments in the second part. Still the whole mysterious atmosphere and question 'Who is Dr. Mabuse?' remains present throughout the entire movie. The movie also ends with a real blast and gets surprisingly action filled toward its ending.Yet another real recommendable Dr. Mabuse movie!810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " The Berlin Wall is in that psychotic vision";
	schema:reviewBody "It is interesting to discover or rediscover Fritz Lang. He was well known for one film Metropolis and then for a few American films films he shot in the USA. But the full set of Dr Mabuse's films is fascinating in a way because it provides a rare vision on the German cinema from the early 1920s to 1960. The eye looking at the world from a German point of view that spans over Hitler Nazism and the Second World War is Fritz Lang's. We know him for his highly symbolical Metropolis in which the meaning is built by visual and numerical symbols. In this Dr Mabuse it is different. There are quite a lot of symbols but inherited from the silent cinema of the old days symbols that are there only to make clear a situation that had been depicted previously with pictures and no words or a page of intertitles. Fritz Lang still uses that technique in his 1960 film which is a long time overdue for a silent cinema technique. But that is a style nothing but a way of speaking not a meaning. The meaning is absolutely bizarre. Dr Mabuse is a highly criminal person but his objective is not to commit crimes in order to get richer or whatever. It is to control the world through his criminal activity. The world is seen as basically negative leading to chaos and overexploitation leading to anarchistic crime and nothing else because the only objective of this modern world is to make a profit by all means available. Dr Mabuse is a master mind of his time and for him crime is the only way to destroy that capitalistic world that he never calls capitalistic or Kapitalismus and to replace it with pure chaos that should be able to bring a regeneration a rejuvenating epiphany a refounding experience. We find in his mind what we could find in some of the most important criminal minds in this world like Carlos in France or Charles Manson in the USA or those sects that practice mass suicide in order to liberate the suicidees and to warn the world about the coming apocalypse. It is the mind and thinking of those who practice war as a revolutionary activity with a fundamentalist vision of their religions or politics and the world that is supposed to reflect that religion. They do not want to build a different society and when they are in power they are constantly aiming at antagonizing their own population and the world because they cannot exist if they do not feel some opposition that they can negate bring down crush like in Iran or in Germany with Hitler though later on it was not much different under the Communists in East Germany. These visions need opposition to exist and they provoke that opposition by aiming at taking the control of the world with violence and imposing their control with more violence. That's Dr Mabuse the main brain of a criminal decomposition and recomposition of society on an absolutely antagonistic vision of life. But that vision is very common. Just as common as this phrase a half full glass is nothing but a half empty glass. Add antagonism to that dual vision and then you have a struggle to the death between the half empty glass that wants to be full and the half full glass that wants to be empty or full? one half only wanting to take what the other half has and impose his half to the other half to make the world one by the elimination of the other side of the coin. That dual antagonistic vision is the popular and shrivelled up approach of the communist catechism of Stalin inherited from Marx's French son in law Paul Lafargue or of course in all dictatorship that reduces life to a little red book to one hundred quotations from the master thinker of the revolution. That's the world you feel in these films. Fritz Lang embodies this ideology of the mentally poor in that criminal character of his kill rob steal counterfeit. Even if you die when doing so the world will change and remember. The master criminal has to die in his activity in order to regenerate the world. What Fritz Lang introduced in his double main feature of the early 1920s and in his Testament is that the master brain of this vision internalizes this paranoid and psychotic vision of the world into himself and has to become psychotic himself and it is in his psychosis that he finds the energy to conquer the world again. In the third film Dr Mabuse has been dead for a long time and is reincarnated by someone who finds his inspiration in the doctor. That is a farfetched cinematographic and fictional antic that is necessary as a reference but brings nothing to the vision itself. A few years later that ideology was to conquer our imagination in many ways. First the Berlin Wall became the symbol of that vision the way it was carried and conveyed to the world by the EastGerman communists. Then we have to think of the various revolutionary movements like Der Baader Meinhof Komplex Die Rote Armee Fraktion to take some German examples. But think of the French Mesrine and the Italian revolutionary urban guerilla warfare movements and you will have a fair picture of this psychotic criminal mind copied and pasted into the political field. The Maoist Red Guard and Cultural Revolution movement was quite typical of this approach. All that was going to come in 1960 and we must admit Fritz Lang was seeing ahead of his time just as he had seen Hitler in his Testament of Dr Mabuse a political leader based on hypnosis and mesmerizing people into blindly following a band of criminals.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Paris 8 Saint Denis University Paris 12 Crteil CEGID".

	onyx:emotionText "It is interesting to discover or rediscover Fritz Lang. He was well known for one film Metropolis and then for a few American films films he shot in the USA. But the full set of Dr Mabuse's films is fascinating in a way because it provides a rare vision on the German cinema from the early 1920s to 1960. The eye looking at the world from a German point of view that spans over Hitler Nazism and the Second World War is Fritz Lang's. We know him for his highly symbolical Metropolis in which the meaning is built by visual and numerical symbols. In this Dr Mabuse it is different. There are quite a lot of symbols but inherited from the silent cinema of the old days symbols that are there only to make clear a situation that had been depicted previously with pictures and no words or a page of intertitles. Fritz Lang still uses that technique in his 1960 film which is a long time overdue for a silent cinema technique. But that is a style nothing but a way of speaking not a meaning. The meaning is absolutely bizarre. Dr Mabuse is a highly criminal person but his objective is not to commit crimes in order to get richer or whatever. It is to control the world through his criminal activity. The world is seen as basically negative leading to chaos and overexploitation leading to anarchistic crime and nothing else because the only objective of this modern world is to make a profit by all means available. Dr Mabuse is a master mind of his time and for him crime is the only way to destroy that capitalistic world that he never calls capitalistic or Kapitalismus and to replace it with pure chaos that should be able to bring a regeneration a rejuvenating epiphany a refounding experience. We find in his mind what we could find in some of the most important criminal minds in this world like Carlos in France or Charles Manson in the USA or those sects that practice mass suicide in order to liberate the suicidees and to warn the world about the coming apocalypse. It is the mind and thinking of those who practice war as a revolutionary activity with a fundamentalist vision of their religions or politics and the world that is supposed to reflect that religion. They do not want to build a different society and when they are in power they are constantly aiming at antagonizing their own population and the world because they cannot exist if they do not feel some opposition that they can negate bring down crush like in Iran or in Germany with Hitler though later on it was not much different under the Communists in East Germany. These visions need opposition to exist and they provoke that opposition by aiming at taking the control of the world with violence and imposing their control with more violence. That's Dr Mabuse the main brain of a criminal decomposition and recomposition of society on an absolutely antagonistic vision of life. But that vision is very common. Just as common as this phrase a half full glass is nothing but a half empty glass. Add antagonism to that dual vision and then you have a struggle to the death between the half empty glass that wants to be full and the half full glass that wants to be empty or full? one half only wanting to take what the other half has and impose his half to the other half to make the world one by the elimination of the other side of the coin. That dual antagonistic vision is the popular and shrivelled up approach of the communist catechism of Stalin inherited from Marx's French son in law Paul Lafargue or of course in all dictatorship that reduces life to a little red book to one hundred quotations from the master thinker of the revolution. That's the world you feel in these films. Fritz Lang embodies this ideology of the mentally poor in that criminal character of his kill rob steal counterfeit. Even if you die when doing so the world will change and remember. The master criminal has to die in his activity in order to regenerate the world. What Fritz Lang introduced in his double main feature of the early 1920s and in his Testament is that the master brain of this vision internalizes this paranoid and psychotic vision of the world into himself and has to become psychotic himself and it is in his psychosis that he finds the energy to conquer the world again.

	schema:headline " The Fantastic Testament of Dr. Lang";
	schema:reviewBody "For nearly three decades the visionary and brilliantly gifted writerdirector Fritz Lang lived in the United States because he fled from the Nazis and particularly from Joseph Goebbels who banned all of his previous films. But during the late fifties he returned to his home country Germany and completed the final three films of his rich career. Of course he couldn't retire without dedicating one last film to the character that is probably his most personally dearest and convoluted creation Dr. Mabuse! The ingeniously and aptly titled The 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse is in fact a belated but direct sequel to Lang's 1933 masterpiece The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. It's a convoluted but extremely intelligent and hugely compelling mysterycrime thriller with many characters and even more plot twists and secret story lines to discover. Some of the plot aspects are obvious and predictable but most of the film is very surprising and incredibly fascinating! TV journalist Peter Barker dies in his car in the middle of an intersection but what initially seems to be death by heartattack turns out to be a case of vile murder committed by an ultraadvanced weapon that fires needles of steel into the victims' brains. Police Commissioner Kras was informed about the murder from beforehand by the mysterious blind clairvoyant Peter Cornelius and the modus operandi of the murder is very reminiscent to a murder committed nearly 30 years ago by the henchmen of criminal mastermind Dr. Mabuse. The investigation of this crime as well as several other peculiar and unsolved murders leads to the Luxor Hotel. While commissioner Kras meets up with some interesting people at the bar like an insurance agent and a hotel detective we are introduced to two other guests namely the beautiful young lady Marion who's about to commit suicide by jumping off the hotel's balcony and the gentle and wealthy American industrialist Henry Travers who's courageous enough to save her. What connects all these individual people to the murder of journalist Peter Barker? And what's the link with Dr. Mabuse who allegedly died in a mental asylum 30 years earlier? The 1.000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse almost entirely revolves on suspenseful plotting and the intriguing rebirth of Lang's titular antihero protagonist. This film doesn't feature those beautiful expressionist trademarks anymore like the case in the 1922 and 1933 films. That's okay though since the film was released in an entirely different era and focuses on more contemporary relevant things like espionage and violent gimmicks such as exploding telephones and new kinds of artillery. However one thing that Fritz Lang definitely kept alive in his postWWII Dr. Mabuse movie is the criticism towards Germany's fascist past ha! Apart from a terrific screenplay and a wondrously grim atmosphere The 1.000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse can also rely on a whole series of impeccable acting performances. Gert Frbe known as one of the best James Bond villains in Goldfinger is excellent as the skeptical police inspector in charge of the investigation. Other great performances come from Peter Van Eyck Dawn Addams Wolfgang Preiss and Werner Peters. Cult fanatics will also definitely recognize Jess Franco regular Howard Dr. Orloff Vernon in a delightful supportive role as merciless hit man. The reincarnation of Dr. Mabuse's character also meant the start of several more sixties' sequels and I plan to watch them all  one day. Great stuff warmly recommended to fans of Fritz Lang but also to admirers of good Krimi crime thrillers.".

Police Commissioner Kras was informed about the murder from beforehand by the mysterious blind clairvoyant Peter Cornelius and the modus operandi of the murder is very reminiscent to a murder committed nearly 30 years ago by the henchmen of criminal mastermind Dr. Mabuse. The investigation of this crime as well as several other peculiar and unsolved murders leads to the Luxor Hotel. While commissioner Kras meets up with some interesting people at the bar like an insurance agent and a hotel detective we are introduced to two other guests namely the beautiful young lady Marion who's about to commit suicide by jumping off the hotel's balcony and the gentle and wealthy American industrialist Henry Travers who's courageous enough to save her. What connects all these individual people to the murder of journalist Peter Barker? And what's the link with Dr. Mabuse who allegedly died in a mental asylum 30 years earlier? The 1.000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse almost entirely revolves on suspenseful plotting and the intriguing rebirth of Lang's titular antihero protagonist. This film doesn't feature those beautiful expressionist trademarks anymore like the case in the 1922 and 1933 films. That's okay though since the film was released in an entirely different era and focuses on more contemporary relevant things like espionage and violent gimmicks such as exploding telephones and new kinds of artillery. However one thing that Fritz Lang definitely kept alive in his postWWII Dr. Mabuse movie is the criticism towards Germany's fascist past ha! Apart from a terrific screenplay and a wondrously grim atmosphere The 1.000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse can also rely on a whole series of impeccable acting performances. Gert Frbe known as one of the best James Bond villains in Goldfinger is excellent as the skeptical police inspector in charge of the investigation. Other great performances come from Peter Van Eyck Dawn Addams Wolfgang Preiss and Werner Peters. Cult fanatics will also definitely recognize Jess Franco regular Howard Dr. Orloff Vernon in a delightful supportive role as merciless hit man. The reincarnation of Dr. Mabuse's character also meant the start of several more sixties' sequels and I plan to watch them all  one day. Great stuff warmly recommended to fans of Fritz Lang but also to admirers of good Krimi crime thrillers.";

	schema:reviewBody "Late in life after finding success in Hollywood Fritz Lang returned to Germany after the economic miracle had unfolded and the US had rebuilt West Germany into a modern capitalist democracy. This film the director's last is at first glance a standard if effective thriller. But a remotely less cursory viewing show it to be a critique of the filmmaker's homecountry as he found it upon his return. Most of the action takes place in a hotel that has retained its Naziera capacity for complete surveillance of its inhabitants. This technology falls into the hands of a faceless mastercriminal currently thought dead who once tried to take over the world. To even call this allegory is perhaps a step far. Lang clearly sees in the new Germany a social apparatus waiting to be usurped by a resurgent fascism one that has only become dormant not dead. The only nonradical note in the movie is that the handsome protagonist is an American industrialist a necessary concession perhaps as it was this class of person who financed this film. The location and language is not the only way in which Lang here returns to his roots. The set pieces of the hotel clearly call to mind the Expressionism of his early years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die 1000 Augen des Dr. Mabuse or The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse is a 100minute blackandwhite film from Germany from 1960. And since the creation of Mabuse decades ago there have been so many films about him including some that are wrongly considered classics and also many followed after 1960 even today. This one here has the advantage of the name Fritz Lang attached to it the German silent film legend. But this one here is of course not a silent film anymore. For Lang it was a bit of a return back to the roots with making another Mabuse movie and here we have one of his final works. The cast is decent with Peter van Eyck Gert Frbe Goldfinger a personal favorite Werner Peters and Wolfgang Preiss. It needed a betterwritten and acted character than Addams' though. Unfortunately overall the script did not do too much for me. I have to say without mentioning Mabuse by name this could have been a completely random film about another villain character. The significance attached to its name does not only come from saying the name all the time.It is not a failure by any means but I thought with the cast Lang had he could have made a better film here. Maybe Thea von Harbou's creative touch was missing. Still the movie has a couple solid scenes that were tense and interesting to watch like the one outside the window for example but overall it just felt like all the killing and drama was included to be shocking and mysterious not as ingredients of a meal of an edgeofseat story that had me and other audiences captivated and genuinely caring about what will happen to the characters who will live and who will die. Best thing about the film is clearly the acting but even with how good it was it was not enough to elevate the mediocre script to a level where I could recommend this movie. Thumbs down from me. Don't see it.".

A whodunnit mystery with husband and wife Doris Day and Rex Harrison with other great stars John Gavin Myrna Loy Roddy McDowell and Herbert Marshall.  Doris puts her heart and soul into this and she is good at weeping!  We don't know who is driving her mad until near the end.  Should we tell who done it? See it and I believe you'll like it!  I don't know if Doris was nominated for this.  Does anyone know?";

There is a crazy guy stalking her naturally totally freaking her out. At first it's just a voice coming from whoknowswhere when she's out at night taking a walk. That voice scared me so bad in about 1978 I probably had nightmares for months about it. Even today it gives me chills. Doris Day is incredible as always in a rare dramatic performance. Rex Harrison is equally good as her disconnected hubby. It's so nice to see people like John Williams  Myrna Loy as part of the great cast. The surprise ending was so terrifying to me as a kid why did my parents always let me watch inappropriate movies? I wanted to jump out of my skin  then invite Doris over for dinner  a hot bath! She endured so much as Kit Preston I felt so bad for her! Would recommend to anyone who likes scary suspensefulbut not gorymovies.".

She was so convincing in this role especially when she provided a tour de force in acting during that scene where she finally breaks down. I can't believe other commentators were not as moved by this as I was. Rex Harrison The Ghost and Mrs. Muir Cleopatra My Fair Lady is also very good in this role though I don't think he is challenged very much here. John Williams is once again the diligent inspector as he was in the two Alfred Hitchcock hits Dial M For Murder and To Catch a Thief both of which coincidentally starred Grace Kelly. The great Roddy McDowell Planet of the Apes is here just as a red herring but he is welcome nonetheless. All in all a good thriller 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS. There's nothing spectacularly original about this glossy Hitchcockian thriller but it's likable in its own commercial way. The theme is absolutely routine. Someone repeatedly calls Doris Day in a spooky voice and threatens to kill her. She spends the entire movie trying to get someone to believe her  her husband her friend Peggy her bubbly Aunt Bea the police  and fails. That's it. That's the plot. Except for the last few minutes when things get a little twisted. A lot of people evidently saw the explanation coming but I didn't.Oh of course the story has to be liberally sprinkled with suspicious men who might for one reason or another have a screw loose in their heads and a motive in their minds. John Gavin seems helpful and handsome enough he smokes a pipe and works in his shirt sleeves usually good signs but he has one scene in which he reminisces about a horrifying experience he had during the war trapped in a burning tank and his character stares distractedly ominously into space. Roddy MacDowell is a weaselly guy who tries to pry money out of Day. Anthony Dawson mopes around in the shadows and we don't know who he is or what he wants. His face is scarred and he looks more openly menacing than he did in Dial M For Murder. John Williams basically repeats his detective role from the same film. Sometimes when I have trouble falling asleep I try to force my mind to run through all the times Williams has played a lawyer a detective or an investigator of some kind in an attempt to compare the subtle differences in the performances but I can never find any. By the time I'm entering Stage Two sleep I've run out of detectives and the final fading image is of Williams hawking the classical collection of LPs in a TV commercial  Ahh it's a marvelous collection. Where was I?Oh yes. Williams has seen all this happen before. The husband a busy executive the wife at home bored. Perhaps sexually neglected. Then a few complaints about naughty phone calls and the husband begins to pay attention. Aunt Bea believes Doris at least until she too is sucked into the sneaky caller's web. Now you must understand Rex Harrison as husband Tony WANTS to help her. Really he breathes sympathy. But there is simply no evidence that these threats are coming from anyplace except Day's imagination. The creepy voice that first calls out to her from the fog in a deserted park good scene. The person who pushed her in front of the bus. A shadow passing her bedroom window up on the third floor  or second floor in London. Come to think of it there's a small hole in the plot somewhere along in here. Harrison and his girl friend helpful neighbor Peggy have contrived the entire plot. The creepy phone voice comes from a tape recorder that either Harrison or Peggy play over the phone when they make the filthy calls. The calls then are prerecorded right? So how is it possible for this scene to take place? Day Aunt Bea and Rex are in the flat when the phone rings. Day begs Aunt Bea to answer the phone and take the call just to prove that they're real. Bea answers the phone and claims to be Day but the caller simply asks Why haven't you called me Mrs. Preston? Before she breaks down Day cries that the caller realized it wasn't she who answered the phone. Okay. But since Rex is present in the scene it means the tape was being played by Peggy with whom he is in cahoots. How could such a deceptive tape have been prerecorded? No one knew until the last second that Aunt Bea would answer instead of Day. Well not worth going on about. I may have missed something. The movie is kind of fun. If I don't look forward to watching it I nevertheless enjoy it when I happen to catch it. The score is worth mentioning too. Nice scene in the pub when Gavin is having his supper and watching Dawson. There's a tinkling piano pubstyle in the background and slowly a more ambitious and menacing low counterpoint swells up on the sound track rather neatly done.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whereas Pillow Talk introduced us to the glamorous Doris Day Midnight Lace certainly focused on both the glamorous and the outright beautiful woman. This is the Doris Day movie that over the years has come to be my favourite. No expense was spared in its presentation. Physically everything in it suggested beauty from the set to a stunning ensemble of costumes worn by Doris who could and did give every then current model a run for the money!  All of this was set up brilliantly to contrast the evil surrounding the villain involved in nefarious scheming. The elevator scene and the stairs scenes were particularly effective.  This chillerthriller was engrossing in its presentation and was able to rely on the varied talents of all the fine actors who were used to present it to the public.  I feel that it was an Oscarworthy attempt on Doris' part and she can certainly stand proud for her efforts in the role. Bravo!".

	schema:reviewBody "Doris Day as an American married to an Englishman is being terrorized in Midnight Lace also starring Rex Harrison Myrna Loy Roddy Mcdowall and John Gavin. A scary voice speaks in the fog and calls her up on the phone  but she can't get anyone to believe her even her beloved aunt Loy who wants to help but has her suspicions about her niece's mental health. The midnight lace is a neat title that refers to some sexy pajamas Kit Day buys for her Venetian trip with her husband Harrison.The film is based on a play Matilda Cried Fire and probably owes part of its plot to Dial M for Murder which was also a play and made into a film by Hitchcock. John Williams is on hand in this film as in Dial M as a police inspector.Unlike Dial M for Murder the film abounds with red herrings so there are plenty of suspects. Roddy Mcdowall is the slimy son of Kit's housekeeper and John Gavin is an attractive man who at one point comes to her rescue. There's also her neighbor Peggy Natasha Thompson. The acting is very good the biggest and most dramatic role belonging to Day. Few people have enjoyed the variety of career that Day did. A wholesomelooking singer and vivacious actress she was in in films from 1948. When she was in her late thirties producer Ross Hunter took advantage of her prettiness and beautiful figure and moved her into glamor roles making her the 1 box office star. If she's a little over the top in spots here it's more the material than the actress and she creates a very sympathetic and likable character. Loy at 55 is beautiful and sexy. Harrison doesn't have a great deal to do and Gavin is  well Gavin very handsome and charming. Herbert Marshall is part of the cast as well and along with McDowall Williams and Thompson make up a strong supporting cast.This movie isn't as good as some others of the same type but it is very enjoyable and well produced. One of those great Sunday afternoon movies.Some trivia A poster mentions that Harrison was distracted during the film because of the death of his wife Kay Kendall. He was also distracted by the fact that he and Roddy McDowell had done a play together for which McDowell had won a Tony. The elevator scene where they are all in the elevator together took a while to film so they were all stuck in a small space. McDowell said something and Harrison said Yes and you can stick that Tony up your a too.".

I had not heard of it prior to coming upon it in an opportunity charity shop a few weeks ago but I picked it up for 1.00 because Doris was in it and Rex Harrison and I collect Doris Day movies  among others. Like many of the other reviewers here I find many parallels between this title and any one of Mr Hitchcock's movies and one could be forgiven for thinking that 'Midnight Lace' is a 'Dial M for murder' sequel the mood is so similar. It's that feeling that someone intends to murder this lady Doris but we just wonder when and how. The tension is set from the very beginning and it lasts all the way through the picture to the climactic end. This sameness between the two movies is helped by the fact that John Williams portrays basically the same Scotland Yard Inspector that he played in the former picture and also Miss Day could easily be Grace Kelly in this work both ladies display that same unassuming trusting quality. This movie is a thriller a whodunnit and almost a Hercule Poirot  Miss Marple mystery all rolled into one. You won't be able to help feeling for Doris all through this movie as she tries to navigate her way through normality with a crazed phonecaller shaking her sanity at all times of the day and night. Who can she turn to? Who will believe her? If not the Inspector then her friend Peggy? Her Aunt Bea? Surely her trustworthy husband!! Midnight Lace will hold you spellbound right through and then thump you with a final twist! Checkmate!! 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this one on Encore while staying home from school and I was surprised at the many twists and Hitchcocklike additions. It was really entertaining.Doris Day plays the role of Kit an American woman living in London with her businessman husband Tony. Almost immediately we are introduced to the story of someone threatening her continuously first in a fogshrouded park then over the phone countless times. It gets progressively worse and worse and Tony and her Aunt Bea who has come to stay for a few weeks begin to suspect the credibility in it all.This is a great movie. Fans of Hitchcock may be impressed. And the acting is great. Doris Day is thoroughly convincing especially when she begins to go hysterical at it all after Bea picks up the phone on the mysterious caller. But thoroughout the film she plays a strong character. Bea is also a great character and very amusing. Overall the film does very well. The ending has many twists you don't think to suspect though I would have expected more with the scenes on the scaffolding. Oh well. Still I recommend this film to all Hitchcock fans and anyone who likes older suspense movies. This one is great.".

It was really entertaining.Doris Day plays the role of Kit an American woman living in London with her businessman husband Tony. Almost immediately we are introduced to the story of someone threatening her continuously first in a fogshrouded park then over the phone countless times. It gets progressively worse and worse and Tony and her Aunt Bea who has come to stay for a few weeks begin to suspect the credibility in it all.This is a great movie. Fans of Hitchcock may be impressed. And the acting is great.

	schema:headline " An intensely Hitchcockian film about individual terror gorgeously filmed";
	schema:reviewBody "Midnight Lace Ah the movies were a tough game in 1960. It was hard to outdo t.v. for any lightweight drama or comedy. And when it came to real movie intensity well there was Douglas Sirk or Alfred Hitchcock or maybe Stanley Kubrick and a few others of course...but it was rough sledding for the mainstream moviemakers without a signature style. Enter Doris Day who managed those strained and slightly wonderful comedies Rock Hudson helping out. This is a real drama Myrna Loy and a truly terrific Rex Harrison and even Herbert Marshal make that clear. It comes four years after her famous dramatic role in Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much. And she is good as a rich woman with some insecurities...though I won't say she gives the role depth just conviction. And she has lots of pricey clothes and posh sets to dither and gasp. As Marshall says later on There's nothing wrong with money that having it can't cure. It was weirdly common to set American movies in this period in Europe or Britain so here London is given the travelog treatment between more important scenes. But it starts with a stylized dramatic sequence in the London Fog where Day's character Kit Preston hears a stalker a voice she hears later in an ominous phone call. This should be a Hitchcockian gem and cinematographer Russell Metty is quite impressive making every single scene from a glance to a swooping camera view on a short comment a matter of consequence. Rex Harrison is really impressive as her husbandat ease confident caringand of course he is suspect number one. There is the handsome man overseeing a construction project and the office assistant or two plus an older man and a stranger in a hat. Lots of potential nasty fellows. I don't mean that this is a lighthearted film but it does largely avoid any actual frightfulness the elevator scene is an exception. I have to admit that I was especially happy to see Myrna Loyforever a force that penetrates the doldrums. In all the cast of characters large and small is impressive. So who is director David Miller? A Hollywood mainstay with few exceptional films but he did direct that rather amazing Sudden Fear in a full noir manner. Here he is certainly in top form. I think the feeling of pace staging and development of story are first rate. There was a lot of comment in reviews at the time about how worn the basic idea was a woman in danger from an unseen evil man as with the more celebrated Sorry Wrong Number and so on but taken out of that context this feels rather workable as is. The story flags for half an hour in the middle mostly because the subplots if you can call them that are not enough to sustain the lulls between the main worry. Visually this is not a Technicolor masterpiece it used Kodak's Eastmancolor film and in some ways this is a major drawback but a lot of the film as with a Sirk melodrama has to do with sucking us into the drama almost regardless of the events. It's quite visually well photographed.  Finally it has to be said that Doris Day is sometimes annoying and it isn't all her fault. She's been scripted to be helpless and at times hysterical. She is never given the more natural role of trying to defend herself even by thinking through the options keeping an eye through windows getting advice from other women all the survival things that women would do beyond screaming for help...which she does not do in the final scene even as the police are watching. That final scene is a great example of how superb this film is at its coredramatic and gorgeous in its filming and editing with a taut score and a final twist or two. Hitchcockian for sure.".

And that's why this film is so great!  My favorite part is the decline of Dr. Mittenhand.  It creates a parallel to the life of one man his struggles his torments and his eventual transformation into some sort of demented spiderhuman hybrid.  Who hasn't dealt with that same trama and those same pains in their own lives?  When his metamorphosis is complete and he declares his new identity in the heartwrenching line I am no longer Mittenhand I am Mittenspider! it is a true milestone reached in cinema.And of course the Leprechaun represents the antagonist in us all.  Big evil comes in quite the small package.  The leprechaun in his quest for his gold is simply a puppet of capitalism and corporate greed.  I think we could all learn a big lesson from this little fellow.So to summarize I give this film a 7 because it is slow at points but the occasional leprechaun in the pants scene redeems it all. Bravo!".

This was a very funny movie with the Leprechaun teaming up with a dastardly space princess who wants the Leprechaun's gold. Together the killer their way through a group of hilarious characters but not as hilarious as in Leprechaun 3. Especially the Doctor which Dr. Evil From Austin Powers resembles. Altough this came out in February '97 while the first Austing came out in May '97. Anyway this was the 4th highest renting horror movie of '97. This is the second best Lep movie following behind 3. Both of this were directed by Brian TrenchardSmith and I think he should direct Leprechaun 5 Lep In The Hood Which is going to be theatrical and have more comedy than horror it will star Warwick Davis and IceT and will be set in an inner city Los Angeles neighborhood. It will film in late summer '99.".

This was a very funny movie with the Leprechaun teaming up with a dastardly space princess who wants the Leprechaun's gold. Together the killer their way through a group of hilarious characters but not as hilarious as in Leprechaun 3. Especially the Doctor which Dr. Evil From Austin Powers resembles. Altough this came out in February '97 while the first Austing came out in May '97. Anyway this was the 4th highest renting horror movie of '97. This is the second best Lep movie following behind 3. Both of this were directed by Brian TrenchardSmith and I think he should direct Leprechaun 5 Lep In The Hood Which is going to be theatrical and have more comedy than horror it will star Warwick Davis and IceT and will be set in an inner city Los Angeles neighborhood. It will film in late summer '99.";

	schema:reviewBody "All logic and development is thrown out the window as Leprechaun 4 begins in space with no explanation of how Warwick Davis's character got there. Honestly in all the installments of this film series none of them have any sort of continuity. At less the other films made more sense than this film. I can see the Leprechaun going to Las Vegas to try his luck in Leprechaun 3. I can see Leprechaun in the Hood in the 2000 film but in no way can I picture a Leprechaun in Space!?! Those two things are not even somewhat related. It doesn't mixed. It's like saying let's watch a movie of Cupid dating a black hole or the Easter Bunny mooning the moon people or Santa Claus conquer the Martians. Surprising the Santa Claus's movie I mention is a real movie but you get what I'm saying. Films titles like these are clearly not Oscar gold. So don't come thinking that a movie titled 'Leprechaun in Space' is anything higher than a Bflick film parody. Leprechaun in Space is directed by Brian TrenchardSmith. The film was made as a direct to video horror comedy that parodies other SciFi horror movies like 1979's Alien and its sequel 1986's Aliens. Its takes other film references from 1982's the Thing 1992's Terminator 1977's Star Wars and even 1963's McLintock! The movie even shamelessly ripped off the tagline from Alien In Space NoOne Can Hear You Scream. Like Aliens the movie starts out in the future with a team of Space Marines. The marine are joined by Dr. Tina Reeves Jessica Collins who is assigned to Mortal Kombat Kano rip off Sgt. Hooker Tim Colceri and his squad to find an alien princess named Zarina Rebekah Carlton. Zarina was kidnapped by the Leprechaun Warwick Davis from her home world of Dominia because he wants to make her as his queen. Zarina looks like a Gary Glitter groupie or something out of David Bowie space oddity. Not only is her character very bossy and materialism. She is so clumsy and damsel in distress that you wish she wasn't save. While the Leprechaun is clearly the villain he acts like the hero for protecting her during a fightfire with the Marines jumping on a landmine for her. The Marines capture her for their dear leader a halfman halfrobotic scientist Dr. Mittenhand Guy Siner. He looks and sounds like a Nazi Dalek. Mitterhand wants to use the princess's regenerative DNA to recreate his own body which was mutilated in a failed experiment. The Leprechaun return from the death somehow and vow to save the princess. Honestly I don't know if the Marines are supposed to be the heroes in this film or the Leprechaun. For the most part there is nobody to root for. They're all pretty unlikeable. So honestly I could care less who lives and who dies. For a Rated R film the deaths are not even gory but cartoony as hell. A good example is that one of the victim get his head flatted. Rather than seeing his skull crush in and blood oozing out. We see his head turn into a doughy pizza size. The Leprechaun even forced one of the victim to cross dress in a comedies fashion that is no way serve any purpose than to get an few laughs out. Fans of SciFi might like the lightsaber death but it was bad as they don't even show the victim getting chop. Even the scene where the Leprechaun violently emerges from somebody's penis seem in bad taste and tame. Yes the movie have some over the top absurd ways to kill their characters but in no way are they gruesome. The deaths don't even make sense. How on earth did the Leprechaun find a scorpion and tarantula in space? The movie doesn't explain anything. Like where did Dr. Mittenhand's experimental enlargement ray come from? The film has one of the most unnecessary breast shot in the history of cinema where the princess strips her top to tell the Marines that they are all doom. It doesn't even make any sense. The women in this movie are just made out to look like sex object idiots. There is a scene where a woman get her pants eaten by a mutant just for horny people to watch her run around with her butt nearly expose. The acting is horrendous from everybody that isn't name Warwick Davis. Honestly Warwick Davis has that charming voice that makes you wish he did better films. He has the acting chops for it. He did had some good oneliners. Sadly the Leprechaun doesn't rhyme. The special effects CGI are just bad. I know this was the 1990s and this film was low budget but gees I could do better effects on paint on my old Window 95 computer. The effects on Mitterspider was pretty good for the time. I just wish they didn't use the explosion scene twice in the film. Bad recycling shot right there. The props for the future are just office supplies glue together. The walls of the ship look like cardboard. I like how the film steals sound effects from the Doom video game. This movie might fall into so bad it's good territory for some fans but I don't think the director succeeds in that I think in fact that the movie is so bad it's bad. This was the low of the low. Like a black hole it's sucks. I'm sorry.".

Like a black hole it's sucks. I'm sorry.";

I would compare this to the way I felt about The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides  just an out of place fourth movie of a series. I really wanted it to be good but it just wasn't.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the movie in 2D but to be honest the low rating was not because of the lack of 3D but rather that it was very disappointing. I felt like the movie had a good storyline but it only touched on segments of it rather than expand on it. The Cryogenics with a 12 yr gap did not make any sense. If the little girl was her daughter than how come she had no memory of giving birth. If the hybrid was a test tube baby she would have still come from somewhere unless the female scientist who looked after the child was the real person who gave birth to her? Also when Selene met with Thomas he knew who she was and that she was responsible for killing elders but it didn't really touch on how he knew even though he acted like he was an elder which I do not think he was. As for me the special effects were soso but it was more like watching the first Matrix movie. The scene where she storms the office building and attacks the guards was very similar to scene in the Matrix. It did not really leave much for the imagination.Towards the end of the movie where the bad guys get the upper hand and the plot of the movie it is short lived. The ending of the movie was like when the Empire Strikes Back ended. Just when the movie was getting good and they followed a lead to meet with her hybrid lover the movie ended! Guess there will be another sequel! When the movie ended I looked at my watch and realized that it was just under and hour and 12. There was so much more they could have done with this movie and cranked out another 2030 minutes to complete the storyline.It just seemed as if they filmed the movie in a couple of months. I do not understand how there was a budget of 70 million when the special effects seemed below par. Yet Underworld 3 was budgeted around 35 million.Naturally Kate Beckinsale looked as sexy as ever which probably the highlight of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who came in late the Underworld series is all about the eternal enmity between the nonhuman species of Vampires and Lycans the latter being an evolved race of werewolves. So far we learned all about the centuries of bloodshed and the absolute necessity for the 2 groups never to reconcile.At the heart of the narrative is Selene Kate Beckinsale who was once the pride and joy of the Vampire army till she fell in love with a hybrid part vampire part Lycan and began to question the ethics of her tribe.Underworld Awakening begins with a new development in the world that Selene and Michael inhabit. Thus far the inferior human species has remained unaware of the existence of the other species. Now that covens and nests have been unearthed paranoia strikes and annihilation of nonhumans becomes military priority.Selene and Michael try to leave the area by boat but both are captured and frozen in a lab for research. When Selene awakens she manages to flee from her prison only to find that it is now 12 years later. Lycans are almost extinct there is a weapon that she has and her enemies want it for their evil purpose.This installment of the Underworld franchise has the flimsiest plot the least talented actors except of course for Stephen Rea and the most unsatisfactory climax. In fact this has to be the first movie of the series that leaves loyalists not clamoring for more. The premise is so incredulous and not in a good way that you will stop trying to comprehend the sequence of events that leads Selene to the end of the movie.To make up for the lack of a credible story the makers decided to intersperse every second conversation with visuals of ripped heads severed body parts and plenty of blood. The gore in the movie is not only irrelevant but also added for shock value or so it seems.The icing on the cake is the presence of constantly flickering lights. The lab has them the parking lots have them the corridors have them  the civilized world does not seem to believe in proper lighting. What the audience is left with is a semihypnotized sense of being after sitting through all those lights.Kate Beckinsale goes through all the motions of being Selene with the ease of a professional. She has done this to perfection before but this time she seems complacent and bored. To give her credit she has maintained her figure and looks no different than the Selene who first made an appearance almost a decade ago in the first movie of the series.The very talented Stephen Rea plays a villain of sorts in the movie. He does look confused at times as if he wonders why he signed the film. There is no sign of effort from any other member of the cast.The music is more like stock music and production value is inconsequential there's nothing in the film except walls and piers. The fight sequences are not engrossing enough and the spurting blood and flying intestines are distracting.In short the entire movie is a disappointment. If however you insist on watching Underworld Awakening avoid the 3D version and maybe your headache will not be as bad.On a more positive note there is always the hope that the next movie will manage to regain the lost glory of the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "When details finally came out about Underworld Awakening my heart sunk a little. True the second installment wasn't very good and the third was a prequel but I was still looking forward to seeing further adventures of the vampire Selene Kate Beckinsale. As it turns out she's the only returning cast member. Everyone else is gone from the project leaving her the one tie to a series seemingly well past its prime. Awakening also clocks in at under 90 minutes making the first film's two hours seem like days in comparison.The plot this time around is told to us in the form of exposition. After Evolution humans discovered that lycans werewolves and vampires exist and decided to wage war against both mythical creatures. They decided that genocide was the only option and all but wiped out both species. So how did Selene manage to survive? Well she was captured by some scientist folks who decided to keep her alive but frozen for the past twelve years. Michael previously portrayed by Scott Speedman her vampirelycan hybrid lover has presumably died.So you'll be unsurprised to find out that Selene eventually escapes from her prison fits back into that catsuit that she has grown accustomed to and begins trying to find out just what the world has become in her absence. Of course she still believes that Michael is still alive so she sets out on a quest to find him. Meanwhile she's also getting random visions flashing in front of her. It turns out as anyone who has seen Evolution will have assumed she has given birth to a daughter Eve India Eisley and the two are linked via their sight. She can see what Eve can see if they are close to one another.The villain this time around is the head of the scientists a man named Jacob Stephen Rae. I suppose the humans are also the bad guys as they want to kill any vampire they come across although the one human whose name we learn a detective named Sebastian Michael Ealy ends up helping Selene. She's also eventually joined by another vampire David Theo James. Lycans also still exist and they end up becoming more frequent as the film progresses after a plot twist is revealed that you'll probably see coming from a mile away if you haven't already guessed it.There isn't really a central plot that's worth discussing. Underworld Awakening's screenplay reads as both lazy and very loose. It's hard to even reflect back on it and try to remember key moments. It doesn't care about secondary characters they're plot devices and it doesn't care for its main one all that much either although Beckinsale's Selene does have to show a tad bit more emotion than in previous installments. But not much more.Essentially we're here for the action scenes which serve both as the main material as well as the glue that holds it together. In what is probably the most actionpacked and gory iteration in this series Underworld Awakening certainly doesn't have many boring moments. There's no substance to the plot or characters but if you're watching the fourth Underworld film chances are you don't care about that kind of thing. You're here to see Kate Beckinsale in a tight leather catsuit running around doing flips off walls shooting at anything that moves and doing it all with a blue tinge. You get that with Awakening.Initially I couldn't quite put my finger on why I still didn't have a great time with this film. It did most of the things it needed to right and was overall quite exciting. But it lacked substance and I don't just mean in its story and characters. Even at its worst point Evolution the Underworld series has always maintained some depth to the world that the characters inhabit. An entire back story was mapped out and we understood the history of both supernatural clans. Awakening seems dedicated to both ruining and ignoring all of that previous work.Here is a film that's premise involves the destruction of the majority of both species' members. Presumably artifacts and historical documents were also destroyed rendering much of the back story unknown to the survivors. Those who do know like a man named Thomas Charles Dance have no proof of it and have no need to bring it up. The world is no longer an Underworld one instead it's just a generic action movie with vampires and werewolves. All of the work that went into the crafting of this universe is destroyed with Awakening. It almost seemed like directors Mns Mrlind and Bjrn Stein went with this story just so that they didn't have to include any depth even if that depth is what made Underworld well Underworld.Maybe I'm overthinking things. Like I said you're watching Underworld Awakening to see Kate Beckinsale in a bunch of physicsdefying action scenes while dressed in her character's signature leather outfit. You get that here. The action scenes are slick and wellmade the lycans look better than they ever have before and the ending sequence involving at least three distinct battles is satisfactory even if the ending as a whole promises much more than it delivers. I did have a good time even if this installment completely ignores all of the history and back story of its universe. This is a movie for the Underworld fans. If you're one of them you'll have a good time here. Newcomers will want to start at the beginning. If you aren't a fan this one has less depth and more action than earlier iterations so make your decision accordingly.".

	schema:headline " Very disappointed";
	schema:reviewBody "I was excited when I found this movie was coming out. I saw all 3 movies again on DVD 2 times each to be fully prepared. I saw the movie right when I got off work on opening night no matine pricing extra for 3D and I was sorely disappointed. The 3D technology used all the gimmicks that I hate about 3D such as things flying at the screen. That is soooo 1950s. Parts of the 3D near the beginning made it look like I was watching a cartoon or some kind of animation. The inclusion of humans in the main story line really mucked this movie up. The other 3 movies were much more interesting in learning and understanding the cultures and issues between the Lycans and Vampires in this Underworld that humans knew nothing about. If you are going to go above ground if Selene is now a daywalker thanks to Alexander Corvinus if humans are involved it is no longer an Underworld is it? Possible spoilers coming. I liked the new male vampire lead David for himself but felt him playing against Selene made her look like a cougar even though there was no romantic interactions between the two. Don't get me wrong she looked SUPER hot as usual but he was way too young or young looking to be her male lead. The storyline seemed to have themes of every action andor futuristic movie I have ever seen. This movie series should be like a serial an evolving storyline not more bigger badder to try to get butts in the seats. I enjoyed getting to know the previous characters but sadly almost ALL of them are gone. I never got to know the new characters too well because the writing directing andor editing sucked. A Black cop? What a clich. Black characters were used effectively in the previous films but the cop in the new film was a mistake. Also the cop helping out the criminal human killing vampire just because she's hot is also a clich. Cops never abandon their responsibilities for fat smelly biker looking criminals with big hearts. Additionally the cop was a known actor. This is a gimmick. They may as well should have added Sean Connery or Liam Neeson. Great actors but gimmicks. Just like when Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds showed up in the 3rd Blade series. Selene is a death dealer killing Lycans. I was surprised when she killed certain people in the movie like when she dropped the guy out the window who SAID he'd saved her she did not know at the time that he was lying. Also Selene was WAY more acrobatic in terms of frequency and physical ability than the previous movies I did not like this. The Godzilla sized Lycan was ridiculous. They never fully explained whatwhy was going on in the laboratory. There was inconsistency in the other movies too in the fact that when Selene shoots Lycans with bullets they die. However everyone else must use silver bullets? Shooting the floor of the elevator about to crash down on her? Rip off of movie 1. First why did she not just get out of the shaft if she is THAT fast. Secondly even though the floor was shot out that DID NOT or should not stop the circular disk from crashing into her and smashing her. If her skeletal structure is strong enough to withstand this then what's the need to shoot out the floor. In fact if she is immortal other than sunlight which no longer affects her why the need to shoot the floor out of the elevator at all. In fact if she IS a daywalker like Michael how did they ever become known to the police. the story points out that the police were dragging people into daylight to see if they would burn. Michael and Selene do not have this issue. Michael can change at will. Wouldn't they just blend in and never be discovered? Finally where are these movies supposed to take place? Hungary? Eastern Europe. Selene speaks a foreign language in this and other movies but now she is suddenly in the United States with no explanation?. Where and why did she ever learn English in the first place.Oh...the daughter. According to IMDb she is turning NINETEEN this year! So much for playing a 12 year old.The movie felt short and it also felt like a total setup for the next film which we'll have to wait how many years for? Maybe never if enough folks don't go to see this. I like this series and will see the next one. True fans won't pass this by either. However new fans keep things going. I doubt they'll be back.Note to the producers for underworld 4 PREVIEW the script and the movie with the real fans the folks that have seen the other 3 movies multiple times not a bunch of tourists walking around Burbank looking for free passes.".

	schema:headline " VERY BAD storyline Very bad film Very disappointed!";
	schema:reviewBody "I LOVED the first three Underworld movies but in all honesty Underworld Awakening was for me a complete disaster. The first three movies were amazing because they made you think deeply about history love hatred war friendship family and other riveting themes they encouraged critical thinking and connection making skills with all the powerful flashbacks and twists and turns that were within a strong plotstructure. But Underworld Awakening failed to do any of these things. The plot absolutely sucked there's nothing original and I don't even know what the pointtheme was at all. Yes there are a few good twists in the movie but they happen in like the last 30 minutes and even here all we get to see is action and no real depth or explanation of the who what where when why how? of the story. If humans are now the common enemy then why on sam hill are vampires and werewolves still fighting? It doesn't make sense. Near the end just as the story was getting good I suddenly noticed the credits popping up. The movie was over. I thought Huh? It can't be over it was just getting good!? The film was also WAY too short. All of this taken together makes Underworld Awakening more like an added TV episode than a major motion picture. I honestly can't believe 70 million was spent on this cop out. It would have been much better if they actually showed the fight between humans and vampires and focused on that instead of going back to a now pointless feud between vampires and lycans.WHAT made Underworld Awakening worse was the fact that the directors did not really connect this sequel to the other 3 Underworld movies where are the flashbacks? Where's the dialogue? What exactly happened to the other characters in the earlier films etc etc? I know this will disappoint all of you diehard fans like me who love the other movies but truth hurts the film was terrible.The storyline was the worst part I think. In the 1 hour and 30 minutes of the film only about 2030 minutes is spent actually talking. Selene only opens her mouth a few times and nobody makes longer speeches which made the other movies great. If the film was really about Selene waging war against humans which it wasn't it would have been much better and an interesting story but that wasn't the true plot at all.To the Producers It was the STORY that made the Underworld series a success not the action but you failed to see that. Because there is VERY little dialogue in this one and A LOT of action there is very little story here which makes it very unlikely that ANYONE will remember this movie after watching it. If you want to make another Underworld movie focus on the story on speeches on the intellect on actual acting instead of crappy action I can see for free on a TV series. I hate to say this because I am such a huge fan of the series but Underworld Awakening is utterly forgettable. I was really disappointed and if you're an Underworld fan you will be too. I don't think I'll watch it a second time.My Objective Vote 310P.S. I think the people who rate this film more than a 5 either haven't watched the other Underworld films were paidoff or are insane. It just doesn't deserve anything more than a pass.".

	schema:reviewBody "!MAJOR SPOILERS!I made a complete fool of myself when recommending this movie to my wife on the basis that the other Underworld movies were very good. My personal favourite being Rise of the Lycans. After about 15 minutes into this movie I realised it was completely disconnected from the other Underworld movies. The story is all over the place I watched with disillusion as the movie went from one moment to many years later skipping all the sub plots that would have actually made a good movie such as the war between humans Lycans and Vampires. We just jump straight into a time when vampires are on the edge of extinction and Lycans are all but gone from the world. But even this is contradicted if humans were so effective at wiping out Lycans and Vampires then how come an ultra secret top of the government organisation is run by the Lycans?!?! Then there's the action sequences which IMHO were only added to be visually appealing they didn't appear to move the story in any direction. There are times when Kate B empty's two of three clips on Lycans at close range and fails to even stop them approaching and then other scenes where she pops off three rounds from vast distances while sliding across the floor or jumping off walls and every single shot hits the 3 bad guys in the head. These types of inconsistencies in both the action sequences and the story is what makes this a stand alone Underworld movie not deserving of the franchise. I was shocked by the 7.1 rating but I guess if you like watching a movie while parking your brain in your popcorn then you might enjoy it if you've seen and enjoyed the other movies I suspect you may well find it incredibly disappointing.".

	schema:headline " Time to put a stake in it";
	schema:reviewBody "So 6 years after the last time Kate Beckinsale donned a leather corset to play vampire warrior Selene and after making a 3rd edition of the franchise without her the folks behind Underworld come back with a 4th go round which really does nothing more than prove they probably should have left well enough alone after the 2nd movie. With four people credited for the screenplay it's not exactly a surprise to find Awakening is the worst written film of the lot and the addition of 3D can't disguise the fact that there's nothing visually new or interesting here. If you're a big fan of these films you might just barely find this one to be passable. If you enjoyed the original which was a good and solid little fantasy action flick but noticed the decline in quality of the sequels you'll find the pattern continuing here.As the motion picture begins the existence of vampires and Lycans has been uncovered by humanity and the result has been allout war against the infected. You think that'd be kind of a big deal and take the story in some new direction but it's nothing more than a plot device. Selene and her hybrid vampwerewolf lover Michael not Scott Speedman get attacked and Selene wakes up from suspended animation 12 years later in a lab. She thinks Michael is the one who freed her but it turns out to be their hybrid daughter India Eisley and no they never even make an attempt to explain where the daughter came from. With the help of a human cop Michael Ealy and a new vampire sidekick Theo James Selene has to save her daughter. Not from the humans but from a Lycan scheme to create new superwerewolves which sort of gets back to the whole plot device nature of humans knowing about the denizens of Underworld. It's not a new beginning for the series or anything like that. It's just the hook they needed to get this production off the ground.If you saw Beckinsale in the first two Underworld movies there's nothing here that will surprise you. Frankly part of this film get dangerously close to outright fan fiction such as when Selene revives in the lab and finds her traditional leather outfit just waiting for her to put back on. I mean what scientific purpose was served by keeping her clothes around for 12 years? Beckinsale looks damn good shoots a bunch of stuff and there's plenty of CGI Lycans and slomo action scenes. If that's all you want have at it.If you're looking for a good story even one only as good as the first or second parts of the franchise don't bother. Underworld wasn't exactly Shakespeare but by fantasy action standards it was a reasonably intelligent and well put together tale. The sequel was a bit too wrapped up in its own mythos but was still functional. The third movie was strictly bythenumbers though it did flip the dynamic by making the Lycans more heroic than the vampires. However Underworld Awakening is a morally confused mess.One of the reasons why the vampire as hero thing works is by being very circumspect about the whole needing to feed on human blood thing. By downplaying that vampires change from menacing predators to really cool hipsters with superpowers. So the original Underworld largely removed humans from the equation and focused on the werewolf vs. vampire conflict and put Selene in the role of heroine by defending the only major human character in the story. She then uncovered and rejected the villainy of her own bloodsucking kind cementing Selene's moral and narrative virtue. Selene may have been a vampire but she never seemed to need to feed on humans and was mostly on our side. That dynamic continued in the 2nd flick and the third cast vamps as medieval tyrants facing a courageous Lycan rebellion where again humans were largely left out of the fight.Underworld Awakening opens with Selene slaughtering a score of human soldiers and then kills some more when she escapes from the lab including chomping a guy on the neck and feasting on his blood. She's not a good guy who's trying to protect people from bad guys. She's an at best morally neutral creature who's only trying to survive and the viewer is expected to side with her out of nothing more than misanthropic contempt for your fellow human beings. This film assumes there's something wrong with normal people trying to protect themselves from supernatural monsters but never explains what that is. It also doesn't help that the plot is one of those multiwriter efforts where different bits from different versions of the script wind up jammed together on screen. There are too many characters and too many scenes that should have been cut out or significantly changed.There are so few femaledriven movie franchises that it's a shame to see this one swirl down the toilet bowl. Beckinsale and the first Underworld deserved the attention and success they got but it's time to drag these movies out into the sunlight and let them burn up so we can all move on.".

	onyx:emotionText "So 6 years after the last time Kate Beckinsale donned a leather corset to play vampire warrior Selene and after making a 3rd edition of the franchise without her the folks behind Underworld come back with a 4th go round which really does nothing more than prove they probably should have left well enough alone after the 2nd movie. With four people credited for the screenplay it's not exactly a surprise to find Awakening is the worst written film of the lot and the addition of 3D can't disguise the fact that there's nothing visually new or interesting here. If you're a big fan of these films you might just barely find this one to be passable. If you enjoyed the original which was a good and solid little fantasy action flick but noticed the decline in quality of the sequels you'll find the pattern continuing here.As the motion picture begins the existence of vampires and Lycans has been uncovered by humanity and the result has been allout war against the infected. You think that'd be kind of a big deal and take the story in some new direction but it's nothing more than a plot device. Selene and her hybrid vampwerewolf lover Michael not Scott Speedman get attacked and Selene wakes up from suspended animation 12 years later in a lab. She thinks Michael is the one who freed her but it turns out to be their hybrid daughter India Eisley and no they never even make an attempt to explain where the daughter came from. With the help of a human cop Michael Ealy and a new vampire sidekick Theo James Selene has to save her daughter. Not from the humans but from a Lycan scheme to create new superwerewolves which sort of gets back to the whole plot device nature of humans knowing about the denizens of Underworld. It's not a new beginning for the series or anything like that. It's just the hook they needed to get this production off the ground.If you saw Beckinsale in the first two Underworld movies there's nothing here that will surprise you. Frankly part of this film get dangerously close to outright fan fiction such as when Selene revives in the lab and finds her traditional leather outfit just waiting for her to put back on. I mean what scientific purpose was served by keeping her clothes around for 12 years? Beckinsale looks damn good shoots a bunch of stuff and there's plenty of CGI Lycans and slomo action scenes. If that's all you want have at it.If you're looking for a good story even one only as good as the first or second parts of the franchise don't bother. Underworld wasn't exactly Shakespeare but by fantasy action standards it was a reasonably intelligent and well put together tale. The sequel was a bit too wrapped up in its own mythos but was still functional. The third movie was strictly bythenumbers though it did flip the dynamic by making the Lycans more heroic than the vampires. However Underworld Awakening is a morally confused mess.One of the reasons why the vampire as hero thing works is by being very circumspect about the whole needing to feed on human blood thing. By downplaying that vampires change from menacing predators to really cool hipsters with superpowers. So the original Underworld largely removed humans from the equation and focused on the werewolf vs. vampire conflict and put Selene in the role of heroine by defending the only major human character in the story. She then uncovered and rejected the villainy of her own bloodsucking kind cementing Selene's moral and narrative virtue. Selene may have been a vampire but she never seemed to need to feed on humans and was mostly on our side. That dynamic continued in the 2nd flick and the third cast vamps as medieval tyrants facing a courageous Lycan rebellion where again humans were largely left out of the fight.Underworld Awakening opens with Selene slaughtering a score of human soldiers and then kills some more when she escapes from the lab including chomping a guy on the neck and feasting on his blood. She's not a good guy who's trying to protect people from bad guys. She's an at best morally neutral creature who's only trying to survive and the viewer is expected to side with her out of nothing more than misanthropic contempt for your fellow human beings. This film assumes there's something wrong with normal people trying to protect themselves from supernatural monsters but never explains what that is. It also doesn't help that the plot is one of those multiwriter efforts where different bits from different versions of the script wind up jammed together on screen.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a fan of the original three Underworld movies having bought all three on DVD which I have watched several times each. After initially watching the third one which I particularly liked the first thought that occurred to me was I hope they make a fourth one. When I heard the announcement that  4 was in the works I was excited.But to my disappointment this movie was too much flash and too little substance. The fight scenes were moderately enjoyable but the storyline was just too thin. The 12year gap in particular was a poor idea IMO. I and I suspect other viewers of the original three movies wanted to see what happened just after Evolution. Also unlike the first three movies which developed an interesting back story and mythology about the two clans this one was just one action scene after another with too little character development and no substantive development of the mythology at all.Having said all that I still liked seeing Kate Beckinsale in action again. But my enjoyment was seriously dampened by one major plot hole which makes it hard for me to rewatch this movie.There are of course many plot holes which have been discussed in other reviews. But the one plot hole that bothered me the most and surprisingly I have been unable to find any discussion about it elsewhere is the fact that when Selene breaks free from Antigen at the beginning of the movie all of the security guards as well as the scientists she encounters are human even though toward the end of the movie nearly 100 percent of the staff appears to be Lycan. This illogical discrepancy was really hard to ignore.I initially rationalized this discrepancy by the idea that Antigen not wanting to reveal their big secret to the outside world mostly used a human staff particularly when dealing with any threat that could not be contained within the facility where the risk that the general public could learn that the building was a Lycan haven would be a serious concern particularly if dead Lycan bodies were found by the police andor observed by passersby. But that idea got thrown out the window by the fact that when Selene openly attacks the facility near the end virtually all of the guards including those outside the facility openly reveal themselves to be Lycans right away. And what happened to all of the human staff at the end? The only human in the entire facility at the end appeared to be the one unfortunate woman scientist.Maybe this shouldn't have bothered me so much but it just seemed like nonsensical writing so that Selene wouldn't discover at the outset the big plot twist that Antigen was nothing more than a Lycan front and intrusively makes the viewer realize how poorly thought out this story was even though Len Wiseman is credited on the screenplay. Also makes it tough to rewatch without wondering why the hell is the entire staff human? at the beginning.If they end up doing a fifth one I am hoping it will be more in the vein of the original three with better more thoughtout writing and a stronger storyline.".

	schema:reviewBody "There was a time when I like the Underworld series. The first one had a good plot solid acting and added something to the mythos even as it borrowed from the White Wolf universe. The second one was... tolerable at best. It was worth watching at least which is more than I can say for Rise of the Lycans. That was a total waste of time.Despite the general downhill trend I decided to check this one out in the theater. Boy was that a waste! If the writers couldn't come up with a better villain than a steroid abusing werewolf they need to go back to the drawing board. There are so many things they could have done with this scenario. We could have seen the Abominations come to the forefront for one as their strengths would have made them very difficult for the humans to kill.Instead we see the Lycans taking the place of the Vampires which I thought was alright except for the whole Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Werewolf bit the Vampires have all turned into a bunch of little sniveling wimps and we are once AGAIN left wondering just what the hell is the Abomination even doing in the movie!! Yeah I said it! The Hybrid is supposed to be some kind of immensely powerful beast capable of taking down even an elder vampire. This is something referenced multiple times throughout the series and yet every time a hybrid gets into a fight they get their head stomped in! In the first movie Michael got smacked down by the elder who is later killed by da da DAH! Selene. In the second movie Michael once again gets punked but at least he made one kill before the day is once again saved by dah dah DAH! Selene! Now in this the fourth in the series presumably focused on the hybrids Michael gets punked even worse right at the start! They could have had him at least take out a few of the guys coming after him before he got knocked on his backside and put on ice! Sure the little girl does alright. No better than Michael ever did but at least she got a kill in her first screen outing. It seems to me that the only tough characters in these films are the females.My point is this if the hybrids are supposed to be the future and the Lycans and Vampires are both scared to death of them WHY don't we see more of their abilities?! Why are we left disappointed time and time again? Why do the writers insist on making the hybrids do little more than turn blue and roar a few times before getting the crap beat out of them? If you writers have nothing better to do with the hybrids TAKE THEM OUT OF THE SERIES. They are to this point little more than a near worthless sidekick and they add almost nothing to the story outside of being the target for aggression from both sides.I gave the film 3 starts because it at least had good special effects. Beyond that it's a flop. Predictable plot mediocre fight scenes and a villain that made me think Bruce Banner had been bitten by a werewolf. If this is the direction the series is headed I am done with it.".

Once again we've been given a film that was quickly thrown together for an additional squeeze on the franchise name and a final milking of the of a reasonable fan base. This film didn't last more than 1.5 hours leaving the audience with an underdeveloped story line and cast of characters. I wasn't too happy with a majority of the character selections. No one seemed to fill their role well. The actingdirecting was mediocre at best. As for the CGI many of the scenes seemed like a underbudgeted video game rather than a well designed special effect. Rest assured this film will not win any awards and we've probably seen the last installment as this film just seemed as though it was coming for it's last breath of air before going under completely. At best you can add this one to the long list of popcorn entertainers best viewed on a rainy day when nothing better is available to do.".

Overall this movie is for those who liked previous parts of this movie! So enjoy the confrontation between VAMPIRES LYCHANS AND now HUMANS!";

One review said there was a 'dull' breakout intro kinda feeling like 'resident evil' style. First off this is incredibly wrong. This movie and all other underworlds LACKED any dullness. Yes Kate Beckinsale is incredibly gorgeous eye candy and the effects were amazing. But I'm not entirely sure where someone can come off and say this lacked story. In my opinion the people saying this are people who think Jessica's body had a good story line. Underworld always leaves it off with such a twist or an ending that leaves so much room for whatever and has the potential to go in any direction. This movie was well played and directed. People saying they 'didn't get the little girl thing' obviously didn't pay attention to dialog or the EXPRESSION on Selenes face. Please if you are a fan of underworld or Kate Beckinsale don't miss out on an amazing film because some people can't understand something that's not spelled out in perfect clich. Clich... something Underworld has yet to bring to the table. Awesome job everyone. Keep it up.".

It's the best movie I have seen since HUGO and it was just great. I was at the edge of my seat in so many of the fight scenes. Selene is back and stronger faster and more kick ass than ever. The movie is just great. I hope all fantasy action and adventure directors take notice of what happened. I didn't think the script was all that great but the action sure made up for it and the story was decent too. I can't wait till the next one. By the way don't waste your money on the 3D. It is not that noticeable and the movie is a dark movie anyways so it was just a waste to see it in 3D but other than that the movie is so good. I had no idea how great it was. The smile on my face when I left the movie and even during the fight scenes was nuts. I can't wait to see this again and then own it on blue ray! Anyone who doesn't like the movie clearly wasn't seeing what I witnessed. Again I can't wait to see this again. I'm excited because not many movies make me want to buy the tickets again and throughout the whole movie I kept thinking this is a great start for 2012 movies should start. Oh and Kate Beckinsale looked even better in this movie than the rest!".

	schema:reviewBody "Allow me to provide some background information on my relationship with the films of M. Night Shyamalan I adored The Sixth Sense and still think of it as one of the best films of 1999 and one of the best supernatural thrillers in ages. Unbreakable was a fascinating take on the superhero genre. I loved parts of Signs to bits and consider the sequence in the basement towards the end of the film one of the finest examples of suspenseful buildup in recent film history. I even liked The Village and could easily dismiss Lady in the Water as a mere misfire. I was greatly anticipating The Happening especially as it seemed to be echoing one of my favorite guilty pleasures the paranoid 70's scifi thriller.Let's get one thing out of the way The Happening is unbelievably impossibly ridiculously hilariously inconceivably bad. Normally I would refuse to rate any film that had any good scenes or that was welldirected less than four out of ten but The Happening has to have one of the worst scripts among recent bigbudget Hollywood films. It's absolutely shocking how retarded the logic behind this is and how poor so much of the dialogue is. This script began as The Green Effect a tremendously poor trust me I read parts of it script by Shyamalan that was soundly rejected and eventually reworked into The Happening. Having seen the critical reaction to The Happening prior to going into the film I found myself pleasantly surprised by basically the first thirty forty minutes of the film. It was nothing special but it had something going for it Shyamalan's direction was topnotch and Wahlberg was playing the sort of goofy science teacher I'd loved and loved to hate on occasion in high school. Then the descent began. The bulk of this film is some of the most hilariously awful crap produced by a talented filmmaker since Schaffner's Sphinx. Shyamalan who was using closeups and steadicam shots to frankly brilliant effect early on begins to use the same shots to comical effect. There is one painfully painfully long closeup of Mark Wahlberg pleading for time to think and then calling for his group to 'keep ahead of the wind' that is up there with Nicolas Cage in The Wicker Man in terms of hilariously awful acting. That scene may very well be the turning point in the film with Wahlberg's acting becoming more ridiculous by the second culminating in a performance that essentially wipes from memory all his tremendous recent achievements as an actor. I don't blame Wahlberg for this I blame Shyamalan. Wahlberg claims Shyamalan tried to force him into real paranoia so his performance would work better. What happens here no pun intended is that Wahlberg ends up looking amazingly uncomfortable for the last hour of this thing and struggles to deliver any reasonable line deliveries.Okay I do have to credit Zooey Deschanel for making this movie watchable. Besides being amazingly ridiculously gorgeous she is a fine actress and creates a sympathetic character and a fairly welldrawn one at that one of the few pros in Shyamalan's script. There's also the score oh my it's gorgeous. Seriously ignore this film and just buy the score CD by James Newton Howard it's brilliant. The Happening starts out well but ends up being an absolute embarrassment. I was prepared for a mediocre offering perhaps a misguided effort such as Lady in the Water. I was not expecting a disaster on the level of The Happening. Its last forty minutes and especially its last ten minutes or so are among the worst I have seen in a long time. Have you ever wondered if it was possible for a film to go from enjoyable to absolutely horrendous in the space of ten or fifteen minutes? The Happening is proof that it can pardon the intentional pun happen. 310".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen an M. Night Shyamalan movie since Signs although I've heard each was worse than the previous ones. Strangely this gave me hope that The Happening would be a turning point for the director that had won so much acclaim with Sixth Sense.Sadly this isn't the case. The Happening is easily the worst movie I have ever seen in a theater and is a strong contender for the worst I've seen altogether. I've never even written an IMDb review before but felt compelled to write one for this movie.1 The acting is horrible. Sometimes you go to a movie and the cast has one lousy actor in it. This was the opposite. The entire cast is uniformly bad with the possible exception of a construction worker in the beginning watching his buddies plummet to their deaths. These performances are a hallmark of poor direction. I know that Wahlberg Deschanel and Leguizamo can actually turn in good work under the right director.2 Almost no one seems to react to what's going on around them in a realistic way. Only one person practically an extra ever really freaks out. Everyone else just kind of bumbles along until the wind catches up to them.3 The premise is ridiculous. Supposedly the plants are tired of us polluting the environment and mowing the grass so they decide to start releasing toxins that cause humans to go insane and kill themselves. There are a few massive problems with this.First the movie presents evolution as something that occurs within the lifetimes of organisms when it actually takes many thousands of generations. Trees haven't had any time at all to evolve that kind of defense mechanism and grass isn't particularly concerned about being mowed. Otherwise it would have evolved a toxin to kill off grazing animals thousands of years ago.Second the movie makes it seem as if the plants can somehow consciously communicate with each other. Although plants do indeed send out chemical signals these signals are not under any kind of conscious control.Third the movie mixes up plant defenses with ecological phenomena such as algae blooms. Algae blooms occur when a variety of factors all converge to provide an ideal environment for overgrowth of algae. The algae population cannot sustain such large levels and eventually the excess dies off. Plant chemical defenses are not remotely similar. If a species of plants evolves a defense mechanism all future descendants will have it and it will continue working indefinitely. If such a mechanism appeared in grass it would eventually make its way across the country. The effect wouldn't magically stop working just in time to save the protagonists of the story.Finally it doesn't make much sense for a toxin to cause suicides. That kind of behavioral alteration is usually seen in the reproductive cycles of parasites that infect their hosts' nervous systems. Plant defenses are either poisons such as nicotine or chemical signals that attract predators to hunt the plant's attackers.4 By the way the antagonists are plants. Although this could have been made to work somewhat like Andromeda Strain Shyamalan decided to add a bunch of foreboding shots of plantlife. It isn't easy to make trees and grass look evil so wind kicked up each time people are about to die. The toxin would accumulate more in still air so you'd be better off waiting for the wind to blow past you. Leave it to a science teacher to miss this point and make sure everyone stays ahead of the wind.5 The score is hamfisted and overbearing.6 So is the dialog.7 There is no twist. A random character we never care about reveals the cause of the mass suicides sometime in the middle of the movie and he's exactly right. I was hoping the real cause would be the creepy lady at the end who hates the outside world but alas no she becomes a victim just like everyone else.8 In a couple of scenes at the very beginning and very end we see one person who is not apparently affected by the toxin. We never find out what happens to them nor why they aren't affected. In reality there would certainly be more people not affected and the people who were would likely be affected in different ways. Psychoactive substances never affect everyone the same way.9 Just before the final scene we see Wahlberg et al. back home three months after the attack. No one appears to have suffered any kind of psychological trauma. The little girl whose parents are both dead is going off to school and somehow the Northeast is repopulated. I'd be very curious to know what they did with all those dead bodies. More likely massive numbers of people who were not directly affected by the plants would have committed suicide due to depression. No one in their right minds would move back to the region so the only living people in that part of the country would be clean up crews wearing Hazmat suits.10 In the very beginning scene the one person not affected by the toxin begins describing what she sees but the camera never shows us. Are those people clawing at themselves? Where?! Sorry you'll never see it. It's like watching a Bob Newhart phone conversation. In spite of the character's comment you never see any of the victims clawing at themselves. Everyone who falls prey to the plant toxin freezes then quietly and expediently commits suicide. It's a continuity error that occurs two minutes into the movie.There are so many more things wrong with this film I don't think it's possible to list them all. The shortest list of the movie's flaws is sadly the movie itself. Hopefully this review will prevent you from seeing it or at least prepare you for the inevitable disappointment.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Happening which was released here in France today is a terrible screenplay and poorly acted. The writerdirector failed to make a complete film which employs any semblance of cinematic language.Normally wellwritten taut and engaging screenplays like good editing should be invisible. They should fit seamlessly into the filmmaking process but unfortunately for The Happening the writing construction of drama and dialogue are so bad that the awful screenplay is apparent from the very first scene. The introduction of the main conflict is visually well done but the writers never bother to move the story past its main conflict thus making the film flat line dramatically very early on. Essentially nothing ever happens except the main characters totally unbelievable reactions to The Happening i.e. the main conflict.We the audience are not emotionally attached to the characters because the screenplay gives us no reason to be. The film's subconflicts are basically nonexistent and the character conflicts emotional relationships are contrived and hollow. The screenplay provides no emotional outlet or connection at all. Simply said this is a screenplay that should have been better vetted for emotional connection between the audience and characters on screen. We don't care about what's 'Happening' because the people to whom it is 'Happening' mean nothing to us. Someone should provide the screenwriter with a copy of Aristotle's Poetics.The dialogue is over the top simplistic explicit and begs the question  does anyone really talk like that? Line after line the screenplay falls further and further apart. The characters tell us what we can already see. Therefore the screenplay doesn't trust that the cinematic language of images is doing its job. The beauty of cinema is that with moving pictures we can say thousands upon thousands of words with each frame and never actually employ dialogue. This screenplay obviously does not respect that logic and in many ways flies right in the face of it. The film would be a lot better if the characters just simply reacted to the events unfolding around them.The acting is unwatchable. No one in this film gives a good performance. The acting similar to the screenplay is devoid of emotion. No one is reacting like a real person. Each character seems to be emotionally empty. They don't seem nervous that millions of people are dying they're not hysterical which doesn't not mean they should yelling and screaming or even realistic. They at no time in the film seem desperate with the desire and hope to live. At times they try to appear upset but it is so shallow that the viewer is left flat. Each actor delivers their lines without any regard or reaction to the actor in front of them. It is so bad that it makes one wonder whether or not the actors were actually on set together or just acting with standins.The subtext of the film which is meant to lead us to the theme  mankind is destroying the planet is blatant and lacks finesse. Pretty quickly into the first act we know that the plants are taking their revenge I wish I was making this up but this really is the plot of the film. The screenplay dialogue and acting do nothing to merit the ending in which a professor on television is yelling about 'how we humanity are guilty for the recent horrors and need to pay better attention to our physical environment.' The films is just waving its fists and again telling us what to think rather than earning our trust. It tells us what its about. Basically the film underestimates us every step of the way.The film never ventures into any kind of serious depth. It stays on the most basic onedimensional level. Plants are killing us  run away.Blame for this film's failures should be squarely laid upon the director and producers. The director is guilty of writing and directing a very bad and unbelievable film. The producers are responsible for allowing the director to get away with this. Someone on the creative team andor on the production side should have sounded an alarm when they read the screenplay. When the screenplay got into production one of the producers should have watched the rushes and pulled the director aside and said something.The Happening is a failure on the most basic and important of cinematic levels. It does nothing to win earn and deserve the audience's emotional and intellectual trust. It doesn't employ image as its main storytelling tool. It just tries to be clever but is actually quite silly.I for one don't care who the writer or director is they must listen to their production and creative team. Filmmaking is a collaborative experience but in the case of this film it is clear that no one bothered to be honest with Mr. Shyamalan.".

After the disaster that was Lady in the Water Shyamalan comes back with a movie which unbelievably almost impossibly may actually be worse. Lousy acting laughably bad dialogue and a story which is just downright stupid combine to make one terrible movie.Anyhow the story here is that starting in New York City and then quickly spreading through the Northeast everyone is suddenly killing themselves. Everyone drops what they're doing seemingly goes catatonic for a moment and then offs themselves anyway they can. Fling themselves off the top of a building shoot themselves in the head...whatever. What could possibly make people do this? Obviously it must be some kind of terrorist attack or so everyone thinks. There certainly is something bad in the air and people need to flee. And here we meet our main characters a Philadelphia high school science teacher and his wife along with his friend and his friend's daughter. They get out of the city inevitably get stuck in the middle of nowhere the characters begin to do and say things which make no sense whatsoever and the whole movie falls apart as we watch people try to run away from the wind.Mark Wahlberg has the central role here and his performance is truly awful. Certainly he isn't helped by the hideous script but it really seems as if Wahlberg can do nothing right. He seems rather emotionless for a guy trying to figure out why everyone's engaging in mass suicide. As his wife Zooey Deschanel goes through the film with a blank stare on her face. Some of the corpses show more life. Most of the other characters we meet make a bad impression if they make any impression at all. Some truly bizarre people wander in and out of this movie. And all of them are forced to spout dialogue which is so bad it often becomes unintentionally funny. Somebody wrote that? Really? Haha. But as bad as the acting and dialogue are it's the story which is the biggest problem. Once the movie reveals what actually is happening it becomes impossible to take the story seriously. Stupid. So very very stupid. The premise makes no sense doesn't work at all and thus the movie is doomed to failure. I really can't fathom that after reading the script anyone actually encouraged Shyamalan to go ahead and make this movie. The Sixth Sense sure was a long time ago.".

	schema:reviewBody "M. Night Shyamalan's first Rated R film and he blew it completely I remember this year actually wanting to see this movie it looked really interesting and Mark Wahlberg is becoming a more great actor in his experience. The only problem here is M. Night Shyamalan this man is constantly credited for Signs and The Sixth Sense... that's it because that and Unbreakable are his only good movies. Honestly he's just loosing it I think he's become so cocky and now he's trying to have more of an edge with this R rating. His story lacks any sense there are just so many things wrong with this story and not to mention the characters have no sympathy. Nothing was ever properly explained and there are tons of plot holes. The ending was just a cop out it was nice to see that Shyamalan didn't go for his typical twist ending but still this story just needed so much work and probably would've been better under someone else's name.According to reports citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves Elliot his wife Alma their friend Julian and his daughter Jess board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination however the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind.I feel so bad for saying this but seriously I was laughing at the suicide scenes. I don't know why just first there is a police officer who shoots himself in the head literally his forehead why would you aim it that way? Also a trainer feeds himself to his tigers that rip his arms off instead of knocking him down and people film it?! There is a woman who is on the phone with her daughter puts her on speaker in front of a group of people to hear her commit suicide?! Also Julian just leaves his daughter to find her most likely dead mother in the hands of a woman he doesn't trust yes let's leave the daughter and most likely make her an orphan. Gosh I could go on and on about how horrible this movie is but I think I'd run out of room. Just trust me the story is just horrible and could've been good if maybe made more as an independent film but Shyamaladingdong just ruined it.110".

	schema:reviewBody "I hate this. I want to tell you guys that this was Shyamalan's comeback and that this film is just as terrifying as you've been promised. But I cannot.The film starts off actually quite well. Minus some less than stellar acting in fact its horrible and some just as bad dialogue I really thought that maybe this film could pull it off.

Nominated for an Oscar for his turn in The Departed Wahlberg seems like a safe bet but in actuality he's playing a role that just isn't made for him. This role was made for someone nicer. Walhberg has been typecast time and time again as the angry and badass guy and now I see why. He's good at that and god awful at being nice.No one else is particularly good either. Zoey Deschanel disappoints John Leguizamo Everyone in this movie has a name that's difficult to spell and all of the extras are just as bad. There is not a single moment of good acting in this movie.And all of that is because of how rushed this film feels. This is one of those movies that it seriously felt like the director was working on a very limited budget and then took the first take for every actor none of them had a chance to get into their roles or so I hope.It's obvious who will get all of the blame for this M. Night Shyamalan and it's really too bad. I can't say that the plot is necessarily bad it isn't and with maybe one more draft the script would've been good. The faults of this film all land on Night's shoulders though. I hate to say it because I am very much not a hater of his I love The Sixth Sense Unbreakable and Signs but I'm forced to say I hate this movie. Not so much for how bad it actually is it's very bad but because I really had faith in the director. The trailers almost felt promising and Shyamalan am I even spelling this right? promised me that I'd walk out shaking. Instead I was shaking my head in disappointment.One thing I'd like to add on though I can tell that they were going for a Hitchcock vibe and the best way I feel that I can describe this is a very bad version of The Birds.

I look forward to news of his next project and love the stories of his supposed total control over his movies and carte blanche from the studios. If those stories are true I have a feeling that era will be ending for Night with the release of The Happening. I ignored all the prerelease press I could before going to see this movie. I read none of the reviews but one word I did catch was uninspired. Unfortunately that one word describes this movie perfectly. In the first ten minutes of the movie I thought it was due to the acting and that maybe Mark Wahlberg was miscast. However after another ten minutes I realized it wasn't the actors it was the extremely lame script. Without giving away any details this is a disaster film where the disaster happening starts with the first scene of the movie. Unfortunately no suspense builds and there is absolutely no sense of dread or panic on screen and so none translates to the audience. Surprising since the 21st century has provided us with too many occasions to study how we react in times of disaster whether by nature or terrorism. It's as if Night ignored all this when writing the story. The characters sleepwalk through the scenes and no it's not a symptom of the happening with no believable sense of the horrible events taking place. Granted we don't need to see people running around in circles screaming and crying but people do not stand in small groups after a disaster calmly taking turns talking one at a time. Without sharing in any of the horror that the characters are suppose to be experiencing the film is a total bore for the audience and the source of the happening is laughable when revealed. I found myself repeatedly checking my watch saying I can't believe how bad this is  not something I'd expect to do in a Night movie. Looking around the theater I could tell others were sharing the same feelings. Most were scrolling through emails or texting on their phones.During the movie since I wasn't paying much attention to the screen I started thinking that there might be a good reason why most filmmakers do not have total control over their films. When they do they can reach a point that it seems Night may have reached where they say I'm going to make people scared when the wind blows and actually believe themselves. Maybe other producers or execs can step in at that point and bring the filmmaker back to reality. I'm not giving up on Night but I'll feel better if his next film is not Written Produced and Directed by M. Night Shyamalan.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the trailer for 'The Happening' I was quite excited at the prospect of another film by M. Night Shyamalan. After all I enjoyed all his previous films save 'Lady in the Lake' and was sure he would deliver another breathtaking blockbuster. Sadly I was wrong and while the film was not a turkey it was not of the excellence I had expected.The film sees some sort of mysterious ecological event leading to people committing mass suicide the phenomenon spreading first from large cities then to smaller towns until it is clear a huge chunk of the East Coast is affected. At first it is assumed to be a terrorist attack but as more and more people are spontaneously kill themselves it is clear the cause may be something else entirely...One of the problems with the film was the quality of the acting and the characters themselves. Mark Wahlberg stars as Elliot the science teacher who is our main protagonist and he does flounder in many scenes as if he forgets he's playing an intelligent but ordinary everyday guy not a gungho military hero who is cool in all situations. He could have injected more emotion into his performance. Zooey Deschanel plays Elliot's girlfriend Alma and she too fails to make the audience care for her with the way she depicts the character to be some sort of an escapee from a teenybooper romance flick. To be fair it is not entirely Deschanel's fault as Alma is a weak selfcentred character with the emotional capacity of a young adolescent for example she puts Elliot and a child at risk a couple of times with her stupid decisions and at the start when it's clear people are dying she is in a huff because Elliot and his friend 'hurt' her feelings.When it comes to the actual storyline the plot does start off intriguingly and there are many chilling moments when we see people are coolly committing suicide like mindless zombies. However the finale doesn't deliver what the buildup promised. There are no real explanations or solid end result. In many ways this film is similar to Shyamalan's previous project 'Signs' both in terms of a mass disaster and no real end resolution to the events but 'Signs' worked better because the characters were more effectively portrayed and their personal storyline was enough of a finale to compensate. This is not the case in 'The Happening' where the storyline fizzles out.Overall this is by no means a terrible film. It is enjoyable and fits nicely into the apocalyptic genre but 'Signs' has done this sort of idea before and did it better. That said there was not only moments that had me on the edge of my seat but also lines which were quite humorous. And certainly it does make one think about the state of the planet in regards to whether humanity does have it coming to them and how we would cope in such an event. It is worth a look especially in a week when the other premiere is 'The Hulk a film aimed at keeping twelveyearolds' entertained.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was disappointed to see such harsh reviews from the critics when there are clearly much sillier and stupid films out there. Zohan was about 60 at rotten tomatoes while The Happening was at 14. The disappointment didn't last long when I realized given the information above if critics had liked this movie that might have been a bad thing. I focused my attention on interviews with Shyamalan himself talking about the film instead of the pretentious critics who have grown accustom to hating his movies. I decided to take HIS advice and go into the theater looking for a fun B movie. You will find that and so much more. This movie is not your average thriller by any means. The Happening holds a solid Twilight Zone feel without being clich or overused. This might be why the average masses didn't like it. We are used to being fed sequel after sequel after remake after remake. Don't get me wrong those are fun movies to watch but the ART of film is being lost. The stereotypic perfect leading man who is smooth witty handsome and quick thinking who always saves the day will not be found in this film. Nor will the overuse of incredible special effects slashing and squirting blood and gore erotic sex scenes fast paced chases or crude language. Yes the content is uncomfortable and disturbing and times but it has a point. It's not goring for the sake of being goring and it's not uncontrolled in it's violence. This film is simple. It has flawed and awkward characters who don't always say the smoothest thing. Everyone is imperfect and they don't handle the situations in the best hollywood type manner. Shyamalan did this on purpose. This movie is not paced for the entertain me entertain me entertain me entertain me type audiences we have mostly become. You are given the elements but it's up to you to be able to slow down and feel the emotions in order to appreciate the film. The parable and meaning are so much deeper and innocent than what is popularized in media today. It will challenge you. It will make you think.The Happening on the outside is a very fun and funny film. It is a B movie on the surface because of it's amazing simplicity but by the end of the film you realize what it's actually all about. It's sad to see that so many people have completely missed it. Bottom line If you liked his other films you must see this one it falls into the ranks of everything made before Lady. If you didn't like his other films stick to boring remakes and sequels.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film starts out with the big blue eyes of Alma staring at the camera. What is she doing? She is on the telephone with a man named Joey without her husband knowing Elliot. She isn't cheating on him but as Elliot explains a few minutes later she seems distant. It is their growing distance that begins the event. The colors on the mood ring and their symbolic meanings are as follows Blue Reserved tranquil calm believed to keep the bad spirits away. Yellow Sign of hope happiness unpredictable. Green Life nature great intelligence seen as a lucky color.Elliot was extremely inward in his feelings about the relationship he shares with his wife. When speaking about the absence of bees he exclaims to his students that there are forces at work in nature beyond our control and in this there is a double meaning. He can't control what his wife does in fact he feels powerless and unable to do so. If blue represents tranquil he certainly symbolizes one who is too reserved to speak up which prevents him from regaining his wife's love back. This is where nature must step in.But killing everyone around him wasn't the only factor in nature's method it needed a vessel a prophet if you will. Yellow represents happiness exactly what is absent from Elliot and Alma's life and what color does the ring turn when Elliot tells Jess puts it on in the diner? Yellow. What color are bees? Yellow and what does Elliot say at the beginning of the film when he's in his class of students? The disappearance of bees is an act of nature something uncontrollable. If yellow represents happiness he basically just stated that happiness has been absent in his life. The meaning behind the bees is double not only is it connected with the actual science aspect of the happening it's literally happiness that has disappeared from Elliot's relationship with Alma. When Julian decides to leave Jess with Alma and Elliot he says to Alma Don't you dare take her hand unless you mean it Alma decides then and there to comply with nature's wish to bring them together. When they approach the isolated old lady's house she says  Why are you eying my yellow drink? Making it clear that he is eying or yearning for happiness. The lady invites them inside and they're sitting at the dinner table. Shyamalan uses great lighting to make a strange plate in the middle of the table stand out to the viewers and only if you were paying close attention to the cinematographic details would have realized it but the plate and the cookies were more significant than you think.If yellow represents happiness and blue represents tranquility and protection from evil forces then you must have realized what the plate stood for. The plate was circular obviously and had a blue border. In the middle sat yellow cookies and when Jess attempts to snag one the old lady who is wearing a shawl which has flowers and other natureesquire features on it indicating that she represents nature at that point snaps at her saying you mustn't take what isn't offered to you. The old lady nature is guarding the plate. The lady just told them that if they want happiness they're going to have to earn it and work for it in their relationship so they must admit to their mistakes and stop looking for ways out of it. But if you look closer you'd see what nature is REALLY protecting on the plate Elliot and Alma. Alma agrees to look after Jess by taking her hand after Julian warns her not to unless she wants to commit like one would take another's hand in marriage. The plate symbolizes blue surrounding and shielding the yellow from the outside. Think back to when the two boys were gunned down on the porch of the isolated house what did Elliot say to Alma? We have to protect Jess. And when does the event finally disappear? When Elliot says he doesn't care about dying anymore and loves her and wants her. So he walks outside afraid but determined and she meets him there. They've proved their love to nature and they walk outside and come together in the middle of the two houses. Notice that there was a telephoniclike thing communicating between the house? That represents their distance. I can hear you like you're right here says Alma just like their relationship. They were both physically present in their relationship but in reality they weren't connected like they two people in love should be.What color was love? I don't remember. Again Shyamalan effectively uses double speak they have forgot what their pure love was actually like but moments later they realize it emotionally remember and they risk their lives by going outside to meet each other and die together. They've learned that their lives don't matter if they die alone and they have found the love and happiness they had been missing the entire film. So they go to each other and break the barriers separating them and the event stops randomly. Great but what does it all mean. Well in elementary school art class what color formed when you were painting and you mixed blue and yellow? Green. Green the symbol for nature the underlying force of protection and life was the reason the happening happened. Nature takes drastic measures to make apparent to Alma and Elliot find happiness together. I hope this made some sense to those of you bashing the film because frankly it was brilliant and deserves much more recognition and appreciation than what 99 of critics have been saying. Look deeper there's more to it than what was supposed to be a scary movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "The film starts out with the big blue eyes of Alma staring at the camera. What is she doing? She is on the telephone with a man named Joey without her husband knowing Elliot. She isn't cheating on him but as Elliot explains a few minutes later she seems distant. It is their growing distance that begins the event. The colors on the mood ring and their symbolic meanings are as follows Blue Reserved tranquil calm believed to keep the bad spirits away. Yellow Sign of hope happiness unpredictable. Green Life nature great intelligence seen as a lucky color.Elliot was extremely inward in his feelings about the relationship he shares with his wife. When speaking about the absence of bees he exclaims to his students that there are forces at work in nature beyond our control and in this there is a double meaning. He can't control what his wife does in fact he feels powerless and unable to do so. If blue represents tranquil he certainly symbolizes one who is too reserved to speak up which prevents him from regaining his wife's love back. This is where nature must step in.But killing everyone around him wasn't the only factor in nature's method it needed a vessel a prophet if you will. Yellow represents happiness exactly what is absent from Elliot and Alma's life and what color does the ring turn when Elliot tells Jess puts it on in the diner? Yellow. What color are bees? Yellow and what does Elliot say at the beginning of the film when he's in his class of students? The disappearance of bees is an act of nature something uncontrollable. If yellow represents happiness he basically just stated that happiness has been absent in his life. The meaning behind the bees is double not only is it connected with the actual science aspect of the happening it's literally happiness that has disappeared from Elliot's relationship with Alma.

Gems like Unbreakable en The Village would never have seen the light of day if someone other than Shyamalan came up with it. His direction always makes sure his story gets the maximum effect. I like his screenplays because they always consist of two things originality and well written characters. His new feature has neither. It's that simple. As a Shyamalan fan I felt this disappointment a little with Lady in the Water. But now it's twice in a row.In a nutshell Beginning in Central Park NYC people are effected what is first believed to be a neurotoxine causing people to behave irrational even to the point of suicide. But then the survivors start to uncover signs that it's not terrorists but nature itself spreading this virus yes it's nature against men. And nature is winning.I thought Wahlberg was a very poor choice. His range as an actor is far too narrow to play in any production that needs a little nuance. In other words he shouldn't be in anything else than a movie about cops or exmarines. Also the rest of the cast is surprisingly aloof. This includes Zooey Deschanel who looks like she's a liveaction version of a Manga character. Can those eyes be any wider?The way the information is brought to the viewer is simple. There is a hinge of a critical message about massmedia how we get our information and how we as a society are depended on TV mobiles phones etc. to get in touch with each other. But it's nothing major. Because there really isn't much to tell. The first 15 minutes are the most interesting. Although the very first scene with the two women on a bench in the park in hindsight is telling. I really had my doubts about everything the acting the actions taken by the characters the total mood and feel of the film. Once it goes into the 2nd act the movie becomes more and more non intentional laughable and silly.After seeing this I read that Shyamalan intended this to be an expensive Bmovie in the tradition of Romero etc. If that's the case then my original rating of 5 outta 10 should be a 3. Because nowhere in the movie does this become apparent. If you want a good homage take a look at Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead although that's really a remake. I don't like a these talented filmmakers who want to take 100 million budgets to make movies who look like they've been made for 10.000. But at least someone like Tarantino or Rodriquez adds originality and a real love for the genre. The Happening is really bad as a serious film. As an homage it's boring and without heart. Take your pick. But you will be disappointed either way.".

What this turned out to be is something that should have been left on the cutting room floor to be swept away and left to rot in a landfill. In terms of quality this movie makes Manos the Hands of Fate look like the Silence of the Lambs.The movie starts out okay. Mark Wahlberg plays a quirky science professor. His class discussions suggest some foreshadowing and expertise behind future events however these expectations fall dreadfully short from being fulfilled. Actually all expectations for this film are refuted. The storyline is bland and has no real plot. Early in the film one event sets the wheels in motion for the rising action. That's pretty much where the movie plateaus. There is no driving force to carry you through to the end.The dialogue is synthetic and clumsy. If I were facing a lifethreatening environmental crisis I would be discussing things relevant to the events athand. These people had the most odd insignificant things to say. It was absolutely ludicrous. Some scenes were so bizarre that all I could say was WTF? The actors' performances were equally as hollow as the individuals they portrayed. The characters have no depth and offer no additional substance to this film no glimpse into something that might ignite a plot twist or even more importantly A PLOT. The general overall feeling was as if everyone were fumbling their way through the script for the first time. Mark Wahlberg is typically a very good actor. In this movie his acting seems forced and unnatural. The closest comparison I can think of is watching his reaction to someone repeatedly snapping a rubber band against his face. Zoey Deschanel's character seems oblivious and disinterested in the events surrounding her. John Leguizamo was slightly more convincing but very awkward.I thought the Fantastic Four sequel was awful but this by far takes the golden turkey for the worst movie I have seen in the past year.

The Happening concerns a mysterious phenomenon which is leading to mass death and causing widespread panic around the world.

They are journeying across the country to escape the happening. The premise is interesting to begin with a message lying at the heart of the film. It is however taken beyond the point of redemption by Shyamalan. The script is simple generic unimaginative boorish rubbish. Stupid emotionless and inhuman lines spoken by characters which might with a degree of kindness be described as twodimensional. The relationships between them are entirely unbelievable and insincere. And the acting? Oh the acting... Wahlberg deserves a slap as the blandly irritating and vapid hero who appears to have only a single tone of mundanity available to him as a voice and Zooey Deschanel is... well simply Zooey Deschanel isn't. Having Wahlberg speak to himself would have been less painful oh wait he does try that. The expressions of joy fear shock and sadness upon Deschanel's face are entirely indistinguishable from each other and indeed from emotion at all. Possibly the single worst performance I have ever seen. To make matters worse both characters seem more attached to turning their heads to the side than they are to each other. You'll think they're trying to get something out of their ears. Perhaps its the sound of the dialogue clunky and tacky as it comes.Woefully acted barely written and just absurd the only thing happening with The Happening is the steady flow of people leaving.

I can only chalk it up to the 'cynical chic' of the South Park generation... those for whom empathy is an alien concept to whom ennui is epitomized by screen images which don't provide visual bombardments even few seconds and by whom meanspirited irreverence is demanded in lieu of actual humorous or heartfelt dialog.If the dialog seems simplistic well look a bit deeper and realize exactly what 'regular folk' might say or do if the events of this Happening actually were occurring... this is the way the world ends this is the way the world ends... not with the bang of snappy repartee or quotable soundbytes but with the whimper of incredulity and dread.Complaining about the acting or dialog in The Happening is like complaining about the 'jumpy camera work' in Cloverfield. In short anyone who just doesn't get it to that extent really shouldn't be posting their opinions on movies.Finding the truly human and poignant moments in the outwardly mundane yet intrinsically significant details of his landscapes and characters is one of MNS's great gifts and he hits the mark here too.The cinematography was superb the actors all hit their strides the story was compelling the occasional odd character visual pun and goodnatured joke worked well... no complaints on that score.I even went in expecting to be underwhelmed by the acting of the two lead characters but came out pleasantly surprised.But then again I loved The Village and found many good things about The Lady In The Water... so I guess mine will remain the minority opinion.But if you have admired MNS's previous work you will enjoy this film as well.".

	schema:headline " Awful";
	schema:reviewBody "I read with amazement that some people actually thought this smelly pile of rubbish to be good. Far be it for me to question the sanity of others.I found it strange that the film opened here in Trinidad before the official release date of Friday 13th in the US  gosh what a clever release date but I am sure once the critics rightly savage the film on Friday it will be thrown straight on to DVD. Actually in my view that would be a waste of a DVD blank. The premise of this travesty in a nutshell  and not to put too fine a point on it  is that the plants get annoyed and decide to kill us. But they don't actually kill us themselves oh no that would be far too simple and a bit too Day of the Triffids what they do is release a toxin in the air that makes us kill ourselves in a variety of creative and colourful ways. We throw ourselves off buildings shoot ourselves slash our wrists get run over by lawn equipment and even bash our heads into walls. Oh gee..I almost forgot...we also jump into lion cages and tease them until they bite our arms off as it is captured on iPhone video. If we take this incredibly stupid premise that the plant version of Google Labs suddenly figured out this clever formula and pair it with some of the worst and most stilted dialogue I have ever heard and then throw in some incredibly bad acting we end up with a recipe for an instant headache.When I say bad dialogue I don't mean just bad dialogue I refer to the sort of dialogue that would make your eyes roll back into your head and never want to emerge again. We are talking lines such as don't let the wind catch you and if I have to die I want to die with you and I of course paraphrase because I was having a hard time staying conscious. This sort of thing might work if it is done tongue in cheek but M N S takes himself so damned seriously with what I gather was meant to be a morality lesson about the environment that I have to assume it was unintentional. The acting made me think they just rounded up a bunch of people and dropped them on the set. Mark Wahlberg makes a fine underwear model but i swear his range makes Keanu Reeves look like Larry Olivier. Zooey Deschanel the female lead seems to have been given some sort of pupil dilating drops and then pumped full of medication before being let loose on the set. The only person who seemed to have escaped this film with her career was Betty Buckley who at least managed a camp crazy lady performance.So to summarise people start dropping like flies within the first 5 minutes then for the next 6 hours..OK fine...1.5 hours ...we have to listen to bad dialogue as people try to figure out what is going on and run from the wind. I am all for freedom of expression but I shouldn't be lured into having to sit through a grade Z movie. I can see no reason for this film other than wasting time and effort and making cinema enthusiasts feel ripped off. I read with alarm that M N S is about to embark on making another movie. Please M. Night do film a favour and put down the pen fold away the director's chair and step away from the camera.".

Far be it for me to question the sanity of others.I found it strange that the film opened here in Trinidad before the official release date of Friday 13th in the US  gosh what a clever release date but I am sure once the critics rightly savage the film on Friday it will be thrown straight on to DVD. Actually in my view that would be a waste of a DVD blank. The premise of this travesty in a nutshell  and not to put too fine a point on it  is that the plants get annoyed and decide to kill us. But they don't actually kill us themselves oh no that would be far too simple and a bit too Day of the Triffids what they do is release a toxin in the air that makes us kill ourselves in a variety of creative and colourful ways. We throw ourselves off buildings shoot ourselves slash our wrists get run over by lawn equipment and even bash our heads into walls. Oh gee..I almost forgot...we also jump into lion cages and tease them until they bite our arms off as it is captured on iPhone video.

	schema:reviewBody "It is a normal day in Central Park whenever people start talking strangely moving awkwardly and inflicting fatal injury on themselves. With the media buzzing with talk of terrorist attacks mass evacuation of the central New York area is organised. Among those fleeing is teacher Elliot Moore along with his wife and a few others. The theory is that the municipal areas are the targets but somehow the attacks continue in smaller areas all along the East Coast. Seeking refuge further and further from population centres Elliot tries to work out what is happening  if only to stay alive.It didn't help that I watched this film shortly after watching the much better The Mist which has the same sort of theme in regards an unknown and deadly disaster. Seeing something hitting the mark highlighted for me just how badly short of the mark this most recent M. Night Shyamalan film is. Of course it didn't really need another film to highlight the problems because they are all up there to be seen by all viewers. The opening scene drops us into the middle of a disaster starting out in New York where suddenly people are killing themselves jumping off roofs and so on and it does grab you that something big is happening. Problem is it has nowhere to go from there apart from delivering a clumsy and obvious environmental rant that makes little sense or impact. The film tries to make things personal and tense by focusing on a small group of characters but it doesn't work and the visual effect of the wind like Kermode said  who's making it blow? just doesn't work and you never once feel genuine fear or urgency.It doesn't help that the script is full of terrible dialogue and has no room or apparent need to have characters that the audience can care about. Many others have highlighted the terrible performances but in fairness with these lines and this direction how could they have been much better? I say this as someone who likes Wahlberg in films that suit him but here he is clunky and unconvincing totally hampered by the material handed to him. Deschanel spends most of the time gawking and offers nothing of interest while at least Leguizamo has the good fortune to get out early on  but even this is a surprisingly emotionless event. The fault for all of this must rest with Shyamalan himself because he has turned a mass disaster into a dull and lifeless affair the good things he has done Unbreakable and Sixth Sense are slipping further back in time and if his plan is to fill his resume with stuff like this then I wonder how long he can continue to have the career he would like.The Happening is a good idea but it falls down badly when it comes to the delivery. It lacks tension urgency character drama dialogue and intelligence and one way or another all of these problems can fairly be laid at the door of Shyamalan. A roundly poor film despite the potential.".

Like to end up in the HallofFame for worst movies of alltime or something. Because trust me  it's absolutely that bad! I literally don't understand how this movie could make it from production to premiere without a wall of people protesting it for its awfulness. I wish I could grade this film with dookies instead of stars because even giving it the lowest slotted amount of stars 1 feels wrong. I'd feel much better giving this film one giant dookie...Or ten. Or 50000. I'm not even sure at this point that's how bamboozled I am by this horrible movie. I didn't even think it was worth a review until I realized I may be the difference between someone watching and not watching and so I feel it's my civic duty to not let that happen.

	schema:reviewBody "M. Night Shyamalan has created a very original story with a lot of creative ideas amazing tone and brilliant shock and suspense scenes that would make even Hitchcock proud. So why all the hate for such an awesome movie? The only conclusion I can come up with is that either people just love to hate on Shyamalan as was evident with The Village or they just wanna see more rehashing. People must love love all of the sequelsIndiana Jones 4 The Incredible Hulk remakes and adaptationsSpeed Racer Iron Man and the straight forward ripoffsThe Strangers The Ruins etc. etc. Don't get me wrong I liked most of these movies with the exception of the ripoffs and Speed Racer but The Happening is far superior because it actually has originality. It truly in my opinion is the greatest movie of 2008 so far and maybe the best movie of the past few years.I loved everything about the story. The thing about Shyamalan is that people always complain about his movies being unbelievable or unrealistic and this simply makes me angry. A movie is not to be watched the intention of learning about the world it meant to be watched to see a story. It doesn't need to be realistic it doesn't need to follow some sort of snobbish standard. It's art for God's sake! Anyways back to what I was saying about the story. It moves amazingly well and I was upset to see it finally end because I wanted it to keep going. There are a lot of shocking and very disturbing moments which is why I was surprised that more horror fans weren't impressed. After all of his PG13 films I thought this would have had very little violence and barely deserved the R rating because most of his movies have been pretty tame. I'll tell you right now that it definitely earned the R rating. It is one of the most gruesome and disturbing Hollywood releases I've seen in a long time.I also wanted to mention how people have been complaining so much about the acting in this film. It was definitely bizarre and awkward but I thought that it followed along with the story and helped the movie create its own little world in that sense. I thought the whole cast did a great job.Don't buy a ticket to this one if you want to see another rehash of something that's already been done. It is a truly different film and I think it is ahead of its time. Shyamalan is one of the only directors out there still doing original work and he does a damn good job of it if you ask me.".

It's yet one more movie that makes me feel like I have a terrible grasp of history as I knew virtually nothing about the movement before seeing this. Melville himself was a member of the Resistance so I can only assume that his film is fairly accurate. It's powerful but not obviously so. It doesn't inspire tremendous reactions or emotions while viewing it but it gets in your head and stays there.The film is lacking any of that championing of the underdog spirit that infuses so many other stories about scrappy groups resisting the tyranny of the powerful. The members of the French Resistance in this film live like unearthly beings skittering from one shadowy doorway to another trying to erase any sign of themselves. The movie suggests that this need for nonexistence bleeds into their psychology as well  the film's main character becomes nearly inhuman in his devotion to the cause and his ability to ruthlessly do away with colleagues when there's a chance that one of them might jeopardize the others. He's not inhuman but he must do inhuman things because the desperation of his and his comrades' situations calls for it.The Criterion Collection's print of the film looks terrific or at least as terrific as the film's dreary pallet of grey and brown will allow. Melville gives the film an authentic look  only some scenes set in the London blitz and on an aircraft carrier have a studio set look to them.A shot of the Arc di Triomphe both opens and closes the film a symbol of the France that would eventually emerge from the dark days of WWII or an ironic jab at a country that can't take much credit for fighting off the tyranny of fascism?

Yet the world of the anonymous guntoting hoodlum occupies only a part of his oeuvre.'L'armee des ombres' aka The Shadow Army is Jean Pierre Melville 1969 masterpiece and does not deal with gangsters. The film is a mix of the director's war time experiences in the French Resistance and Joseph Kessel successful wartime novel. What is remarkable about this film is that Melville turned a mosaic of anecdotes that Kessel's novel is all about into a great dark epic.From the chilling opening shot of Germans marching down the ChampsElyses to the final scene involving the fellow Resistant Mathilde the great Simone Signoret the film seems to demonstrate that fighting for an ideal often leads towards death and solitude. What Melville does successfully is to show those deadends the way they occur to their protagonist very simply and minimalist however more than showing them Mr. Melville managed to make these realities death and solitude an equally tragic experienced for the audience...'L'armee des ombres' is Melville's most moving film a monument to the spirit of the Resistance rather than its actuality. A poignant drama with a strong performance from not only Lino Ventura but also Simone Signoret Paul Meurisse Jean Pierre Cassel Claude Mann Paul Crauchet to name a few.This is probably Melville's greatest cinematographic achievement and when fiction becomes reality when actors leave behind their egos to resurrect into heroes when the colors of the film mirror the one of the soul and when silence becomes music true cinema has been achieved 'L'armee des ombres' is a terrible yet powerful experience in which the words duty courage abnegation get charged with meaning".

Lino Ventura plays Philippe Gerbier a highranking officer in the French resistance. Gerbier is intelligent resourceful and brave. He and his small band of urban fighters are constantly in danger of capture and torture by the Nazis. This isn't a film of rural partisansit's a film where people meet in cafs and offices. No one knows when Nazi soldiers or Gestapo will sweep down and drag them off. No meeting is safe and no relationship is safe eitherhow many people can remain silent under savage tortures that go on for days?Although Ventura is excellent in the role the movie is dominated by Simone Signoret as Mathildetougher and braver than any of the men but possessing one terrible weakness.This movie is different than most films about the French Resistance. Things don't go smoothly they don't go well fear is everywhere and heroism often takes place in a prison cell where no one ever learns of it.

The movie defies any sort of simple categorization. It is a thriller without being thrilling. It is a spy story without a single gadget. It portrays the tedium of the task without being boring. Finally it tells a story of heroic courage without the benefit of a single hero. That last point isn't immediately evident and you are free to disagree of course but heroes as defined in the usual movie terms are hard to come by in this story.A popular adage goes one person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter. This movie serves up proof to that lie. There are true freedom fighters that will never be labeled terrorist and you will meet them during the course of this film. The movie makes clear that they and the ones around them paid a high price in pursuit of freedom. Not just in life and limb but in moral conviction. As the movie unfolds I found myself asking is this action justified? The answer of course is that it most certainly is. The better question is would I or anyone I know have the courage to do what had to be done.The technical aspects of the film are all first rate even though a bit below the best of European cinema at the time. In some ways the lack of high definition color and sets give it a feel much more in keeping with the time it portrays. The actors disappear into their roles and there is not a starturn to be found.According to the announcement made before the screening I attended it is being released in the United States on May 12 2006 just before the summer blockbuster crush. Why that date and why now almost 30 years after it was made I do not know. My guess is it probably has something to do with money. Doesn't it always?

	schema:headline " Melville's Powerful Epic";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a tough somber film that captures the absurdities involved in war and ultimately in life. The French Resistance heroes in the story are never shown conducting sabotage or planned attacks against the Germans as one would get in a traditional World War II movie. Instead we follow their claustrophobic and paranoid lives as they move from one hiding place to another or one prison to another constantly hounded by those in power haunted by their own actions and the inability to communicate with those dear to them. Melville shows us their doubts and questions as they deal with betrayal cowardice and the murky ethics of killing their own to preserve the larger good.Every episode in the film seems to lead to a darkly ironic conclusion and the meaninglessness of their efforts becomes almost overwhelming except that somehow these ordinary people continue to offer resistance in the face of death so that their heroism lies not in the ability to stop the Germans but in taking action at all while facing the abyss.While the acting is excellent all around Lino Ventura's performance as Gerbier deserves special attention. It's hard to imagine any other actor bearing the tremendous weight of this film as well as he does. Gabin at an earlier age might have had the physical and emotional strength but I'm not sure he would've been capable of Ventura's unassuming portrayal which is so necessary for his character. The shadows at the core of this tale are seriously dark and Ventura's Gerbier is strong enough to face them yet modest enough to realize he can't conquer them on his own. The only way the Resistance makes sense by the end of this film is in the collective effort of its members. Similarly each of us individually cannot conquer death but we as a group of human beings can continue to live on. L'Arme des ombres ultimately moves beyond a story of the French Resistance in World War II and serves as a powerful existentialist epic with Ventura's performance responsible for much of the film's dignity and humanity.As with Lon Morin prtre 1961 another story set during the war Melville seems more emotionally present in L'Arme des ombres than he does in his policiers or noir pieces and after seeing the film his overall body of work suddenly seems much heftier. While the movie isn't as visually daring of some of his other works it has a dark beauty all its own and his pacing editing shot selection and use of sound show him in great artistic control. Fortyeight hours after seeing it I still find myself caught in its world.".

	schema:headline " A grim austere masterpiece of the French resistance during World War II by JeanPierre Melville";
	schema:reviewBody "...but I'm going to die and I'm not afraid. It's impossible not to be afraid of dying. But I'm too stubborn too much of an animal to believe it. If I don't believe it to the very last moment the last split second I'll never die. This is Philippe Gerbier speaking. The time is between October 1942 and February 1943. He's the leader of a resistance cell in Germanoccupied France. He was an engineer. Now he is a hard man of skeptical intelligence. He kills a German guard with a knife to the throat so quickly and so unexpectedly it's nerve rattling. In Jean Pierre Melville's austere somber Army of Shadows we follow what happens to Gerbier Lino Ventura and a handful of others primarily Luc Jardie Paul Meurisse a weakseeming intellectual who turns out to be the head of resistance in France Jean Franois Jardie Jean Pierre Cassel Luc Jardie's younger brother and the remarkable Mathilde Simone Signoret resourceful with icy nerves a woman Gerbier tells us who is strongwilled methodical and patient. She knows both how to command and how to carry out orders. For four months we watch them operating in a claustrophobic environment of matteroffact violence the realities of betrayal hiding and planning a life without humor and only cautious trust and above all else the goal of killing Germans. That also means the need to kill informers no matter how young or how respected. They will all probably die. The movie is really a series of incidents that happen during these four months and how this group must respond a prison camp and an escape a shave from a barber who might be a Petainist the killing of a young informer in an empty house when three of the resistance including Gerbier discover they cannot use a gun there is no knife and finally they decide to use a towel to strangle the man. All the while gagged and tied the informer can hear them discuss the problem. This will be the first time any of the three have ever killed a man and they do it. There's Mathilde's nerve in smuggling a radio through a German cordon and her attempt to rescue a Resistance comrade from a prison where he has been tortured. There's the death of one of the four carried out by three. Briefly at the very end we read of what happened to the members of this group...a cyanide pill a beheading tortured to death survived. The ending is logical and incredibly sad. One of the most effective aspects of this movie is how it concentrates on this small group of people. There are no explosions gun fights beatings and torture scenes no gore no bravado. In fact there are comparatively few Germans. What there is is the unremitting pressure of discovery of making a mistake of tension of never being able to relax. All the main characters were based on members of the French resistance. The actors are excellent. Lino Ventura dominates his scenes. Signoret is incredible. This is tragedy not melodrama says Amy Taubin author of an article which appears in the Criterion booklet. When that last note on the screen is finished we feel exhausted. We have to remind ourselves that the right side won. Otherwise I at least would feel not just respect for these men and women but also deeply pessimistic. We've gotten to know them. Not to like them they are too grim and dedicated for that but to understand them to a degree. We know that if they had never existed there would have been others in their place. But I came to understand that I probably would never have had the fatalism the nerves or the courage to undertake what they did. Army of Shadows was shot in color but the effect has been so deliberately muted that the movie looks as chilly and overcast as the time period.".

	schema:reviewBody "Today watching a film like Mr.and Mrs. North 2005 or one of the Bourne or Mission Impossibles or any of the current crop of 'action' films up to and including the latest Kung Fu spectacular with invulnerable flying fighting machines seems to have rendered the genre into a profitable degeneracy rendering the depiction of actual human beings or their cinematic similitude obsolete as cave paintings. That anyone could be entertained by the goings on of a Charlie's Angles movie puzzles me. I do know there is no audience for a genuine film detailing the lives and works of a genuine underground resistance like that of the French during the German Nazi occupation.This might be the most mundane matteroffact war movie since Robert Montgomery's overlooked masterpiece The Gallant Hours. This is because the people patriots all who rose to fight were pretty ordinary people from rather prosaic walks of life. When it come to resisting a foreign tyranny in the form of an occupying army it isn't a bunch of professionally trained assassins who can be counted on but politically aware citizens who organize. These are ordinary people who had to rise to a situation. It is pure Existentialism.This is a very spare almost Jansenist version of the true story of the French Resistance. This Melville is as usual the opposite side of the coin from his twin Robert Bresson. At one point the central character played by Lino Ventura escapes by simply running away. He is helped along the way by a man who doesn't even mention the situation or his role in assisting. Its just done because that is what one does. The German's are hardly seen as this film is simply not about them. Each death there are very very few of them is a moral and ethical agony. At least for the resistance. The torture scenes are all off camera.Directoral moments are minimal such as when Ventura buys a new suit and shoes and then must leave them behind. Its like what soldiers say about combat extreme longueurs of boredom interrupted by moments of sheer terror. The truth behind the story is that the German Gestapo commander Klaus Barbie the so called Butcher of Lyon was a war criminal who was spirited out of Europe after the war by the US to train military regimes in South America in the techniques of torture that he perfected in France.In one of the set pieces British STOL Lysander aircraft land to and take off to bring certain resistance members to London. This scene features the actual aircraft. This was particularly amazing as most Melville films suffer from budgetary constrictions which usually effect the realism of certain scenes see the helicoptertrain transfer in Un Flic and there were possibly only two airworthy Lysanders at the time of the filming of L' Arme des ombres. The parachuting scene is also so nicely judged in its almost prosaic ordinariness yet we know its still a jump into the seemingly limitless darkness but which would aggravate the ADD generation. The dry almost Islandic renderings of scenes sometimes to the level of an Industrial film reminds me of the flat rendering Truffaut did of simply fueling a car at a service station in Le Peau Douce. This is why Melville and Bresson were the honorary mentors of the New Wave. It was a further adaptation of Realism and neorealism but with an awareness that at all times it was a film and therefore an adaption of reality but distorted only to make the truth more vivid.It is a pity if as I think this film will fail to connect with a generation saturated on the super hero shenanigans of SFX dareadoings. One writer pointed out the ridiculousness of someone deliberately sending himself to prison in order to deliver a cyanide capsule totally discounting true sacrifice for the type of action where the pretty actors manage to survive almost any cataclysm so that in the end after the death of countless nameless and faceless minions and the elimination of the satanic villaininchief while ankle deep in gore they can have a nice chuckle. Hey babes that's entertainment.Looking at the restored version of L' Arme des ombres just emphasizes the death of film culture not because there are no writers and directors who can make films like this but because there are no audiences for films like this. Highly recommended.".

While I can only speculate as to this film being THE film of its category as I've yet to see other films on the resistance it sets quite a high standard for painting a very calculated perfectly cool or cold on your POV piece of filmmaking on the subject. It's basically as if Melville having lived through the period this being perhaps an even more personal film than his other crime films still takes on some of the true knacks of what he does in the rest of his oeuvre. Taking characters who go by codes of loyalty professional as can be and in a true underground in society. However this time their opponent being the Germans instead of the police the stakes are raised. Even as a couple of parts in the middle seem to shake with the deliberate pace Melville sets a couple of times the main core of the story and the characters is remarkable and honest in a dark bleak way.Lino Ventura is at his best as Gerbier a main man in the French resistance movement who gets more involved in the proceedings following a brief prisoncamp stint the escape from which is one of the most daring in any film. The film is fairly episodic however encompassing a group of the resistance people including Mathilde Simon Signet very good as always Le Masque Claude Mann and JeanFrancois JeanPierre Cassel at a peak as well in his own way.Some of their operations are simple like retrieving weapons or finding more support through certain channels. Though here and there some payback is in due to the traitors. This becomes a higher issue as the film rolls into its final act as alliances come into question and the real ties of humanity together are tested in the midst of the German occupation.As usual with Melville all of this is told in its own way fairly simply almost clinically by Melville's camera. There are some zooms here and there some very intense camera positions though not awkwardly and exciting when need be. At the same time there are some scenes like a short scene on a beach all blue or a few others at night or in different lighting modes that are the best Melville's done in the midst of a color scheme used perfectly to correspond with the mood it works just as well if not better than how he uses it for his crime films. But one of the pleasures of seeing a film like this by a real kind of maverick of European cinema is seeing how much room he gives for his actors. These are not performances that become oversensational in the slightest. On the contrary what adds sometimes to the tension in some of the scenes or the outright tragedy is how the actors just play as they do professionalwise sometimes with what's not said meaning more and how the Melville gets these quiet moments is fantastic. Featuring a superlative musical accompaniment by Eric De Marsan this is one of the best directed antiwar films ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arguably the finest movie ever made about the French resistance. The only other film I think ranks with it is the documentary THE SORROW AND THE PITY. Here it's reimagined in typically Melvillian terms as a glum stark rewardless battle for survival  and in part something like a good death. As I'm sure other commenters have said it's interesting that for the most part we don't see the Nazis and they're certainly not represented as Nazis a group with a certain set of beliefs or motivations. Rather it's about battle itself the constant sense of doom the tawdry needs for killing former friends the sense that the only real choices are how one dies. People float a lot of existentialist references around but I wonder if Melville wasn't more influenced by Hemingway who had much the same sort of philosophy. It's a genuine classic.".

Here it's reimagined in typically Melvillian terms as a glum stark rewardless battle for survival  and in part something like a good death. As I'm sure other commenters have said it's interesting that for the most part we don't see the Nazis and they're certainly not represented as Nazis a group with a certain set of beliefs or motivations. Rather it's about battle itself the constant sense of doom the tawdry needs for killing former friends the sense that the only real choices are how one dies. People float a lot of existentialist references around but I wonder if Melville wasn't more influenced by Hemingway who had much the same sort of philosophy. It's a genuine classic.";

Seeing it in unsubtitled french didn't help with my French not exactly great. but lucky enough the film isn't too dialogueheavy and even more lucky it really is a masterpiece. How good? I'd actually put it down as the best film I've seen this year. Part gangster movie part documentary in its style it's a great look at the doomed lives of a group of resistance workers in occupied France. No big movie heroics no big explosions just lots of tension and having to deal with the awful details like killing an informer in the most practical way possible each new job taking a little bit more of their humanity away often losing their lives and making no difference. And the end caption revealing the fate of the characters really hit me hard.Excellent performances too especial kudos to Lino Ventura's weary and watchful lead and JeanPierre Cassel but the whole cast are superb. And so many great scenes like the improvised escape via a barbershop or the moment when Ventura gives away his last cigarettes to other prisoners because he knows they'll all be shot in a few minutes time. I can't speak highly enough of this one and really hope that Criterion will do this sooner rather than later  but why didn't the BFI release it with their batch of Melville DVDs earlier this year? So good I'm going to watch it again this week.I definitely think a petition to Criterion is in order here!".

In Melville's eyes these two worlds are very much the same. The gangster codes he adopted for many of his films were based largely on the codes of the French resistance and his own experiences during the German occupation not the other way round as some people suggested.Melville must be the most celebrated French director at this point in the U.S after the rerelease of Army in the Shadows in 2006 that was almost universally applauded by the critics as a work of genius or a forgotten masterpiece. Now in many ways this is a good film but something is missing and I can't really put my finger on it. Perhaps it's the clinically almost surreal interaction between the characters that worked so well in Melvile's gangsters film but here he is depicting admittedly his own  reality and very much his personal take on French resistance where real life plays a much greater part than in the surreal settings of many of his gangster films but it doesn't feel that way when watching this. The film is languidly paced with a slow buildup but never really catches fire. With Melville's characteristically cold  almost clinical  direction it's partly captivating in parts but perhaps the tone is a little too detached for my taste. He certainly takes his time to tell the story but the acting is first class with Lino Ventura and Simone Signouret giving memorable performances among a firstrate cast.Camera Obscura  710".

Stylish and sedate Melville finally took on a subject worthy of his skilled eye above pop heist yarns.

This is something I simply do not understand. When L'arme des Ombres finishes you feel as if you have been through a torrent of experiences just as Gerbier. Any speedier editing and the movie would come off as a popular spy film  and it simply is not a fit for that genre. Even the cinematography tells us it's going to be a dim journey. It feels as if every scene is filmed through a neutral density filter and the blue cast doesn't allow any warmth in whatsoever. Though the framing is often static there are indeed some breathtaking camera moves at the right moments.L'arme des Ombres may not have the cool factor of the Delon pictures but it's got truth on it's side and a truckload of memorable characters and performances. There is a masterwork here for those looking to see something special. If you want something faster go watch Ocean's 11 and forget what you saw ten minutes later.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1942 in France the engineer and chief of a cell of resistance Philippe Gerbier Lino Ventura is arrested and sent to a prisoner camp. He succeeds to escape and together with Felix Lepercq Paul Crauchet and the resistance killer Claude The Mask Ullmann Claude Mann they kidnap the traitor that gave him away to the Germans and execute him. Gerbier travels to London to discuss external support to the resistance and meanwhile Felix is captured by the Germans and tortured. The resistance members Mathilde Simone Signoret Guillaume Bison Vermersch Christian Barbier and the Mask unsuccessfully try to rescue him. But the brother of the resistance chief Luc Jardie Paul Meurisse Jean Franois Jardie JeanPierre Cassel sacrifices himself to have the chance to give a cyanide pill to Felix. Along the months the group operates until the day one member is captured by the Germans and becomes a threat to the others and shall be executed.L'arme des ombres is another long movie directed by JeanPierre Melville about members of the French Resistance in the World War II. The movie has great performances locations set decoration costumes and cinematography. However the original plot does not show any French Resistance operation against Germans the way we used to see in other movies. The movie gives the sensation that the members fight only for their selfpreservation during the war. Gerbier flees easily from the Germans and in situations not believable. Mathilde's mistake is silly and also unbelievable for a woman with her profile. But the worst situation is when Mathilde and the two killers go to the Gestapo's headquarter without any explanation how they have gotten the documents and with two guys that do not speak German.

He succeeds to escape and together with Felix Lepercq Paul Crauchet and the resistance killer Claude The Mask Ullmann Claude Mann they kidnap the traitor that gave him away to the Germans and execute him. Gerbier travels to London to discuss external support to the resistance and meanwhile Felix is captured by the Germans and tortured. The resistance members Mathilde Simone Signoret Guillaume Bison Vermersch Christian Barbier and the Mask unsuccessfully try to rescue him. But the brother of the resistance chief Luc Jardie Paul Meurisse Jean Franois Jardie JeanPierre Cassel sacrifices himself to have the chance to give a cyanide pill to Felix. Along the months the group operates until the day one member is captured by the Germans and becomes a threat to the others and shall be executed.L'arme des ombres is another long movie directed by JeanPierre Melville about members of the French Resistance in the World War II. The movie has great performances locations set decoration costumes and cinematography. However the original plot does not show any French Resistance operation against Germans the way we used to see in other movies. The movie gives the sensation that the members fight only for their selfpreservation during the war. Gerbier flees easily from the Germans and in situations not believable. Mathilde's mistake is silly and also unbelievable for a woman with her profile. But the worst situation is when Mathilde and the two killers go to the Gestapo's headquarter without any explanation how they have gotten the documents and with two guys that do not speak German.

	schema:reviewBody "My first thought after seeing this film was why haven't I seen it before? This is  alongside with Elim Klimov's gruesome 1985 movie Come And See  possibly the best WWII movie ever. The explanation seems to be that when it first was released in 1969 it offended the sensibilities of the ironic generation who wanted no part of their parents's world  which was dominated by that war. And so it remained for the better part of forty years... until the 2006 restoration and rerelease.Timely indeed because make no mistake about it this is a movie about terrorists. What is a hero? In my subjective view someone who manages to keep his human dignity under almost impossibly severe conditions. This isn't a film about heroism but rather its opposite the process of becoming inhuman because you don't see what else you can do. What are your options when your country is invaded by a foreign enemy and most of your countrymen  who aren't outright opportunists and collaborators  resign to a fate of daily harassment and police controls? Hope springs eternal as they say but for some it is a time to die  and in so doing making a statement against oppression but also abandoning their humanity.There is very little 'action' during the entire two hours that Army of Shadows lasts. Instead we get to witness how a handful of characters march towards their own demise through fatal choices that are being made. It is a tragedy. It doesn't end well. It is neither pretty nor sentimental. Melville's typical bleak colour palette somebody once said that he had an ambition of creating blackandwhite movies with colour underscores the grim realism of this movie. This is far far removed from the gungho propaganda heroism of us versus them that is so depressingly typical for war films.War doesn't create heroes it creates murderers. Indeed war makes shadows out of men. Even if you survive the hostilities in and of themselves you'll still have to live with what you've done. Other people have to live with what you've become. Interestingly and perhaps symbolically the leader of this resistance group is evidently a professor of mathematics and his action man an engineer. But under the circumstances they choose to become terrorists. The ultimate message of this movie is that this can happen to any one of us human beings given the right or wrong as it were situational context.".

	schema:reviewBody "JeanPierre Melville's Army of the Shadows attempts to portray the harsh existence of the French Resistance members in Nazioccupied France. One of the things I loved about this movie and which I love in all Melville's movies is that it's not romantic. In fact the movie goes to great lengths to show that the Resistance seldom achieved anything. Its members' great triumph was keeping out of jail staying alive and occasionally helping some people get out of France and to England.Melville portrays the members as people living on their own alone and suspicious about everything and everyone. Sometimes they had to be ruthless like when one of their own betrayed them. Sometimes they'd chicken out and disappear understandably no man should be judged for that. It's not a glamorous or fascinating life. But Melville's characters don't waste time or words on discussing ideals and beliefs. For them fighting Nazis is an understated mission and is explained by itself. They're conscious that they're not much that in the end they'll all end up caught but fighting is their only option.Although slower and more introspective than Melville's sophisticated heist movies Army of the Shadows is an interesting movie to watch if only to see Melville doing what he does best taking all the glamour and glitter from his heroes and portraying them as normal people caught in a complicated world.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I watched this film it never occurred to me that a working knowledge of World War II history might actually be a prerequisite to enjoying it. To my mind JeanPierre Melville's meditation on the French Resistance needed no preface since its subtext was one of existential angst the backdrop of occupied France merely serving as a backdrop.However as one reviewer complained the primary characters in 'Army of Shadows' spent the bulk of their time in selfpreservation rather than actually fighting the Germans. He was annoyed that the focal group never seemed to accomplish anything aside from the occasional jail break and places the qualifier of 'I'm no historian' on his remarks. Clearly.The truth is that this movie takes place during 1942 a relatively early stage in both the war and the occupation. At the time there was barely a Resistance of which to speak. Hence what little antiNazi fighting force did exist at the time had two primary concerns recruitment and survival. It wasn't until the Germans began impressing every able bodied man into forced labor in 1943 in what was then called Service du travail obligatoire or STO that the Maquis really gained in number and began to have success against their occupiers. In other words until the average Frenchman was given the options of either Resistance or concentration camp most lived cowering in quiet acquiescence. To criticize the movie for refusing to abandon history in favor of satisfying this or that viewer's infantile need for some satisfaction is just childish. Rewriting history in this manner would have done a disservice to the men and women involved.At any rate you may have already sensed from this review the tone of the movie bleak. The entire palette is one of muted blues gray and black. The weather is perpetually cloudy. The characters are constantly at odds with both their prospects of success and themselves.Constantly running and hiding Melville's subjects participate in actions of questionable ethics. Their portrayal as anyone who has seen his earlier works Le Cercle Rouge and Le Samourai can tell you is essentially that of the gangster. The French public at large objected to this characterization yet a good number of the veterans of this conflict either came forward in the press or contacted Melville directly to congratulate and thank him for his obvious depth of understanding of their plight. In this sense 'Army' is worth seeing for its historic value if nothing else. Incidentally it is noteworthy to make mention of the fact that unlike a good number of other war movies in which the participants are dyed in the wool believers in the cause and therefore beyond introspection here our protagonists often openly and plainly question themselves and each other and whether their desired ends really do justify the means they use to get them.As for the acting the quiet desperation so elegantly displayed by JeanPierre Cassel as well as the stoic pragmatic hopefulness portrayed by Simone Signoret are two tours de force. In each we see the kind of power and bravado one only finds in a man at gallows edge. The subtle depth of their performances does the unimaginably cumbersome heavy lifting required by a film of such profundity.Finally Army of Shadows is compelling on levels which are completely external to the film itself. Both its philosophical base and its depressive outlook lodge it squarely on level pegging with the literature of JeanPaul Sartre and Albert Camus as well as being reflective of the general mood in France at the time. This despite the fact that most of the French who saw it were dismayed at the mistakenly perceived heroic appearance of Charles de Gaulle who had recently been colored a villain for his treatment of the Paris Commune though in the film he's portrayed as ironic pinning useless medals on the chests of our 'heroes' who obviously view them with contempt.At any rate I would suggest any reader of this review to not just see this movie but really watch it. It is extremely subtle oftentimes the most pivotal moments are understated to say the least with what's not said being more important than what is.In any event a perfect 1010 goes to this cold cloudy quietly desperate diamond of a film.".

Probably because it is an adaptation rather than an original script the film has problems of length rhythm and tempo but that only helps it become graver more disturbing. It follows the exploits of a halfdozen Resistants during six months of German occupation in France between October 1942 and February 1943 and Melville deliberately purges the story of any heroic romanticism playing up its merciless survivalist elements like killing one of their own to ensure the movement's survival or maintaining one's real identity secret and depicting the courage and heroism of the Resistant more as a routine burden. The fact that the film ends on a downbeat note is not exactly casual since it only underlines the high cost that the Resistance paid for its stand for freedom Melville's emphasis on the honour codes of loyalty that were integral to his masterful thrillers like Le Samoura or Le Cercle Rouge is put to good use here especially since their use in crime stories descended precisely from the Resistance codes. And his austere stylized handling is as good as it ever was despite a production that is shoddier than usual locations and trickwork don't really cut well with the film's forlorn look especially since the copies currently doing the rounds on TV and video have some contrast problems. The actors are uniformly stunning especially Lino Ventura and Simone Signoret but probably because he was too close to the story it's not one of the director's masterpieces.".

	schema:reviewBody "A combination of lonely lives constituting a singular force destined to fight the Nazi occupation this is Melville's epic tragedy of ordinary heroes Army of Shadows. A movie poorly received at the time of its release in 1969 when De Gaulle was considered as an oldfashioned relic and Army of Shadows a conservative movie. Thankfully time did justice to the film which after 40 years is regarded as one of the greatest and darkest depictions of a period where life was outweighed by honor.This is a movie of an era where duty transcended every element of a fragile but historically significant organization the Resistance. No place for the individual the strength came from unity and secrecy. This secrecy gave the 'gangster' feeling to the film with its gallery of characters the towering presence of 'Le Bison' Felix the man with the bowler hat and the central character Philippe Gerbier a nononsense solidly built engineer played by the extraordinary Lino Ventura embodying all the irony and tragedy of the Resistance fighting against an outnumbering enemy which means a sentence to death perpetually postponed. Even Britain their greatest ally didn't trust their power enough and were afraid of wasting weapons. In one scene they didn't even have a silencer to execute a traitor. How futile was this War but how vital.This futility was one of the necessary steps before the ultimate victory but most of these men who fought in the early years knew they wouldn't survive the war. That's why they carried pills of cyanide in case of being caught. Melville was a member of the Resistance and so was the writer of the book the Academician Joseph Kessel from which this masterpiece was adapted so the film couldn't have been more faithful to the truth. And carrying your own death in your pocket is the most eloquent expression of its vicious unpredictability. Death was as familiar as life during WWII a life made of duty and survival. Never in the film these 'Resistants' seemed to have a break except maybe during the London trip their life was about planning and executing sometimes orders sometimes men with what was at hands.And sometimes there was nothing at hands a traitor must be executed but no silencers no knives only three men Gerbier his friend Felix and a young overly confident upstart. What followed was one of the most haunting deaths I had ever seen. And this is a credit to Melville's directing no dialogs no words only looks and the agonizing sound of a man whose soul is progressively fading. This was a scene painful to watch emotionally as it looked obviously painful for the executioners ... it was all in the faces and the cries of the younger whose immersion was also ours. This scene helped to face death in the later ones.Because death was everywhere hiding itself in the corner of a street after a first inspection through a hand on your shoulders or strangers coming to you  the element of surprise was so vicious that the certitude of death was even more comfortable. That's the point of torture for keeping alive and condemning to a slower death that'd test your moral resistance. Basically when you see Nazi treatments you realize how lucky were the ones who carried death in their pocket and had time to use it. Worse than torture they also killed your death through the anonymous execution so you could die as a coward when you actually were a hero. Like JeanFranois Jardie JeanPierre Cassel the handsome pilot who sacrificed his life and his reputation to die as an anonymous hero unknowing that his brother Luc played by the great Paul Meurisse was the leader of the Resistance the two brothers will die survived by that ironic secret. But this only matters for the witnesses of the film these considerations were nothing since the individual was nothing. Individual recognition might come after the war or not the outcome of this War is beyond individual fame it's about moral duty.This was indeed a doomed time where each mistake could lead to death. When Mathilde disguised as a German Nurse and was told that Felix couldn't be transported because he was agonizing she didn't show any emotions and left the prison. And despite all this perfectionism she made a fatal mistake by keeping the photography of her daughter a weapon the Germans used to blackmail her. How could such an intelligent woman not follow Philippe's advice and commit such a mistake. This is the whole point despite everything they're human and sometimes a last sacred link deserves to be cherished. Death was close but it was hard to believe in to feel it as long as life was here. That was their dilemma how could you feel detached when you're too stubbornly attached to life to admit the simple concept of death this admission is your strength but also your weakness. This is Philippe's weakness that made him run under the German fire. Choosing to run as an existentialist expression of your will to live even in an ugly word the unknown is always scarier.Melville's movie is cold with dark and cold colors a lot of clear blue of gray and white classical pieces of music accentuating the melancholic premonition of death. Long shots of people running to their lives meeting anonymous helpers like the barber who gave Philippe another raincoat or potential traitors like Paul or who knows Mathilde? After all Mathilde's look on her face when 'Le Bison' shot her is full of ambiguity. Maybe this was one of the reasons of individual recognition's futility you never know what hides beneath a conscience. What characterize a member of the Resistance are his acts recognized or not all that matters is fighting for victory. A victory none of our ordinary heroes would witness anyway.".

This is the whole point despite everything they're human and sometimes a last sacred link deserves to be cherished. Death was close but it was hard to believe in to feel it as long as life was here. That was their dilemma how could you feel detached when you're too stubbornly attached to life to admit the simple concept of death this admission is your strength but also your weakness. This is Philippe's weakness that made him run under the German fire. Choosing to run as an existentialist expression of your will to live even in an ugly word the unknown is always scarier.Melville's movie is cold with dark and cold colors a lot of clear blue of gray and white classical pieces of music accentuating the melancholic premonition of death. Long shots of people running to their lives meeting anonymous helpers like the barber who gave Philippe another raincoat or potential traitors like Paul or who knows Mathilde? After all Mathilde's look on her face when 'Le Bison' shot her is full of ambiguity. Maybe this was one of the reasons of individual recognition's futility you never know what hides beneath a conscience. What characterize a member of the Resistance are his acts recognized or not all that matters is fighting for victory. A victory none of our ordinary heroes would witness anyway.";

But please let's not pretend it's perfect. Everyone is saying this restored print of a film rejected as Gaullist twaddle in France when released and previously unseen in the US is his greatest masterpiece.Let's not go overboard. It's fascinating to see how in Army of Shadows Melville applied his style to an experience he knew first hand  the French resistance during the Nazi occupation. 'L'Arme des ombres is full of Melvillian effects. It oozes with a kind of heroic fatalism  gestural like Alain Delon's doomed hipster anomie in Le Samoura and as nihilistic but with selfless heroism replacing dry panache. However tied to its period approached rather late for one who lived it and adhering perhaps a little too faithfully to a respected novel about the resistance this lacks the rhythms momentum or focus of Melville's best work. Ebert's claim that it's the best foreign film of the year may be true but if so it's a sad fact. Nonetheless the writers who are heralding this as the work of a master aren't wrong. And at times it does achieve an epic quality a deadpan existential nobility. It is however rather shaky getting started episodic and disjointed in structure and it takes a while before the viewer can finally fall in with its rhythms. Color wasn't a good idea for anyone as noir as Melville and his other two late works Le Cercle rouge and Un flic though great look sickly. The color of this restored print is nice but detail is blocked out completely in the darks and there are many penumbral scenes that would be much better had they been shot with the greater crispness of black and white. For Melville color seems to have seemed simply an unsatisfactory kind of black and white.The opening image is much talked about. It's a short but chilling long shot of German soldiers marching in front of the Arc de Triumphe. We're told Melville had trouble getting permission to bypass restrictions against allowing Nazi symbols and uniforms on French streets. The point is made this is the occupation the time of Marchal Ptain and the Vichy collaborationist government of paranoia guilt betrayal and pinched kitchens a time of German voices and signage heard and seen everywhere of everpresent oppression.We begin with a man named Philippe Gerbier who's at the center of a small cadre of resistance leaders though their chief a writer on technical philosophy in peacetime and unknown to the rank and file Luc Jardie Paul Meurisse emerges only later. Gerbier is played by the convincing wonderfully stolid and stoical but not at all charismatic actor Lino Ventura. The only cast member who exudes much warmth is Simone Signoret who's central as Madame Mathilde but who appears less often on camera than various others. We see arrest torture or its aftereffects imprisonment execution by the resistance of its own traitors or compromised people and by the Nazis of captured resistance fighters. We see a lot of planning and discussion. What we don't see and aren't meant to see are suspenseful and dramatic and successful operations. This is a series of snafus and grim strokes of bad luck. This is about a gray war a long battle of noble failures.For a while we see only Gerbier  who's being taken to a Nazi prison camp as we begin a relatively benign one whose austere comforts Gerbier greets with polite irony. He escapes after being taken off to Paris just when he was about to stage a potentially spectacular escape from the camp with a young communist who like him is an electrical engineer. We remember how Gerbier runs down the street and then breathless lets himself into a barber shop and requests a shave.There are vivid scenes linked only be being parts of the collective effort. Gerbier and others nab a young man named Paul Dounat Alain Libolt who's become a traitor to the cause and they execute him. We remember the way they have to struggle to find a way to do it. Neighbors have unexpectedly appeared next door to their safe house in the country so they can't use a bullet there is no suitable knife and they're left with strangulation with a towel.In a central episode one of the leaders Flix Paul Crauchet is captured and tortured by the Gestapo and Signoret's character leads a trio who pretend to be a medic unit in a truck come to transfer Flix to a hospital. Imagine driving a truck into Gestapo headquarters that would take a brass pair.Gerbier is captured again and sent before a firing squad and this scene too is memorable because of the way the condemned men are released on a long gunnery field and told to run for it. It's sport. If they dodge the machine gun bullets successfully they'll be allowed to live to another day. Gerbier in voiceover wonders if he should run like a silly rabbit or just stand there and let the others run. But he runs with surprising results.The cadre  with their chief ritually in the car with them to solemnify and sanction the act  wind up  in the final vivid sequence  executing one of the bravest and must trusted of their members because that person has become compromised. How does it all end? Not happily.

Continuing  along this vein during the festival itself Stern spends much of his  camera time observing the audience caught unaware reacting to jazz on a  summer day after all live music does not exist in a vacuum. It's this  footage along with the incredible jazz music that makes this  documentary really special. As a viewer we get to react to the music  and react to the audience reacting to the music. That girl with the  seductively cute smile in the yellow dress and that gruff man hiding  behind the shades with the nervous twitch are people that we can  connect to from our own personal experiences at open air summer  concerts. The feeling of community one gets as the music breaks down  the barriers and the sun begins to set. Stern allows his moving  compositions to develop and flesh out the character of his subjects  giving us a nostalgic feeling for a time gone by that may have occurred  long before we were even born. It does not matter because we are there!  But this particular slice of time has special significance because  jazz would soon be replaced in popularity by Rock  Roll. We watch it  happen before our eyes as a young Chuck Berry takes the stage. Backed  by some excellent jazz musicians all looking amused but not taking  very seriously the music that would knock them off the charts for good  within a couple of years. As Berry's classic Rock  Roll riffs project  across the audience young people spontaneously jump to their feet and  start moving to the rhythm while their parents watch perplexed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think you can enjoy this film on a few levels.First it's a great chronicle of midcentury music. Although nominally a jazz festival producer George Wein put Berry a rock 'n roll star and Jackson the leading gospel singer of her day on the roster probably to attract a larger crowd.The images are superb. If you're over 50 you probably recall Bert Stern's photography. It was a pinnacle of midcentury advertising the Smirnoff ad shot in the Egyptian desert with the pyramid inverted in a refreshingly cool vodka martini glass with a twist. It was his stills of Sue Lyons in Stanley Kubrick's version of Lolita that everyone remembers. Almost everyone has seen his iconic nude photo shoot of Marilyn Monroe The Last Sitting.Here you have the still photographer's sensibility brought to a documentary. You can see the same thing in Ken Burns' earlier works for the same reason. The tight shots of the performers using very long lenses something that was not yet common in film but was emerging on TV at the time. The long languid at times voyeuristic shots of the audience. The Festival was taking place at the same time as the America's Cup trials. Stern shot some of this from a Piper Cub inexpensive to rent and almost as slow as a helicopter and there are some long cutaways to this footage. At times the images on the screen resemble the LP covers of the era  the original Miles Ahead cover for example featuring the beautiful white model on a sailboat which Davis despised.The mono sound is surprisingly good given the circumstances probably because the audio track was engineered and recorded by Columbia Records which was there to record its artists. They used thenstateoftheart studio microphones rather than the more durable lower quality ones you'd typically see in a concert setting in those days. Yes sound recording technology is better today.Second you can appreciate the back story of making the film. Today people in their 20s and 30s making documentaries probably have no appreciation of how tough it was to pull off this project. Today high definition video cameras and tape can be had for a tiny fraction of what film cameras 35MM stock and processing cost in those days. Sound synchronization is a given. Today for a fraction of the cost of a Moviola you can assemble your A and B rolls and soundtrack on a computer without having to pay extras for optical effects or sound processing. You no longer have to assemble and keep track of miles of film and mag stripe audio reels as well as handle the negative with loving care. It's all there on your hard drive and you get unlimited doovers. Aram Avakian the editor also a photographer and filmmaker was at it night and day for months and months largely by himself. Woodstock by contrast had a large team of editors and assistants. Avakian as much as Stern is responsible for the film the two share the director's credit. Also trying to sync up the images from all those different cameras with the soundtrack had to be challenging and I'm guessing it must have required a lot of work and inspired workarounds to get it looking as good as it did.Not to mention just how audacious it was for Stern to put the money up for shooting it himself and how he managed to get a large number of professional cameramen to help out. Since he didn't have enough money to shoot or even light everything Stern used George Avakian a legendary producer at Columbia Records and Aram's brother to cue the film crew to turn on the lights and start rolling when he thought a number would be worth shooting.After scouting the location Stern was so unimpressed by the Festival's cruddy venue the local high school athletic field he decided not to make the film only to have his mind changed by the person sitting next to him on his flight back to New York. He originally planned to create a story line around the festival. Luckily it proved impossible to film the hokey stuff they had written.Third it's an authentic look at midcentury America. When I was growing up in the 60s I used to look at back issues of Life magazines of the 30s and 40s. At first to goof on at the earnestness and corniness of the ads and the stories. But then to appreciate the nuances of living everyday life in the decades before I was born which you could glean from leafing through those pages. Anonymous history is infused in the film. The kid holding several empty soda bottles is probably there at the festival because sneaking into an event like this and picking up empties was an easy way to earn some money. In those days the deposit you paid on bottles was much larger in real terms than today.Shows like Mad Men do a decent enough job of picking up some of the atmospherics of this time usually by showing people smoking cigarettes like madmen but this is the real thing. The clothes especially but also in the gestures and the way people move. And then there's the WhiteNegro thing in this film. There wasn't the kind of overt racism in Newport Rhode Island that you would find in the south but there was definitely separateness. Remember in 1958 Amos 'n Andy was still being shown on TV and only white people were in TV ads. The two groups are integrated in the movie but this wasn't typical. Stern was told that he probably couldn't distribute the movie in the south because of this.In all a real gem for anyone who loves jazz. A mustsee for anyone who likes makes or wants to make documentary films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Partly a jazz concert and partly a time capsule to a long ago era Jazz On A Summer's Day records highlights of the fourday 1958 festival held in Newport Rhode Island. The film gets off to a slow start with interviews of arriving audience shots of Newport and cutaways to the America's Cup yacht race taking place concurrently.About nine minutes into the film the real program begins. The brilliant Thelonious Monk plays Blue Monk on the keys. From here on most of the audio and visuals focus on the festival itself except for brief visual cuts to the sailing event and impromptu shots of people enjoying themselves in presumably nearby locales. Although the film title says day about twothirds of the film is shot at night.Different styles of jazz provide ample variety and run the gamut from an apparently unrelated boarding house jam session to the rockin' soulstirring gospel music of Mahalia Jackson who forcefully belts out three numbers at the end. Louis Armstrong and rarely filmed trombone legend Jack Teagarden perform a casual seemingly improv vocal of Old Rocking Chair. Dinah Washington singing All Of Me and the unusual percussion sounds of the Chico Hamilton Quintet are also quite good. But my personal favorite was Chuck Berry and band with a slowed down beat thumpin' rendition of Sweet Little Sixteen.My only serious complaint is the film's editing which includes the sailing event and quite a few extraneous visuals and a toobrief overall runtime. A threehour total jazz event would have been ideal.The overall mood of the concert is upbeat almost carnivalesque. The camera jumps back and forth between onstage performers and audience reaction. Everyone seems to be having a good time. Glad to see this film recognized by the National Film Registry to preserve an account of a unique event held at a crucial moment in American history.".

All those I've cited are highlights of what I've seen in this great documentary of the Newport Jazz Festival of 1958 which ran at the same time as the America's Cup boat race of which some of that is also shown. And seeing all those shots of audience members having the time of their lives were also fine visually especially when one was seen singing along with one of Sachmo's songs.

Together with his film team he tries to discover the reasons for the breakup of his relationship. His exgirlfriend has since married and is in the throes of divorce. Parallel to this he relives his own love relationship to this woman. Following a period of analytical observation he becomes more and more involved with his own problems. 'Moon in Taurus' is a film without actors for all the participants act themselves. This method aims at an exceptional authenticity which makes it possible for the viewer to compare the relationship conflicts with his own and to experience the cultural differences between the continents of Europe and America.";

Beresina is a comedy that gains its attraction from a naive Russian girl Irina played by Elena Panova a very talented young actress. Although it is presented in a very fairytalelike way the story takes place in today's Switzerland with all its oldfashioned cliches. But since the movie never tries to take itself too serious it manages to give a view of the real centers of power in this oh so beautiful little country the way they could be. Actually at the date of release reality has already caught up with fiction meaning we now have a scandal about a secret Secret Service and a whore pretending to know the Swiss government from within. One might almost call Beresina the Wag the Dog of Swiss politics.All in all the film's first half presents kind of a chronicle of slowness and hence reflects the way structures are broken and opened to new ideas in the heads of many people always being mindful of tradition. But this slow pacing can also be very amusing as Daniel Schmid shows us. Although he never reaches the tempo of a Billy Wilder comedy he manages to capture another speciality of the very same director showing people the way they are making us care for them without taking them too serious. A pretty obvious characteristic of this movie are the constant repetitions which may not always please but which show effectively how the presented characters live their lives following ritualized patterns.What makes this movie go is doubtlessly the story of Irina the Russian callgirl. She is the only one really believing all the myths and promises around her promised Switzerland and ironically a central factor in their destruction. She provides the only emotional relation to the audience. In her idealisticly pure hope for a paradise she is willing to sacrifice even a virtue or two lying is a bad thing! in order to make her dream come true.It's also a story about friends most of them false ones though. From a certain point in time things happen to tumble and the satire turns into a very amusing grotesque.Watch out for the rduitsequence a true highlight! I have to admit that I would have never thought that Swiss Folk songs could be delightful sung with a Russian accent. By the way there is a powerful performance by Geraldine Chaplin who shows us a hundred ways to open a fanI was very pleased to see the first good Swiss movie in years even if its attraction may somehow be limited to Switzerland and prevent it from being successful in probable foreign releases.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beresina oder Die letzten Tage der Schweiz is a Swiss Germanlanguage film from 1999 so this one will soon have its 20th anniversary. With late director Schmid and writer Suter in charge this project unites 2 of Switzerland's most famous and successful filmmakers from the last decades. The lead actress is from Russia like her character and it may be one of Panova's most known career efforts and you probably did not expect Geraldine Chaplin to show up in here and not just for a few seconds. German film buffs will immediately recognize Ulrich Noethen and Stefan Kurt. Maybe these names are also a key reason why this film was chosen to represent at the Oscars back then even without much awards attention. It did not manage a nomination though.Despite all the political stuff in here this is never a politics movie. It is also not much of a drama despite several dramatic issues being touched such as expulsion. These are always presented with an ounce of humor frequently with very dark humor. I do think that the film had a couple solid moments here and there but for over 100 minutes it simply wasn't enough. The absurdity may be the film's biggest strength and biggest weakness at the same time and if you have seen it you will know what I mean with that. It's never an actors' movie but really all about the plot and subject and not about individual performances. As a consequence this is also where the quality especially isn't enough. I would say the actors were better than the script. That doesn't mean it is a failure though. Not by any means. But maybe you really need to be Swiss to truly make a connection here. It's somewhat interesting how Switzerland is nowhere near Germany and Austria in terms of cinematic status but also that some of the most known Swiss films are about Switzerlan. Die Schweizermacher would be another example. Okay not gonna talk any more about other films now this one here gets a thumbsdown from me overall and I do not recommend checking it out even if it has some upside too. Go for something else instead.".

Maybe these names are also a key reason why this film was chosen to represent at the Oscars back then even without much awards attention. It did not manage a nomination though.Despite all the political stuff in here this is never a politics movie. It is also not much of a drama despite several dramatic issues being touched such as expulsion. These are always presented with an ounce of humor frequently with very dark humor. I do think that the film had a couple solid moments here and there but for over 100 minutes it simply wasn't enough. The absurdity may be the film's biggest strength and biggest weakness at the same time and if you have seen it you will know what I mean with that. It's never an actors' movie but really all about the plot and subject and not about individual performances. As a consequence this is also where the quality especially isn't enough. I would say the actors were better than the script. That doesn't mean it is a failure though. Not by any means. But maybe you really need to be Swiss to truly make a connection here. It's somewhat interesting how Switzerland is nowhere near Germany and Austria in terms of cinematic status but also that some of the most known Swiss films are about Switzerlan. Die Schweizermacher would be another example. Okay not gonna talk any more about other films now this one here gets a thumbsdown from me overall and I do not recommend checking it out even if it has some upside too. Go for something else instead.";

It is precisely this quality which impels many people young and old alike to seek Swiss nationality in order to lead a better life than what they have been leading. This is something which viewers can watch in 'Beresina' a film where Swiss director Daniel Schmid chooses to reveal the weaknesses of influential Swiss people when they are duped by a meek person exploited by them. It is fun to watch how the family members of victims endorse the presence of the exploited person in their midst. Daniel Schmid's film depicts some powerful Swiss people namely an army general some industrialists a media specialist etc who misuse their power as well as position to indulge in personal pleasures. This film also features a discussion about how far can an ordinary person go in order to dream something big in life? There is also a sub plot about basic human values as a young Russian prostitute's innocence is shattered when a letter informs her of not having obtained the Swiss nationality. The entire story runs slowly until viewers finish watching threefourths of the film. It is only in the last parts that some crucial events happen which herald the destruction of Switzerland. Despite being a story about an expensive call girl Berezina is not at all exploitative. It has been hailed as a comedy film but watching it one would not laugh in the same manner as how other people do when they watch Chaplin Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd.".

Gnther is gay and Paul is straight but has never slept with a woman. The two boys know each other's story and yet remain good friends. Gnther has invited Paul to his family's house outside Berlin and Paul has accepted hoping to see Gnther's sister Hilde again. Paul has met Hilde once before and she's made quite an impression on him. Hilde is a free spirit who believes that it's OK for a woman to have several lovers at once but she's never looked at Paul that way. She is much more fascinated with Hans a boy from a much lower class who works in the kitchen of a restaurantdance club that she and Gnther frequent. Problem is Gnther is also in love with Hans. Add to this somewhat incestuous somewhat quadrangular love arrangement the Leopold and Loeb philosophy of the day throw in a weekend party of heavy drinking and absinthe use top the whole thing off with a pistol that Gnther has become fascinated with and you have a recipe for disaster.The movie opens with Paul being interrogated after two of the party goers end up dead so you know that this isn't going to be a happy story from the very start but watching these attractive young people as they meander through the events that lead up to this tragedy is fascinating.This movie unfolds slowly and will not be to everyone's taste but there are images and moments that will linger with the patient viewer long after seeing the film. I especially like the way that Gnther's homosexuality played a part in the story but didn't dominate it.. It was just one aspect of the overall course of events and was treated as just another fact of these people's lives.".

More of a coincidence than deliberately i might add since the premises of the film did not really seem to suit me.

Berlin this is a story of worldweary rich teens looking for new kicks to make their life interesting. The two friends Gnther and Paul go out one weekend to Gnthers family's summer house for partying and drinking. Troubled love is involved and soon things spiral out of control.I did enjoy this film quite a lot. I'm sure the slow pace will put some people off but i had no problem with it. I found the actors to be the films most prominent strength many of them managed great performances. Also i found the lack of sex and nudity in a film revolving mostly around love and sex to be liberating. It never feels like exploitation.The one thing that put me down a bit is that i don't really know what the filmmakers wanted to say with this. We get a view of events happening but where is the point of all these events? Perhaps that is for us to find out but i still feel i would have liked some sort of closure. This is a small point though and probably also something that won't bother most viewers. So i'm confident in recommending this to anyone interested in this kind of film. It's a nice period piece and well worth watching if you are not put off by the somewhat slow pace.I rate it 610.".

And since they consider happiness to be the essence of life they decide that once this moment is over they should kill themselves and the person who took them their happinesslove away as well before they feel miserable. And Gnther does that.The beautiful scenery and the unobtrusive but still remarkable score make just the perfect finish to this beautiful story.Some viewers might find the paste rather slow but I think that this is the only way to really get close to the characters and understand their motives.

It is as much a tale of the decadent 20s in the Berlin that would breed the Nazi Party as it is a stirring thriller. And if think back to the times of this story a similar theme was being played out in this country under the names of Leopold and Loeb! Strange crossover...Paul Daniel Brhl is a student poet from a working class family who makes friends with Gnther August Diehl who is a gay and wild romantic from the wealthy class. Their common thread is their sense of rebellion against their families and the need for Byronic defiance in a world they find shallow. The make a 'suicide pact'  that once they discover true happiness in love and knowing that true love cannot be repeated they will commit suicide. The two lads go to the country home for a weekend party of drinking and carousing. Gnther brings along his love Hans Thure Lindhardt a kitchen worker clearly not in Gnther's social class who begins having a sexual liaison with Hilde Anna Maria Mhe Gnther's lusty superficial hedonistic sister. Paul is in love with Hilde but at the party he observes her acts of sexual freedom and turns to plain Elli Jana Pallaske for his initial sexual encounter. When Gnther realizes he has lost Hans to Hilde the options of the 'suicide pact' play out in a gruesome way. Paul is left to tell the story later becoming a novelist condemned by the Nazis and thrown into exile.Achim von Borries manages to recreate this sick tale with all the feeling of Weimar decadence. It takes a while to get the characters straight but once they are in place the development of each has a fearsome momentum. The young cast is excellent. It is refreshing to see a film that includes a gay main character whose sexuality is at the core of his life but at the same time the story is not focused on the gay character so much as being focused on all youth in a cumbersome time in history and in adolescent physiology! The film is in German with English subtitles and presents the actual events of the case in writing on the screen after the story is completed. Very Effective. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Love In Thoughts is a beautifully made yet ultimately pretentious German drama based on an event in the life of the author Paul Krantz who published under the name of Ernst E. Noth.The film focuses on Paul's friendship with Guenter and his love for Guenter's sister Hilde. This scenario is further complicated by the fact that Hilde is having an affair with Hans a man that Guenter also loves. Paul and Guenter discuss taking their own lives and those of their lovers when their love has reached it's zenith. Over the course of a weekend Paul and Guenter are rejected by the objects of their affection and they reach the point where they have to decide whether or not to go through with their murdersuicide pact.My biggest objection to the film is the treatment of Paul and Guenter's fatalistic view of love. Their actions are treated as grandiose and tragic. Personally I'm not sure what is particularly heroic or romantic about two losers who turn homicidalsuicidal when their imaginary lovers reject them. This problem is compounded by the fact that Hilde and Hans are so unappealing. Hilde is the town bike who not only disrespects her brother's emotions but is also rude to her best friend. Hans on the other hand is a chef with bad teeth who doesn't appear to have anything going for him at all.Despite the film's general pretentiousness and self importance it does have many things to offer. Firstly the actors. I enjoyed Daniel Bruehl's portrayal of Paul. He is a little bit pouty but the subtlety of his performance is a huge relief in comparison to August Diehl's hammy turn as Guenter. The film offers the chance to view another fine actor in Thure Lindhardt who plays the creepy Hans. Furthermore the film looks absolutely fantastic. The cinematography is stunning. The landscape is captured beautifully and a scene in which the teenagers get high on absinthe is wonderful filmed.This is an accomplished film but by no means a great one. Despite its significant beauty Love In Thoughts is ultimately hollow and insubstantial.".

	schema:reviewBody "Was ntzt die Liebe in Gedanken or Love in Thoughts is a German movie from over 10 years ago that stars Daniel Brhl and August Diehl the possibly two biggest players in terms of the New German Wave of cinema in the 21st century. Anna Maria Mhe daughter of Ulrich and Jana Pallaske play the major female parts both fairly well known at least here in Germany. The film is based on real happenings between the two World Wars which is maybe the biggest reason to watch it. Sadly it is also almost the only reason as I have to say I was not too impressed by Achim von Borries' script and direction in this one. Brhl and Diehl have given better portrayals in better movies too.Two best friends make a pact to kill those who broke their hearts and commit suicide afterward but only one of them sticks to the plan. This is in theory a pretty interesting plot but unfortunately the movie loses itself in all kinds of love triangles and apart from a couple scenes early on and the final showdown there really isn't too much in this film about the aforementioned pact. I cannot say I really cared for the characters or with whom they were in love which really hurt my overall perception of the film. I also felt that the fact that this plays in the 1920 could have played a bigger role in terms of political situation or general inclusions other than costumes and set decorations. Of course it should not have been about this at the core but still I think it may have helped the film to have a little more emphasis on the time during which it was set. Overall I do not recommend the watch. I thought this would be better and I am actually glad this was such a short film only runs for 80 minutes without credits.".

This story based on a true facts has already been filmed in the 20's and a second one during the 60's but now director Achim von Borries claims that this is the definite version what else could he say anyway?. Everything is set in the twenties which was a good time for Germany as there was no sight from the dark forces that were to come. It was also the days of the rise of psychology and some youngsters the most famous actor among them is Daniel Brhl who is appearing in almost every German film there is made these days are building up their suicideclub. The rules are simple but hard. Love is the only reason to live love is the only reason to die for and therefore life must end if there's no love to be found and those who have betrayed that love will be taken in death as well. The love is at its most free vision as there is both homosexuality which was back then immoral and even incest. Von Borries could have made a very interesting film with this but it looked like it was more a trip into poetry rather than coming up with good cinema. The dialogs are far too bland the acting sucks and it's filmed with such an uninteresting eye that it sets the viewer asleep. German cinema has found its reincarnation today but this film doesn't belong to that current wave.".

	onyx:emotionText "Recent years the German cinema did surprisingly well with some unexpected successes and this movie Was ntzt die Liebe in Gedanken tries to profit from this revelation but in no way it can be a contender. This story based on a true facts has already been filmed in the 20's and a second one during the 60's but now director Achim von Borries claims that this is the definite version what else could he say anyway?. Everything is set in the twenties which was a good time for Germany as there was no sight from the dark forces that were to come. It was also the days of the rise of psychology and some youngsters the most famous actor among them is Daniel Brhl who is appearing in almost every German film there is made these days are building up their suicideclub. The rules are simple but hard. Love is the only reason to live love is the only reason to die for and therefore life must end if there's no love to be found and those who have betrayed that love will be taken in death as well.

	schema:reviewBody "This demented and adorably overthetop gory zombie flick was presented and introduced here at the Belgian Horror  Fantasy Festival by its writercreator Scott Thomas. He claims that in spite of all the obvious plotsimilarities with Snakes on a Plane his film is definitely NOT a quick cashin on the huge success of the 2006 summerblockbuster and that the basic concept and the preproduction phase of Plane Dead actually predate Snakes on a Plane. Well I don't know if all that is true but I tend to believe Thomas because he's such a nice guy and he seemed very confident. Moreover even if Plane Dead simply was a ripoff of the popular Sam L. Jackson hit I still wouldn't care that much because it's such a tremendously entertaining and enthusiast splatterflick! As long as you don't expect new and groundbreaking story lines andor highly intellectual dialogs Plane Dead honestly can't fail to amuse you. In most departments it's even far better and more appealing to horror fanatics than Snakes on a Plane because it's a lot faster cheesier gorier and shamelessly features all the standard clichs us genre fans love so much. Safely protected in the cargohold of the redeye flight from L.A. to Paris a mysterious scientific experiment is transported out of the US by its malicious creators. The unscrupulous Dr. Leo Bennett and his loyal researchers developed a virus that rapidly destroys human DNA only to revive the infected victim again as a bloodthirsty and unstoppable zombie. He plans to sell his formula to the military in order to create the ultimate soldier of course but some unanticipated turbulence and noisy passengers on the 747flight cause the female testcase zombie to resurrect a little early and she immediately begins to feast her way through crew and passengers. Once bitten the victim turns into a zombie as well and pretty soon the plane is overrun by seemingly more zombies than there were passengers in the first place. It perhaps takes slightly too long before the zombies run loose on the plane but when they do Plane Dead turns into a nonstop series of laughs creative deaths and extreme gore. Apparently only stereotypes were allowed aboard this flight and it's always a lot of fun to watch those getting killed off one by one. Naturally it's the elderly pilot's last flight before retirement there's the heroic copper  who eventually has to save the day  transporting a witty criminal arguing teen couples sexy yet emptyheaded stewardesses couples with marriage issues and Tiger Woods' biggest competitor himself! The gore is guaranteed to please people as the script features several ingenious new methods to kill zombies like an umbrella through the head nineiron golf clubs and of course airplane engines. Be honest what would you rather get facetoface with whilst stuck in an inescapable location ordinary snakes albeit a little venomous ... or filthy virulent ravenous and outrageous zombies? There are quite a few recognizable faces in the cast like Kevin J. O'Connor the creep from Lord of Illusions and Deep Rising Erick Avari and Richard Tyson. The lines and characters are often very funny the makeup effects are delightfully campy in an oldfashioned way and there even is an occasional moment of genuine suspense. Plane Dead is awesome horrorentertainment and I hope Scott Thomas will enjoy the success he deserves with it.".

It stands out because it presents you with some things you don't expect from the average lowbudget directtovideo Zombie flick i.e. a script that actually works decent acting neat makeup effects and even a nice score.What I liked about the plot There's are rather long but surprisingly suspenseful introduction before it gets bloody. That part works because the writers use the time to introduce some well chosen stereotypes of characters that promise to be fun victims later on. There's the jock his rich bitch girlfriend the cutebutstupid stewardess the evil corporate guy and even a Tiger Woods lookkindaalike just to name a few. The movie also stays relatively plausible and plays coy before it kicks into high gear for the finale. It's a sudden and thoroughly enjoyable switch in tone.Flight of the Living Dead is no disguised comment on society but as far as zombie butcherfests go this one is pretty nice. Not revolutionary film making but rather competently executed gory fun.If you enjoyed the intro song and desperately tried to locate it without success Take a look at the MSpace page of one Bill Grainer the gentleman who wrote the song.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so pretty much any zombiefan will know about George A Romero's classic 'Night of the Living Dead.' There have been many imitations. Here we have one that goes as far as to try and rhyme its title for added effect. The result  soso.I'll start by saying that 'FLIGHT of the Living Dead' is no classic. Any zombie movie today always has to fight to get noticed among the dozens of undead offerings we find released straight to DVD. So... what has this one got that makes it worth the watch? The answer... no much really. But that doesn't mean it's all together bad. The title alone basically tells you everything you need to know about the plot. A plane. A toxic outbreak on board. Zombies. Before I watched it I did kind of wonder how they could drag out a film set in such a confined space to an hour and a half  even the biggest jumbo jets would soon find every last inch crammed by flesheating ghouls pretty quickly. However the filmmakers have done a reasonable job of making things believable.The first half of the film introduces us to the characters and reinforces what little plot there is. Basically the plane is populated by stereotypes. You will probably guess the fate of most of them but there are a couple which actually stand out as people you'd root for ironically one of the best characters is a prisoner who's on his way to jail!. And that's enough for this sort of film. It basically scrapes through on character traits. The plot is waferthin and the gore is nothing that you haven't seen before.Like I said it's no classic but if you're in the mood for yet another zombie film and you're in a forgiving mood then this one might fill an hour and a half of your life.For me the only part I really rolled my eyes at were when the undead  somehow  managed to 'punch through' the floor of the plane in order to climb out of the 'hold' and get into the cabin to feast on the passengers. Next time I'm on a plane I'll be a little worried when I'm taking my seat if I think the floor beneath my feet could give way so easily!".

A refrigerated box relevant to a secret government experiment is being shipped to Paris from New York in the cargo hold of a passenger plane. On board we have young beautiful stewardesses three mysterious doctors two amorous young couples anxious to join the mile high club a nun and a pro golfer whose wife is angry about the attention he gets from the public. A policeman is escorting a wisecracking thief who has stolen 35 million to trial. This is the pilot's last flight he's about to retire to spend time with his grandchildren and go on a cruise to Alaska with his wife.Watching the first part of the film I was mentally classifying the characters into three groups Dead Meat Survivors and Maybes. It was a pleasant surprise that I was wrong on several of these. One character I thought was going to be a Survivor for sure was one of the first victims.That's the advantage of having very very capable actors who aren't big stars. If this had come from a major studio you could look at the cast listing on the poster and determine who will and won't come through it. Here all bets are off.There's lots of action the closing credits list over fifty stunt players and lots of gore plus the requisite unimaginative cursing. The actors all seem to be having a good time. The good thing about playing in a film where you're turned into a zombie is that although your character gets killed off early you're still in the rest of the picture. Plus some get to do two death scenes.In a perfect world David Chisum Kevin J. O'Conner and Richard Tyson would be huge stars getting 20 million a film and Brad Pitt would be waiting tables. Check out their credits on IMDb. They're hard working actors who do their jobs and go home. They deserve better.FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD lost two points for the way they felt obligated to leave the door open for a sequel. Sure it makes it easier for the writers if another film in the series comes along. But look how definitively Jason has been killed off in the Friday THE 13TH series and it doesn't slow him down a bit.".

It's everything the title says it is but must agree with those here the title is rightfully and simply Zombies on a Plane. It doesn't get any better than that.Director Scott Thomas even though working with a limited budget really makes a B movie look great. Camera lighting and sound were all wonderful sometimes in a low budget production things are not always this good sometimes the sound is poor at times the lighting fails in some scenes camera work is hurried but not with this film. You can tell a lot of love went into this movie and that my friends is what makes a bad movie great.If you haven't seen it do so. This isn't that movie you'll buy and only ever watch it once.

Now rather than relaxing on the redeye as they had planned the passengers on this particular overnight flight find themselves fighting for survival against an ever growing horde of bloodthirsty zombies.What makes Flight of the Living Dead so fun is its no holds barred anything goes approach and its twisted sense of humour which delivers laughs and scares in equal doses. The likable cast don't take things too seriously and the sense of funlike the virus in the filmis extremely infectious. Kevin J. O'Connor is particularly good as Frank Lee Strathmore a criminal being transported to jail by niceguy cop Truman Burrows David Chisum. Frank is a very funny characterslimy but quick wittedand he actually ends up being something of a hero.Also worthy of mention are Kristen Kerr as the pretty stewardess heroine Derek Webster as a progolfer who uses his impressive swing to great effect against the zombies and Erick Avari from TV's Heroes as the scientist responsible for the outbreak who eventually becomes a particularly memorable member of the walking dead.Considering this is a relatively lowbudget affair the effects are uniformly good with some impressive CGI shots of the aircraft in flight and some nicely realised zombies. The reanimated corpses have disgustingly nasty bright yellow eyes move pretty quickly as in the recent Dawn of the Dead remake and make a nasty screeching noise which on it's own is enough to make the hairs on your neck stand on end. The gore quotient is also more than adequate with some lovely squishy effects including a zombie decapitation an umbrella through the skull where have I seen that done before??? and a halfzombie which walks on its hands.I watched this film immediately after the much higherbudgeted and overhyped Planet Terror and whilst Rodriguez's film might have been the slicker of the two movies Flight Of The Living Dead was more entertaining.7.5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for IMDb.".

All the performances were good but special mention must go to David Chisum and the always reliable Richard Tyson. The best performance however comes from Kevin J.O'Connor more or less reprising his character from The Mummy. I can't remember the last time I was so entertained watching a horror film.

I mean I didn't see how they could make a movie about 90 minutes involving zombies on a plane. I was proved wrong in my thoughts and I for one am glad I was as well. The movie is decent and it far surpasses the other movie with a similar theme to it you know the one.The thrills were there and in a plentiful doze as well some nice eye candy as well from three lovely looking ladies in the movie Kristen Kerr Megan Heidi Marnhout Emily Emily looked cool as a zombie Sarah Laine Cara Cara looked cool as a zombie as well not in an attractive way either ha ha. The scene where we see the zombies crawling through the vents is a nice touch as well. Not many movies show us how the killers get to and from their destinations while dragging along their victims carcasses for consumption later on. They usually just pop up in places and then disappear. It may not have been that special a scene but I thought it was a neat one.There was some comedy in the movie it came more or less from Kevin J. O'Connor Frank  the criminal in cuffs. He spewed fourth some witty lines in the right places as well. Speaking of comedy there was one scene where the cop I think it was shot a zombie that was flying through the air as if it had just bounced off of a trampoline and the cop fired at it LOL.If you like zombies then this movie should be given a viewing at least once. I wont say you will like it if you like zombie movies. As I know all too well that everyone has a different taste. But give it a go and see what you think you might like it then again you might not. What I will say though you will see a lot worse than this movie oh yes!.".

I mean OF COURSE there also just happens to be a convict aboard with a cop attached to him pretty stewardesses a couple of scientist quarrelsome young couples oh and even a nun and a couple of other weird bunch of characters of which you never get to know their names. simply because you just don't care.No the movie doesn't feature much surprises. It's a pretty formulaic movie with all of the elements you would expect. Nothing happens as a real surprise and it's one of those movies in which you pretty much know already who is going to die and live. You know exactly in advance what you're going to get when you watch a movie like this with a title such as this one has.It takes a bit too long for the movie for the horror to kick really in but this has obviously to do with the movie its restrained budget and also story. I mean if things started off right along in this movie it would had probably only had been about an hour long. I mean how much good and interesting can you come up with a movie that's completely set aboard a plane.About halve way through the action really kicks in and the gloves are off! The fun really starts then when the zombie like creatures are unleashed among the passengers and get on a killing spree and more and more zombies are reborn. It then most becomes obvious what an unpretentious simply Bhorror this actually really is. The movie turns into a pure gorefest with the one graphic killing after the other.It's a good visual looking movie. At least it's not clumsy or anything and everything looks actually quite convincing and professional. Also the makeup and gore is pretty good looking and shall definitely please the genre fans. It definitely knows how to make use of its limited budget!As you would expect the acting isn't much special but this also has everything to do with the simple script and formulaic dialog. Still there are some decent well known actors in the movie like Erick Avari and Raymond J. Barry.The story is kept at all times simple and is of course far fetched silly and far from believable. But like I said before how much interesting can you come up with for a movie that is completely set aboard a flying plane? And uh firing guns and blowing up gas tanks in a plane without crashing down or even create a hole in the plane? I think that pretty much sums up how serious you have to take this movie.This movie is simply good and enjoyable for what it is a deliberate simple gory Bhorror flick featuring a whole bunch of zombies. It serves its purpose really well and effectively! A great movie in its genre that is very well worth watching at least if you're in these type of movies of course.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

I like action and I like cogent clever films... I don't have time for excessive relationships in my horror thank you.Let me finish up by saying the blood and gore is pretty darn good. You get your blood you get your gore. And for the low budget they do a pretty impressive job with it. Faces half ripped off body parts missing... jugulars torn from throats. Oh don't worry. They didn't try to make this halfdonkeyed by any means. You get what you paid for  plenty of zombies overflowing on a plane. Let down by Snakes on a Plane? Love zombies? Love confined spaces to be fighting horrible creatures? Love action? I think you'll really dig this picture. Granted I was probably partially drunk at the time but it made my night in a way no other film could have done. It's worth the rent and maybe even the purchase the two commentary tracks make this three films in one...".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're like me you adore Shaun Of The Dead and Dead Alive and always will but like with the Sam Raimi dead movies could wish the zombies and atmosphere were just a little less silly and a little more scary. If that's the case this movie is for you. I was very skeptical about this one. What a great surprise! It deliversit's funny sure but it's scary too...and I don't scare easily. The plot mixes Return Of The Living Dead with one of the old Airport disaster movies. We're introduced to a group of people traveling on a plane from LA to Paris including one group responsible for an illegal toxic surprise in the cargo hold. The setup alone is great if you've ever experienced turbulence on a plane you know what anxiety is there have been many suspense films exploiting this. The plane has to fly through heavy storm clouds the toxic cargo is released and...the Situation Begins To Deteriorate Rapidly. Actually all hell breaks loose. It does take awhile for things to kick in but that's part of the fun...there's a yawing sense of dread that permeates the whole first half of the movie...you know what's coming...just how bad is it going to be?Pretty bad! These zombies are not slow Romero shufflers they're more like the animalistic infected from 28 Days Later although they are most certainly replicating flesheaters. The main attack once they finally hit in full force is really disturbing as you wonder just how anyone could possibly survive in the situation. It's a great premise...and well executed. The way the filmmakers are able to prolong suspense and carry the terror of one high concept over a featurelength running time is ingenious...also too the way they are able to pull off the kind of scares they do without ever dimming the lights. You see everything and it is a very gory film...not the kind of porn gore that has become common of late where everything is shown just to make you puke the director shows restraint he knows that sometimes what you DON'T see is more scary even though he kindly delivers the goods again and again. The zombie makeup is nothing that alarming but I've always believed it's the IDEA of zombies that's scarier than the look...the idea that your best friendloverenemywhatever suddenly turns into an irrational maniac who wants to eat you. It just never gets old.There's a really neat bit of business with a hole in the floor of the passenger area that doubles for a grave for the undead to crawl out of as well as being the punchline to some great sight gags. It's every bit as terrifyingmaybe even moresothan an open grave in a misty cemetery at night. There are nightmarish glimpses into the zombieinfested cargo hold the usual tabooshattering zombie ironies surprises and popout gags galore and plenty of actiongunplayviolence and even stuff for airplane enthusiasts to enjoy. The actors are almost all from TV so there's an easy confidence to the characters many of whom are recognizable names. The pace is brisk but not lightweighteven without knowing much about the characters you care about their plight and want them to make it. The timing of the gags both the funny ones and scary ones is impeccable.The only things keeping me from giving it a 10...some of the CG effects work is really...odd. It appears they didn't have the budget to pull off some of the things they wanted to do which is too bad. Most of the exterior plane shots have a weird matte painting look that may have been a styl istic choice but sort of goes against the grain of the rest of the movie and the same with a few of the effects inside the plane too most notably a character who is supposed to be on fire. It's the only place where the budget of the film shows. Having said that the majority of the gore effects are alarming and wonderful however. The other problem is it IS a bit on the light side I'm not sure if I'd need to see this again and again like Dead Alive or Shaun it's got a bit of a videogame movie mentality basically just a lot of action and that doesn't always work well in repeated viewings. However this is the best new horror flick I've seen in a long time the best new zombie flick I've seen in years and I can't recommend it highly enough to fans of the genre. I'm really excited that the door was left open for a sequel...keep 'em coming! We need more well thought outexecuted and fun movies like this!".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not some big Zombie fan or anything. I love horror films and a well made Zombie film is hard to come by. I think the last one I sat through was the disgustingly deplorably made Diary of The Dead see my review. I saw this on the shelves of my local video store some time ago and noticed it was always rented. I waited a long time and then picked it up for really cheap and sat down to watch it hoping to at least get a good laugh and a few creepy moments. By the time the film was half hour my jaw was on the floor. Flight of The Living Dead is actually a well made well acted entertaining fun gory movie with some really terrific special effects and thrilling moments. The movie actually has a really good story well made plot with good characters and they actually spend time establishing the characters. It was like they made a zombie movie and cared about the story?!?! And it shows!! How a crap fest like Diary of The Dead got into theaters but this goes straight to video is beyond me but there is no missing this for zombie fans or horror fans or if you just want a creepy thriller! The film isn't perfect by any means and I don't mean to say that it's some profound feat of movie making...all I'm saying is that it is a top notch Zombie flick that will entertain you beginning to end!! The cast is packed with virtual newcomers or new faces and they all do a really terrific job. David Chisum is a terrific lead actor as cop Truman. He delivers a sharp wit and just really looks the part of the lead action hero. I hope this jump starts Chisum's career in different ways. Richard Tyson who will be immediately recognized as Schwarzenegger's foe on Kindergarten Cop is also very good as Air Marshall Paul Judd. Tyson and Chisum have great chemistry with each other and it felt almost like a buddy cop movie when they team up against the zombies. Long time character actor Erick Avari is good as the lead scientistdoctor Dr. Bennett but really shines as the disturbing torn apart zombie towards the end. Kristen Kerr is good although not as good as some of the other cast as flight attendant Megan and Chisum's love interest although they don't really go into a lot of detail or spend time on the romance. Raymond J. Barry is terrific in a smaller role as the captain of the plane and Kevin J. O'Connor adds a twist of dark comedy to his role as prisoner escapee Frank who has a very good chemistry with Chisum's cop.It's probably a good 45 minutes to an hour before you even see a zombie in this film because the film makers spend that time establishing all these characters on the plane and their relationships and setting the tension as the plane makes it's way through a bad storm. The entire film save for a few minutes at the end takes place on the plane and you never get bored. The special effects are remarkably good for a straight to DVD film. Everything from the zombie effects to the plane itself which I assume much is CGI but it's brilliantly done better than most theatrical releases. Of course Flight of The Living Dead isn't for everyone but there are plenty of zombie fanatics and horror fans that get sadly shorted on good horror and zombie movies as of late and might overlook this one but it really took me by surprise. My hope for a solid 6 or 7 out of ten suddenly became one of the best movies I've seen in the last little while. Definitely one you must check out for the fans. It's brilliantly done and although they probably couldn't repeat the success of making this I hope for a sequel with same film makers and some of the same cast too. Well done!! 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Up to the time it was released in 1945 Caesar and Cleopatra was the most expensive British film ever made. It was as though the British cinema was trying to show America it could do a DeMille like epic as good as Cecil B. DeMille or anyone else from Hollywood. It may have been a little too overdone. Director Gabriel Pascal might have gotten a bit carried away with the spectacle and the audience might well have missed some of George Bernard Shaw's inspired dialog.And Pascal had the advantage of the aged Mr. Shaw personally supervising the production. Of course Shaw insisted on total fidelity to his play and the ideas therein. I understand that J. Arthur Rank wanted to have a little sex and romance in there like DeMille did do but Shaw would have none of it.What sets Caesar and Cleopatra apart from other Cleopatra stories that starred Theda Bara Elizabeth Taylor and Claudette Colbert is that Shaw portrayed her as probably what she was a silly teenager who just happens to be Queen of Egypt. There's a little bit of Scarlett O'Hara in Vivien Leigh's performance as she moves from silly teen to a young women well schooled in statecraft by Julius Caesar.Claude Rains plays a world weary Julius Caesar and the Shavian quips roll off his tongue with great aplomb. Like George Bernard Shaw's other masterpiece Pygmalion Rains tutors Leigh and the results far exceed what he could have hoped for.Production on Caesar and Cleopatra was begun while there was still a shooting war in Europe and V2s and other such explosive devices were still raining down on the United Kingdom. A couple came real close to the studio in London this was being filmed at.Stewart Granger got his first real notice in this film playing Apollodorus and Francis L. Sullivan plays a blustering and plotting Pothinos. If you look hard among the various slave women you will find both Jean Simmons and Kay Kendall among the extras.You will also like both Basil Sydney as Ruffio and Cecil Parker as Britanus two aides to Caesar who both occasionally give him a reality check.Caesar and Cleopatra failed to recoup the cost of making it in initial release. J. Arthur Rank misjudged the British public taste post World War II. Maybe a little less expense and more attention to Shaw's words and the film might have been better.Still it's pretty good as is.".

Like George Bernard Shaw's other masterpiece Pygmalion Rains tutors Leigh and the results far exceed what he could have hoped for.Production on Caesar and Cleopatra was begun while there was still a shooting war in Europe and V2s and other such explosive devices were still raining down on the United Kingdom. A couple came real close to the studio in London this was being filmed at.Stewart Granger got his first real notice in this film playing Apollodorus and Francis L. Sullivan plays a blustering and plotting Pothinos. If you look hard among the various slave women you will find both Jean Simmons and Kay Kendall among the extras.You will also like both Basil Sydney as Ruffio and Cecil Parker as Britanus two aides to Caesar who both occasionally give him a reality check.Caesar and Cleopatra failed to recoup the cost of making it in initial release. J. Arthur Rank misjudged the British public taste post World War II. Maybe a little less expense and more attention to Shaw's words and the film might have been better.Still it's pretty good as is.";

I'm not sure if it's makeup or perhaps lighting but Rains's face looks like it was taken from one of those memorial portraits in the Roman catacombs.

I love Claude Rains in everything but there's an intimacy with Rains here  that makes Caesar and Cleopatra one of my Rains favorites.And Vivian Leigh.  What can I say?  Her Cleopatra is Scarlett O'Hara except that while Scarlett's flirtations were matters of the heart  Cleopatra's were purely matters of state.  In the beginning Cleopatra is a sheltered naive...well princess.  By the end she has learned well at Caesar's knee and possesses the ruthlessness and guile of statecraft  she is a queen.Another delight is Stewart Granger's swashbuckling Apollodorus and Flora Robson has a delicious part as Cleopatra's nursemaid Ftatateeta.  Robson is well qualified as a tutor of royalty having herself played Queen Elizabeth in Fire over England.Like another classic British spectacle The Four Feathers Caesar and Cleopatra is one of the treasures in my film archive which I view repeatedly alone.".

	schema:headline " Little part  HISTORY considerable part  GEORGE B. SHAW most part  VIVIEN LEIGH";
	schema:reviewBody "CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA 1945 based on George Bernard Shaw's play and directed by Gabriel Pascal is a very unique movie that combines all precious aspects of film art. It is not purely a historical movie since it contains a lot of inaccuracies that appear to be illogical from a historical perspective. Nevertheless one has to analyze it in a deeper understanding taking into account other factors that make the film a precious piece of postwar cinema. Therefore it is impossible to see it without the consideration of other aspects or more clearly other figures that significantly affect the movie in general George Bernard Shaw with his style filled with wit and elegance and Vivien Leigh with her extraordinary acting skills. Let me consider the three aforementioned aspects history Shaw and Leigh.HISTORY It is true that if you know Cleopatra's story and the events connected with the Roman conquest over Egypt you will feel confused or even disappointed with the content of this film. Cleopatra definitely did not learn to be a queen from Caesar that much as she does here. She was a very intelligent woman with foxy plans as for Caesar and Romein this case I would recommend CLEOPATRA by DeMille 1934 or by Mankiewicz 1963. The film by Pascal presents in part justifiably a total mess in Egypt that Caesar finds when he steps into its politics. This is proved by the way Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy are showed  two kids rather than rulers who compete for power. However there are some strong historical points in the film that must be seen together with shortcomings. First the film very well presents the Romans together with their leader Julius Caesar wonderfully played by Claude Rains. There is a very realistic scene of Roman legions entering Alexandria the capital of Egypt. I also liked the way Caesar's personality is developed  someone who is full of contradictions rather than an almighty conqueror. These aspects make the film more authentic and ancient heroes more humane. However it cannot be treated as a historical work for sure.GEORGE BERNARD SHAW But all must be thanked not only to the director but to this great classic playwright. G.B. Shaw is noticeable throughout particularly through magnificent elegance. The director Gabriel Pascal really retains everything that one can find in Shaw's play. Therefore any Shaw's fan including the one with richest imagination will not be disappointed thanks to the marvelous elegance in this movie. In other words the pictures of the film will not leave anything else to wish. The lavish sets the costumes simply BEAUTY noticeable in most of the scenes! Wit is another aspect. This is most effective in the scenes with Caesar and Cleopatra. You will soon learn how to govern says Cleopatra to mighty Caesar after a day or two of his lessons of ruling. Or the jumps into the sea Apollodorus Caesar and .... Cleopatra  quite unique!VIVIEN LEIGH Before seeing the film I did not expect her to be as good as her Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND 1939. Now I must say that she is better as Cleopatra. Vivien gives a marvelous performance as a girl dreaming of a handsome man with strong arms who could protect her and as a girl who later changes into a courageous mighty queen. If one man in all Alexandria can be found to say I did wrong I swear to have myself be crucified on the door of the palace by my own slaves which she says to Caesar after ordering Pothinus to be killed. And how wonderfully she plays one of the first scenes when she in very unpredictable circumstances finds out that the stranger she met at the Sphynx and with whom she talked so trustworthily is Caesar himself. UNFORGETTABLE! A lot of people associate only Liz Taylor with film Cleopatra. Not to mention Claudette Colbert it is a pity they don't find Leigh's performance as worth highest attention.It would be unfair to skip one more factor other cast. Vivien shines in her role but others do very good jobs as well. Claude Rains is a very different Caesar than in most other films actors who played him were among others Rex Harrison William Warren Fritz Leibner. But he is unforgettable his face reflects a spirit of antiquity. Flora Robson who gives a memorable performance of Cleopatra's bossy servant Ftatateeta stresses rather male features of character. She does it wonderfully through her gestures and low voice. And Francis L Sullivan as Pothinus  really worth attention!All in all there are many other aspects that make the movie highly recommended. Of course it is difficult to mention everything in one review. All I can say at the end of my review is Do see the film!If you are Shaw's fan you will find his spirit throughout. If you are Vivien Leigh's fan you will be absolutely amazed by her performance. If you are fond of historical lavish epics there will definitely be something wonderful that you will appreciate in CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA. 810!".

	schema:headline " The magnificence of Shaw and Caesar";
	schema:reviewBody "It's our amazing good fortune to have this document of one of George Bernard Shaw's greatest plays filmed during his lifetime so that he could author the screenplay as he wrote the original stage work. It is a monument to the magnificence not only of Shaw but of Caesar. It is also a monument to Shaw's brilliant playcraft clever plotting and canny application of humor. It goes without saying that Shaw was brilliant since of course he was a socialist.We have seen this story before though differently told when the wonderful Rex Harrison played Caesar to the talented Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra. Both of these names should be written with a K since that is how they were both actually pronounced. It is an absolute truth about that later film that only the first half is much worth watching since Richard Burton in the second half plays a lovesick puppy so well it's thoroughly disgusting. GBS avoids that pitfall by giving us a great Caesar and a delightful Cleopatra and fabulous stars to play them.Shaw's play tells the story of Caesar's occupation of Alexandria after his final defeat of Pompey and his defense of his position against perfidious Egyptians and renegade Romans in the service of Ptolemy XIV Cleopatra's prepubescent brother and husband. The text is a creation of the utmost cunning nothing less than a successful imitation of Shakespeare though mostly in a more modern idiom. Few writers other than Shaw would have attempted this feat and fewer still would have been successful at it.Mentioning Ptolemy XIV I should mention his and Cleo's brother Ptolemy XIII. They were both married to Cleopatra and each of them was pounding on her bedroom door by the time he was 10. The film alas forgets the last Ptolemy the XVth called Caesarion Caesar's son by Cleopatra. It was his official acknowledgement of this son that caused him so much trouble back home.The essence of Shaw is of course his wit. Hardly a play of his is as witty as this one. The film is 2 hours long and seems scarcely an hour so packed is it with sparkling dialogue.To portray this great literary work the producers have assembled a gallery of some of the greatest actors of the time. Caesar is played by the hugely talented Claude Rains whose portrayals of iconic roles have made him one of the greatest actors of the last century. He gives the immortal Julius such sangfroid and cool calculation as to make us instantly believe his greatness as a general and statesman.Cleopatra is portrayed by the great Vivien Leigh who graced and enhanced every part she took. Her beauty is in fact far far greater than the legendary queen's we have pictures. There is a rumor that Cleopatra was African black by descent  which while not a big deal is a lie. We know each and every one of her ancestors since before the time of Alexander the Great and they are all Greek and mostly closely related. Shaw also cleverly switches the story of the rug from her first meeting with Caesar to ruse to smuggle her into Caesar's emergency redoubt at the Pharos the Alexandria lighthouse.Apollodoros misspelt with a u before the s the Greek jack of all trades arts and talents is played with huge humor by the inimitable Stewart Granger. Granger's acting talents gave both of the Fairbanks a run for their money. Cleopatra's nurse and chief bottle washer Ftatateeta is portrayed by the wonderful Flora Robson. For this part her skin is stained dusky and she's given an Egyptianstyle fright wig  and is absolutely convincing. When she's on camera she manages to upstage even the riveting Rains.The roll of talented veteran actors continues. As Pothinos misspelt with a us Ptolemy's puppet master and master of all nasty diplomatic maneuvers we have Francis L. Sullivan. It was Pothinos' idea to knock off Pompey in the hope of sucking up to Caesar. No such luck of course because Caesar greatly admired and liked Pompey despite the fact that they had recently become enemies. Sullivan portrays Pothinos with delightful wiliness and sliminess.  As the loyal Rufio Caesar's shield we have a steadfast Basil Sydney. Rufio eventually becomes Roman governor of Egypt although that country was then still technically independent and didn't have a governor. Rufio's part is given a good shot of goodhumored testosterone and Sydney gives it great stature.  The talented veteran Cecil Parker gives us Caesar's faithful British amanuensis Britannus. His physical stature and Druidic appearance make him very convincing as a 1stCentury BCE British warriorpoet.  And so on. Every part in this film is wellplayed by people who know what they're doing.The DVD itself was manufactured in Korea. Don't expect a lot. This Technicolor film has a washedout look  although the colors are usually clear if not vividly bright. The sound is good but could be better and as we might expect from actors of stage quality the dialogue is clear. There are in addition English subtitles. There are no extra features but with older films we seldom get them. Some people might take points off for substandard color and sound. So do I. I give extra stars for Shaw's genius and take them off for an inferior recording of the original film. That leaves the correct total the maximum.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's our amazing good fortune to have this document of one of George Bernard Shaw's greatest plays filmed during his lifetime so that he could author the screenplay as he wrote the original stage work. It is a monument to the magnificence not only of Shaw but of Caesar. It is also a monument to Shaw's brilliant playcraft clever plotting and canny application of humor. It goes without saying that Shaw was brilliant since of course he was a socialist.We have seen this story before though differently told when the wonderful Rex Harrison played Caesar to the talented Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra. Both of these names should be written with a K since that is how they were both actually pronounced. It is an absolute truth about that later film that only the first half is much worth watching since Richard Burton in the second half plays a lovesick puppy so well it's thoroughly disgusting. GBS avoids that pitfall by giving us a great Caesar and a delightful Cleopatra and fabulous stars to play them.Shaw's play tells the story of Caesar's occupation of Alexandria after his final defeat of Pompey and his defense of his position against perfidious Egyptians and renegade Romans in the service of Ptolemy XIV Cleopatra's prepubescent brother and husband. The text is a creation of the utmost cunning nothing less than a successful imitation of Shakespeare though mostly in a more modern idiom. Few writers other than Shaw would have attempted this feat and fewer still would have been successful at it.Mentioning Ptolemy XIV I should mention his and Cleo's brother Ptolemy XIII. They were both married to Cleopatra and each of them was pounding on her bedroom door by the time he was 10. The film alas forgets the last Ptolemy the XVth called Caesarion Caesar's son by Cleopatra. It was his official acknowledgement of this son that caused him so much trouble back home.The essence of Shaw is of course his wit. Hardly a play of his is as witty as this one. The film is 2 hours long and seems scarcely an hour so packed is it with sparkling dialogue.To portray this great literary work the producers have assembled a gallery of some of the greatest actors of the time.

	schema:reviewBody "Impressive acting is the highlight of 1945's Caesar and Cleopatra a British production starring Vivien Leigh Claude Rains Stewart Granger Flora Robson and Francis L. Sullivan. In smaller roles you can spot Michael Rennie Kay Kendall and Jean Simmons.This production was not without its problems  made during World War II bombings often delayed the filming there was a fiveweek break while Vivien Leigh recovered from a miscarriage and there was a shortage of materials to build the sets. Nevertheless for a British film this is a real spectacle and made in color which was also unusual back then.Shaw's Cleopatra Leigh is a childlike girlwoman who has hitting matches with her younger brother runs giggles talks fast and becomes nervous at the thought of meeting the great Caesar Rains. In the beginning she meets him without realizing it. The two have a flirtation while he teaches her how to be a queen. Shaw's Caesar is an old man a great warrior and a benevolent ruler who rules with a velvet glove rather than a sword.Rains and Leigh are wonderful in their roles. Rains as someone stated with his Caesar haircut weary face and beautiful profile looks as if he stepped out of that time period. His mastery of Shaw's language is magnificent and he really holds the film together.The stunningly beautiful Leigh whitefaced with glorious cheekbones and dazzling eyes is a whimsical Cleopatra at first. She matures and becomes calmer and more regal as she learns how to be a queen but she falls back into her childish ways in the presence of Caesar particularly when he promises to send her Marc Anthony. They say the camera adds 10 pounds  frankly I'm surprised any of the actors could see Leigh she is so tiny. She gives a sprightly energetic performance. Shaw's Cleopatra is 16 though in reality she is 20 or 21  Leigh was 32 at the time of filming and comes off like the teenager Shaw wrote.Stewart Granger as Apollodorus shows off his very hunky physique  no wonder he came to the attention of Hollywood. As two aides of Caesar's Basil Sydney as Ruffio and Cecil Parker as Britanus give fine performances. Finally Flora Robson as the protective tough nursemaid of Cleopatra's Ftatateeta sinks her teeth into the role and is a force to contend with.This movie flopped probably because audiences thought it was going to be some huge spectacle  it's big for England but it's not DeMille. Still it's a real treat to see one of the classics done by two great actors who were welltrained and wellequipped to perform George Bernard Shaw.".

	schema:headline " Leigh is brilliant";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite all it's shortcomings I throughly enjoyed 'Caesar and Cleopatra' the 1945 filmed version of George Bernard Shaw's play.It's essentially a stagebound production with Leigh reprising her role as Cleopatra from the stage version. Leigh is brilliant in the role of the feisty girl queen. Given that Leigh was in her early 30's at the time of production she did a great job of portraying a very young girl. Leigh's seductive innocence squeals and fits of temper make for a very believable character who couldn't possibly be older than 15 or 16. Claude Rains is great in a leading role as Caesar. It's a calm measured performance and he shows great command of Shaw's dialogue. The relationship between the two is depicted as a fatherdaughter bond with Caesar guiding Cleopatra to becoming a 'real queen'.Cleopatra's transformation is superbly handled by Leigh. At the start she is a frightened girl hiding in the shadows of the Sphinx looking very young and unassuming. Caesar's arrival heralds the beginning of a new era for Egypt and Cleopatra. From her gleeful whipping of a slave to a murderous plot Leigh is never anything but convincing. She looks the part in suitably regal attire and dramatic makeup. She does seem a bit 'white' to be the Egyptian queen with GreekMacedonian origins Leigh is very pale throughout the whole film but Leigh's catlike smile and gleaming eyes both scream seductive ruler.Leigh's performance is even more remarkable given the fact that at the time of shooting she was enduring great personal difficulty. She miscarried Olivier's child on set tripping and falling heavily in the slavewhipping scene to be preciseand fell into depression afterwards. She played the 'Kill Kill Kill!' scene after returning to the set from the hospital and others on set were reportedly uncomfortable with the depth of her acting and conviction in this scene. She appeared a changed woman as Cleopatra was.One must appreciate the attempted scale of Pascal's production. In wartime povertystricken Britain in the 1940's making a film was a hard task let along making a grand one. The Technicolour is slightly off but still effective and it is a decent attempt a glossy epic. However the 'cast of thousands' appear to be just milling around with nothing to do and it never gets over it's stagy outlook.C  C is very witty thanks to Shaw's dialogue. Leigh shows an unurtured gift for comedy in this one although Shaw had it that Vivien was playing it all wrong. I think she played every scene right. Have a look and judge for yourself.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering that this movie was made in 1946 when many of its technical features were in its infancy including color it is still a wonderful interpretation of the play. But to be objective we must place ourselves in that period in time otherwise the movie seems dated and some of its characters out of place.It is no easy task to interpret a play into film and this movie even though it wants to give a feeling of outdoors we now that we are so sophisticated with our special effects can tell it is a studio. But let's give credit where credit is due. Vivien Leigh shines by itself she is the perfect Cleopatra I find that Claude Reims is also a character to contend with. We might find him with our modern eyes not physically attractive and you wonder what Cleopatra sees in him but let's not forget that through out the play it is always out in the open the fact that she wants a younger man for herself this is not a love story between them but simply the encounter of a couple of very strong intelligent determined and ruthless human beings as such they are a pair to admire!Claude Reims seems paternal sometimes there are other types of attraction as well as rejection he seems that he never takes her seriously however he never forgets every word she speaks. Considering that he is supposed to be the most powerful man of its time it can make any man a very sexy man! Power is an aphrodisiac if not lets look our own culture with all our icons in hollywood and in the sports arena now even politicians are getting into it.In the other hand Shaw's wonderful wit and facility use of the English language is evident all over the place he is always so caustic and economic with his subtle criticisms of his own time. We must remember this movie is about the value of words and the intellect between these two not about the bloated romance Hollywood has produced so far.Yes there is a story and an ambiance but the essence of this playmovie is the underlying meaning of the dialog between them. If you liked Pygmalion the other Shaw play made into a movie later reincarnated by Hollywood as My Fair Lady you will love this movie.".

	schema:headline " Physically Lovely Colorful WellActed and Intelligent";
	schema:reviewBody "It required fifty years for me to finally be able to view this famous and wellmounted postWorldWar II British film. it would undoubtedly be even more spectacular as a physical achievement on a large screen but the film is an adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's famous stage play not an historical fictionalized biography. So the ideas in the play are Shaw's not Julius Caesar's and that renders the finished product a bit difficult to assess I suggest without taking into account the structure of the play from which its screenplay was 'adapted. as well as the historical context upon which it comments. The decision to make much of the play on soundstages was typical of the period I assert but does not always work to the finished product's advantage. However anyone seeing the film for the first time would know it is an A production and he or she would have to admit that the use of color is unusually rich and fine. The battle scenes are serviceable the cast is extraordinary. Also the finished product conveys Shaw's message very clearlyabout avoiding extremes as a ruler which is a necessary message to wouldbe rulers or even statesmen in any Age especially our own at this time... The story begins with Julius Caesar recent victor over his fatherinlaw Pompey the Great in a terrible Roman civil war arriving in Egypt in pursuit of the escaped opponent. He goes out alone by night to ponder his own mortality and worldly power addressing his remarks to the aged monument The Great Sphinx. Cleopatra is listening therehe wonders if she is a divine child when he first meets her and she calls him old gentleman not recognizing him. The next day he takes over the country and meets the horrible Egyptian royal court. The girl has a nasty little brother a bad adviser a tough general and a murderous Nurse named Ftatateeta. he makes Cleopatra Queen under him his army holds the balance of power and with his interesting staff including a secretary Britannus an old soldier named Rufio and an aide named Lucius he proceeds to be nearly assassinated and then to fight off an attack by the Egyptian army led by its fine general  Achillas. The remainder of the film consists in him trying to teach Cleopatra to be a queen and not a monster and tell her why he is not doing terrible reprisals to every enemy.. He is only partly successful. The great Library of Alexandria has been burned during the battle he is still in a somewhat precarious position and she is bloodthirsty her killing of Ftatateeta is justified but she enjoys it too much. By the time Caesar leaves promising to send his friend Antony to console her for his absence as he returns to Rome we are in no doubt that Caesar's way would be bestand that Egypt for the Egyptians would be catastrophic. There is one rather spectacular scene as a hoist ascends to Caesar's level and there is also the forming of a testudo or turtle formation with a roof of shields during the fire and the escape by leaping into the harbor by Caesar and others is well done. But overall this is a play where human beings caught in a fascinating historical era's mostcharged situation actually talk to one another. The screenplay by playwright Shaw is unusually literate for a film and Gabriel Pascal's direction contributes to the overall dramatic movement even where physical movement may be wanting. Shaw and the director wring out many unusually fine nuances of character attitude and reaction everywhere. The credits name Georges Auric as contributor of music Oliver Messel as costume creator and credit Messel and John Bryan for the lovely art direction. Important cinematographers Jack Cardiff Jack Hildyard Robert Krasker  and Freddie Young all received screen recognition as well. Among the actors Vivien Leigh then 32 portrayed a teenaged girl quite interestingly she made a vivacious potentialmonster irresponsiblequeen. Claude Rains works hard as Caesar but lacks a bit of vocal power to gain the credit for his intelligent try an extremely demanding part he is very good as is Stewart Granger as the bycontrast athletic young Apollodurs. Cecil Parker played Britannus the bookish slave with Franics L. Sullivan as the wicked Pothinus the young King's evil Svengali Basil Syndey was a stout Rufio and Raymond Lovell and Anthony Eustrel were Lucis and Achillas respectively. Flora Robson deserved an award for her monstrous manstrangling Nurse. The remainder of the cast was filled with lesser knowns and soontobeknow performers such as Michael Rennie Leo Genn Alan Wheatley Stanley Holloway Esme Percy Ronald Shiner Renee Asherson Jean Simmons Kay Kendall Valentine Dyall Roger Moore Zena Marshall Michael Cacoyannis and Louis de Wohl. This feature film is perhaps not a great movie but it was very intelligently scripted and it is still absorbing physically stunning in many scenes and expensive without ever being overwhelmed by its own sets nor embarrassed by its historical recreations. I found it well worth waiting fifty years to see and I would enjoy seeing it redone by a great writer and an equally great cast.".

So the ideas in the play are Shaw's not Julius Caesar's and that renders the finished product a bit difficult to assess I suggest without taking into account the structure of the play from which its screenplay was 'adapted. as well as the historical context upon which it comments. The decision to make much of the play on soundstages was typical of the period I assert but does not always work to the finished product's advantage. However anyone seeing the film for the first time would know it is an A production and he or she would have to admit that the use of color is unusually rich and fine. The battle scenes are serviceable the cast is extraordinary. Also the finished product conveys Shaw's message very clearlyabout avoiding extremes as a ruler which is a necessary message to wouldbe rulers or even statesmen in any Age especially our own at this time... The story begins with Julius Caesar recent victor over his fatherinlaw Pompey the Great in a terrible Roman civil war arriving in Egypt in pursuit of the escaped opponent. He goes out alone by night to ponder his own mortality and worldly power addressing his remarks to the aged monument The Great Sphinx. Cleopatra is listening therehe wonders if she is a divine child when he first meets her and she calls him old gentleman not recognizing him. The next day he takes over the country and meets the horrible Egyptian royal court. The girl has a nasty little brother a bad adviser a tough general and a murderous Nurse named Ftatateeta. he makes Cleopatra Queen under him his army holds the balance of power and with his interesting staff including a secretary Britannus an old soldier named Rufio and an aide named Lucius he proceeds to be nearly assassinated and then to fight off an attack by the Egyptian army led by its fine general  Achillas. The remainder of the film consists in him trying to teach Cleopatra to be a queen and not a monster and tell her why he is not doing terrible reprisals to every enemy.. He is only partly successful. The great Library of Alexandria has been burned during the battle he is still in a somewhat precarious position and she is bloodthirsty her killing of Ftatateeta is justified but she enjoys it too much. By the time Caesar leaves promising to send his friend Antony to console her for his absence as he returns to Rome we are in no doubt that Caesar's way would be bestand that Egypt for the Egyptians would be catastrophic. There is one rather spectacular scene as a hoist ascends to Caesar's level and there is also the forming of a testudo or turtle formation with a roof of shields during the fire and the escape by leaping into the harbor by Caesar and others is well done. But overall this is a play where human beings caught in a fascinating historical era's mostcharged situation actually talk to one another. The screenplay by playwright Shaw is unusually literate for a film and Gabriel Pascal's direction contributes to the overall dramatic movement even where physical movement may be wanting. Shaw and the director wring out many unusually fine nuances of character attitude and reaction everywhere. The credits name Georges Auric as contributor of music Oliver Messel as costume creator and credit Messel and John Bryan for the lovely art direction. Important cinematographers Jack Cardiff Jack Hildyard Robert Krasker  and Freddie Young all received screen recognition as well. Among the actors Vivien Leigh then 32 portrayed a teenaged girl quite interestingly she made a vivacious potentialmonster irresponsiblequeen. Claude Rains works hard as Caesar but lacks a bit of vocal power to gain the credit for his intelligent try an extremely demanding part he is very good as is Stewart Granger as the bycontrast athletic young Apollodurs. Cecil Parker played Britannus the bookish slave with Franics L. Sullivan as the wicked Pothinus the young King's evil Svengali Basil Syndey was a stout Rufio and Raymond Lovell and Anthony Eustrel were Lucis and Achillas respectively. Flora Robson deserved an award for her monstrous manstrangling Nurse. The remainder of the cast was filled with lesser knowns and soontobeknow performers such as Michael Rennie Leo Genn Alan Wheatley Stanley Holloway Esme Percy Ronald Shiner Renee Asherson Jean Simmons Kay Kendall Valentine Dyall Roger Moore Zena Marshall Michael Cacoyannis and Louis de Wohl. This feature film is perhaps not a great movie but it was very intelligently scripted and it is still absorbing physically stunning in many scenes and expensive without ever being overwhelmed by its own sets nor embarrassed by its historical recreations. I found it well worth waiting fifty years to see and I would enjoy seeing it redone by a great writer and an equally great cast.";

	schema:reviewBody "You're liable to get the impression from the first couple of scenes that this is stagy and maybe without too much point. Claude Raines as the newly arrived conqueror meets Vivien Leigh as the airheaded tittering adolescent Cleopatra in front of the Sphinx and under the Egyptian stars. It's all very cute.Well it remains stagy. After all it's a play. But it's hardly pointless. Raines remains the man he first appears rather gentle bearing the weight of the world on his shoulders goodnatured able to suffer some twitting stern but fair endearingly sensitive about being middle aged and losing his hair.But Cleopatra  wow! When she meets Raines Vivien Leigh is wraith like and pale and imperiously beautiful without actually knowing it. At first she's just a kid jealous of her husband who is her younger brother who rules Egypt as Ptolemy  or at least he did until Raines takes the reins. But Leigh's character evolves. Her childishness her giggling and choking on tears is at first an aspect of her inner nature but later becomes a tactical ploy used deliberately in disarming enemies. She turns pretty clever and not in a good way. Her whimsy turns to murder. She enchants Raines but Raines is no fool. He treats her like a slightly reckless daughter until after she has a rival assassinated he dresses her down. But in the end he sails away leaving her in the hands of his Executive Officer and promising to send her a handsome younger man named Marc Antony.Aside from Pygmalion I was never able to get WITH George Bernard Shaw whose play this is. The two or three of his plays that I've seen seemed preachy and discursive. But if you get past the opening this one is pretty good. Of course Shaw being the rational moralist he was it's about more than Caesar and Cleopatra and who's going to rule Egypt.Cecil Parker is Caesar's worried slave and firsthand man Brittanus an Islander meaning he's from Britain and worships the Druids or something. Shaw has a good time with him poking fun at his homeland. Well I guess Shaw was Irish but identified more with Britain. Parker's Brit is a mostly comic figure who can't swim. He's aghast when he is asked to leave Cleopatra with a man unattended by a chaperon. Shocked! he exclaims in a tone copyrighted by Claude Raines a few years earlier in Casablanca. But then later someone asks Raines What is Caesar in despair? And Raines replies He who has never hoped cannot despair which either Albert Camus ripped off from Shaw or independently invented. Kids  don't try to apply that maxim at home. I did and it doesn't work.What a cast! Almost everybody who was anybody is in this thing in parts small or large. Stewart Granger is present as the tall dark handsome Sicilian Apollodorus. He's the only person in the film with an evident sun tan and wardrobe has him decked out in embarrassingly brief garments. Stanley Holloway goes almost unnoticed as a Roman soldier with I think one line. He was a sublime grave digger two years later in Olivier's Hamlet. Too many other familiar names to list though I should mention that I think I glimpsed a chubby teenaged Jean Simmons as a harp player who had no lines at all. If her movie career had stopped at this point mine would have been better than hers. I had a dozen parts with no lines at all.All of those performances by the way are quite good even if they seem a little hammy at times as if this were a filmed play and the actors were trying for the balcony. The sets are both stylized and stylish.And it's both amusing and dramatic without being in the least preachy.".

	schema:reviewBody "When this film was recently shown on British television I recorded it on the rather nave assumption that it would be a grand epic of Classical antiquity something along the lines of the famously expensive Elizabeth Taylor Cleopatra still often cited as the costliest film ever made when values are adjusted for inflation. Of course Caesar and Cleopatra is nothing of the sort the British cinema never really had the budget to copy Hollywood in this respect although some European filmmakers especially in Italy certainly tried to.The film was certainly expensive by the standards of 1945 indeed it was reported to be the most expensive film ever made in Britain at that date costing well over a million pounds. It is not however a Hollywoodstyle epic but a cinematic adaptation of the play by George Bernard Shaw. While in the Egyptian capital city of Alexandria Julius Caesar becomes involved in a powerstruggle between Queen Cleopatra and the backers of her younger brother and husband Ptolemy. In real life Caesar and Cleopatra were lovers but here their relationship is portrayed not as a romantic or a sexual one. The middleaged Caesar is shown more as a fatherfigure to the youthful Cleopatra a mentor who tutors her in the arts of politics and government. And given the intrigueridden nature of the Egyptian court these are certainly areas where she could do with a little tuition.Towards the end of his long life this film was made five years before his death Shaw was a revered figure of English literature regarded as the nearest thing the twentieth century had produced to a Shakespeare. In more recent years this reputation has faded somewhat partly because his plays are not always very dramatic. He can be stronger on philosophy and political theory than on action or dramatic tension and even though his contributions to political and philosophical debates are often expressed in witty and vivid dialogue the reader and to an even greater extent the theatregoer is sometimes left with the impression that Shaw's linguistic gifts might have been better employed in penning political tracts than in writing for the stage.Nevertheless some of Shaw's plays have been turned into very good films notably the 1938 Pygmalion with Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller or the 1941 Major Barbara also with Hiller and Robert Morley. One could also include My Fair Lady in this list but that is really secondhand Shaw a musical based upon Pygmalion which owes much of its success to its songs. There have unfortunately also been a number of failures such as The Millionairess which relied too heavily on Sophia Loren's glamour and the comic talents of Peter Sellers which were not too much in evidence and although supposedly a comedy ended up about as funny as a twohour speech at a TUC conference.Caesar and Cleopatra must also rank among the less successful Shaw adaptations. A lot of its millionpoundplus budget seems to have been spent on its lavish sets economic and political considerations in 1945 precluded location shooting in Egypt itself but from a modern perspective they seem like part of the problem giving the whole production a very artificial stagey look. It is said that the director Gabriel Pascal ordered sand from Egypt to get the colour right but when everything else looks so artificial a gesture like that seems like an unnecessary luxury. The stagey impression is strengthened by the dialogue both in the unnatural way it is spoken and at times in the way it is written. Shaw could sometimes succumb to the delusion that if he was the twentiethcentury Shakespeare it was incumbent on him to write in the style of his august predecessor particularly when dealing with historical subjects.The best acting performance comes from Claude Rains as Caesar. I normally think of Rains as a supporting actor in roles like his French police chief in Casablanca so it was nice to see him in a leading role for once. This is not the Caesar of history who was doubtless a lot more ruthless than he is portrayed here but it is Caesar as Shaw wrote him an essentially decent man whose undoubted sense of Realpolitik is tempered by his instincts towards humanity and clemency.Vivien Leigh however is well below her best here. She may have been one of Britain's leading actresses of the period but seems quite wrong for the part. She was 32 at the time and never seems convincing as Cleopatra whom Shaw envisaged as a kittenish teenager. A thirtysomething Cleopatra would not I am sure have required any lessons from Caesar in statecraft.Of the supporting cast the best is Francis L. Sullivan as Ptolemy's wily and ambitious tutor Pothinus. The young Stewart Granger seems to have wandered in from another film possibly one of the swashbuckling historical adventures which were later to become his stockintrade. Flora Robson has a thankless task as Cleopatra's nurse Ftatateeta a character seemingly invented for the sole purpose of raising a laugh every time one of the other characters mispronounces her absurd name. Cecil Parker specialised in playing uppermiddleclass English gentlemen and here he plays Caesar's slave Britannus as an uppermiddleclass English gentleman transported back in time to Ancient Egypt something which is never remotely convincing.The film was described at the time as a box office stinker evidently British audiences in the last year of the Second World War wanted something a bit more entertaining and uplifting than this wordy overlong disquisition on the nature of political power. Some films which were stinkers when they first came out have gone on to become classics but Caesar and Cleopatra seems to have gone in the opposite direction today it is a littleknown rarelyseen curiosity. 510".

I normally think of Rains as a supporting actor in roles like his French police chief in Casablanca so it was nice to see him in a leading role for once. This is not the Caesar of history who was doubtless a lot more ruthless than he is portrayed here but it is Caesar as Shaw wrote him an essentially decent man whose undoubted sense of Realpolitik is tempered by his instincts towards humanity and clemency.Vivien Leigh however is well below her best here. She may have been one of Britain's leading actresses of the period but seems quite wrong for the part. She was 32 at the time and never seems convincing as Cleopatra whom Shaw envisaged as a kittenish teenager. A thirtysomething Cleopatra would not I am sure have required any lessons from Caesar in statecraft.Of the supporting cast the best is Francis L. Sullivan as Ptolemy's wily and ambitious tutor Pothinus. The young Stewart Granger seems to have wandered in from another film possibly one of the swashbuckling historical adventures which were later to become his stockintrade. Flora Robson has a thankless task as Cleopatra's nurse Ftatateeta a character seemingly invented for the sole purpose of raising a laugh every time one of the other characters mispronounces her absurd name. Cecil Parker specialised in playing uppermiddleclass English gentlemen and here he plays Caesar's slave Britannus as an uppermiddleclass English gentleman transported back in time to Ancient Egypt something which is never remotely convincing.The film was described at the time as a box office stinker evidently British audiences in the last year of the Second World War wanted something a bit more entertaining and uplifting than this wordy overlong disquisition on the nature of political power. Some films which were stinkers when they first came out have gone on to become classics but Caesar and Cleopatra seems to have gone in the opposite direction today it is a littleknown rarelyseen curiosity. 510";

Anyway despite not wanting to repeat myself I probably should go over the themes one again for those who don't want to jump over to Goodreads to read my review but first of all the movie.I was quite surprised to discover that this play of Shaw's was also turned into a Hollywood movie which means that there are I believe four of his plays that have made it to film and that is not counting any BBC production that may have been created because apparently back in the fifties and the sixties the BBC would cycle through a number of plays and then destroy the film afterwards. The adaptation itself was pretty good and it seemed to stick quite close to the play something that did not happen with the Devil's Disciple. I also though that Stewart Granger played a very good Caesar doing great justice for the character created by Shaw and the historical figure himself.The play itself is a political satire set in the period just before Caesar's assassination where he travels to Egypt to locate Pompey. As it turns out Pompey had been murdered prior to his arrival something that Caesar is not to happy about. However the entire expedition was designed to make Egypt another protectorate of Rome much in the same way that Judea was a protectorate. However the major theme of the film focuses on the interplay between Caesar and Cleopatra the ruler of the new empire and the ruler of the old the elder statesman and the child queen the benevolent princeps and the traditional monarch.As I was watching this film the idea kept on going through my mind that this seems to be reflective and somewhat critical of Britain's colonial ambitions. To me the movie itself was analogous to Britain and India or moreso Britain and China. Here we have Britain like Rome as the new empire built on a different model of government while we have Egypt being analogous to China and India an ancient empire that had persisted with the same model for centuries which resulted in the system becoming stagnant and rigid unable to change and unable to challenge the might of the new power. However we must remember that the British leaders were not the wise and noble leaders that Shaw created in Caesar and Shaw himself is very critical of many of their ways.What we see in this film is the leader of the old empire living the same way that they had done for centuries  marrying their brother sleeping in luxury eating extravagantly and doing no work for themselves. Opposing this we have the leader of the new empire who works sleeps in a cot lives rough and eats frugally. While this was not necessarily the case with all Roman rulers there was this idea that they were a nation of farmers and soldiers who lived frugally and eschewed luxury. The reason for this is a luxurious lifestyle makes one decadent and when one because decadent one loses the ability to fight to think and to even do things for oneself.I was quite pleased to have found this movie because it has opened up another of Shaw's plays to me that would most likely have remained on paper simply because they do not tend to be performed all that much anymore. It seems that at least here in Australia all we ever see performed is Shakespeare and maybe the occasional other playwright and a bunch of by modern Australians none of which I have ever bothered going to see though I am sure some of them are pretty good.".

	schema:reviewBody "In advance of his relatively small Roman forces the aging Julius Caesar Claude Rains is fresh from his victory over political rival Pompey. At the Sphinx he meets the unwary and nave Cleopatra Vivian Leigh a decade older than Cleopatra was at the time. Although he playfully toys with her superstitious nature he is never malicious. She acts like a frightened child and does not even know how to command her slaves especially Ftatateeta Flora Robson. Caesar gives her a guiding hand on ruling her subjects. Is it sweet or bitter to be a queen? he asks. Bitter she replies. Soon the small Roman force less than one legion arrives and hails Caesar. Don't eat me she exclaims to him. He tells Cleopatra not to fear as he is a reasonable man. Later at the Egyptian court in Alexandria the capital and surrounded by enemies he speaks clearly but also in double entendres. Caesar does not reveal what he is thinking. Competing for the throne are sister Cleopatra and much younger brother Ptolemy Anthony Harvey. As was the case in Egypt brother and sister are also married considered abhorrent by Romans. Ptolemy says that as soon as he is older he will execute his older sister. Caesar's temporary decision is to have brother and sister jointly rule. He also says that he needs money some 16000 talents he is told that the treasury is empty. At any rate in such a treacherous atmosphere one has to be on hisher toes. And it was really this way. Although Pompey had aided Egypt in his early campaigns the Egyptians rewarded his request for sanctuary by murdering him before he was even ashore. An especially wicked court adviser is the eunuch Pothinus Francis L. Sullivan. The scholar Theodotus Ernest Thesiger is treacherous. The Egyptian general Achillas is untrustworthy. All three were involved in the assassination of Pompey although the actual deed was done by Lucius Septimius Raymond Lovell. Nevertheless Caesar eventually allows the entire court to leave an action that leaves his secondincommand Rufio Basil Sydney baffled. Michael Rennie is one of the Roman centurions. Young Stewart Granger plays a flamboyant Apollodorus the Sicilian who helps deliver Cleopatra to Caesar. Britannus Cecil Parker from far away Britain that is not yet a Roman possession is obviously in the script as an agent to give playwright Shaw a chance to get in some points for his homeland. The Romans manage to hang on to the palace grounds but are greatly outnumbered by Achillas' Egyptian army that has occupied most of Alexandria. At one point Caesar has to dive into the harbor and swim away to safety historically accurate. In the fighting the fleet in Alexandria Harbor is set afire which spreads to the famous library and destroys most of the old manuscripts. The scene where Cleopatra wraps herself in a carpet that is delivered safely to Caesar by Apollodorus is historically accurate also although it happened earlier and not later at the Pharos lighthouse. After the main Roman army in the East arrives they eventually defeat the Egyptians. Cleopatra who has morphed from adolescent to a foxy manipulator is now sole ruler of Egypt. As Caesar departs for Rome he promises her that he will send one of his best generals and one she has admired for a long time Mark Antony.The film features terrific production values and costumes. The acting is great as one would expect from such a production and there is snappy and witty dialogue. Notice that in the opening credits each of the U letters is converted to a letter V. Note that the Romans carved the letter V instead of U on marble as V was used as U in Classical Latin. Over time usage changed. Also as it is difficult to carve smaller curves with a chisel they were often avoided. So a letter C may appear as a sideways V . Postscript The movie produced on soundstages is based on Shaw's play so it cannot be historical although many pictured events did really happen. Cleopatra was educated and savvy enough to know her royal role even before Caesar arrived. The film does not cover later incidents such as the birth of Caesarion the son of Caesar and Cleopatra her trip to Rome Caesar's rule and his subsequent assassination. Caesar was never a murderous leader. Untraditional in his rule he was wise and compassionate. Ironically Caesar's benevolence and clemency  his forgiving of many enemies clementia  led to his undoing. He left so many adversaries in the Roman Senate that they banded together and did their terrible deed on the Ides of March in 44 BC.".

I'd wondered briefly why star Neve Campbell also got producer credit. The DVD 'making of' documentary explains that the whole project was her idea she'd been a dancer long before she took up acting and wanted to combine the two. She chose Altman to direct because of his skill at portraying relations and interactions among people in groups. Altman did a fine job depicting dance both rehearsals and performances. Campbell showed she can still dance. Malcolm McDowell gave a great performance as the acerbic company director. The Joffrey dancers were brilliant. Altman has created a dazzling cinematic album of what the world of dance is like at the beginning of the 21st century.But the story arc was weak. This was no accident. In a recent October 2004 interview Altman said Question Why do you think you're drawn to stories about big groups of people sharing the same space? Did it have anything to do with growing up in such a large closeknit family? Robert Altman Possibly. I don't know. That's a little too cerebral for me. I'm not much interested in stories anyway. I'm more interested in reactive behavior. That sums up The Company very nicely. The movie is a montage of scenes of reactive behavior among realistic characters and in this it is more like real life than a more structured story would have been.Of course there is some story structure here involving the creation of a new dance. This story is engaging because the outside choreographer is a fey flake and dance disaster seems foredoomed. But the dancers being good soldiers follow his orders diligently. And despite all expectations at least all of my expectations their climactic performance is superb.But this story is not central to the movie. Again like life it unfolds amidst all sorts of other organizational and interpersonal drama.And for this reason the movie left me unsatisfied. Part of what I look for in movies and in books is a story arc a beginning a middle and an end. I look for this precisely because life is rarely that neat. Many directors deliver this arc and many more try to and fail. Robert Altman chose not to try. He is free to do that and I am free to rate this movie 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE COMPANY shows several slices of lives that of the company and those of various other characters over a period of a few months or so. So many things happen during that time large small hugely significant totally mundane sad frustrating thrilling indifferent. Through it all there is so much beauty emotion and human reality. There is also a LOT of wonderful dance and fascinating very authentic glimpses at preparation for and creation of real professional ballet performances.Anyone needing a continuous linear 'a to b to climax and neat ending' plot will not find that here. The movie has its own rhythms and was completely engrossing throughout for me as well as entertaining. I love traditional straightforwardly plotted movies good ones that is of which there are many but this movie is its very own animal and it's wonderful. It is absolutely the most honest truetoreallife movie that I've seen anyway ever made about the life work and culture of a professional ballet company not that they are all alike but there is much that is universal and some of the people friends family audience members etc. who interact with it at times. And what a treat to have a 'ballet movie' with authentic goodtoexcellent professional dancers in realistic stage performances. CENTER STAGE was mostly sickeningly ridiculous as was its 2008 sequel to an even greater degree and the audition scenes in SAVE THE LAST DANCE were EMBARRASSINGLY badthey even misspelled Juilliardoy!Always audience members need to open themselves up and try to experience a movie or any piece of artentertainment on its own terms. You may like it or not think it succeeds or not. But you don't go to TERMINATOR 3 expecting it to operate like an intimate quiet nuanced character study and then condemn it because it didn't meet those expectations. With this movie you need to understand and accept that you'll be seeing assorted moments just various pieces and details of lives and let go of the idea that they'll form into a finite story shouldn't be too hard for Altman fans. For me the pieces were fascinating enough to make the whole extremely rewarding and beautiful.By the way I did find myself caring very much about the characters in THE COMPANY although differently than I might about the characters in a more traditionallyplotted movie. The characterizations are very real not actorish from those who are actual actors as well as those who are not. So many beautiful sequences but one that really struck me as I watched was as Ry Campbell's character arrives home late after an exciting triumphant night prepares for bed and begins to cry. This sequence is alternated with scenes of one of the male dancers alone in a studio listening to music moving to it trying to begin choreographing a dance. So true to life and moving.This is really a wonderful movie and I hope there are enough people around who appreciate and enjoy this kind of thing for more such movies to be made. Kudos to Mr. Altman Ms. Campbell and all the others involved.".

	schema:headline " Altman's Red Shoes";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching The Company I was suddenly aware of how stylistically similar Robert Altman is to one of my other favourite directors Frederick Wiseman.Wiseman is a documentary filmmaker who typically picks a space or institution as his subject a high school a town a military base a zoo a hospital etc and then sets about filming human beings as they work and interact within these selfcontained environments. Wiseman improvises shoots without a screenplay is subtly satirical hires small crews and seems content to simply observe people as they go about their various daytoday routines within their chosen fields or environments. Altman operates in a similar way. With The Company he sets his sights on the Joffrey Ballet Group of Chicago voyeuristically observing its inhabitants over the course of several months. There is seemingly no overriding narrative no overt plot only a series of connective strands each character existing as a pebble in a vast mosaic.What separates Altman from Wiseman however is Altman's acute awareness of genre. Altman enjoys subverting expectations turning war on its head in MASH noir with The Long Goodbye deconstructed Bonnie and Clyde with Thieves Like Us ripped apart the western with Buffalo Bill and Mrs Miller mauled the murder mystery with Gosford Park and pretty much invented the antinarrative multicharacter mosaic badly imitated by Paul Haggis Lawrence Kasdan John Sayles and Paul Thomas Anderson with films like Nashville or Short Cuts.With The Company the narrative being deconstructed is your usual star is born tale Showgirls Red Shoes All About Eve Black Swan etc. Actress Neve Campbell at first glance appears to be the heart of the picture. She plays your typical lowly artist stereotype who works hard hoping for that lucky break which will lead to her starring in the film's final grand performance.But as the film progresses Altman will continually undermine the genres usual obstacles and clichs. Watch how he sets up Neve's final performance only to have her fall and be pulled out of the show. Watch how he sets up Neve's argument with her lover only to have them peacefully fall asleep together. Watch how he sets up a pushy mother who is consistently unable to get a word in. Watch how he sets up a thunderstorm which has no effect on the performance. Watch how he sets up the vindictive father of one ballet dancer only to have the guy consistently brushed off.Time and time again conflicts are set up and then undermined. This notion of avoiding conflict of dodging the act of telling a story is epitomised in the film by Mr A the manager of the ballet company and an obvious stand in for Robert Altman who leaves the room whenever someone wishes to argue with him. The result is that not only are conventions subverted but the very act of storytelling seems avoided.One thus recalls the climax to Altman's Thieves Like Us a crime movie which likewise subverted gangster clichs. That film promised us your typical last act gangster bloodbath our bank robber heroes dying in slow motion a hail of bullets peppering their bloody bodies. But when his climactic shootout occurs Altman pulls the rug out from under our feet and cuts away. In this simple scene we see how Altman operates. What is usually denied is given precedence the spaces omitted in normal films are given by Altman room to breathe.For better or worse reversals like this  both obvious and subtle  take place constantly throughout Altman's filmography. Enjoyment of his films thus depends on the audience having an intimate awareness of what is being subverted deconstructed or undermined which is perhaps why Altman is so despised. Those who like his films tend to like him for what he doesn't do. What he sets up and then rejects.Beyond all this you have the typical selfreferential Altman layer. The act of preparing improvising and putting on a show ballet is mirrored to the act of preparing improvising and creating Altman's film. And of course you need a creative force in both worlds personified by Mr A Malcolm McDowell in the film Altman's doppelgnger. Such a selfreferential layer is typical of Altman. Nashville Buffalo Bill MASH Gosford Park Prairie Home Companion The Player Cookie's Fortune etc all revolve around large groups of people getting together and putting on a performance. What's fresh about The Company is the sheer level of restraint.810  Worth two viewings.".

	onyx:emotionText "Watching The Company I was suddenly aware of how stylistically similar Robert Altman is to one of my other favourite directors Frederick Wiseman.Wiseman is a documentary filmmaker who typically picks a space or institution as his subject a high school a town a military base a zoo a hospital etc and then sets about filming human beings as they work and interact within these selfcontained environments. Wiseman improvises shoots without a screenplay is subtly satirical hires small crews and seems content to simply observe people as they go about their various daytoday routines within their chosen fields or environments. Altman operates in a similar way. With The Company he sets his sights on the Joffrey Ballet Group of Chicago voyeuristically observing its inhabitants over the course of several months. There is seemingly no overriding narrative no overt plot only a series of connective strands each character existing as a pebble in a vast mosaic.What separates Altman from Wiseman however is Altman's acute awareness of genre. Altman enjoys subverting expectations turning war on its head in MASH noir with The Long Goodbye deconstructed Bonnie and Clyde with Thieves Like Us ripped apart the western with Buffalo Bill and Mrs Miller mauled the murder mystery with Gosford Park and pretty much invented the antinarrative multicharacter mosaic badly imitated by Paul Haggis Lawrence Kasdan John Sayles and Paul Thomas Anderson with films like Nashville or Short Cuts.With The Company the narrative being deconstructed is your usual star is born tale Showgirls Red Shoes All About Eve Black Swan etc. Actress Neve Campbell at first glance appears to be the heart of the picture. She plays your typical lowly artist stereotype who works hard hoping for that lucky break which will lead to her starring in the film's final grand performance.But as the film progresses Altman will continually undermine the genres usual obstacles and clichs. Watch how he sets up Neve's final performance only to have her fall and be pulled out of the show. Watch how he sets up Neve's argument with her lover only to have them peacefully fall asleep together. Watch how he sets up a pushy mother who is consistently unable to get a word in. Watch how he sets up a thunderstorm which has no effect on the performance. Watch how he sets up the vindictive father of one ballet dancer only to have the guy consistently brushed off.Time and time again conflicts are set up and then undermined. This notion of avoiding conflict of dodging the act of telling a story is epitomised in the film by Mr A the manager of the ballet company and an obvious stand in for Robert Altman who leaves the room whenever someone wishes to argue with him. The result is that not only are conventions subverted but the very act of storytelling seems avoided.One thus recalls the climax to Altman's Thieves Like Us a crime movie which likewise subverted gangster clichs. That film promised us your typical last act gangster bloodbath our bank robber heroes dying in slow motion a hail of bullets peppering their bloody bodies. But when his climactic shootout occurs Altman pulls the rug out from under our feet and cuts away. In this simple scene we see how Altman operates. What is usually denied is given precedence the spaces omitted in normal films are given by Altman room to breathe.For better or worse reversals like this  both obvious and subtle  take place constantly throughout Altman's filmography. Enjoyment of his films thus depends on the audience having an intimate awareness of what is being subverted deconstructed or undermined which is perhaps why Altman is so despised. Those who like his films tend to like him for what he doesn't do. What he sets up and then rejects.Beyond all this you have the typical selfreferential Altman layer. The act of preparing improvising and putting on a show ballet is mirrored to the act of preparing improvising and creating Altman's film. And of course you need a creative force in both worlds personified by Mr A Malcolm McDowell in the film Altman's doppelgnger. Such a selfreferential layer is typical of Altman. Nashville Buffalo Bill MASH Gosford Park Prairie Home Companion The Player Cookie's Fortune etc all revolve around large groups of people getting together and putting on a performance. What's fresh about The Company is the sheer level of restraint.810  Worth two viewings.";

	schema:reviewBody "Yet another marvelous marvelous film from Robert Altman. I hope that he makes a hundred more movies before he leaves us. What really needs to be said about The Company though is this kudos to Neve Campbell! This is certainly an Altman film but it was Ms. Campbell who organized this whole project and pulled it off. Who knew that this young beauty had merely been slumming the whole time? Her years in awful television drama and slasher flicks paid off. She came up with the story put up some of the money and she was the one who convinced Altman to take the job. Not only that but she comes off as almost too modest with the relatively small role she has in the film. Of course she's in it more than anyone else and we get to learn about her life more than anyone else's but the spotlight is simply on ballet itself. And what a beautiful art it is! The film works like a musical with ballet numbers popping up throughout the loose narrative. Most are unannounced these are just some of the performances the company the Joffrey Ballet Company of Chicago give throughout their season. The final setpiece a hallmark of Robert Altman's cinema is built up to through most of the film. The Company works much like a documentary a documentary that makes no commentary on its subject. It's all just observation. In many ways it's not like a regular Altman film because another of his hallmarks is the swift and thorough characterizations his subjects receive. By the end of Nashville those 20 characters are so potent in our minds that the audience could write novels based on them. Not so with this one where we really only get wisps of the people. It's a subtler approach than Altman's more famous films it's a grace I suppose that fits the subject. We watch the everyday events that occur in the company the successes and the failures the fading careers and the beginnings the egos of the stars and the humbleness of the chorus. The film also follows the characters this time mostly Neve's lives after the season is over. Campbell has to work as a bartender in a trendy club. Along the course of the film she meets a handsome young chef played by James Franco. Malcolm McDowell shows the strongest personality in the film mostly because he's playing the company's head. The kind of humor that is specifically Altman's is not common in The Company but when it does pop up it's always around McDowell. This is a wonderful film not to be missed. It's also the rare film that I really wish I could have seen in a theater. Perhaps one day at a distant Robert Altman retrospective I will have that opportunity. 910.".

	schema:headline " Robert Altman's valentine may include minor SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "The trailer for The Company is tantalizingly vague and compelling  flashes of dance and movement hints of a ballerina's personal life when we see Neve Campbell playing pool in a bar the forceful projection of Malcolm McDowell as he instructs his troop but no clear sense of what the film's story is about. And it turns out that the trailer is an accurate representation of the film. We see evocative imagery brilliant dancing and a forceful character presented by McDowell but still leave without a clear sense of the story.The film is presented as Robert Altman's film and as director and coproducer it's a fitting appellation. But as star cowriter and coproducer the film is as much Neve Campbell's as anyone's.Initially I sat through the film feeling a bit frustrated by the incompleteness of the story. But as time passed before I was able to write this review it was able to gestate a bit and I ended up feeling that Robert Altman and Neve Campbell deliberately and in some ways brilliantly deliver exactly the film they wanted.The stories presented in The Company are frustratingly abbreviated. We see Josh James Franco first spot Ry Neve Campbell in the restaurant where he works though she does not see him. We later see them in a bar  he covertly watches her while she plays pool. We don't see them meet  instead the film flashes forward to them waking up together. The next scene with him has him entering her apartment with his own key. Clearly time has passed and we have only seen flashes of their lives together without the opportunity to watch the characters develop.Other subplots are similarly condensed. We see a new dancer John Gluckman fumbling about trying to find his place in the Company  pleading to share a locker with another dancer struggling to find an open spot on the bar begging to sleep on a fellow dancer's apartment floor. A quick glimpse into the impoverished life of a new dancer but no clear development nor a clear resolution for that matter. In another storyline we see the interactions between a gorgeous young dancer David Gombert and his overcontrolling boyfriend Yasen Peyankov who is listed as his mentor in the credits but the relationship seems so much more but we fail to receive a complete picture of their story.But in a way it seems that these abbreviated stories are in fact intentional meant more like sporadic snapshots into their lives rather than a complete film reel. And in that sense the film mirrors the art it features. Dance and ballet in particular invokes emotions through color movement and sound. The stories told in a ballet are hinted at suggested by the dancers' actions. Similarly the film hints at the characters' stories through quick images but without presenting a complete story. The audience is given a few points in time and is left to connect the dots and complete the story themselves  just as we would at a ballet.And the film presents just enough hints to be able to fill in those blanks or at least some of them. We see how hard it is for Ry and Josh to stay together.

	onyx:emotionText "The trailer for The Company is tantalizingly vague and compelling  flashes of dance and movement hints of a ballerina's personal life when we see Neve Campbell playing pool in a bar the forceful projection of Malcolm McDowell as he instructs his troop but no clear sense of what the film's story is about. And it turns out that the trailer is an accurate representation of the film. We see evocative imagery brilliant dancing and a forceful character presented by McDowell but still leave without a clear sense of the story.The film is presented as Robert Altman's film and as director and coproducer it's a fitting appellation. But as star cowriter and coproducer the film is as much Neve Campbell's as anyone's.Initially I sat through the film feeling a bit frustrated by the incompleteness of the story. But as time passed before I was able to write this review it was able to gestate a bit and I ended up feeling that Robert Altman and Neve Campbell deliberately and in some ways brilliantly deliver exactly the film they wanted.The stories presented in The Company are frustratingly abbreviated. We see Josh James Franco first spot Ry Neve Campbell in the restaurant where he works though she does not see him. We later see them in a bar  he covertly watches her while she plays pool. We don't see them meet  instead the film flashes forward to them waking up together. The next scene with him has him entering her apartment with his own key. Clearly time has passed and we have only seen flashes of their lives together without the opportunity to watch the characters develop.Other subplots are similarly condensed. We see a new dancer John Gluckman fumbling about trying to find his place in the Company  pleading to share a locker with another dancer struggling to find an open spot on the bar begging to sleep on a fellow dancer's apartment floor. A quick glimpse into the impoverished life of a new dancer but no clear development nor a clear resolution for that matter. In another storyline we see the interactions between a gorgeous young dancer David Gombert and his overcontrolling boyfriend Yasen Peyankov who is listed as his mentor in the credits but the relationship seems so much more but we fail to receive a complete picture of their story.But in a way it seems that these abbreviated stories are in fact intentional meant more like sporadic snapshots into their lives rather than a complete film reel. And in that sense the film mirrors the art it features. Dance and ballet in particular invokes emotions through color movement and sound. The stories told in a ballet are hinted at suggested by the dancers' actions. Similarly the film hints at the characters' stories through quick images but without presenting a complete story. The audience is given a few points in time and is left to connect the dots and complete the story themselves  just as we would at a ballet.And the film presents just enough hints to be able to fill in those blanks or at least some of them. We see how hard it is for Ry and Josh to stay together. They are separated continuously throughout the movie  when he has to work on New Year's Eve when he's later separated from her across a crowded bar when he's already asleep when she returns home and ultimately when he's trapped on the opposite side of the stage from her at the film's conclusion. But though the theme of being separated recurs throughout in the end it seems to be about being able to surmount those obstacles to stay together. Though Josh is already asleep when Ry returns home on New Year's Eve she is able to snuggle against him on the couch and fall asleep in his arms.

I'm sure some research into the background of Neve Campbell the socalled star of the film would reveal some interest and background into balletI hope. Any ballet dancer could have been lead character. This film would have been better suited as a one hour documentary on AE or Bravo. Over half the movie seemed to be dedicated to actual ballet performanceswhich were nice but really dull. I'm sure there is much time dedication and drama in the lives of ballet dancers who battle it out to be the one performer who gets to shine on stage during performances but this movie does a real boring job at portraying it.".

He's renown as one of the great directors to give actors freedom he's probably in his own way as meticulous as Stanley Kubrick only with far less takes though one wonders if from time to time he does give his direction to an actor or to make sure they know what they're doing. But in his films like with this Chicago dancing company presented in his 2003 film The Company the people doing the work need to know what they're doing and that's the key to getting process since dance like film combines many elements in terms of dance there's physical movement there's acting and performance there's emotion there's music and lighting and so on.I imagine that's what drew Altman to the project it was said it took some consideration before he accepted the job that and perhaps a connection with the character Malcolm McDowell plays Mr. Antonelli. He doesn't have much of a ego but when he needs to or just wants to he'll put on airs. While some of the students may roast him eventually there's a company Christmas party where he's ruthlessly but pleasantly mocked they always take what he says seriously since when he speaks one listens even if it's a rambling speech about what the 1960's were like. He like Altman is in control even when he doesn't seem to be doing much. And how the stage is set as we see goes a long way for a fantastic dance setpiece be it with thirty people in crazy costumes or a couple in very sensual poses.The Company has not much plot to speak of then again Altman would probably rather get a root canal than worry about a plot except that it's about a danceballet company putting on performances throughout a season with some minor drama here and there a small romance between a superstar in the group played by Neve Campbell and a chef played by James Franco tender scenes but played for real much like those in Thieves Like Us. But there are a few great scenes and as Hawks would say no bad ones and one of them might be one of my favorite scenes in terms of intentional or not artistic elements coming together in any Altman film. There's a performance out at night in a park in front of hundreds. The first part goes reasonably well with thunderstorm sounds in the background. Then Campbell and another dancer take the stage and as the lovely string music swells the lightning and thunder as well and the rain falls and the crowd looks anxious but all the while wrapped up in the completely professionalbreathtaking dancing on stage with little dust and other things flying in the air. It's glorious.How much that was on the spot for Altman or if it was planned to just shoot in the impending storm or perhaps if it's all just made up for the movie it's a really wonderful set piece among many others that are more conventionally stagebound and shot with multiple cameras. The assortment is nice to see a song from David Lynch's Industrial Symphony 1 even comes up. But it's those little scenes between people where Altman breaks down artifice or adds to it seamlessly like a dance itself that The Company gains its strength. One of which is the first time Franco and Campbell meet eye to eye at a bar. Watch as Franco sits and watched her play pool. This could go any number of ways from creepy to erotic but it's more playful and ambiguous than that. We see the aftermath of this scene in a morningafter followup but it's how Altman lets these actors be natural find their space to look at one another or play pool that is extraordinary.What The Company lacks in melodramatic tension or a real driving force towards something the one criticism it could be given though not a harsh one is an almost disdain for any continuing conflict is made up for in a principle need to express what it's like to create something anything on stage or on film that's worth something. It's the work of an old master still looking for ways to create or observe it being done.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Company is far below the level of Robert Altman's best efforts. In contrast with Gosford Park's endlessly fascinating chatter weaving an intricate web of intrigues and secrets there's much stretching and dancing but very little delving into the backgrounds or relationships of the principals. There's hardly what you could call a plot. There are only a few strong characters. All you really get to hold things together somehow or provide some sense of continuity is a series of things that go wrong1 Among the many dance numbers' the one that stands out is the first an outdoor performance featuring the Hollywood actress Neve Campbell Scream 12 and 3 Wild Things a trained dancer and the force behind the making of the whole film. A thunderstorm comes to buffet the audience and the dancers. The dancers bravely go on and the dance  so we're told anyway  is a triumph. The entire sequence is dominated by a sense of impending disaster. A slippery stage could have meant serious injury. One also wonders about damage to valuable string instruments being played in the open to accompany the dance. All this is extremely distracting and excruciating to watch. Altman does succeed though in giving us a sense of what performances are like from the company's point of view  struggles with physical problems successful efforts at best to avert disaster.2 An injury forces a new lead dancer to give up a role. This happens twice. We realize that dancers constantly face injury or as often are dangerously in denial that they have one.3 Another sort of injury prevents a dancer from performing the whole of a number.' This happens to Neve Campbell at the end of the movie. It's just an arm injury so not careerthreatening but enough to require a quick replacement by a standin.4 A young man is replaced but only for the latter part of a dance he's in  because his energy seems to flag at that point in the performance. This nonetheless results in a terribly bruised ego for the young man and his union rep promises to lodge a formal protest. We get a sense of the constant threats to the ego in such an arbitrarily run system along with the surprising news that union redress may be available in such cases.5 One of the guys in the company takes a new girlfriend. This time again it's Neve Campbell who's the injured' one and at a postperformance celebration she delivers an I was the last to know' speech to the bad boy. I saw nods of agreement from dancerlylooking audience members during this moment.6 The aging female lead dancer  she's 43  repeatedly protests about toochallenging new dances and refuses to make changes in the choreography of old ones. This potentially interesting possibly tragic theme of aging in what is really one of the world's most demanding sports is however only briefly touched on.7 An argument occurs between the director and one dancer who hates choreography of a dance he's in in which men wearing skirts give birth'  and the director instantly reverses what he said about how to perform this moment the day before. The director is adamant the dancer has lost his cool and the conversation breaks down. He frequently ends unsatisfactory conversations by dismissing his interlocutor. The director's rule is autocratic and rarely challenged. However the company does get mild revenge toward the end in a mock restaging of the season's events at a party.All this adds up to something so generic and uninteresting as emotional truth or human experience that you are deeply grateful when at least the main dancer character Neve Campbell gets hooked up with a cook boyfriend the intriguing James Franco. You're thankful for one young male movie star in the piece because the real dancer actors'  as usual  have very little presence or ability as actors. All James Franco gets to do is smile kiss the girl take off his shirt and break some eggs. He does these things with lots of charm and charisma but these are just crumbs tossed to us. The point however seems to be that dancers don't have time for much more than quick sex it's like smoking a cigarette something squeezed in.Altman's casts are usually heavy with talent.  This time there are only three leads Campbell McDowell and Franco. Ironically only the least used Franco has any real appeal.Ms. Campbell is little more than bustling and workmanlike. She has a few minutes with her pushy stage mother that provide some sense of relationships outside the company but it's not enough.You will have a lot of trouble with this movie if you don't like Malcolm McDowell. As the Italian' company director Alberto Altonelli he is brusque bossy obtrusive  really just a flaming ahole with a lot of power to abuse. Is this how dance companies work? Where's the genius? Why does young Franco have more charisma and sex appeal? And what's this about a ceremony in which the blatantly English McDowell gets an award for honoring the ItalianAmerican community'? Okay let's pretend that he's Italian. But do we have to pretend he has no English accent? If that weren't bad enough his little speech about not discouraging their sons from becoming ballet dancers is jarring and crude like all his speeches it's the height of ingratitude and you wonder how anyone so undiplomatic could get money for his company. Is it just possible that McDowell is a jarring and crude actor? His performance is wooden and unsubtle. All he has to qualify for this role is forcefulness. Granted he has that. But his scenes are nothing but irritations.This is at best a generic treatment of an American ballet company. But it fails even on that level. How come none of the male dancers not one is shown to be gay? Isn't that a bit unrealistic about the culture of dance? Why the pretense that they're all straight vying to have sex with the female dancers in the company?Neve's partner after their triumph in the rain has a private improv session unwinding to a Bach solo cello suite. It's rather fun  and would have worked better if it had been allowed to run by itself and not been constantly intercut with the scene of Neve in her apartment  a huge Hollywoodstyle creation right by the El' with a glam bath. The improvised Bach session makes you realize that Flash Dance was better than this. There was another movie about a dance company featuring real dancers again that was better than this. It had a bit more plot and perhaps better dances the people seemed a tad more real as people  and yet it wasn't a great movie. Altman's film has spectacular dance sequences at the beginning and the end but they're just staging not great dance and they're window dressing to cover up the emptiness of the whole production.If you love dance andor Altman you'll doubtless have to see this picture but you won't be watching a particularly memorable ballet movie or getting Altman even at his average level.".

The point however seems to be that dancers don't have time for much more than quick sex it's like smoking a cigarette something squeezed in.Altman's casts are usually heavy with talent.  This time there are only three leads Campbell McDowell and Franco. Ironically only the least used Franco has any real appeal.Ms. Campbell is little more than bustling and workmanlike. She has a few minutes with her pushy stage mother that provide some sense of relationships outside the company but it's not enough.You will have a lot of trouble with this movie if you don't like Malcolm McDowell. As the Italian' company director Alberto Altonelli he is brusque bossy obtrusive  really just a flaming ahole with a lot of power to abuse. Is this how dance companies work? Where's the genius? Why does young Franco have more charisma and sex appeal? And what's this about a ceremony in which the blatantly English McDowell gets an award for honoring the ItalianAmerican community'? Okay let's pretend that he's Italian. But do we have to pretend he has no English accent? If that weren't bad enough his little speech about not discouraging their sons from becoming ballet dancers is jarring and crude like all his speeches it's the height of ingratitude and you wonder how anyone so undiplomatic could get money for his company. Is it just possible that McDowell is a jarring and crude actor? His performance is wooden and unsubtle. All he has to qualify for this role is forcefulness. Granted he has that. But his scenes are nothing but irritations.This is at best a generic treatment of an American ballet company. But it fails even on that level. How come none of the male dancers not one is shown to be gay? Isn't that a bit unrealistic about the culture of dance? Why the pretense that they're all straight vying to have sex with the female dancers in the company?Neve's partner after their triumph in the rain has a private improv session unwinding to a Bach solo cello suite. It's rather fun  and would have worked better if it had been allowed to run by itself and not been constantly intercut with the scene of Neve in her apartment  a huge Hollywoodstyle creation right by the El' with a glam bath. The improvised Bach session makes you realize that Flash Dance was better than this. There was another movie about a dance company featuring real dancers again that was better than this. It had a bit more plot and perhaps better dances the people seemed a tad more real as people  and yet it wasn't a great movie. Altman's film has spectacular dance sequences at the beginning and the end but they're just staging not great dance and they're window dressing to cover up the emptiness of the whole production.If you love dance andor Altman you'll doubtless have to see this picture but you won't be watching a particularly memorable ballet movie or getting Altman even at his average level.";

The camera work is very unrestricted simply because of the fact that the movie deals with real dancers so there is nothing to hide technically in terms of doubling feet because an actor who had no dance experience would have to be doubled. The dances have color light and a life of their own. Altman is great at using the spaces and situations to create an organic feel to the piece. The audience can see things that dancers see and hear point shoes on the stage. It's amazing. Even if one isn't into ballet they should still see this film for a solid story and wonderful dance numbers that will leave you wanting to sign up for a dance class.".

The rest of us don't learn anything or at least learn just enough to know that professional dancing is a horrible way to live. The dancing was beautiful including Neve's although she doesn't look quite as polished as her back ups in the company but the characters were shallow and you are never given anything to grab onto to care about any of them. The only ones you root for the ones who are injured or fired so they can get out of that horrible horrible place. Such a disappointment on so many levels.

Smiley had been forced into retirement by the departure of Control but is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by a rogue agent Ricky Tarr that there was a mole.

Should you expect car chases spills thrills gadgets galore and closelychoreographed fight scenes then you WILL be disappointed. Set in smokefilled sepiatinged 1970s the film centres around the uncovering of a mole 'right at the top of the circus'. The 'circus' is the British Intelligence Services and is made up of a who's who of British acting talent  Firth Hinds Cumberbatch Hardy Strong and Hurt. For the most part the action takes place in the brownsuited and wallpapered world of England but we are given brief glimpses of the spy territory in Budapest Paris and Istanbul. Smiley played inscrutably by Oldman is tasked with uncovering the mole and is ably assisted by Guillam the everwatchable Cumberbatch. Admittedly this is a slowburn of a film full of meaningful looks pregnant pauses and one that hints at deeper and more complex plot strands but it has an authentic air and it is a fascinating to observe a buildup of tension and coldwar paranoia which culminates in a dramatic if subdued fashion. Being slightly too young to have watched the original Alec Guiness TV series I cannot make any direct comparisons and I imagine that a TV series allows much more time for plot and character development. The film must be judged on its own merits and whilst I am sure that this will not be to many mainstream moviegoers' tastes it is one for those who are looking for a film of a different type time and pace.".

It is unpleasant superiority and it is mostly undeserved because to be honest this is a hard film to follow and it does demand attention. Those wishing to insult me via private message can do so but I did struggle several times to understand how things fitted together and what relevance certain scenes had. This didn't limit my enjoyment of the film though and mostly I still followed the broad stroke of the plot even if some bits of it did lose me.I've not read the tome of a book or seen the BBC miniseries so I can't comment how well it compresses down to this twohour film but for me it did at times seem to be cramming a lot into a small time and occasionally it felt like it was unnecessarily convoluted or confusing. If you stay with it as best you can it is intriguing and rather dramatic considering that much of the film is people talking to one another as opposed to chases and gun fights. The success of this is mostly down to the atmosphere and tone created by director Alfredson because there is a constant tension to the film  cold perhaps but very tense at times certainly not bored even if it can look that way from a distance.This is not what he does best though because to there was an aspect to the film that was excellent and this was the feeling of outdatedness of an unnecessary function and a pointless war. This feeling is in the characters in the setdecoration and in every shot. The men we follow had the height of their import many years ago  now it appears they are mainly fighting their equal numbers on the other side simply because they exist. I really liked this overarching sense of smallness that sat across the film and I enjoyed finding it being employed in even the smallest detail  in the attitude of a minor character through to the cheap do not unplug text scrawled on the wall those that work in older offices will know this feeling. Alfredson is bang on the money with this feeling it is part of the story and it is brilliantly delivered throughout.Speaking of brilliant delivery the cast is deep in British talent and unsurprisingly they deliver. Oldman may not have won the Oscar but he is great here  working with restraint and doing so much. He does so much with minor reactions and movements and he is a great character. He is the lead here but alongside him is a cast that is hard not to just list  Cumberbach Hurt Jones Firth Burke Graham Hardy and so on British all perhaps but it says a lot that almost all of the supporting players here will be recognised internationally. Everyone gives strong performances and everyone seems to understand what Alfredson is doing.Overall this is a great film albeit one that is not as easy to follow as those impatient snobs would have you believe. It is OK to struggle with some aspects and it is still easy to enjoy the film. The plot engaged me but what stayed with me more than anything else was how it all seemed so unimportant how those involved were all working to ignore the irrelevance of their work and how very tired this world seemed  this aspect was very well done and made the film as much as Oldman's strong central performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fortysix year old Swedish director Tomas Alfredson came to prominence three years ago when he directed the film adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel 'Let The Right One In'. After the initial success of the vampiric romantic drama Alfredson became attached to an international adaptation of John le Carre's espionagenovel 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'. Based on aspects of le Carre's also known as David Cornwell experiences during his time as a member of the British Intelligence service sectors MI5 and MI6 during the 1950s and 1960s Alfredson creates a fine absorbing picture which engrosses from beginning to end.Control John Hurt the leader of an unknown sector of the British Intelligence service is ousted along with his longstanding companion George Smiley Gary Oldman due to a botched operation in Budapest Hungary which saw the officer Jim Prideaux Mark Strong murdered in public. Control was under the impression that there was a mole among the top ranking members of the service referred to as the Circus by the other top ranking members due to its location in Cambridge Circus London and Smiley is drawn out of retirement to pinpoint the culprit after Control passes away. Alongside the young Intelligence officer Peter Guillam Benedict Cumberbatch Smiley has four primary candidates to focus his investigation upon they are the last remaining members of the Circus Bill Haydon Colin Firth Percy Alleline Toby Jones Roy Bland Ciaran Hinds and Toby Esterhase David Dencik.Utilizing an allstar established cast Alfredson allows the film to unfold at an almost flawless pace. Every sequence contains a small snippet of information which allows the viewer to conduct their own investigation alongside that of Smiley's. While the narrative is also driven along by strong performances from the primarily male cast Gary Oldman Colin Firth Toby Jones Ciaran Hinds David Dencik Stephen Graham and Kathy Burke all give strong commanding performances. While the true artists of the piece are Benedict Cumberbatch who plays the young and somewhat naive intelligent officer assigned to assist Smiley. John Hurt as the aging instinctdriven leader of the British service and Tom Hardy who is Ricki Tarr the dirty cleaner for British intelligence's most fowl operations. Their performances go above and beyond in their supporting roles and at times eclipse Gary Oldman's subdued portrayal of a man drawn back into the murky world of corruption betrayal and treasure.Alongside the narrative and its cast one of the more surprising aspects of the film is Alfredson Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and Editor Dino Jonsater's use of stylistic nuances that further enhance the viewing experience. Lingering closeup shots of seemingly insignificant objects and shallow focus shots constantly evoke the nature of mystery and intrigue which surrounds such clandestine organisations. Alfredson never rushes any moment instead he allows for the audience to become accustomed to their surroundings and appreciate their beauty. Wide angle shots and long lenses are used for interior and exterior locations showcasing the breakdowns of their interiors while closeup shots are used to examine objects and characters in their most frail states. During the opening sequence involving Prideaux's botched secret mission a simple concoction of jump cuts and lingering static shots concentrating upon various characters within the vicinity creates a sense of the tension suspense and vulnerability of the situation and this is how Alfredson constantly keeps the audience engrossed. By providing those observing the action on screen with just enough information that they themselves become entwined within Smiley's investigation as he moves forward.Once the credits and a dedication to the films screenwriter Bridget O'Connor who passed away last year finish the viewer is left with an overriding sense of satisfaction. Smiley's world is a far cry away from the glitz and glamour that the espionage genre has become accustomed to. There are no martinis in sight but only reel upon reel of bureaucratic wrangling childish bickering and greedinduced dealmaking where it seems everybody is working for themselves and their reputation rather than the nation's government that is employing them. Since its premiere at the 68th Venice International Film Festival 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' has been touted as an Oscar contender and it is easy to understand why Tomas Alfredson has taken a solid source novel utilized an established cast and infused the final concoction with elements from his own visual repertoire to create a wonderfully crafted film that does the original BBC televised series justice.".

It also doesn't fit the change in perception that the current generation have needing an edit at least every 5 seconds and a linear storyline that's not ageist just what we in a much older generation have left as our inheritance sadly. I really enjoyed the film references whether they are intentional or not they range from Rear Window to La Nuit Americaine to Mr Bean's Holiday to Godard. Gary Oldman as Smiley is very good much colder that AG and as in the book a bit younger. It is also less of the feel of a group of Oxbridge Dons in charge rather ex servicemen as MI5 was in those days. I was in my 20's in the early 1970's and the general dullness of everything during that time comes through very well. I would think that after they edited it they wished they hadn't had some rather crass graffiti so prominent but I remember it was all over London at that time. Good film with a plot that makes you concentrate and you have to use your brain well worth seeing but don't go if you want thrills and spills.".

	schema:headline " A Genuine Achievement";
	schema:reviewBody "Boldly announcing himself upon the stage of international cinema with 2009's Let the Right One In the significant critical and commercial acclaim accorded director Thomas Alfredson clearly proved him a filmmaker capable of pulling off high quality adaptations of complex and dark literary sources.Called back into service to uncover the identity of a Soviet mole at the height of the Cold War retired British intelligence operative George Smiley is tasked with unwinding a vastly convoluted web of conspiracy codenames double agents and deceit.The movement from relatively lowbudget foreign language filmmaking to helming star casts in comparably costly productions is one that historically holds significant risk for directorial careers. Add to the mix the danger of bringing a muchloved novel to life on screen and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spybased on John le Carr's bookthrows an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key charactersmost of whom go by at least two namesthe film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed particularly considering its reserved pace the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tenselyoriented end of the genre delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache indeed Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed thereinthe brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shotan extreme closeup of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of and familiarity with this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt Hardy to Cumberbatch Oldman to Dencik the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together each actor inhabiting their character with awardcourting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisationan alltoo often underutilised aspect in this genreeach of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage but ours is with them exploring their motivations their private lives their loyalties and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities but rather human beings with emotions afflicted by the agonies of their toils burying themselves in vodkalaced punch to just get away from it all.Hitting all the right notes in its performances script and direction Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives. Shot with unforgettable effulgencecommitting to memory eternal every last contour of Oldman's storied browit is a genuine achievement in cinematic storytelling.".

	onyx:emotionText "Boldly announcing himself upon the stage of international cinema with 2009's Let the Right One In the significant critical and commercial acclaim accorded director Thomas Alfredson clearly proved him a filmmaker capable of pulling off high quality adaptations of complex and dark literary sources.Called back into service to uncover the identity of a Soviet mole at the height of the Cold War retired British intelligence operative George Smiley is tasked with unwinding a vastly convoluted web of conspiracy codenames double agents and deceit.The movement from relatively lowbudget foreign language filmmaking to helming star casts in comparably costly productions is one that historically holds significant risk for directorial careers. Add to the mix the danger of bringing a muchloved novel to life on screen and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spybased on John le Carr's bookthrows an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key charactersmost of whom go by at least two namesthe film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed particularly considering its reserved pace the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tenselyoriented end of the genre delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache indeed Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed thereinthe brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shotan extreme closeup of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of and familiarity with this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt Hardy to Cumberbatch Oldman to Dencik the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together each actor inhabiting their character with awardcourting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisationan alltoo often underutilised aspect in this genreeach of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage but ours is with them exploring their motivations their private lives their loyalties and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities but rather human beings with emotions afflicted by the agonies of their toils burying themselves in vodkalaced punch to just get away from it all.Hitting all the right notes in its performances script and direction Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives. Shot with unforgettable effulgencecommitting to memory eternal every last contour of Oldman's storied browit is a genuine achievement in cinematic storytelling.";

	schema:reviewBody "John Le Carre is without doubt one of the literary greats of the late 20th Century . A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geopolitical situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic  a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema You can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman  Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematography The problem is that  and I'm afraid to admit this  is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time . A British agent is shot and caputured in Hungary and MI6 believes he was set up by a mole . I understood this but then we cut to a character after character discussing who the mole might be  do we have a mole and we don't have a mole and very soon I was very lost . This film topped the film charts in Britain for a grand total of three weeks and one suspects by way of a backhanded compliment many people went to the cinema for a second and third time in order to unravel the plot .

	schema:headline " The classic Cold War spy thriller turned into a ravishing looking thinking man's thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "I have not read the book nor seen the 1979 landmark series that garnered so much acclaim for the BBC and Sir Alec Guinness but such contextualisation is not needed to recognise that this version of 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is a masterful retelling of John le Carr's seminal work about British espionage during the Cold War. An early scene really encapsulates the whole tone and mood of the film. A retired George Smiley played majestically by Gary Oldman is sitting at home and enjoying a documentary about Winston Churchill which seems suitably apt for a man of his former position when his doorbell suddenly and unexpectedly rings. His head turns slowly to the left in the direction of the impudent sound and the instantaneous look of sheer effrontery and disdain on Oldman's face will leave you chuckling as his peaceful reverie is rudely disturbed. Such scenes like this leaven the film with humour but ultimately this is a chamber piece expertly played by the cream of British acting talent headed by Goldman and Hurt who incidentally could also have been a great George Smiley and told with a languid verve that unravels the complex plotting in a series of tableaux vivants laden with mystery and suspense but which also acts as important plot points and clues.The film is about the hunt for a Soviet 'mole' in the highest echelons of the British Secret Intelligence Service MI6 but fictitiously known as 'The Circus' by George Smiley an intelligence officer who has been brought out of forced retirement by Oliver Lacon the Civil Service overseer of the Circus. Through a love affair with the wife of a Russian intelligence officer a British agent Ricki Tarr Tom Hardy discovers that there may be a high ranking Soviet mole within the Circus. Aided by Peter Guillam Bendedict Cumberbatch who is Tarr's handler Smiley sets about uncovering the mole without the knowledge of Circus leadership anyone of whom might be the mole headed by Percy Alleline Toby Jones and his deputies Bill Haydon Colin Firth Roy Bland Ciarn Hinds and Toby Esterhase David Dencik  the 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' of the book codenames assigned by Control Head of British Secret Service.The director Tomas Alfredson established his reputation with 'Let the Right One In' an icy Swedish romantic horror that dealt with relationships and this too is a film about human nature moral dilemmas and relationships  friendship loyalty and betrayal on intimate and grand scales with personal and national implications. Like 'Let the Right One In' Alfredson imbues 'Tinker Tailor' Soldier Spy' his first English language feature with somnambulistic pacing and mood that requires the audience to be patient but this is richly rewarded with scenes shot after shot that ravish the eye and heavy with period atmosphere and drama. James Bond this is not and George Smiley has more in common with Harry Palmer than Ian Fleming's vigorous secret agent. Indeed Robert De Niro's admirable treatment of the early history of the Criminal Intelligence Agency CIA in 'The Good Shepherd' 2006 has a similar cipher in Edward Wilson  a 'grey man' whose very ordinariness renders him invisible to counter espionage and thus makes him the perfect intelligence operative. A raised voice towards the end of 'Tinker Tailor' is as excited as Smiley gets but for those not familiar with the story the ending will leave you with a broad smile of satisfaction as the 'grey man' note Smiley's grey hair grey countenance and grey suit replete with oversized glasses and shambling gait of the secret intelligence service wins the day.The screenwriters Peter Straughan and the late Bridget O'Connor have done an exceptional job in condensing down what is clearly a labyrinthine Cold War thriller into a classic two hour potboiler without losing any of its exposition characters and plotting. John le Carr and his fans will be proud. This is a thinking man's film about a period of recent history that is as murky as it is exciting and relevant today with its eternal themes of friendship loyalty and national security. There must be many more stories of espionage to mine from both sides of the Iron Curtain and I do hope this film kick starts a renewed interest in telling the stories of the Cold War warriors who shaped the modern world. If the film does 'King's Speech' levels of business I think it just might and Hollywood would be the richer for it.".

	schema:headline " This is how a Spy thriller should be made!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's the oldest question of all George. Who can spy on the spies? Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy might just be my favorite movie of the year. Director Tomas Alfredson caught my attention a few years ago with his Swedish film Let the Right One in which in my opinion is the best vampire film I've seen. This is a very different movie but he still uses very similar techniques. He shoots several shots from a distance which sort of sets the mood of the story dealing with espionage the setting is also very dark and grayish and the story moves at a pretty slow pace but at the same time the mystery and thrills are always there. This is how a spy thriller should be made it's about as realistic as any spy film could ever be. I'm sorry for all those Mission Impossible James Bond and Jason Bourne fans but this is a far more superior thriller. Perhaps the action isn't as entertaining or as easy to follow but if you stick with this movie and put your complete attention specifically on these characters the result is truly satisfying. This isn't a popcorn movie you can watch while you're doing something else you have to devote time and attention to it. My greatest fear is that viewers are becoming so numbed by mindless action scenes and special effects that we don't even want to think about a movie while we're watching it. Sometimes we just want to feel entertained but we're not willing to spend time focusing on the story and what is going on. We want everything put in front of us and don't want to try to discover things on our own. If that is the case then Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is not the movie for you but if you are into a well crafted mystery thriller than you will be in for a pleasant surprise like I was. This was one of the greatest viewing experiences I've had this year.The movie takes place during the Cold War and its set in 1973 London. One of the head members of the British Intelligence Service named Control John Hurt sends one of his agents Mark Strong on a special mission to Budapest. Control tells Jim that he received important and confidential information about one of his four top spies being a mole which would explain why the Russians have been up to date with what is going on in England. Control's four head spies are Percy Alleline Toby Jones Toby Esterhase David Dencik Roy Bland Ciarn Hinds and Bill Haydon Colin Firth and he believes one of them is the mole. Control evens suspects his right hand man George Smiley Gary Oldman so he orders Jim to go to Budapest and meet with his contact to find out who the traitor is. He has a code name for each one of the spies tinker tailor soldier and poorman. When Jim arrives at Budapest the mission goes wrong and it's clear to Control that the traitor has found out and blown the mission once again. Control is forced to retire after the Budapest fiasco along with George Smiley. A year later Control passes away and one of the British ministers hires Smiley to discover who the mole is after he receives a phone call from a disappeared agent named Ricky Tarr Tom Hardy who claims to have information about the traitor. Smiley begins investigating with the help of another agent named Benedict Cumberbatch Peter Guillam and begins piecing things together through a series of interesting and eyeopening flashbacks.The story is just really well made it's really smart there is a lot of talking going on and not much action but it forces you to pay attention to every small detail of the movie. Once the movie is over you feel like watching it all over again because you feel like you had missed some important details. I really loved this film and was completely satisfied with the movie. The performances are just great Gary Oldman steals the show. He is so quiet and emotionless what a really good spy probably looks like. You never know what is going through his mind but you cant help but think he knows what he's doing. Then there is Tom Hardy who is always great. He is probably the person who shows more emotion in this movie but he is brilliant. Peter Guillam Colin Firth Toby Jones Mark Strong and John Hurt are all terrific as well. The movie really has a seventies feel to it and I don't think you can get closer to that time better than how Alfredson did. The casting the setting the filming the editing the soundtrack everything about this film is just perfect. This film along with Drive were the best experiences I had with a movie this year. It isn't a sexy or entertaining film it will require your complete attention but the payoff is completely worth it. The screenplay was also really well adapted from the John Le Carre lengthy novel. They were able to condense the story into two hours which is much shorter than the seven hour BBC television version starring Alec Guinness. I really loved this film and absolutely recommend it over any other spy thriller. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Watch the TV series instead";
	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to enjoy this film. I watch the 1979 TV series at least once a year and was looking forward to a new dark edgy take on a wellloved story.I was very disappointed. First the plot is mashed up for example Ricki Tarr who should set Smiley's mole hunt in motion does not appear until the halfway point. Secondly characters are not developed and even altered Percy Alleline is a peevish bully rather than an overpromoted pompous buffoon who has been suckered into giving the KGB a pipeline into Western intelligence and Peter Guillam is fashionably gay. We don't even get any sense of Bill Haydon's motivation to turn double agent apart from a throwaway line about the West being rather horrible. Colin Firth does make more of Haydon's frustration at working for an increasingly impotent power  Britain  when he wants to make a mark on History and therefore turns to a more dynamic force which he believes the USSR to be.There is no suspense in the key scenes where Peter Guillam steals a top secret file from the archives or even in the revelation of the mole. What Hitchcock could have done with these sequences! One scene which did work for me on a symbolic level was the Christmas party.

	onyx:emotionText "I really wanted to enjoy this film. I watch the 1979 TV series at least once a year and was looking forward to a new dark edgy take on a wellloved story.I was very disappointed. First the plot is mashed up for example Ricki Tarr who should set Smiley's mole hunt in motion does not appear until the halfway point. Secondly characters are not developed and even altered Percy Alleline is a peevish bully rather than an overpromoted pompous buffoon who has been suckered into giving the KGB a pipeline into Western intelligence and Peter Guillam is fashionably gay. We don't even get any sense of Bill Haydon's motivation to turn double agent apart from a throwaway line about the West being rather horrible. Colin Firth does make more of Haydon's frustration at working for an increasingly impotent power  Britain  when he wants to make a mark on History and therefore turns to a more dynamic force which he believes the USSR to be.There is no suspense in the key scenes where Peter Guillam steals a top secret file from the archives or even in the revelation of the mole. What Hitchcock could have done with these sequences! One scene which did work for me on a symbolic level was the Christmas party.

I just couldn't follow the plot of this labyrinthine movie adapted from John Le Carre's novel which had previously been made into an awardwinning BBC TV series with Alec Guinness as spycatcher George Smiley. That itself had been a multipart production but here the action or should that be inaction is condensed into a still lengthy two and a halfhour film.It seemed that every time I picked up a plot thread it led me down an inconclusive sideroad with no real drama at any point. Even the revelation of the mole in the British Secret Service was delivered unspectacularly in keeping with the dogmatic realism of the rest of the narrative. Plotlines circle round and turn in on themselves but ended up only dizzying my perceptive powers.The cream of contemporary British acting talent old and young pretty much is the whole cast but I didn't get any sense of the actors really inhabiting their parts. Gary Oldman's playing is very much in the shadow of Guinness and noone else distinguished themselves in my eyes. They may have been in the book I guess but strange scenes like Smiley taking a constitutional swim in a public place or the Secret Service office party just sort of occur although to what end I'm not entirely sure. Apart from hearing the odd stray song on the soundtrack or sighting a vintage car in the streets I hardly got the impression that this was the 70's at all. There were no news inserts or political issues to reference the times leaving the story to unfold in a musty grey netherworld vaguely Kafkaish in tone.Which may well have been the point. All I know is this film failed to connect with me at all and was a major disappointment for this particular viewer in almost very respect.".

In a discussion with a friend of mine I was also treated to the same rhetoric when I disagreed  that I must be some kind of unintelligent heathen who only likes simple action films. Not so unfortunately. Rather I just spent the last two hours being bored to within an inch of my life. Only because I thought there must be something coming that justified said glowing reviews did I not leave the theatre but it turned out to be as bad a decision as going in there in the first place.The film setting is pretty much the most dismal and dreary image of 1970's England imaginable. Everything is brown or grey dirty and uninspiring as if looking through the eyes of a severely depressed individual. We are treated to endless scenes of characters simply moving from one dreary location to another and then sitting there not speaking. Smiley whilst brilliantly acted by Oldman seems incapable of responding to any dialog without first a 30 second pause of suspended animation. The majority of the rest of the characters comprised a bunch of sour rude and miserable old men none of which I developed even the slightest compassion for.The basic story of the film is the discovery of a mole in MI6 except that since MI6 appeared to consist of the most miserable human beings on the planet then really who cares if they find the mole or not? In fact why not leave the mole there since he's the only thing that's even vaguely interesting. The mole is of course finally uncovered in a scene that typifies the film another brown room two miserable old men not speaking and not moving.Cinematography also seems to be another buzzword to use here so let's address it. To be fair some nice use of the camera does add a modicum of style but it's nothing that hasn't been done before and if anything it's overused to the point where it gets in the way of the film and becomes tiresome.It's not that there aren't some good points there are. There are a few well done scenes the acting is good and the younger characters do infuse some life into the plot. However unfortunately these islands of relief are few and far between and the result was two and a bit of the most dreary and uninspiring hours of my life.".

It didn't help that they focused on a particular character in a certain way which was out of context with how other characters were dealt with. Why did they do that? Oh because he is the bad guy.

At first I did find the book somewhat a slowburner and not to easy to get into. On repeat readings however I do find it a compelling and very interesting piece of work. I had heard much about the 1979 version and when I saw it I was more than impressed. It was tense involving I connected to the characters and Alec Guinness' performance in it for me was one of his most memorable and iconic of his very great career.About this Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy it did have a lot to live up to considering how great the book and the Alec Guinness version were. And I think it succeeds it admirably condenses a very difficult book which I imagine is a daunting task and does extremely well on its own merits toowhich is how I will judge the film. At first like the book it is a slowburner to start with but once the tension rises the story gets going and more characters introduced the film becomes more absorbing. The ending I agree was a little rushed but I personally didn't find it too convoluted.I did find that Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was very well made. The period recreation was wonderfully evoked and even better than that it was authentic. The cinematography was also impressive perhaps grainy but it did suit the gritty menacing tone of the film and atmosphere very well. The music is electrifying it does play a subtle part in some scenes but also adds to any scene that is tense or shocking. The direction consistently is assured and don't fall into the trap of being too artsy.The script is thoughtful and has the basic feel of the prose of the book. The story as I have said is slow to start with and it is a good idea for those who haven't read the book or seen the 1979 version to have a good enough idea of it before watching but the number of shocking scenes such as the killing of Hardy's love interest and Firth's character's demise and the atmosphere throughout kept me interested and thrilled. Also the part where Ciaron Hinds' character hums the George Formby song it was terrifying in a way that they'd been listening in but Cumberbatch's face was a picture! The pace is solid alive to nuances and doesn't plod so much as for me to call it dull or something like that.Characterisation wise Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy isn't as good as the 1979 version or the book even but in many ways I can understand. The 1979 version did have more time and room to delve more into the characters. That said I do commend the film in doing what it could to make the characters interesting and perhaps complex and I think any slow pacing helped with this rather than hindered it. I also loved that the emotion in this film is very under the surface rather than hard hitting. The acting is excellent.Gary Oldman is superb George Smiley is perhaps one of his more subtler performances but nonetheless it is still commanding and one of my personal favourite performances of his. Of the support cast the standouts are Tom Hardy whose character apart from Smiley was the film's most interesting and Mark Strong whose charisma and intensity still captivates. Benedict Cumberbatch I initially wasn't sure about in regard to age but the acting was so great I forgot about any worries. Colin Firth gives his usual solid performance Toby Jones also excels and Kathy Burke does well in a hard role. John Hurt gives his all into what he's got which goes to show how good an actor he is he's got some good lines and excellent delivery but the character isn't as developed well or as natural as the rest.Overall a very interesting and well done movie. It was one of my most anticipated movies of the year and it ended up being one of my favourites too which is saying a lot seeing how hitandmiss so far 2011 has been for movies. 910 Bethany Cox".

And of course it's with its BBC television predecessor that this film invites comparison. Some things come out about even. John Hurt is a charismatic Control even if the shortened format doesn't allow us to witness the gradual and complete disintegration of the character that Alexander Knox portrays in the BBC series. But Colin Firth brings nothing to the role of Haydon to match Ian Richardson's selftormenting irony it would have been interesting to see what Ciarn Hinds already in the cast but underemployed as Roy Bland might have done with the role. As the central character Gary Oldman is an enigma a man who reveals nothing of himself to others. Alec Guinness gives us something more complex a character who reveals to others exactly what he wants them to see. In showing the light in his character he also reveals the shadows. Oldman's Smiley is by contrast a hero for our modern age we don't much care who or what he is as long as he is on our side and we win.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many people here dislike the movie but are satisfied with the TV version andor the book. Well judging from the film the spy story itself is ridiculous on so many levels. Le Carre as a former spy should have known better.The opening scene in Budapest that sets everything in motion sadly doesn't pass the laughing test. A British undercover agent is to meet a potential defector  a Hungarian general who is willing to reveal to the British ultraimportant information about a Soviet mole at the very top of MI6. Why would this general use a gobetween and thus increase the chances of being discovered exposing his gobetween probably a dear and trusted friend to a mortal danger? It's absurd.The Budapest operation had already been betrayed however and the Russians know. So they are supposed to be in full control  remember the stakes couldn't have been higher. Instead they let a sloppy Hungarian agent mimic nervously in front of everybody and let sweat drop in front of the British spy among other revealing signs and yet the British spook omits all those. Then the stupid Hungarian agent shoots the fleeing Brit why when they can just surround the place and apprehend him???? Only after all this nonsense takes place some Russian spy chief pops out of nowhere and shouts that everybody is stupid.A young woman breastfeeds there right in the middle of it sitting in the open in the cold so that she gets shot in the head by mistake  the bullet aimed at the fleeing spy takes a left and ends up inside her brains contrary to real life ballistics. How cruel can the spy world be! Really? How dumber and more contrived can this go?Then the captured Brit is tortured why when the Russians have this much better informed mole higher at the very top of MI6. And then the Russian master spy named Karla because that's how Le Carre wants to present him  a master lets the Brit back to the UK so that he would tell how he was tortured how they unnecessarily blew the brains out of a young nice woman in front of him absolutely for no reason and most importantly the captured British agent had talked to the mole before leaving for Budapest. So if he is let back to the UK he would immediately point at the all important mole as the potential source of the information that betrayed the entire Budapest operation. This officially makes Karla the worst agentrunner in history despite Le Carre's halfbaked attempts to make him a master spy. But it is not only the Russian master spies who are stupid. So are the British when the mole played by Firth is finally caught and in custody the British let him outside the safe house in the open ??? nobody guarding him ??? so that everybody who wants revenge or just to shut his mouth can easily sneak in and put a bullet in his head no sweat. Really? This is how the British will keep their uberimportant detainee? The man who is supposed to give them some idea how much damage has been done how many operations have been compromised??? And this goes on and on ... nothing makes sense in the spy story.The director is employing a series of cheap shots to impress the easily impressionable  the young breastfeeding woman the completely unnecessary violence all along. The story is boring as many already pointed out incoherent from A to Z.On a personal level Smiley as smart and deeply intellectual as he pretentiously is supposed to be finds out his wife is cheating on him only by chance simply because she is so careless that she makes out with the mole at some ridiculously set party at the MI6 headquarters. I thought he was supposed to be able to read people if he is so good. It turns out his wife was betraying him every step of the way.Most of the characters are 2dimensional at best John Hurt's Control is a caricature of a human being who would allow a person with such unhinged behavior to be the head of British intelligence? We've heard about British eccentricity and propensity for alcohol but how do you go up in such a hierarchy with behavior that outrageous?The gay element also seems contrived. For obvious political correctness. Since we all heard how some of those Soviet moles in MI6 were homosexual here comes Le Carre or the director to remind us that gays can also be the good gays who catch moles. And sacrifice their personal lives for the cause. This is sophisticated world people make no mistake.We don't learn anything about most of the characters and their motivation with very few exceptions such as the British rogue agent in Istanbul who wants to save a Russian damsel in distress just out of some basic human decency. This give or take is the only plausible event in the whole story.Oldman's acting is reasonable but nothing extraordinary although I found some elements of his performance rather pretentious than anything else. But it could only be me.The director employs clichs that I'm sure the cinemasnobbery would fawn over. For example the main character OldmanSmiley is shown several times swimming in some pond with deep deep dark dirty waters. So if you are so dumb and not getting it how Smiley is swimming in the dangerous and muddy waters of international espionage here comes the director of this movie with his mindblowing 'symbolism' generously helping you out.The film was tremendous disappointment for me especially since I saw some of the ads on British TV presenting it as something like the best spy thriller ever. What?".

	schema:reviewBody "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 2011  out of 4 Gary Oldman plays George Smiley a retired British agent who is placed back into the field to try and uncover the identity a mole within the ranks of the M16's who is giving information to Russia. TINKER TAYLOR SOLDIER SPY adapted from John le Carre's novel is certainly a very wellmade movie and it features some terrific performances but I must admit that I got lost several times. It seems most people are commenting that they can't figure out the story and it seems many people are hating the movie for this and I can't blame them. However even though I couldn't figure out all of the plot points this type of confusion reminded me of THE BIG SLEEP with Humphrey Bogart another movie where you couldn't follow the story but that didn't take away from the entertainment. Director Tomas Alfredson LET THE RIGHT ONE IN does a marvelous job at keeping the film moving at a good pace even though it's deliberately a very slow one. It seems like the director wants to get every bit of detail within the frame so there are very slow drawn out sequences where not much happens but you can look around and just about everything will grab your attention because you never know if it's a clue or not. I really loved the cold atmosphere that he brought to the film and it's almost identical to his vampire movie. The other very strong point is that you got some terrific actors doing strong work. Oldman is so great here that I'm surprised he's gotten as much attention as he has. This isn't James Bond and there's not a single bit of flash to his character but that's what makes the performance so great. I'm sure most actors would have wanted to add more flair to the part and this is something that Oldman did in many of his early great performances. He doesn't do that here and instead he really gives such a lowkey performance that you just sit there riveted because his eyes tell you everything you need to know. What also impressed me was the way he came off to be constantly thinking about everything he's taking in. Several actors have talked that it's important to listen and think while on camera and Oldman does that brilliantly here. It certainly doesn't hurt that you have impressive support by Colin Firth Benedict Cumberbatch Toby Jones Ciaran Hinds David Hencik John Hurt and Tom Hardy. Again the story makes very little sense or at least to me someone who hasn't read the novel but everything else is just so perfectly done that the film remains entertaining.".

There's something kind of simple and sweet about it. Cute was the word I heard from people in the audience as they were walking out after the show. It doesn't feel like Allen set out to create a masterpiece here it feels like he wanted to make a little comedy and have fun doing it. Compared to just about everything Hollywood is producing Allen's stuff has a tendency to charm. Even the fluffy stuff.

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of 'Scoop' last night. Full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause. I didn't speak to anyone who disliked 'Scoop' although two teenagers sitting next to me sighed and fidgeted uncomfortably for most of the film. They were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves.'Scoop' is a quickly paced murder mystery. A young female journalism student is unwittingly maneuvered by forces beyond her control into trying to catch a serial killer on the loose. Plenty of hijinks ensue as she partners up with a traveling illusionist and falls in love with a frisky and charming young nobleman.'Scoop' isn't a bad addition to the Woody Allen filmography. It isn't his best work but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp. I'd say it fits quite comfortably into being an average Woody Allen film right in the middle of the pack. If you're a Woody Allen fan you'll probably enjoy yourself. If you're indifferent to his work then 'Scoop' might be enough to get you interested in seeing more. I don't think that anyone who dislikes his style of filmmaking and acting are going to change their mind. Woody plays the same kind of neurotic character we've grown so accustomed to although it borders dangerously close to forced and over the top in this film. While potentially aggravating for some who might find themselves wishing he'd hurry up and just spit out the words Woody Allen fans know what to expect.Very good performances all around in my opinion although I found myself missing Ian McShane who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough. Hugh Jackman is great as the charming nobleman and I think Woody Allen has found a new regular star to work with in Scarlett Johansson. I think that with 'Match Point' this is their second pairing and she's just magic with the material that Woody gives her. Could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship! I'm glad I saw the movie and definitely recommend it. More sophisticated comedy than movies like 'Scary Movie 4' so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former 'Scoop' probably isn't for you. If on the other hand you like a touch of class sophistication and fun 'Scoop' is for you. Probably not the Woody Allen film I'd introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scoop is also the name of a lateThirties Evelyn Waugh novel and Woody Allen's new movie though set today has a nostalgic charm and simplicity. It hasn't the depth of characterization intense performances suspense or shocking final frisson of Allen's penultimate effort Match Point argued by many including this reviewer to be a strong return to form but Scoop does closely resemble Allen's last outing in its focus on English aristocrats posh London flats murder and detection. This time Woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian a magician called Sid Waterman stage moniker The Great Splendini who counters some snobs' probing with I used to be of the Hebrew persuasion but as I got older I converted to narcissism. Following a revelation in the midst of Splendini's standard dematerializing act with Scarlett Johansson as Sondra Pransky the audience volunteer the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace English journalist's postmortem attempt to score one last top news story. On the edge of the Styx Joe Strombel Ian McShane has just met the shade of one Lord Lyman's son's secretary who says she was poisoned and she's told him the charming aristocratic bounder son Peter Lyman Hugh Jackman was the Tarot Card murderer a London serial killer. Sondra and Sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths. With Sid's deadpan wit and Sondra's bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the London aristocracy.Woody isn't pawing his young heroine muse  as in Match Point Johansson again  as in the past. This time moreover Scarlett's not an ambitious sexpot and wouldbe movie star. She's morphed surprisingly into a klutzy bespectacled but still pretty coed. Sid and Sondra have no flirtation which is a great relief. They simply team up more or less politely to carry out Strombel's wishes by befriending Lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt. With only minimal protests Sid consents to appear as Sondra's dad. Sondra who's captivated Peter by pretending to drown in his club pool rechristens herself Jade Spence. Mr. Spence i.e. Woody keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker spewing nonstop oneliners and all the while maintaining apparently with success that he's in oil and precious metals just as Jade has told him to say.That's about all there is to it or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome. At first Allen's decision to make Johansson a gauche naively plainspoken and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an allaround bad decision. But Johansson who has pluck and panache as an actress miraculously manages to carry it off helped by Jackman an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable if he desires her. The film actually creates a sense of relationships to make up for it limited range of characters Sid and Sondra spar in a friendly way and Peter and Sondra have a believable attraction even though it's artificial and tainted she is after all going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniac.What palls a bit is Allen's again drooling over English wealth and class things his Brooklyn background seems to have left him despite all his celebrity with a irresistible hankering for. Jackman is an impressive fellow glamorous and dashing. His parents were English. But could this athletic musical comedy star raised in Australia XMan's Wolverine really pass as an aristocrat? Only in the movies perhaps here and in Kate and Leopold.This isn't as strong a film as Match Point but to say it's a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong. It has no more depth than a halfhour radio drama or a TV show but Woody's jokes are far funnier and more original than you'll get in any such media affair and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness. It doesn't matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it's diverting summer entertainment. On a hot day you don't want a heavy meal. The whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment without crude jokes or bombastic effects without Vince Vaughan or Owen Wilson. Critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the Allen decline that preceded Match Point. Don't believe them. He doesn't try too hard. Why should he? He may be 70 but verbally he's still light on his feet. And his body moves pretty fast too.".

Even Mr. Allen poked fun at the fans who wanted him to continue making his same funny films. As with any great artist Mr. Allen's craft evolved over the years and he lost some fans while picking up others. Last year's masterpiece Matchpoint showed he is still every bit as relevant and poignant as he was in the days of Annie Hall and Manhattan. What is most striking to us 40 plus year fans is that Mr. New York himself seems to have a bit of a crush on the mother country. Apparently he actually likes England!! While filming Matchpoint Mr. Allen became enamored with Scarlett Johansson and her real life spirit and sense of humor. This attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years. Scarlett while risking overexposure must be given credit for not just picking films that cast her in some glamorous light. She is unafraid to look and act like a real person. In Scoop she flashes some real on screen comedy chops and in many scenes delivers the real punchline to Mr. Allen's straight man. Of course any time Mr. Allen decides to put himself in front of the camera he will get more than his share of one liners and social commentaries in  which is fine because few do it better.Very nice support work from Ian McShane and Hugh Jackman. In fact Mr. Jackman provides a few glimpses into why many of us thought him the best choice to replace Brosnan as the new Bond. As with most of Allen's films the star is the script not the actors. Although Scarlett delivers superbly here and is a nice contrast to the polished Allen and Jackman what makes this one crackle is the dialogue ... especially the banter between Allen and Scarlett. If you are not a huge Woody the actor fan fear not. He does limit his screen time and he is quite effective except in two or three brief scenes that almost seem out of place. Another Woodman tradition is a sparkling musical background and Scoop is no exception ... especially the Strauss composition.Scoop is a nice cross between Annie Hall and the best of the Marx Brothers films or the Cary Grant comedies. Yes it is an adult comedy but it is actually very cute ... especially for a serial killer and talking ghost comedy!!".

	schema:headline " Scoop on Scoop. Funny Woody is back";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me comment that the audience LOVED it from the first moment. Perhaps current events in the MiddleEast led people to take the attitude I came for a comedy and by George I'm going to enjoy it. but for whatever reason everybody seemed really into the comedy of it. The last few times Woody has tried to do a straight comedy Small Time Crooks Curse of the Jade Scorpion Hollywood Ending I've felt like the oneliners felt strained and a bit antiquated. I remember thinking at one point That would have been funny in the early sixties. So going in to this movie I was afraid Woody was becoming tone deaf however in this one his comic sensibilities were in perfect tune. Admittedly there were plenty of my fellow AARP card carrying folks in the screening but there were also plenty of 20somethings and 30somethings as well and they all seemed to get it and give up the occasional belly laugh in addition to numerous guffaws chuckles and the like. In many instances the throwaways had people laughing so loud you missed the next line.Thematically Woody was traipsing familiar ground. As I suspected from the trailer this film had a lot of Manhattan Murder Mystery in it but then again there was more than a smidgen of Oedipus Wrecks New York Stories Alice and even a little tribute to Broadway Danny Rose at the very beginning.Even with Woody in the movie Scarlett as Sondra was at times the Woodyproxy but her character was far from the Nebbish that say Will Ferrell gave us in Melinda and Melinda or Kenneth Branaugh attempted in Celebrity. Instead of archetypal ticks and quirks Sondra's nerdishness comes directly from the family history which she shares early on. On numerous occasions the family business leads her to malapropisms that we get as an audience while the characters on the screen can only perceive them as strange nonsequiturs. Since we are all in on the joke we can't help but laugh. But the laughs don't come from recognizing the Woody nebbish but truly from the character. To a great extent unlike Farrell Branaugh Cusack or even Mia Farrow before her Scarlett is not required to use the Woody voice to evoke the Woody role. Thus we don't find ourselves ripped out of the narrative as a Woody's voice suddenly emerges from someone else' face.As my friend commented on the way out Sid the character played by Woody is a supporting role but more centerstage than I was hoping going in. However this time Woody seems to have written a character that truly fits his current persona. Unlike his Ed Dobel sage character in Anything Else or his blind director in Hollywood Ending this time the character is a comfortable fit. Perhaps more importantly this time the character works in the story. Within the elevated circles they find themselves in he is even more fishoutofwater than Scarlett which is used to great comedic effect throughout. Sid is a declining itinerant magician playing to small audiences but the fact that he is from another era is placed front and center for our enjoyment.But what about Jackman? What about Ian Swearengen McShane? I liked both of them to the extent that they are used in the piece. I particularly liked McShane's short but effective turns. Jackman is charming with the ease of Old Money that was so often portrayed in films from 50 years ago. Class echoes from Purple Rose of Cairo?So what did I think? Short answer maybe his best straight comedy since 1994's Bullets Over Broadway. Less stylized than Mighty Aphrodite. Less caustic than Deconstructing Harry. Less forced than Small Time Crooks or Hollywood Ending. Woody has finally found a comic voice that works in the 21st century.".

	schema:reviewBody "Coming immediately on the heels of Match Point 2005 a fine if somewhat selfrepetitive piece of serious Woody Scoop gives new hope to Allen's small but diehard band of followers among whom I number myself that the master has once again found his form. A string of disappointing efforts culminating in the dreary Melinda and Melinda 2004 and the embarrassing Anything Else 2003 raised serious doubts that another first rate Woody comedy with or without his own participation as an actor was in the cards. Happily the cards turn out to be a Tarot deck that serves as Scoop's clever Maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of Woody Allen comedy.Even more encouraging Woody's selfcasting  sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years  is here an inspired bit of selfparody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters. In Scoop Allen astutely assigns himself the role of Sid Waterman an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stagepatter who much like Woody himself has brought his act to London where audiences  if not more receptive  are at least more polite. Like Chaplin's Calvero in Limelight 1952 Sid Waterman affords Allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative. Moreover because they seem in character Allen's ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time. Waterman's character also functions neatly in the plot. His fake magic bodydissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from Joe Strombel Ian McShane a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim. Introduced on a River Styx ferryboattoHades Strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just can't rest in eternity without communicating one last scoop about the identity of the notorious Tarot killer. Unfortunately his initial return from the dead leads him to Waterman's magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate Sondra Pransky Scarlett Johansson who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magician's climactic trick. Sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant Waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father. As demonstrated in Lost in Translation Johansson has a talent for comedy and the querulous byplay between her and Allen is very amusing  and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romance.Scoop's serial killer plot involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect Peter Lyman Hugh Jackman is the no doubt predictable result of Allen's lengthy sabbatical exposure to London's ubiquitous Jack the Ripper landmarks and lore. Yet other facets of Scoop as of Match Point also derive from Woody's late life encounter with English culture. Its class structure manners idiom dress architecture and yes peculiar driving habits give Woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire. When for instance Sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with Peter Lyman at a ritzy private club Waterman observes from his point of view we're scum. A good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved British social manners encountering Waterman's insistent Borschtbelt Jewish plebeianism. And then of course there is Waterman's hilarious exit in a Smart Car he can't remember to drive on the left side of the road.As usual Allen's humor in Scoop includes heavy doses of injokes taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as increasingly references to his own filmography. In addition to the pervasive Jack the Ripper references for instance the film's soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of Grieg's The Hall of the Mountain King compulsively whistled by Hans Beckert in M the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre. The postfuneral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed Joe Strombel clearly mimics the opening of Broadway Danny Rose 1984. References to Deconstructing Harry 1997 include the use of Death as a character along with his peculiar voice and costume the use of Mandelbaum as a character name and the mention of Adair University Harry's alma mater and where Sondra is now a student. Moreover the systematic use of Greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to Hades recalls the use of Greek gods and a Chorus in Mighty Aphrodite 1995.As to quotable gags Allen's scripts rely less on oneliners than they did earlier in his career but Scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones. To a question about his religion Waterman answers I was born in the Hebrew persuasion but later I converted to narcissism. And Sondra snaps off this putdown of Waterman's wannabe crimedetecting If we put our heads together you'll hear a hollow noise. All in all Scoop is by far Woody Allen's most satisfying comedy in a decade.".

If you don't want to know how the movie ends don't read this review!Scoop is so bad you'll think Annie Hall was a fluke.It gets one star because you get to see Hugh Jackman's naked chest. That's the only thing Scoop has going for it.Woody Allen's misogyny and his fixation on women young enough at this point to be his granddaughter has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point.The plot seems promising a ghost Ian McShane directs a fluffy headed student Scarlett Johansson to investigate whether or not an English Lord Hugh Jackman is the notorious Tarot Card Killer of prostitutes. A magician Woody Allen helps the girl.Promising plot notwithstanding the movie completely lacks charm or humor or atmosphere. It's an amazingly leaden amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film never mind dozens. Perhaps Allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press.Much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films Woody Allen now a septuagenarian has FINALLY allowed a younger male lead to get the girl.Not so. In fact the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one.There is an early scene where Johansson for no reason central to the movie allows herself to be gotten drunk and seduced by a powerful older director. Seduced is a euphemism for what happens. It's a slam bam I've gotta go kind of moment. It bears no relation to the plot whatsoever and it cheapens Johansson in the viewer's eye. Why did Allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie? Because it shows a powerful director  like Allen  having sex with the female lead. Allen gets to have his cake and eat it too.Johansson is not yet an actress. She doesn't know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight low cut top. She imitates Allen in a couple of scenes and that just looks weird and sad.It doesn't help that her character is scripted as a doll who can't function without a ghost or an elderly and less than aweinspiring magician telling her what to do at every turn.She is approximately half Jackman's age and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together.Audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines and Jackman deserves better too  a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency and an actress who can convey those qualities.Hugh Jackman is similarly cheated by the script. Allen apparently can't stand it that Jackman is so stunningly good looking and young and so he gives Jackman nothing to say or do. Like Johansson he is used merely for his good looks. This is a shame because as Jackman has shown in any number of productions from Oklahoma to X Men he CAN act.Here's the big plot twist  Jackman suave charming English Lord really is a killer. So though the movie says it is all about letting someone else other than Allen get the girl she doesn't get anyone. Jackman the man she's been making love to is a man who murdered a prostitute. Nice Woody. Nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp.In a passive aggressive touch Allen deprives his heroine of his own presence as well killing off his character the magician leaving Scarlett Johansson all alone at the end of the film.A final note at my screening not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film. Always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Scoop' is a comedy set against a thriller in the backdrop. Plotwise it's nothing new but the comic situations and lines do provoke some laughter. This isn't anywhere near Allen's best works but it's amusing enough to keep one entertained. Moreover the English countryside is always great to watch as the fine cinematography captures it. The background score is pleasant. While the cinematography is mostly good I don't understand why a few of the scenes were shot from certain angles for example the scene where Jackman and Johansson are walking down the stairs to go to the 'secret chambre' the camera only focuses from the top floor on part of the actors' heads. In terms of performances 'Scoop' is pretty much Woody Allen's film. He is very much his usual comedic self and yet he's the one who entertains the most. Scarlett Johansson is not really great. For a change she does try to wear more than just the usual 'clueless' expression but her dialogue delivery falls flat and she mostly ends up being unintentionally funny. Hugh Jackman does not get much scope. He is mostly okay with what he's given. He does slip back and forth into his Australian accent. Thus 'Scoop' makes for a decent entertaining onetime watch but that's about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scoop  out of  Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director but I enjoyed Match Point. It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star Woody Allen. It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it.Scoop is Woody Allen's latest film and though he appears in this one it's OK. It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfect together.Johansson plays Sondra Pransky a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel Ian McShane. Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the Reaper has taken. One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman Hugh Jackman. She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of England. Joe with the scoop of a life time travels back to the living and gives this info to Sondra during a magic act. Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman Woody Allen. She becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box she gets the visit from Joe. Not knowing what to do she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case.This film has a nice lighthearted feel to it compared to Match Point and yet it all works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humor fits perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman the suspected serial killer.This is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch. The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself. I say give it a chance because you just might like it.".

She's helped by stage magician Sid Waterman Woody Allen who doesn't like what he sees.I like this better than the over rated Match Point from last year. It was shorter and moved much more quickly. The plot is old but I was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end. It's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines all from Allen of course. It's not one of Allen's best but it's far better than his worst.The acting is for the most part very good. Allen is bad but he's played this character a million times before and it's gotten tiresome. But Johansson and Jackman are just greatthey look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances. Also Allen surprisingly works on their sex appealthere is a sequence where they're both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies. The only real debit is that Allen still seems unsure on how to shot London. He's not as off as he was on Match Point thoughmaybe he'll just get better as he goes along.Worth seeing. I give it an 8.".

Little did we suspect that we were in for a harrowing experience. I'm not exaggerating. Ten minutes into the movie we were so embarrassed by what we were seeing that we considered leaving the theater. We stayed only out of respect for the director whom we all love so much.I'm not going to go into all the flaws of this atrocious film you can read the reviews elsewhere. The main problem is not the plot which is nothing more than a halfhearted rehash of the excellent Manhattan murder mystery and Match point. It's not that the movie is unfunny and boring which is also painfully true. The problem is that the directing and especially THE ACTING are so poor that the experience is as unbearable as hearing a piece of music played by outoftune instruments. Really it would be hard to find worse acting and directing in any zmovie to come out in the last 10 years.It is totally baffling that someone with the comedic timing and genius of Woody Allen could direct this piece of crap. I still cannot understand it GO AND SEE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!".

	schema:headline " A Small Valentine";
	schema:reviewBody "Woody is such an accomplished filmmaker with such a stable production crew that he can toss off a movie essentially an appreciative valentine to a young woman  he can do this quickly and still imbue it with more grace than most.In this project the basic cinematic values are merely satisfactory. I assume he just lets the crew take the most economical approach to capturing a scene. The blocking and coverage is predictable. The use of London has less texture than his treatments of Manhattan.The story is where the magic is. Sure he has a few good lines funny ones. And sure the two lovers are appealing enough. But take a look at the very idea of the thing. It springs from the idea of a 30's newspaper movie and their strong woman reporters. Several are mentioned.But our girl is intended to be less deliberately less by reference. Its rather amazing how Woody has started with the character and created a whole pretend world whose primary gravity is to place her vulnerable sexuality at the center. He reminds us by having a preface where she sleeps with an older man a filmmaker she has encountered.Against this newspaper device he layers some others associated with writing on reality apparently pulled from his mind arbitrarily. A stage magician whose magic works in an unexpected way. The mechanics of death that is temporarily defeated by the desire to tell a story. The device of the tarot cards and the musical instruments in a vault rather than being played.This IS minor Woody. He clearly has movies he works on and deepen beyond what we see and other movies which are a sort of celebration of the immediate imagination.Still worth watching. And Ms Scarlett is fetching in just the space he made for her.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " London murder mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "Something happens to Sondra Pransky when she enters the magician's box on the stage of a London theater. Little does Sondra know the spirit of newly departed journalist Joe Strombel materializes to ask her to investigate the man someone has told him on his voyage to another dimension is the infamous Tarot killer that has been on a binge of crime in London. The only problem is the man accused is for all appearances a respectable upper class man.When Sondra tells her experience to the Great Splendini who is a.k.a. Sid Waterman the magician is stunned but decides to go along. The two would be P.I.s conjure an invitation to a club where Peter Lyman goes to swim. Sondra who fakes she is drowning catches the attention of this hunk who wants to see more of her.Needless to say the two of them will get into all kinds of funny situations until the mystery is revealed at the end of the film. Little does the real Tarot killer think he can fool a resolute Sondra who proves herself to be more resourceful than he gave her credit for.The result is a perfect summer film with a lot of laughs that is just what one needs to get out of the heat into a perfect time in a cool theater. Woody Allen has done better and yet this sunny comedy will vindicate him for past failures. In Scoop Mr. Allen has taken himself from the romantic lead pawing his gorgeous leading lady. His trade mark gesticulating is something this funny man will never get rid of since it appears to be his trade mark. The film has some funny one liners that will go over the head of the viewers that might not be paying attention.Scarlett Johansson the beautiful star of Scoop seems to be the perfect foil for Woody Allen. She plays the straight part while Mr Allen does his shtick a perfect combination. Both are excellent in their banter throughout the film. Ms. Johansson is a knockout beauty in her red bathing suit although they have dressed her so dowdy in most of the costumes she wears on the screen. Hugh Jackman is seen as Peter Lyman a sophisticated man about town with the right pedigree. He makes a good appearance in the movie as the man pursuing Ms. Johansson. Ian McShane plays the dead Fleet Street journalist on his way to eternity.Scoop is a light film for the hot and humid summer thanks to Woody Allen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh my god! Wood Allen is not funny. I like and can appreciate virtually all types of humor and just listening to him makes me cringe. I actually had to not watch him while he talked so I could get through the movie. Maybe if there was just a tiny bit of him in it it would not have been completely unbearable but he sucks the life out of this movie. Everything he says is totally predictable and there was only one thing I thought was marginally funny. I know it's his shtick but that endless stammering and then.....payoff...the same joke again and again and again! Wow what a genius! And his fakey dialog and bad acting are catching. Scarlett J was twitchy and unbelievable in every scene with him. Hugh Jackman gave an Academy Award performance in comparison. He was horribly out of place because he could actuntil the end at least. He must have just given up by the time it was filmed. What an awful movie.".

Allen's routine bored the socks off me and the acting was routinely terrible.The script was complete tosh so the poor actors had nothing to chew on. The rest of the time Allen was hogging the screen with his stupid routine.London has seldom been used so poorly with a couple of dreadful backdrops that were so obvious it looked like it was made in the 1950's.What on earth was Allen thinking of this was awful.brendan".
