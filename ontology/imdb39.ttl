Let's start with the soundtrack  an amazing selection of songs that you can only find on the incredibly rare OST. And then the stunts  a serious amount of awe for the talent of the stunt experts showing off their stuff. I will confess that some of the lame jokes still even rise a laugh from me  as do some of the antics of the teams in the race.So  if you want a fun stunt film with great music this is an enjoyable watch.

I have seen this movie about 10 times now and i can safely say that this movie is in my top 1.5.In my many viewings i have discovered several nifty tricks to make this wonderful movie experience just a tad better. For example playing Uncle Kracker's follow me backwards while the voiceover is going on in the intro will do wonders! Try it! Also replacing all the dialog except the before mentioned catchphrase of course with horrible screams will really enhance this epic tale. After seeing this for the first time you might be skeptic about the fact that anything could be improved and frankly you're right. Still test these suggestions before blindly discarding them.Now go watch it! And then again afterwards!".

It obviously really suffers from its low budget. It's an European coproduction that's still entirely English spoken but it remains one with a European and particular an Italian style to it. No wonder since the director Duccio Tessari is an Italian. It has a cheap look and feel to it but it still adds a certain charm to the movie as well.It's a movie that is also being a typical late '60's'70's crime movie filled with money pretty girls fast cars gun fights backstabbing characters and a story of a man seeking revenge. A movie in the vain of Steve McQueen's The Getaway to name an example. Not saying that this movie is still as good though of course but if you like this sort of movies made during that particular time period chances are you'll like I bastardi as well.Another reason why this movie will appeal to certain people is its cast. It stars Klaus Kinski for instance who is being deliciously villainous and is really playing a great role. Much better than main lead Giuliano Gemma who I believe also got dubbed though it's hard to tell since the sound quality of this movie isn't all that great and Italian productions at the time always got shot without sound and the actors would later do all of their lines in a studio. But the movie also stars big '40's star Rita Hayworth. I had never seen her as an 'elderly' woman. Sort of bad she had to end her wonderful career with these obscure sort of movies even though this movie most definitely is not a bad one.It's sort of too bad that the movie is lacking in true excitement and enough action. It would had make the movie such a better one to watch and with a bigger budget they would also mostly most certainly come up with a far better and more spectacular ending as well. Really the ending instead now is really random and cheap and even made me laugh at how silly it was.

Or maybe it's their whiskey chugging mother Hayworth who is totally out of it when it comes to her two sons trying to kill each other.Even though it's set in modern America there's a whole Spaghetti Western feel about the plot as Guiliano is betrayed and crippled by his brother who instructs doctor Umberto Raho to surgically sever tendons in his arm so he can't shoot anymore and Guiliano is taken in by a pretty ranch owner Auger who nurses him back to health. There's a growing romance between the two but Guiliano just can't let go of the past getting ready for revenge by using a harp as target practice. Which is a strange choice when you think about it. Hey Claudine you got any bottles I can shoot? No just use on of the spare harps I've got.In tone this one isn't too far removed from the midseventies Eurocrime films with the gun violence car chases and sexy deadly ladies and Duccio Tessari sure has a certain visual style that keeps things alive. There's a complete 'Eh?' moment very late in the film that comes out of nowhere but that just adds to the general mean tone of the film. Man the good Eurocrime films far outweigh the bad ones.

I saw it tonight at the Annual Fairy Tales Queer Film Festival in Calgary Canada. This a mild tragedy of a 22 year old gender confused but totally innocent and inexperienced F to M person leading a double life whose colleagues and family are unaware that their dear friend and sister is transgendered. She fakes heterosexual love affairs while doubling as a boy in love with an essentially innocent 14 year old girl played by Lucie Hollmann. Except for a 5 second distance shot there is no nudity and no nudity whatsoever of Ms. Hollman. The film is about dealing with taboos and discoveries and in many ways a tragic tear jerker. You actually feel for this couple who cannot continue. This film will be of interest to both straight and GLTG viewers alike. It is a love tragedy like no other but nonetheless uses classic Greek techniques. Even Nietzsche would approve.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mein Freund aus Faro or To Faro or Mel  Jenny is a German movie that is also almost exclusively in the German language. This came out back in 2008 so it will have its 10th anniversary next year and it is by far the most known work by writer and director Nana Neul. This 87minute film scored a pretty decent deal of awards recognition back then which made me a bit curious about it to be honest. And still my expectations weren't too high which is why as a consequence I was pretty positively surprised. This has a lot to do with lead actress Anjorka Strechel who does not only exactly look the part but also gives a performance that certainly can be considered one of Germany's finest from 2008. It really is pretty shocking that apparently she did not receive any awards recognition as it all went to Neul for the film itself. Anyway it's a good film so I don't mind it. I am also a bit surprised that neither Strechel nor her colead Lucie Hollmann managed a big breakthrough in the last decade. Instead the more known names from this film today are still the supporting players like Cortez Panzner Prckner and Dychauk. I will admit though that I was especially positively surprised in Manuel Cortez' case as I have seen him in quite a bit of other stuff and he never stroke me as remotely talented to be honest. But maybe this role here was just perfect for him. He certainly nailed it. There are some film's weaknesses in the last half hour I guess for example with all the drama in there not all felt authentic to be honest and some of it was also over the top but it's not so bad that it hurts everything before that. The successful stone throw also was a bit on the unrealistic side and honestly this is a bit of a problem even if it is just minor scenes like that one because this film goes 100 for realism and honestly Neul did a fairly good job in making an admittedly not too realistic plot the two Miguels still come off as pretty authentic and that's quite an achievement that one can be proud of. On a more positive note I quite enjoyed the ending to be honest. As for the undressing scene that exposes the truth I am not sure if I liked it. Sure it makes sense from the perspective that the central character just had to find another way as she was not able to express her identity through words but if that was the right choice I am not sure because it is full exposure and before that she managed no exposure at all to anybody really. To end the review on a more positive note I want to say that I liked the very ending quite a bit too because it was nice they did not include a forced superhappy ending where the two are a couple but one that makes much more sense and feels closer to reality and is still somewhat a feelgood ending somehow I guess with the other girl asking the central character if she is gonna write her. There are so many really weak films especially in the short film genre that focus on homosexuality these days that lose themselves in clumsy sex scenes and unrealistic events while not managing at all to be a good character study of any kind. This one here shows these untalented filmmakers how it is to be done. I applaud everybody working on this movie especially Neul and Strechel and I recommend checking it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Coen brothers are known for being one of the best filmmakers of our time. They both compliment each other perfectly. When I heard they were remaking the 1969 John Wayne classic True Grit I was extremely excited and had incredibly high expectations of the film. Being a major fan of Western movies I was really interested how it would turn out. I wanted the movie to be more faithful to it's original source material Charles Portis novel than the 1969 film had been. I was also hopeful that Jeff Bridges would fill the huge shoes of the classic legendary John Wayne. I was hoping that they would blend the humor of the original 1969 film with some of the suspense or thrills from earlier Coen brothers films like No Country For Old Men or Fargo. But not become way too violent that it causes to stay completely unrecognizable to Charles Portis classic novel. After seeing the Coen brothers new film I have to say. My extremely high expectations were surpassed. The movie actually surprised all the hype I had what an incredible film. The atmosphere clothing and the buildings reminded me of the old classic Hollywood westerns they used to make. I had a feeling of nostalgia watching the movie through the end. I felt transported to another time period of the old western. Hailee Steinfeld was amazing in the movie I truly believe that this is her breakout performance. Matt Damon and Josh Brolin were as usual amazing. But the true star of the film has to be Jeff Bridges in all respects  I don't mean to offend John Wayne or anything I think Jeff Bridges did a better job than John Wayne in portraying Rooster Cogburn. His performance showed much more experience strength and power the performance was pretty much unforgettable. Jeff Bridges handily reinvents the iconic role of Rooster Cogburn in the Coen brothers' backtothebookremake. I congratulate the Coen for bringing back the western genre that Hollywood has ignored so much the last decade or so. I can't stress enough how much I recommend this movie to people.".

	schema:headline " Good ol' fashioned storytelling";
	schema:reviewBody "As is to be expected the film has all the classic Coen flourishes first and foremost its use of language. The Coens have always been impeccably tuned in to language and accents from the most creative use of swear words in The Big Lebowski and Burn After Reading to the colorful stylized prose of The Hudsucker Proxy and The Man Who Wasn't There to the very distinct accents in Raising Arizona Fargo O Brother Where Art Thou? and No Country for Old Men. In classic Coen fashion the use of language is very much emphasized in True Grit. The characters have a very distinct use of words lifted right out of the novel and as it feels at least right out of the time period the film takes place in. Unlike something like Deadwood which features a very modernized and stylized version of 18th century speak the dialogue in True Grit sounds completely authentic and along with the impeccable and accuratefeeling costume and set design really adds to the realism of the world True Grit creates. Accents are also very important  the harsh Southern drawl that the Coens have always been attracted to is very prominent and plays a very large role in the film.As has become expected of the brothers especially in recent years the film looks incredibly beautiful mainly thanks to regular DP Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography. All of his trademarks are in place harsh but very naturalistic lighting washedout colors especially in the outdoor scenes smooth camera movements and just a generally beautiful palette he uses to paint the world of the film with. Also very prominent in the film is the beautiful score by Carter Burwell. It hearkens back to his more melodic work on the Coen brothers' earlier films especially Miller's Crossing. Using themes from classic hymns from the time period of the film the soundtrack along with the language of the dialogue helps add a very strong feeling of authenticity to the film. It is a beautiful piece of music dramatic but not heavy handed whimsical but with a hint of darkness to it. These two longtime Coen collaborators as well as the costume and set designers with whom the Coens have also worked with many times before all deliver topnotch work and show once again just how strong the power of longterm collaboration can be.Other returning collaborators are a number of the cast members. The Coens seem to have grown distant from most of their longtime regular cast members Jon Polito John Turturro John Goodman Steven Buscemi and others but Coen regulars still make appearances in some of their recent work. In this case it is The Dude Lebowski himself Jeff Bridges who makes his triumphant return in a Coen brothers film filling the very large shoes of John Wayne who gave an iconic performance as Rooster Cogburn in the first adaptation of True Grit from 1969. Bridges brings his own unique style and sensibilities to the role combining his drunken goofiness with the demeanor of a serious and very skilled hunter and lawman. It is a wonderful performance playing to all of Bridges' best abilities as an actor and it is just a joy to watch. Also playing to his best qualities is Matt Damon who delivers one of the loosest and most fun performances of his career as Texas Ranger LaBoeuf or La Beef as he is referred to by himself as well in the film. Damon is clearly having fun with the role although like Bridges he too manages to find a very excellent balance between the humor and the seriousness and skill his character has. But the standout performance has to be newcomer Hailee Steinfeld who beat out 15000 other girls for the part. Open casting calls often provide disappointing results as nonprofessional actors tend to be just that  not professional. 14yearold Steinfeld proves she is a talent to watch though  she totally commands the screen with her strongwilled stubborn character and manages to hold her own against Bridges Damon and Josh Brolin who makes a brief but memorable appearance later in the film. It is a fantastic powerful performance that is an absolute joy to watch. I foresee great things from Steinfeld in the future.Many people will be turned off by the straightforwardness of the storytelling in True Grit. I have already heard complaints that the film lacks poignancy. But that isn't what it lacks. What it lacks is irony. It's actually quite amazing to see a film so completely and utterly devoid of irony such as this one  it seems like most films these days including the Coen brothers' recent output all carry this air of cynicism about them. True Grit hearkens back to a more classic form of plot and characterdriven storytelling and in that sense it succeeds immensely. Ultimately True Grit is a piece of pure entertainment  and it is quite an entertaining film thrilling engaging and very very funny. I have read many opinions claiming that this doesn't feel like a Coen brothers film but its storytelling style and techniques actually remind me most of another classic Coen film Miller's Crossing. That film was also completely stripped of irony and instead focused on telling a good oldfashioned yarn nothing more nothing less. So while True Grit is not one of the very best films in the Coen's oeuvre it is still just a darn good film overall.".

The acting was unbelievable as you'd expect from such established accomplished thespians but Hailee Steinfeld was a revelation holding her own if not carrying the entire film on her relatively small shoulders. The Brothers Coen have justified their choice to adapt Charles Portis' novel not remake the John Wayne classic. The impact and visceral reality of life in such places and times coupled with the abrupt brutal violence is something you didn't fully grasp in the grandstanding heroics of the 1969 version. I applaud the Coens for exercising restraint and understatement to allow the scenes and the situations to breathe and take there natural course. Overall it was an amazing cinematic experience that truly transports the viewer to a very real and fully realized time and space that crackles with fire and true grit.".

The impact and visceral reality of life in such places and times coupled with the abrupt brutal violence is something you didn't fully grasp in the grandstanding heroics of the 1969 version. I applaud the Coens for exercising restraint and understatement to allow the scenes and the situations to breathe and take there natural course. Overall it was an amazing cinematic experience that truly transports the viewer to a very real and fully realized time and space that crackles with fire and true grit.";

	schema:reviewBody "Few directors working today in America have mastered form like the Coens I discover this with every new film they make. True Grit is a commercial film made to please but I don't see a compromise in the making and it's still a distinctly Coen film if you pay notice. Try to take out the Coen character from the film and the film breaks apart it's that tightly woven in the fabric of it.A Coen film works for me in the face of it but I'm always on the lookout for what goes on behind for the unseen cogs that grind out the fates of their characters. As with No Country I came to this film looking to see is there a statement on violence does it happen in a certain way and is the universe indifferent to it is life worth a damn?This one here works very much like the Henry Hathaway film from '69 except everyone's better where John Wayne played a character Jeff Bridges plays a man and even Barry Pepper betters my beloved Robert Duvall's turn as Ned Pepper. This probably won't do it for Jeff Bridges because we've been accustomed to expect a certain degree of pofaced seriousness from a great performance he snarled and staggered in Crazy Heart but he was serious about it but he's one of the great actors of our times and I find this again in his Rooster Cogburn. Clint Eastwood also fell from a horse in Unforgiven and couldn't shoot a tin can to save his soul but Munny was a scumbag Cogburn still is and I like that. I like the courtroom scene where it's gradually revealed that he won't only bushwack those he needs to bring to justice he will lie to make himself out to be the hero.Another interesting aspect here is how the concept of the gunslinger and the western with it has evolved. When John Wayne played Cogburn in the Hathaway film the reward for the audience was the smirk of watching John Wayne be that drunken failure. The casting mattered in our appreciation. In the remake most comments seem to point out that it's a fairly traditionalentertaining western. The dastardly revisit of something that was revisionist in the 70's oddly seems to give in our day a traditional western. We've been accustomed to heroes who are not heroes and maybe the erosion of that heroic archetype says something about the way we view the world now as opposed to 3040 years ago. Then we were beginning to realize that wars are not gloriously justly won but survived and endured now we know there is no clear struggle between dual opposites and have grown disenchanted as that knowledge has failed to prevent the same wars. Now we know there is stuff about the legends that don't make the print or we are suspicious enough about legends to imagine them.Is this a traditional western then? Watching True Grit through the eyes of the brass 14yo girl reminded me of Winter's Bone another film from the same year. In both cases a young girl is determined to plunge herself in a dark world of hurt and walk a path fraught with perils on all sides to achieve a moral purpose both films maintain an appearance of realism but what I get from them is a magical fantasy. This becomes more apparent when Mattie falls in the snakepit but what about the hanged men who are really hanged high? The Hathaway film ostensibly based on the same material missed that note and played out a straight western. The Coen film unfolds as a hazy dream of that West. Although I wished for more open landscapes it makes sense then that film narrows our gaze and clouds the margins. Perhaps we are even seeing the film as Mattie relives the experience in her old age an affair shaped by memory and time.This is the marvellous touch effected by the Coens on the material the minute recreation of the Old West as a historical place and the odd incongruous moments found within it annihilate any authority over the material.The epilogue is important in that aspect.It's not only that Mattie's revenge didn't accomplish anything that it was for her merely another practical inconvenience to be bargained paid for and settled like her father's ponies and saddle or the service of the US Marshall before but that she clings to the memory of it so fiercely. What's horrifying then is not so much the violence of the West but the idealization of that violence. The film closes in a time around the turn of the century people like Cogburn roosted in Wild West shows for a cheering audience and Mattie is one of the people who lived to tell the tales. Out of those tales the western of John Ford and Raoul Walsh emerged to print the legend. In a roundabout fantastic way the Coens give us the true account the creation myth behind the western.".

	schema:reviewBody "True Grit is not a remake but a reimagining. Narrated by Mattie Ross played by Hailee Steinfeld who makes her feature film debut we find Mattie picking up the pieces following the death of her father at the hands of Tom Chaney Brolin. A headstrong girl Mattie isn't looking for a handout she's looking for justice. She is directed towards Rooster Cogburn Bridges a Federal Marshall whose reputation for shooting his prisoners makes him the right fit for Mattie's cause.She is discovered soon after by LaBoeuf Damon who is also looking for Chaney for a crime committed in Texas. Mattie's plan of riding off with Rooster and LeBoeuf are short lived when LaBoeuf refuses to go out into Indian territory with a girl. Rooster though reluctant at first escorts Mattie into the territory.Though I am not familiar with the novel with which it is based on I would say that the Coens have done the story justice. Though you can't replace John Wayne's take on Rooster Bridges gives a different more rugged approach to the character. It wasn't The Dude or Bad Blake from last year's Crazy Heart. He was Rooster Cogburn the way the Coens wrote it. He doesn't step on Wayne's toes but rather makes the character his own.One upgrade from the original film one of several was Damon's portrayal of LeBoeuf. In the original Glen Campbell played a much more cooperative LaBoeuf than Damon. Damon is more independent and clashes with Rooster more often. They're chemistry is much more believable and enjoyable.Another major upgrade is the music. Though the original has the classic big sweeping score by Elmer Bernstein that many westerns of the day were accustomed to it just didn't fit the story. It made is much lighter than it needed to be. Carter Burwell whose previous work for the Coens is simply sublime gives yet another stellar score creating just the right mood and tempo. Rooster's charge at the end is accompanied by a wonderful piece of music that brings you right in the saddle with Rooster gunsablazing hollering and rooting for the good guys. Burwell's sense of both the time period and the mood of the film couldn't have been better.Where would a Coen Brother's film be without some stunning visuals. Roger Deakins whose work is up there with the best of the day does a fantastic job capturing the sights of the wild west in a way that films of the 50s and 60s couldn't do. The way sunlight coats the landscape snow falling through the trees and the shadows of a flickering fire are just moments that stand out.Lastly we come to Joel and Ethan who might be the finest pair of filmmakers working today. They are gifted in telling a story with images and dialogue. Though not working with an original work still springs off of the screen. Not to mention the performances they get out of their cast is second to none. Everyone is on board for this picture and it shows.True Grit is a better film than the '69 version. The photography supporting cast and all around production is better. Still I have no doubt that Rooster Cogburn will be remembered as John Wayne I have to hand it to Jeff and the Coens for putting on a spectacular film both a delight for the eyes and ears.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's get the comparisons with Henry Hathaway's version of the Charles Portis novel out of the way. The Coen Brothers certainly knew that however much they want to 'go back to the source material' their film would play against Hathaway's version.The Hathaway version while tampering with details from the Portis original remains strikingly true to its story and theme. This is most clear in the dialog  the decision not to tamper with Portis' language was decisive for the making of that film. The Coens' tampering with the novel is more subtle than Hathaway's film but no less an interpretation.Approaching the characters and composition of the Coens' version without reference to the Hathaway film apparently proved impossible. For instance the shootout at the dugout cabin was rewritten for a nightscene but the camera angles remain pretty much the highelevation shots Lucien Ballard provided Hathaway intercut with full body shots of people getting wounded and horses running etc.also similar to Ballard's.Two performance stand out as striking examples of reference to the original film. Dakin Matthews seems to struggle mightily not to recreate Strother Martin's interpretation of the horsetrader Stonehill  and fails. Apparently Martin had the character down pat and there's nothing but to reproduce his interpretation. Far more to the point is Barry Pepper's interpretation of the desperate outlaw chief Ned Pepper  it is pure Robert Duvall. Pepper can only match Duvall's selfaware determination  and he does  but he can't surpass it nor can he find another interpretation to set off against Duvall's.As for the Coens' own reinterpretation of the Portis novel what was most noticeable to me were the minor points simply dropped out of the story telling. The most irritating to me were a pair of lapses that are interconnected and combine to make an important point about the characters. 1. We never get to see Mattie tell Rooster that Chaney has linked up with Ned Pepper later Rooster does remark the fact but how did he learn of it? 2 We don't get to hear Rooster's remarking how he shot Pepper through the upper lip because he was aiming at the lower lip. These two incidents combine to let the audience know that Cogburn's hidden agenda on the Chaney hunt is really Ned Pepper he and Pepper have something of a feud going on  which information fills out the background detail for their final shootout. Except here we don't have that connection.Finally the whole Mattie  Rooster issue many critics are saying that Mattie is more at the center here than in the Hathaway picture which focused attention on John Wayne's Cogburn. Not true. When we add up screen time and lines of dialog we discover that Mattie not only has as much time and dialog in the Hathaway film but it is in much the same proportion to Cogburn's as in this one. If most remember the Hathaway film as a 'John Wayne film' that is due simply to Wayne's bravura performance.Well enough of the comparisons. Does the Coens' version measure up as film worth seeing on its own accord? Yes we are presented here with a beautiful frightening amusing piece of 'Americana.' There are scenes approaching dreamlike states as in the meeting with the bearman and during Rooster's desperate drive to get Mattie to a doctor. Hailee Steinfeld is quite engaging and Matt Damon develops an intriguing complexity that makes one wish he had more screentime. Bridges' performance is the most problematic  Bridges plays Cogburn as a a kind of whimsical brute  as he rambles on with his lifestory on the trail we get the gnawing sense that if we were not along for a dangerous manhunt and dependent on his abilities as a master manhunter Cogburn would be someone we would not like to know. This develops a distance between the audience and Cogburn that is actually rather on par for the Coens  there are no 'heros' in the Coen universe.Perhaps that's a good thing here. Mattie in her experiences with the wild men of the old west has encountered something larger than her life on the farm could ever get her. These are men who make their own laws and are not bound to statutory codes or biblical decrees and adapt their own law to the wilds of the frontier that surrounds them. Mattie is a confirmed churchgoer with a good lawyer and if she weren't so determined on her revenge she would actually be impossibly smallminded and dull. This is a subtext to the novel that both films attempt to convey but neither quite captures because it's difficult for any film maker to admit that the central character of the story is the least interesting.The age of such wildmen has passed. It is not that wildmen do not exist  wildmen show up quite frequently in Coen Brothers' films in contemporary settings  but now they are corrupted by moving outside the law and outside the commonplace they grow sick and psychopathic. The killer in Fargo feeding the partner he's killed to a woodchipper is as wild as one could get but he is no longer larger than life and evokes only the sickness at the heart of modernity not any adaptation one would want to live with.We look back at historical moments like those of the Old West because anything seemed possible to them whereas very little is possible for us. But that might simply be a wishful delusion  and the Coens' clear suspicion that it is really determines the limits of what they accomplish here. They don't present the West as 'it really was' nor do they present what we want from it rather they present a disappointment with it. Rooster Cogburn is indeed 'larger than life' but we wouldn't want to spend any more time with him than we do.".

Bridges' performance is the most problematic  Bridges plays Cogburn as a a kind of whimsical brute  as he rambles on with his lifestory on the trail we get the gnawing sense that if we were not along for a dangerous manhunt and dependent on his abilities as a master manhunter Cogburn would be someone we would not like to know. This develops a distance between the audience and Cogburn that is actually rather on par for the Coens  there are no 'heros' in the Coen universe.Perhaps that's a good thing here. Mattie in her experiences with the wild men of the old west has encountered something larger than her life on the farm could ever get her. These are men who make their own laws and are not bound to statutory codes or biblical decrees and adapt their own law to the wilds of the frontier that surrounds them. Mattie is a confirmed churchgoer with a good lawyer and if she weren't so determined on her revenge she would actually be impossibly smallminded and dull. This is a subtext to the novel that both films attempt to convey but neither quite captures because it's difficult for any film maker to admit that the central character of the story is the least interesting.The age of such wildmen has passed. It is not that wildmen do not exist  wildmen show up quite frequently in Coen Brothers' films in contemporary settings  but now they are corrupted by moving outside the law and outside the commonplace they grow sick and psychopathic. The killer in Fargo feeding the partner he's killed to a woodchipper is as wild as one could get but he is no longer larger than life and evokes only the sickness at the heart of modernity not any adaptation one would want to live with.We look back at historical moments like those of the Old West because anything seemed possible to them whereas very little is possible for us. But that might simply be a wishful delusion  and the Coens' clear suspicion that it is really determines the limits of what they accomplish here. They don't present the West as 'it really was' nor do they present what we want from it rather they present a disappointment with it. Rooster Cogburn is indeed 'larger than life' but we wouldn't want to spend any more time with him than we do.";

It was amazing highly entertaining suspenseful funny and had a great story line. Jeff Bridges was fantastic as was Matt Damon. Josh Brolin was good too the only problem is I didn't get to see enough of him. He is definitely an up and coming actor that I hope to see more of. However the best acting in the entire film was done by Hailee Steinfeld. Hailee plays the role of Mattie Ross and she is incredible. She really is 14 and held her own with the likes of Damon Bridges and Brolin. This film was an excellent western and comedy. There were several times that the theater was filled with laughter. I will definitely see this film again and may even purchase the DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't get me wrong True Grit is a good movie. In a time when most films seen in cinemas are made for teenagers it can appeal to anybody regardless of age. The gunfights not much and talking a lot give it a nice pace that keeps you on the edge of your seat while not being chaotic enough to confuse your father.Mattie Ross is a 14year old girl who gets a US Marshal Rouben Rooster Cogburn Jeff Bridges to help her track down and bring to justice her fathers killer Brolin. Tom Chaney is also pursued by a Texas Ranger by the name of LaBeouf Matt Damon who wants to punish him for the crimes committed by him back in Texas.Spoilers start here i guess. While the movie starts at slow and a little bit annoying pace it soon picks up after our unlikely team leaves town. The director was obviously well aware of the saying that chasing a hare isn't about catching it but about the chase itself. True Grit makes you want to catch Tom Chaney along with it's heroes but when they do actually get him it does not give you the expected satisfaction. That is weird because the character was obviously supposed to be given a personality. When he talks to Mattie you might even reconsider thinking about him as the bad guy  The bandits have emotions and Tom gets desperate after his team leaves him. But then he quickly reverts to his I'm this pictures' villain! pose tries to kill the girl and gets shot. Boom that's it. Not even any last words that would make him more human and less twodimensional. Nope. He gets shot point blank with a rifle. That's it. The force of the bullet causes him to fall off a cliff Not very naturally too and that is the last time you see him. Did he have a personality? Or was he just trying to get Mattie to lower her guard? We'll never know.Then suddenly a plot hole appears! It seems Mattie and Rooster have to leave LaBeouf because he DOESN'T HAVE A HORSE! Yup that's right. It doesn't matter much that he just shot a bandit off a mount 400 yards away and that the horse is still standing there saddled and ready. No. Instead Rooster and Mattie now bitten by a handy plot device rattlesnake! ride her horse to death and end up in a middle of a field. Cogburn a weak old man then proceeds to carry the girl in a scene that was surely envisioned as touching but still makes you wonder about why exactly didn't they take the horse with them or LaBeouf for that matter. If you can ignore some plot points that don't feel right and the general lack of soundtrack in most scenes you will find yourself captivated by the plot of True Grit a motion picture that is by no means mediocre. Great acting skills of not only the main characters but supporting cast such small roles as Dakin Matthews who argues with Mattie about a price of a horse make it a memorable experience that I will be happy to watch again some time. You will enjoy it as long as your expectations aren't too high.".

	schema:reviewBody "Henry Hathaway directed True Grit in 1969 a routine western with a memorable performance by John Wayne as bastard gunslinger Rooster Coburn. The Coen brothers remade True Grit in 2010. That film went on to become their biggest box office hit.Much of the new Grit's financial success  it took over 200 million dollars at the ticket booths  had to do with the name Rooster Cogburn having a certain brand recognition. Indeed polls show much of the film's box office being down to old timers visiting cinemas in droves desperate to catch a glimpse of the new John Wayne. Cogburn himself is like Dirty Harry and Paul Kersey the kind of vengeful idiotic super rightwing American hero who shoots first and asks questions later. He's the likable bastard who embodies the American desire for swift frontier justice. It's no surprise that President Nixon adored the original Grit and wrote a loving letter to Wayne praising his performance. Cogburn fits Nixon's fantasy image of himself the outlaw lawman an American hero who righteously endures a little White Man's Burden a little barbarism and blame so that order is restored and wrongs are made right. No surprise too that the original Grit was released at the height of the Vietnam War its shoot first fix things later plot tapping into a kind of cosy fascism.So much of Grit's boxoffice seems down to nostalgic Americans looking to reconnect to some more Dirty Harry mythology. Like Scorsese's Cape Fear another remake which was praised by critics became the director's highest grossing film and which time revealed to be total crap Grit perhaps also marks the point at which the Coens moved from being outsiders to insiders. No longer cult filmmakers they're now fully embraced by younger generations. Cue money prestige and much awards.Both Grits are based on a novel by Charles Portis and both tell a fairly straightforward tale in which a young girl Mattie sets out to avenge the murder of her father. Seeking help she hires Rooster Cogburn  played by Jeff Bridges in this readaptation  a harddrinking Federal Marshal who prides himself on his ruthlessness. By the readaptation's end we learn a message typical of the western genre an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind and revenge takes its toll on the body and the soul.If you've seen the 1969 film then the Coens' take is dull as hell. Virtually every scene is the same the plot unchanged and most sequences replicated without an ounce of imagination or surprise. Whilst the Coens' remake of The Ladykillers was zany enough to warrant viewing Grit's is a decidedly pointless affair every scene matching Henry Hathaway's merely competent direction blow for blow.Even if you haven't seen the 1969 film this is a subpar western. The Coen's fail to convincingly evoke the feel tone and expansiveness of the West and for a film called True Grit the flick is surprisingly spotless with slick CGI towns CGI horses clean well starched clothes and supremely selfconscious dialogue. Unable to conjure up novel images the Coens like Tarantino also find themselves playing formalist games with words manicuring every line of dialogue and going to pains to remove all contractions simple folk of the era used more contractions than we do now.Bizarrely the Coen's Grit is typically treated as a serious and authentic western. But like Fargo Grit is a genre game pretending to be serious but played entirely for laughs. Portis was himself a precursor to postmodernists like the Coens and his novel was itself a work of satire Portis formalizing western conventions to the point of absurdity. With his flamboyant and purposefully convoluted dialogue comic business and deadpan humour Portis took a century of Wild West writing and played prose games with the pieces. But it's been half a century since Portis the genre now toyed with so much and the era of sincerity long gone that modern consumers sadly mistake the Coens' dry retelling as being earnest and Portis' prose as being canonical. But how could anyone miss Barry Pepper's deadpan mimicking of Robert Duvall from Hathaway's film and the film's cast of dimwits and buffoons? More than most Coen brothers flicks True Grit is very verbose packed with long winded dialogue a kind of hillbilly Tarantino speak a guy falls down says I am severely injured or flowery showing off. As for Cogburn the Coens erase Hathaway's reactionary ideology almost completely. Where Hathaway offered a traditional revenge movie the Coens are bound to postVietnam genre revisionism. Mattie thus goes through a watered down version of Bill Munny's transformation in Unforgiven another supposedly anti violence anti revenge Western. Elsewhere the film's revengehunt themes are treated rather superficially see the westerns of Budd Boetticher Anthony Mann even offbeat westerns like Rancho Notorious and The Bravados Mattie looks like she stepped out of a comicbook not a world which forged a heart of hate.Of course Bridges is a better actor than Wayne but his character is nevertheless less interesting and his relationship with Mattie less compelling. Wayne was shown to be violent mean and alcoholic but his various ruminations about his wife and past were touching and earned our sympathy. In contrast Bridges' violence and alcoholism are undeveloped and he earns no sympathy. He's just another Coen yokel albeit with added screen time.6.510  Reflexive cinema squared behind its gloss this is arguably the worst Coen flick. Some great Jeff Bridges westerns Wild Bill and Bad Company. More interesting westerns Open Range Shotgun Stories Meek's Cutoff Lonestar Lonely are the Brave Altman's Buffalo Bill Mccabe and Mrs Miller Flesh and Bone 1993 Ride With the Devil Hombre Hud and The Long Riders.".

	schema:headline " True Grit 1969 versus 2010!";
	schema:reviewBody "Had the original 1969 production of True Grit never been made I would have said this new version is a pretty decent movie. HOWEVER not only have I seen both movies unlike most here I ACTUALLY READ THE BOOK by Charles Portis. Matt Damon admittedly never saw the original film and the Coen brothers apparently say they only saw it as kids. Quite intriguing since they supposedly wrote the screenplay and manage to match much of the original film's dialogue word for word. Additionally much of the acting here is nearly identicalVoice inflections and such. Hmmm.Right from the start when Mattie Ross started saying she had hired Rooster Cogburn to assist her I was eagerly anticipating the reincarnation of the Duke in some form from the great beyond. Seriously! What a disappointment! Jeff Bridges in an outhouse? Please!! While Jeff Bridges is a fine actor and his character here is quite interesting he just does not replace or improve on the original in any way. Not even remotely! He mumbles incessantly through his dialogue and never creates the picture of a character of True Grit. Here he is much more akin to Otis on The Andy Griffith Show as the town drunk.As far as being true to the original novelwhich has been stated frequently by the film's participants that is accurate only in the ending. The 2010 production does in fact follow the novel to its conclusion many years later. In reality though this adds little to the movie itself and in fact is a bit depressing. The book is not depressing. The original film ends on a cheerful note whereas this one follows through to the inevitable end of every person that ever lives. They die! However this has really nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie itself and adds nothing of worth.The original film is nearly word for word from the Portis' novel and has an absolutely outstanding conclusion. This new version is substantially less attached to Portis and ends poorly at best.The Coens change several scenes and even add new ones that have nothing whatsoever to do with the original book. NOTHING AT ALL! This would be OK except for the fact that they claim a close adaptation of the original novel. It is not and it adds nothing to improve the overall value of the movie.As far as the acting goes Hailee Steinfeld does a very commendable job of copying Kim Darby's nearly perfect performance. Unfortunately she is NOT nearly as good or even remotely as entertaining as the original. Not a chance! The other 2010 version cast members are as equally NOT GOOD! Comparing Strother Martin as Colonel Stonehill in the original to the new guy is not an option. Dennis Hopper as Moon Jeff Corey as Tom Chaney James Westerfield as Judge Parker and H.W. Gim as Chen Lee all added to the greatness of the original 1969 film. These were all great actors that added their touch to an outstanding John Wayne film. To attempt to compare the new Ned Pepper to the original performance by Robert Duvall is absurd. Even Glen Campbellwho was reamed as the original La Boeuf is FAR MORE INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING than Matt Damon's dull dull and flat disinterested performance.As intimidating an actor as was John Wayne he ALWAYS allowed his supporting cast to let loose with their own unique talents and it always was a great benefit to the final outcome. This is very much not in attendance in 2010. The supporting cast are in reality just reading old lines here as they come across as completely boring and this movie is just HORRIBLY DULL in comparison to 1969! Even the scenic shots from 41 years ago are far superior. Hard to believe this reality in the new world of digital technology.I really hesitate to compare Jeff Bridges to a guy who was a topif not always 1 box office draw for 5 straight decades30's through 70's because I nearly always enjoy watching Jeff Bridges. BUT in this case he is way out of his league. PERIOD! As far as the Coen brothers go for them to be able to come up with great films like Fargo and No Country For Old Men should also give them enough intuitive foresight to realize YOU DON'T MESS WITH CREATIVE PERFECTION! In regard to the executive producerSomeone who gets paid a substantial sum but does little elseSteven Spielberg needs to stick with Indiana Jones and ET. When it comes to great westerns you are NOT at all with the program.The original 1969 production of True Grit was a fun and highly entertaining film which is what movies are nearly always meant to be. ENTERTAINMENT! PERIOD! It is most worthy of historical significance in the archives of filmdom. To remake it with the intent of surpassing and basically spitting on the original production is the work of fools. Clearly the only object here is to make money. I'm sure they are very successful at that but it is most assuredly at the expense of a real work of art from long ago. See the original and dare to compare.".

Quite intriguing since they supposedly wrote the screenplay and manage to match much of the original film's dialogue word for word. Additionally much of the acting here is nearly identicalVoice inflections and such. Hmmm.Right from the start when Mattie Ross started saying she had hired Rooster Cogburn to assist her I was eagerly anticipating the reincarnation of the Duke in some form from the great beyond. Seriously! What a disappointment! Jeff Bridges in an outhouse? Please!! While Jeff Bridges is a fine actor and his character here is quite interesting he just does not replace or improve on the original in any way. Not even remotely! He mumbles incessantly through his dialogue and never creates the picture of a character of True Grit. Here he is much more akin to Otis on The Andy Griffith Show as the town drunk.As far as being true to the original novelwhich has been stated frequently by the film's participants that is accurate only in the ending. The 2010 production does in fact follow the novel to its conclusion many years later. In reality though this adds little to the movie itself and in fact is a bit depressing. The book is not depressing. The original film ends on a cheerful note whereas this one follows through to the inevitable end of every person that ever lives. They die! However this has really nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie itself and adds nothing of worth.The original film is nearly word for word from the Portis' novel and has an absolutely outstanding conclusion. This new version is substantially less attached to Portis and ends poorly at best.The Coens change several scenes and even add new ones that have nothing whatsoever to do with the original book. NOTHING AT ALL! This would be OK except for the fact that they claim a close adaptation of the original novel. It is not and it adds nothing to improve the overall value of the movie.As far as the acting goes Hailee Steinfeld does a very commendable job of copying Kim Darby's nearly perfect performance. Unfortunately she is NOT nearly as good or even remotely as entertaining as the original. Not a chance! The other 2010 version cast members are as equally NOT GOOD! Comparing Strother Martin as Colonel Stonehill in the original to the new guy is not an option. Dennis Hopper as Moon Jeff Corey as Tom Chaney James Westerfield as Judge Parker and H.W. Gim as Chen Lee all added to the greatness of the original 1969 film. These were all great actors that added their touch to an outstanding John Wayne film. To attempt to compare the new Ned Pepper to the original performance by Robert Duvall is absurd. Even Glen Campbellwho was reamed as the original La Boeuf is FAR MORE INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING than Matt Damon's dull dull and flat disinterested performance.As intimidating an actor as was John Wayne he ALWAYS allowed his supporting cast to let loose with their own unique talents and it always was a great benefit to the final outcome. This is very much not in attendance in 2010. The supporting cast are in reality just reading old lines here as they come across as completely boring and this movie is just HORRIBLY DULL in comparison to 1969! Even the scenic shots from 41 years ago are far superior. Hard to believe this reality in the new world of digital technology.I really hesitate to compare Jeff Bridges to a guy who was a topif not always 1 box office draw for 5 straight decades30's through 70's because I nearly always enjoy watching Jeff Bridges. BUT in this case he is way out of his league. PERIOD! As far as the Coen brothers go for them to be able to come up with great films like Fargo and No Country For Old Men should also give them enough intuitive foresight to realize YOU DON'T MESS WITH CREATIVE PERFECTION! In regard to the executive producerSomeone who gets paid a substantial sum but does little elseSteven Spielberg needs to stick with Indiana Jones and ET. When it comes to great westerns you are NOT at all with the program.The original 1969 production of True Grit was a fun and highly entertaining film which is what movies are nearly always meant to be. ENTERTAINMENT! PERIOD! It is most worthy of historical significance in the archives of filmdom. To remake it with the intent of surpassing and basically spitting on the original production is the work of fools. Clearly the only object here is to make money. I'm sure they are very successful at that but it is most assuredly at the expense of a real work of art from long ago. See the original and dare to compare.";

Far from it she recites her lines almost parrot fashion and without any true emotion.Secondly Jeff Bridges is totally miscast here. The accent he uses is often incomprehensible. And for much of the film he sounds like Karl Childers from Sling Blade.John Wayne's Rooster was a lovable rouge. Jeff's Rooster is a hobotype figure who looks like he pongs rotten. He too recites his lines as if he's reading directly from the script. Nothing likable about him one bit.I'm bored already writing about this film all except it's poop. Unbearably tiresome bleak vacant and stale.No wonder it won nothing at the Oscars. Finally the Panel saw sense to ignore it. So do yourself a favour and watch the 1960s version.".

It seems like this version was tailor made not for movie lovers but the short attention span crowd.

	schema:reviewBody "True Grit 2010 is a new film by Brothers Coen for which they wrote the screenplay based on the eponymous cult western novel by Charles Portis. The novel was first brought to screen back in 1969 with John Wayne as the eyepatched heavy drinking trigger happy US Marshall Reuben Rooster Cogburn in Fort Smith Arkansas 1877 the possessor of true grit who was hired by a 14 year old girl Mattie Ross to find the killer of her father and to bring him to justice. During the last two weeks I saw both films back to back and found them gripping entertaining and very well made.I did not read the Charles Portis' novel and I can't say I am a big westerns fan even though I've seen and enjoyed some of them but I am a longtime loyal fan of all things Coen and I did not miss a single one of their movies. I sincerely believe that the Coens do not make bad movies for the simple reason they don't know how. True Grit is their first Western and the first film since 2003 rated PG 13. For many fans that always wait impatiently for their next film the brothers' choice of the material was a surprise. Coens have only remade one film before True Grits The Ladykillers and they never made a pure western before but after watching True Grit it is perfectly clear that their latest film is a true Coens the western as only Ethan and Joel could have made it. According to Ethan Coen before the shooting started the Coens wanted to make a more faithful adaptation of the novel and to tell the story the way it was told in the book from the point of view of Mattie Ross the 14 years old girl who set her mind on hiring the right man for the job of finding and bringing to justice the murderer of her father. The newcomer Halee Steinfeld brings such incredible independence sharpness courage intellect and toughness to the character of Mattie that she more than holds on her own in the scenes she shares with the true starstalented actors such as Jeff Bridges Matt Damon Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper among others. As wonderful as these actors are this is HalleyMattie's film and she owns it from her first appearance.The Coens mentioned that the novel is tough violent and funny and that's how they wanted to adapt it to the screen. I believe that they achieved their goal because their adaptation of the novel is a true Coens very dark violent I personally could not watch the scene in the snakepit and had to turn away yet funny  thanks to another memorable performance from Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn and Coens 'unique dark humor which is in the dialogs and the characters' personalities. The screen chemistry among Bridges Steinfeld and Matt Damon as Texas Ranger who is also in search of Tom Chaney for another murder is very strong and watching three of them together is the viewers' delight. My only problem with the Bridges' performance is the way he speaks his lines. It was hard to understand what he was saying and some of the Coens'Portis' writings were lost on me. In this regard following John Wayne's Rooster was much easier.As always Coens' cooperation with the brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins produced the film of indescribable beauty and authentic atmosphere of the time long passed. The scene close to the end of the film where Rooster rushes on the horseback to get bitten by the deadly rattlesnake Mattie to the doctor as the day light changes to darkness and the huge surreal stars lit the sky is breathtaking and its beauty brought the tears to my eyes. It is without doubt the most memorable shot in the CoensDeakins movies for me. I realize that the awards may not be important in order to recognize and to admire Deakins' vision but it was upsetting to find out that in spite of having been behind the camera for dozens of the greatest films from over 20 years he has never been awarded the Oscar for his work. This is a criminal oversight from the Academy of Motion Pictures and I hope that he will be rewarded for his camerawork in True Grit.Some viewers and critics find he end of the film rushed and somehow abrupt. Wrong. It is a perfect ending to a perfect film besides it follows the novel's ending faithfully. It is different from more optimistic final of the older version but both finals fit their films very well.Renowned film critic Roger Ebert wrote about Ethan and Joel Coen's Fargo Films like Fargo are why I love the movies I would say it is true about every one of the Ethan and Joel Coens' films including the adaptation of True Grit.".

The man she hires is tough oneeyed US Marshall Reuben J. Rooster Cogburn Jeff Bridges a boozy lawman who is a law unto himself. Joined by Texas Ranger La Boeuf Matt Damon who also seeks Chaney for another crime the three of them head off into the Indian territory on a quest for justice. When news of a True Grit remake was announced it was met with the now standard grumbles that accompany any such news. Eyebrows were further raised when it was known that it would be the Coen brothers taking on the job of reworking the much loved but hardly a genre classic John Wayne starrer of 1969. After all who can forget their previous poor foray into remake territory with The Ladykillers 2004? But after the critical and financial success of their contemporary Western No Country for Old Men the source material for True Grit looked a nice fit for the Coen's and with them announcing they were to cleave close to Portis' novel hopes were high of a modern Western fit to sit alongside the likes of Unforgiven in terms of stature and widespread appeal. The film duly delivered. Even though the initial interest in the film was no doubt helped by the ever increasing fan base of the Coen's True Grit went on to be almost unanimously acclaimed by the critics making over 200 million in profit Worldwide and garnering 10 Academy Award nominations in the process. For once all the praise and back slapping is warranted.It's a film where everything just comes together because all the big decisions have been called correctly. From inspired casting technical prowess and the biggest decision of them all following the book and telling it from Mattie Ross' perspective True Grit is as close to perfection as a new millennium Western is going to get. The Coen's have managed to craft a classic old time Western rife with stock genre characters and infuse it with evocative beauty mythical tones and Biblical undercurrents. Not forgetting a narrative that is propelled forward by a revenge core and coming of age wonderment. The script pings with lyrical smarts that hark back to an era long since dead yet bringing with it an elegiac poeticism that plants us the viewers firmly in the period. Helps of course that the source story is so strong from which to launch such delights. Mattie Ross indomitable at 14 years of age is forced to grow up faster than should have been needed and story involves the critical passage of play in her life. Yet as she is awakened to the harsh realities of her era evidenced by the tragic murder of her father she also comes to see the flipside of bad humanity and it's this with Rooster Cogburn in tow that gives the film its key ingredient big heart. Come the emotional stirrings of the coda at the end of the film the heart is the organ that feels it the most.There are very few film fans who would deny Jeff Bridges his new found acceptance as a top draw actor here he cements his reputation with a wonderful turn as old rascal Cogburn. Wisely not channelling Duke Wayne's take on the role Bridges puts his own stamp on it playing it lovably slobbish and with a voice gravelled by many years of hard drinking and tobacco smoking. Once the layers start to come off after being exposed to Mattie Ross' courage and determination Bridges gives Rooster an emotional depth that didn't seem possible in the beginning. A double hander from Bridges the end result being a classic case of character acting. He is helped no end by the chemistry with Steinfeld who in light of it being her first big screen outing turns in an astonishingly mature performance. She gives Mattie a steely determination quick of mouth and mind yet always remaining one inch away from the melancholy brought about by the sudden change in life circumstance. It wouldn't have been hard for Damon to improve upon the inept performance of Glen Campbell as LaBoeuf in the 69 version but he plays off of Bridges with unassuming ease. Playing the cocky bravado and comedy at just the right tempo he knows just when to underplay the critical scenes. In support Brolin as Chaney is just dandy himself orally challenged while Barry Pepper himself a fine character actor turns in a memorable treat as scuzzy outlaw Lucky Ned Pepper.Rounding out the list of achievements is Roger Deakins and Carter Burwell's respective work. Both of whom are now well established as important pieces of weaponry in the Coen's armoury. With the Coen's favouring a Biblical tint to proceedings Burwell came up with the idea of playing on hymns and church like flecks to soundtrack the film. An unusual score it flows sweetly with the narrative. Most potent is the strains of Leaning on the Everlasting Arms used to form Mattie's theme fans of The Night of the Hunter will need no introduction to that particular piece. Deakins' photography is gorgeous and it's not just about capturing sprawling vistas either. His close photographing of bare trees and parched land is pin sharp in detail while the winter setting that dominates the last quarter lets him showcase the skill of lighting for best possible impact. More memorable though is his ability to utilise outdoor light for interior scenes. As touched upon in a sadly too small extra on the home format releases a court room scene has Rooster cloaked by shards of light giving him an aura of mysticism to the watching Mattie. A stunning piece of work in what all told is a stunning film. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "In what is only the fifth film of the Saw series released over its five year Halloween run at the box office this latest installation suffers from the same detrimental qualities that made number four slightly disappointing for fans and casual audiences alike. Making his directorial debut here all eyes are cast upon David Hackl to see if he can either bring something new or at least keep the momentum going for the popular franchise. The good news for some is that Saw V feels natural and consistent to its recent predecessors helmed by Bousman yet for many others this won't be something to get excited about. Insofar as the movie itself goes this is mostly typical Saw material throughout going through the motions almost. This of course will please those looking for a continuation of the previous instalments but it will undoubtedly feel too stagnant and jaded to interest anyone else. Nevertheless for his first feature film at the reins Hackl proves he can live up to Bousman's style that has been engrained in the series thus far creating yet another engaging and loyal sequel that will be sure to cater to those craving more twisted games.For many fans and casual watchers of the series Saw figuratively died when lead character and focus for the film Jigsaw Tobin Bell eventually succumbed to his cancer in film number three. Yet just as instalment IV managed to incorporate the mastermind into its story as does V in the same manner through flashbacks. Playing a game of two sides and narratives that eventually collide Saw V first and foremost continues on where we left from IV detailing the continuation of Jigsaw's work through forensics expert Hoffman and how he eventually has to tie up all loose ends regarding the deaths of those in III and IV. This narrative although a little tiresome in its approach of filling in every detail and hole in previous features nevertheless provides as the real meat of the script. Characters are again rather shallow and motives are less than clear yet much of this goes out the window when Mr. Bell graces the screen with his presence. As he has proved time and time again it is within the character of Jigsaw that Saw's real heart lays and with plenty of reminiscing going on here in regards to numbers IIV there's enough material and characterisation work here to satisfy hardcore fans of the series.On the other side of the pitch however is a much less characterdialogue driven narrative which focuses solely on another unlucky five as they work their way through the latest of Jigsaws traps this time set up by successor Hoffman. For those who attend screenings of the latest Saw movies only to watch people get their comeuppance through a series of bloody and grisly tests then this will be where your thirst is quenched. Taking on a tone that is strikingly similar to instalment two the challenges presented here are graphic and extremely cerebral shot in the same berserk ways so far explored in the series although the blending scene segment style incorporated in IV is gone which add to the movie's intense ability to draw you in.A consistently forceful element of the series cinematographer David A. Armstrong here follows the movie's mantra of don't fix what isn't broke and the film's sense of coherency and embodiment of the script's themes works just as well here as it did in previous features. Sure enough Saw wouldn't be Saw without its morally challenging undercurrent squirming underneath all the corpses and violence and in this regard V does well to incorporate the same subtext. Of course as has been the case with all the sequels thus far the message isn't quite as clear here as it was in the original and the ideas always seem to be justifying the gore rather than the other more appropriate way around but there's enough here to stop the whole ordeal boiling down to a silly slasher flick with no fibre to it at all.Needless to say there are many audiences out there who outwardly oppose everything the Saw series stands for be it involving the gore the message or just the tacky horrormoviesequel feel in general. Yet as I have been witness to many the genre has to offer so far this year I can safely say that while Saw V is by no means a masterpiece nor as significant as its first production it still beats out most of the competition by quite some distance.In the end the entire ordeal feels more like an addon a tidbit of flavour designed to tie up the loose ends left dangling from all the other features and in this respect V will feel a little underwhelming even to rabid fans of the series. And yet it's the fans that will make up most of Saw V's audience. I recommend V but only to fans and only because there's hope that VI which the door is left wide open to here might get the ball rolling again and begin to tell a new story. So by all means if you can appreciate the series' unmatched ability to make you squirm to have you question your moral code and to fascinate you with its lurid engrossing world made of cogs puzzle pieces and of course saws then you can't go wrong here. Saw V is everything that fans of the series as a whole will want but a lack of progression in narrative and its disregard for relevancy to anyone outside of its core audience inevitably cuts it short not enough for anyone else but fans should enjoy it for the most part.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

	onyx:emotionText "In what is only the fifth film of the Saw series released over its five year Halloween run at the box office this latest installation suffers from the same detrimental qualities that made number four slightly disappointing for fans and casual audiences alike. Making his directorial debut here all eyes are cast upon David Hackl to see if he can either bring something new or at least keep the momentum going for the popular franchise. The good news for some is that Saw V feels natural and consistent to its recent predecessors helmed by Bousman yet for many others this won't be something to get excited about. Insofar as the movie itself goes this is mostly typical Saw material throughout going through the motions almost. This of course will please those looking for a continuation of the previous instalments but it will undoubtedly feel too stagnant and jaded to interest anyone else.

I've enjoyed all of the Saw films predictably liking some episodes a lot more than others and Saw V is again very watchable with some intense moments and no shortage of grisliness. But I'd still say it's the weakest entry in the series to date. The trouble is that the main narrative addition for this episode which has to sustain half the running time turns out to be a dramatically weak one. I don't think a Saw film ever previously failed to create excitement or new meaning via one of its big twisty revelations but Saw V's add next to nothing. The knowledge gained doesn't force any reevaluation of the past events it concerns you just see and know a bit more about them and to no great effect except for the fact that Tobin Bell's performance is always compelling maybe even more so when he's talking to people who aren't stuck in Jigsaw's deathtraps.The Saw films have demonstrated an unfeasibly high success rate over time in terms of pulling off twist after twist and having them nearly all hit home. With this track record it seems inevitable that there'd be a significant stumble at some point. They've never been bulletproof films and thrillers are the genre that are hardest to bulletproof but I'd say Saw V is definitely the stumble. In spite of this it still keeps in enough with the series in general for me to be ready for Saw VI in 2009  which I hope will be better work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Review Written With Possible Spoilers So i just saw Saw 5. And how to sum it up.. I think my brother summed it up best as One long ass prologue for Saw 6.Now i remember the first saw being one of the best films I've ever seen. Saw 2 was a major let down to me.. it was just too random and didn't have the calculated brilliance of Saw 1. Saw 3 i actually didn't mind just because i found it more interesting then Saw 2. Saw 4 was pushing it but i kept on watching just cause all the little questions that had built up over the series had to be answered otherwise i couldn't sleep at night.. So we come to Saw 5... And what HUGE revelation do we get in this movie? ...... Well... actually we don't get one. Oh sure there is the back story of how Hoffman became the new saw killer.. But its so cheesy that a 6th grader could've strung it all together. And the story isn't...well...Good... There is no twist none... NONE.... And the entire movie we just see an agent going from scene to scene of the old Jigsaw crimes.. and somehow imagining how they all happened... by just standing there and self narrating the past events... There is a sub plot involving a bunch of 5 other subjects.. but if you don't pick how that ends after jigsaws i wanna play a game rant Then you've obviously never watched a saw movie. major spoiler also the 5 people in that subplot game didn't seem to mind killing each other at any given chance as well.. Not to mention it was random as.. the literally just turn on each other without giving reason.. then at the end instead of killing each other they decide to work together... it didn't really fit with the characters that we had been shown through the movie... Im surprised that the guy didn't shove the girls arm into the trap after finding out she was the one who set him up for the murder of the 8 people.. He just goes Its your fault I'm here... But hey.. lets work together... Umm... OK....OK.. So lets ignore the terrible story that doesn't go anywhere not to mention the B grade acting.. So we come to the traps... Saw 3  4 mainly rode on the fact that the traps got more and more gore filled then the original first movies.. And that helped carry them a bit since the story was semi lacking... So I'm confused why every trap in this movie... Is... Well lame.. We see a guy get sliced in half lamely.. A girl lose her head.. Some dude blown away without seeing anything.. Girl stabbed in the neck.. and a couple of people bleed a little out of their arms probably the most violent scene in the movie.. Maybe the other titles have desensitized me to gore and violence.. But it was all quite tame in comparison.Plus the lame attempt to fill half the movie with Flashbacks just to have jigsaw in the movie while its nice to see Mr Tobin again.. just seemed like a massive time filler... Which sums this movie up nicely. Its just a filler. No questions are answered in this one... Apparently there is some huge underlining plot that we still aren't privvy to because the producers want to milk it for all its worth for at least another sequel. And you know what.. I'll see the damn sequel just cos i want to see how the series ends.. Which we all know is going to end with Hoffman getting killed by Gordan who will be the final new Jigsaw. We all know thats where its heading.... ".

	schema:headline " A review of mixed feelings...";
	schema:reviewBody "The Saw series has always been a standard of sorts. After what I felt was an iconic debut the series has always remained consistently interesting with one of the most compelling and ever expanding plots in film history. People may complain that the series is in decline but what people need to realize is that each part is astronomically better than the corresponding parts of other horror series for example Saw IV is better than Halloween IV or the 4th Nightmare on Elm Street film. The same holds true for Saw V though the film definitely shows that the series is in decline and needs to end soon before it descends into pure absurdity.A universal truth of the Saw series is that every entry no matter who does it will always be well written and contain a plot twist or two at the end. Again Saw V continues the tradition of revealing the 'huge' if you could call it that twist whilst Hello Zepp by Charlie Clouser plays in the background. The film answers as many questions as it raises and serves as more of an origin movie like Saw IV did. Only this time the origin doesn't focus on John KramerJigsaw and therein lies the problem.Why does Saw V fail to impress me? Simple. Not enough Jigsaw. Tobin Bell who has managed to create an iconic villain over the last 5 years delivers another sublime performance that is not to missed in the world of horror as perhaps the greatest villain of the decade. It really amazed me how Saw IV had the best acting of the series but just one movie later pretty much every performer falls flat on their face. This is especially sad considering most of the cast are returning characters except your typical why is this happening to me! AHHH! type characters which got unbearably annoying considering they killed off the two least annoying ones first. Meagan Good and Costas Mandylor are acceptable in their roles however.Back to the lack of Jigsaw. Tobin Bell really doesn't physically appear that much in the movie and that is far and away its biggest flaw. The film is similar to Saw II more than the others. To get my drift a little better imagine the second film except reduce Jigsaw's screen time by about half. Yeah. This is the only weakness of the screenplay for me which appears to have matured from the over the top torture porn in Saw III and the ridiculous attempt to run Saw IV concurrently with its predecessor. The film's biggest flaw is in the acting and lack of Jigsaw. Besides this I really felt that it fit the mold as a worthy entry to the series.After watching this however I no longer feel that Saw is the standard of excellence in horror as it once was. That said the film has the advantage of being short and never dragging. It's well paced and will more than deliver the thrills. Another thing I feel obligated to mention is that this is the least scariest film in the series which is okay because unlike every other cheap horror film Saw V doesn't try to be scary. It's more of a thriller with some gruesome images like the first film than a full blown horror movie like parts II  III.In the end what it comes down to as far as your ability to enjoy the movie you have to ask yourself this question why do I watch the Saw series?. If you watch it for the story and plot twists you should be at least satisfied if not entertained. If you watch the series for pure shock and awe and disgust you'll be disappointed because Saw V does not try to be a horror film outside of a few scenes. It's a decent entry to the series that is tolerable despite a lack of the iconic Jigsaw horrid acting and a somewhat predictable plot twist easily the most predictable of the series.".

Tobin Bell who has managed to create an iconic villain over the last 5 years delivers another sublime performance that is not to missed in the world of horror as perhaps the greatest villain of the decade. It really amazed me how Saw IV had the best acting of the series but just one movie later pretty much every performer falls flat on their face. This is especially sad considering most of the cast are returning characters except your typical why is this happening to me! AHHH! type characters which got unbearably annoying considering they killed off the two least annoying ones first. Meagan Good and Costas Mandylor are acceptable in their roles however.Back to the lack of Jigsaw. Tobin Bell really doesn't physically appear that much in the movie and that is far and away its biggest flaw. The film is similar to Saw II more than the others. To get my drift a little better imagine the second film except reduce Jigsaw's screen time by about half. Yeah. This is the only weakness of the screenplay for me which appears to have matured from the over the top torture porn in Saw III and the ridiculous attempt to run Saw IV concurrently with its predecessor. The film's biggest flaw is in the acting and lack of Jigsaw. Besides this I really felt that it fit the mold as a worthy entry to the series.After watching this however I no longer feel that Saw is the standard of excellence in horror as it once was. That said the film has the advantage of being short and never dragging. It's well paced and will more than deliver the thrills. Another thing I feel obligated to mention is that this is the least scariest film in the series which is okay because unlike every other cheap horror film Saw V doesn't try to be scary. It's more of a thriller with some gruesome images like the first film than a full blown horror movie like parts II  III.In the end what it comes down to as far as your ability to enjoy the movie you have to ask yourself this question why do I watch the Saw series?. If you watch it for the story and plot twists you should be at least satisfied if not entertained. If you watch the series for pure shock and awe and disgust you'll be disappointed because Saw V does not try to be a horror film outside of a few scenes. It's a decent entry to the series that is tolerable despite a lack of the iconic Jigsaw horrid acting and a somewhat predictable plot twist easily the most predictable of the series.";

I can appreciate that they're trying to bring it back to what the original was all about a brilliant plot with a couple of gory scenes the previous two have been somewhat goreladen with little story for my liking the problem being unfortunately that the plot is fairly weak. The intensity of the torture scenes is greatly increased though by the rest period between them.

I could rave on about the fourth installment but considering I'm writing a comment about the fifth I won't. There were so many things wrong with this movie especially the horrible ending. There was no twist midmovie because they couldn't think of a clever enough ending.I'm also extremely disappointed about the lack of relevance the main Saw trap had to the movie. They all had something to do with a fire where eight people died...so what. But they'll probably reveal why they were all chosen in the sixth one which I'm seriously considering not seeing.Yet another flaw the crappy traps which could have easily been escaped by the seemingly mentally handicapped victims. At least in the final trap the two left had a moment of clarity realizing what they should have done to get out. But they ruined it by sawing half of their arm in half when they could have just sawed off a finger and let the blood drain out.Alas even more is wrong with this awful sequel. Detective Hoffman in my opinion seemed to be randomly thrown in to the entire storyline because the writers weren't clever enough to come up with a real twist. The story has become way to complex and I found myself an avid film watcher bewildered at points. Good thing Agent Strahm was there to reveal the plot line aloud and to himself.Now there's a series of questions that have been built up and Jigsaw and all of his accomplices are dead. So i guess the writers are going to have to come up with another random plot line random character take random scenes from the other movies put the random character in them and add a random trap that kills a bunch of moronic random people. Again.I hate to say this but I actually caught myself laughing at the lame traps stupid people and a lot of Jigsaw's lines. i.e. Killing is distasteful..All in all this movie was a disaster an atrocity not even comparable with the rest of the Saw movies. I gave a 210 sheerly because it gave me something to whine about to my friends for the next couple of days.".

Let's keep it at the thin plot description already given a detective goes out of his way to make sure that his secret is kept before an agent uncovers his identity. The subplot involves 5 individuals who are somehow connected and must work their way out of traps.The traps still prove to be especially cruel perhaps a little too cruel but even that is worked into the story. It involves quite a bit of the past much like Saw 4 it will give you more of the origin of the characters whether it's needed or not. Minimizing flashbacks it instead will fill in a number of plot and character holes.This is David Hackl's directional debut. Considering he's been around since Saw 2 as production designer this is a solid step forward. There's no doubt that these somehow ingenious if not over the top story lines that interconnect were made up well after the fact but that doesn't change the fact that the scriptwriters were keen on at least making an effort to do exactly that. Tie things in making the package look neater  hoping you don't think about it too much that you start to see the implausibility of it all.If you have not seen the previous Saw's you will be lost here as you will be left with confusing tie in's and past incidents that mesh too well with the present. It's just not kind to new viewers.All in all I can't complain about Saw 5 because I got exactly what I expected. Clever deadly traps uncomfortable situations  of course the twist at the end. There's no denying that one particular actor that's been in all the Saw's is especially good at what he does.For the most part I would suggest waiting for a rental. I think that some viewers may grow tired of the series because it comes out every year. The nature of an audience viewing sequels is that it dwindles in number over time as sequelitis sets in.

Saw V shows that the filmmakers are now trying to make money.The film picks up where Saw IV left off Hoffman is now the newest person to carry on Jiggy's legacy and will do whatever it takes to get it unnoticed. That is until Strahm survives one of his traps and is now off to kill Hoffman. Meanwhile somewhere else 5 test subjects are in a house one named Brit played by Dexter's Julie Benz who wears a hilarious fright wig that somehow changes itself in every scene. The goal is to kill each other until one's surviving to get out of the house. Some traps include the necktie trap and even the razor hand trap.And that's all you need to know. This one is a real dud Not only are they carrying on a series that didn't need to be carried after our very own Jigsaw died but they're also trying to be like Saw I in some bits and even Saw III. Plus where's the gore? With how gory it is this should be rated PG13. The only gory bit is in the beginning with the pendulum trap. Not to mention the ending which sucks big time too because there's no twist!!! I'm sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with a Holographic cover and even a ticket to Saw VI will no doubt showcase all of its alternate endings but at this point I'm not sure if I even care.Overall this is a complete waste of time and is just another attempt to milk the cow from Lionsgate and Twisted Pictues.

I never claim Saw movies feature terrific acting besides 1 and 3 but 5 featured some atrocious performances. On one hand you have the wooden Strahm who is literally dictating his thought to... well no one on the other is Julie Benz normally a fine actress in Dexter spouting of ridiculous lines that sound meant for trailers ex.  It's our next nightmare. On top of that the movie is just full of sloppy filmmaking. Let's start with Strahm he's just unnecessary he seems only to be there as a vessel to fuel the flashbacks. On to the main trap The best of the characters is killed in just the second room. Why did they even have to kill him? He was savvy and sharp but I guess the director just wanted to remove all intelligence from this movie. Finally the ending. This might be the worst evidence of a cashgrab I have ever seen. There was no ending as my friend put it  It's like they ran out of ideas for 6 movies so they cut five in half and thats really how it felt INCOMPLETE.".

I never claim Saw movies feature terrific acting besides 1 and 3 but 5 featured some atrocious performances. On one hand you have the wooden Strahm who is literally dictating his thought to... well no one on the other is Julie Benz normally a fine actress in Dexter spouting of ridiculous lines that sound meant for trailers ex.

The entrapment was tried in the first movie when they planted the Doctors flashlight on one of his victims. The 2nd Game is a ReHash of the game with Mark Whalberg from Saw 2 with the almost the same RulesStay in the Room and Live or Follow your instincts  The building will become your Tomb.Were there any good bits in the movie well yes there were some nice touches Agent Strahm giving himself a Tracheotomy  Hoffmans Revenge on his Sisters killer was a very nice touch and oh no thats about it these touches while good are not enough to hold a whole movie together.The Tag Line You won't believe how it ends is a total let down the ending was the same as Saw IV and we already knew who took over from John as Jigsaw. You won't believe how it ends more like We could not think of a proper Ending so we reused Saw IV ending. Poor Poor Poor.Also and Unfortunately in my view one question was never answered and has left a unfortunate reason for Saw VI to be made Whats in the Box thats Johns wife was given? In short Saw V is like the Labour Government It's running out of Ideas  This is a truly awful movie and like Jigsaw should be stopped. I pray I have the will power to leave Saw VI well alone but I'm stupid like that and I just know I will talk the wife into going to see it.".

I'm still a fan of it thought but it needs some new fresh ideas fast.Of course in essence all Saw movies are more or less the same. However all previous movies still knew to keep me interested and guessing throughout the entire movie. It still featured some surprising and interesting elements while Saw V really doesn't feature any. No big surprises or twists here not even at the ending which in my opinion was a bit weak and disappointing. Normally the end of a Saw movie provides a big twists that will leave you shocked and stunned in your chair for a few minutes after the movie has ended. I missed this in Saw V.The movie is also the least interesting Saw movie as of yet because it features some lazy writing. Normally Saw scripts are airtight ones but not this one sadly. It often takes the obvious paths.Like always it is also featuring lots of different plotlines and characters again although in this case not all are connected well enough to each other. Seriously what have all those people going to the Jigsawtrails have to do with the rest of the movie its plot? It just seems to be there because its a Saw movie and it needs to feature all these sick and twisted games. The story lines don't ever really get together well enough. The movie again is also featuring lots of flashbacks which shows events that happened in the previous movies often seen from a different side this time but some of these flashbacks however are quite pointless for the movie once you start thinking about it.I also blame Hoffman for it that this movie doesn't work out as good and interesting as any of the other sequels. He's the new Jigsaw and as of yet he also is the least interesting one. It probably also has to do with the fact that he is featured a lot in the movie while Jigsaw normally always remain on the background. Also the reasons why he became the new Jigsaw as gets shown in this movie are a bit shaky and not exactly believable.The movie itself is perhaps also lacking in one clear good main hero and character.It still is a superior genre movie of course. It's concept alone is already good and interesting enough to please the genre fans and provides the potential for an infinitive amount of Sawsequels. All Saw movies have a great look and atmosphere over them though this one works out as the least effective one when it comes down to its atmosphere and horrorthriller elements because of the reason that this movie features very little new elements.The Jigsaw games themselves also seem less innovative and clever. It's still gruesome and lots of bloods and guts can be seen flying around but it's just less surprising and shocking all.Lets hope Saw VI will have some fresh new good ideas and a better script with some better and more interesting characters in it.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

It seemed like this movie could have just been tossed in with part 4 to make one big movie as the prequel to the next part. So to me it seemed like the studio just split up 1 movie into 2 parts to capitalize on the profits....which they have done well I might add because myself and many other movie goers packed the theater for the 5th Saw installment. So in closing I think this movie may be adequate for the die hard saw fans not nearly good enough for new comers and winds up lacking far more than it gives. That is why I can only give this movie a 5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Just got back from seeing the new saw tonight and i must say i was a little surprised. The Saw franchise has officially been run into the ground ever since saw 2 so you either really need to be a fan of the series or go in knowing all the saw movies and having an open mind. Knowing that this was probably just a milk the cow and grab the cash type of deal i was a little surprised. This saw film is different from all the others it returns a little to its original roots.Much like the first saw this time around we are given more story and little on the deaths and traps. This movie seems more of a detective thriller than a gore slash em up type of movie however that still is present. The movie also moves at a slower pace. So here is my rundown of the film.The death traps to me seemed very unoriginal but i guess thats kind of hard when you have probably used them all and overall that sadistic feeling is just gone now. The story continues where saw 4 left off and pretty much really stays the same nothing new really happens. The viewer may get more story but it's really unnecessary. The only new things we learn is how that detective came to work along side jigsaw. We learn nothing new about jigsaw or his past like we were promised. Also again his wife is left with nothing new other than a box with something in it that we don't get to see or hear from again...probably till saw 6. So overall the traps are kind of boring and have been done you also get cheated out of some the story is quite pointless and the ending is....The ending is well the tagline reads You won't believe how it ends well guess what i can believe how it ended and all i'll say was wow it is nothing excellent or twisted. Just open ended no surprise or nothing unlike the other saw films but maybe it's just setting up for the final act so there is no need to bring in other killers or major twists like the last saw films. Overall the movie was alright not great but probably more worth watching when it comes to DVD or bluray. Saw fans will probably either love this or even shrug it off because of its slower pace. For people who haven't seen all the saw's will want to avoid this one because of the constant flashback's and confusing story line.Best saw films overall Saw Saw 3 Saw 2 Saw 4 Saw 5".

The story was very good in this one as well. It didn't have the best acting but was okay. It wasn't that jumpy or to scary but did have a few scares and jumps. It is a great movie to go see during Haloween. It did have a few boring moments but for the most part keeps you entertained. The movie does go very deep into the story with this one. Some of the games were fun and some were bad. This saw was more like the second one. The ending was led up very well for a great finale. The whole movie was fun though and intense for the most part.

I couldn't figure out where the film was on the timeline at certain points  at one point I though Jigsaw had come back from the dead.The truth is you don't really care about the characters the games are poorly conceived and it seems that the makers just want to go for gore and guts without going any deeper which would be the smart thing to do.I expect these films will just keep going and going they should have quit while they were ahead but alas money is the dictator. So 1 out of 10 I feel is fair only because it didn't last longer than 90 minutes. If you have to watch this wait til it comes out on DVD and go see Ricky Gervais at the cinema instead.".

But between little to no creative traps absolutely terrible dialog and the worst ending to a film since The Village really the ending is that bad I think it stands a testament how terrible of a director Dave is.

And he had flying 8's that would ravage your children. That ending would have been better then what I just watched no more then 2 hours ago. I will not let this dreg sink in. Jigsaw is barely in the film and so many VERY IMPORTANT questions are left unanswered but not in a Saw way. Sort of like in a Clue or Jeopardy kind of way. It's like if Alex Tribek asked the question nobody got it right and then he didn't tell you the answer.The plot was horrible. The acting was bad. The last trap involving hands in the film was pretty good. The real last trap that's not a trap it's just uncreative and stupid looked like something from a bad library book you steal just to resell it. Not good not fair not even terrible.

	schema:headline " Riveting and mindboggling after three sequels the SAW franchise skyrockets";
	schema:reviewBody "Who would've thought that a slasher horror film franchise after three sequels could STILL be one of the best things Hollywood has to boast today? Not I that's for sure. The intricate original crowd pleasing absolutely shocking riveting suspenseful Saw wowed audiences in 2004 and a very solid sequel did the same in 2005.I still remember seeing Saw and Saw II for the first time and realizing how amazing they were. Yet I was unhappy with Saw III along with many others for reasons being it focused more on violence than plot there was no twist and the ending was very unsatisfying.I know for a fact I wasn't the only person who thought the Saw franchise was officially over judging by the very disappointing third film...yet I still possessed a strange love for these films and couldn't wait to see the fourth when it hit theaters. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece at all...but I got one.Saw IV is not the average horror flick. If you're a Saw fan that likes the series for its blood and guts you're going to despise it. If you're not willing to completely concentrate on the film's every little detail you're going to despise it. If you feel like just kicking back watching a nice gory horror film and not spending a night analyzing the film racking your brain until you drive yourself insane you're going to despise this film. Quite honestly that's why so many people hate this film because they were expecting something completely different. Make no mistakethe Saw franchise as we know it is now going in a completely different direction.Here's where the line's drawn between Saw IV and it's predecessors. With the deaths of two main characters in Saw III you can't possibly think of how Saw IV could really be close to a decent film. Instead of a basic storyline of traps unlucky individuals who don't appreciate their lives and suspenseful jump scenes Saw IV delivers a completely different premise it's darker edgier scarier more complex more intricately designed and more controversial than its predecessors. In some ways the most horrifying thing about the film is instead of watching people being tested on screenYOU as a viewer are testedchallenged to see what Jigsaw sees feel what Jigsaw feels...judge how Jigsaw judges. The traps aren't there to entertain or to make you recoil in disgust...they're there to make you THINK.Even if you don't want to or don't feel like it Saw IV will whisk you away into a land of nightmare where you're forced to make the choices to what happens to the individuals on screenyou're the one in control. By the end of the movie you'll be so shaken up you won't be able to move. For me this one Saw IV HUGE points because it's actually scary unlike II and III! It's not a bodycount movieit's a riveting mindboggling psychological thriller in the sense of the first film. The film feels like it balances a huge amount of plot and story and a huge amount of gore and ends up taking the cake. The film is exceptionally brutally violent even more so than Saw III and some scenes are very very disturbingnot because they are violent but because stuff so horrifying is happening you just want to vomit your brains out. Saw IV is NOT for the faint of heart and there is some very disturbing sexual violence in one scene and another massively disturbing scene where five people in my theater got up and left...and this scene has haunted me since I came out of my theater.Though horror veterans James Wan and Leigh Whannell the original creators of Saw did not write Saw IVit almost seems better. Darren Lynn Bousman's exquisite directing incorporates a dire sense of urgency throughout the whole film making it feel like you're watching a 24 episode.I will warn you now the ending will confuse the hell out of you which apparently is another reason for people to completely wrongly condemn this film. Me and my friends spent a good two hours discussing the film afterwards and it made much more sense to us. Be prepared to watch this film with an open mind and be ready for some serious postviewing discussion afterwards. The ending is very much like that of The Prestige and you may have a desire to watch Saw IV again the minute it ends.If you're a Saw fan that was disappointed with the lack of psychological horror in Saw II and Saw IIIfear not. Saw IV has what you're looking for and will take you to hell and back...but hold onto your dinner. I have no idea how this film made it past the MPAA without an NC17 rating. Along with your dinner try to hold onto your sanity while watching the film...good luck with that.Enjoy which is in my opinion one of the best treats of the 2007 movie season.".

Darren Lynn Bousman's exquisite directing incorporates a dire sense of urgency throughout the whole film making it feel like you're watching a 24 episode.I will warn you now the ending will confuse the hell out of you which apparently is another reason for people to completely wrongly condemn this film. Me and my friends spent a good two hours discussing the film afterwards and it made much more sense to us. Be prepared to watch this film with an open mind and be ready for some serious postviewing discussion afterwards. The ending is very much like that of The Prestige and you may have a desire to watch Saw IV again the minute it ends.If you're a Saw fan that was disappointed with the lack of psychological horror in Saw II and Saw IIIfear not. Saw IV has what you're looking for and will take you to hell and back...but hold onto your dinner. I have no idea how this film made it past the MPAA without an NC17 rating. Along with your dinner try to hold onto your sanity while watching the film...good luck with that.Enjoy which is in my opinion one of the best treats of the 2007 movie season.";

If in the past a character clicked on the TV and saw themselves on it by way of a CCTV monitor hidden in their house then it might have worked somewhat and was quite eerie.

You turn up you get grossed out and then you leave again. You shrug and you wait for the next instalment right? Wrong. Wrong attitude. I gave the Saw franchise the benefit of the doubt I really did at least for two of its sequels but this is garbage and everybody knows it.

Following on from the third Star Wars episode the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakesprequels the recent Hannibal Lecter prequel the third Saw entry and now this a crass delving into a past nobody cares about as Jigsaw Bell comes to be the mechanical contraption expert we all know him for.The film for the most part covers the journey of a police officer named Rigg Bent as he ventures from one trap involving others to another all the time aiming to save fellow police officer Eric Matthews Wahlberg the guy that has been missing since the finale of number two. Like every film of this ilk he has a time limit ninety minutes which doubles up as your bogstandard length for pieces of junk films such as this one. Rigg's adventure is peppered with dumb wouldbe deeper meaning pseudophilosophical statements in which he is invited the 'see what I see' and 'feel what I feel' by a Jigsaw character pathetically put across only by way of cassette tape. His journey is uninspiring and episodic it consists of him stumbling across an array of different people of various past baddeeds instances that could unfold in any order at all and we'd all still end up where we eventually end up.

To add some more story into the mix Agent Strahm Scott Patterson and Agent Perez Athena Karkanis are hot on Rigg's tale while also trying to find Matthews and Hoffman.Obviously story was thrown out of the window when making this movie as the story is convoluted and predictable. It is merely an excuse to show off some inventive and sadistic traps for the ADD riddled target audience. Whereas in James Wan's Saw traps were secondary to the mystery and intrigue here they are the focus. Not to say I do not enjoy watching how they work as they provide some excellent gore. Director Darren Lynn Bousman has not changed his style very much because the editing is as atrocious as it always has been with quick flashy cuts that plague most scenes. These are incredibly irritating and make it hard to follow the action. Even parts of dialogue are reduced to this MTV musicvideo style of camerawork.None of the acting is particularly worth mentioning Tobin Bell really needs lessons to broaden his range as all he does is talk in that same gruff voice he has done in Saw  Saw III. Betsy Russell is probably the best as Jill Jigsaw's exwife. To be fair the actors are not helped by the script as it is pretty darn poor. The twist at the end could probably be seen a mile away and lacks any punch whatsoever and it does not help that we are treated to a series of flashbacks which explain it like we are not smart enough to think for ourselves! The story itself seems contradictory as Jigsaw's motive was to kidnap people who did not appreciate their life like druggies arsonists rapists and test them. In this Rigg is chosen although he is a policeman whose flaw is trying to save everyone?! Seems a bit dodgy to me...Regardless you could do worse for 95 minutes. If you are a hardcore Saw fanatic you will probably love this if you aren't you should probably just skip it. This is nothing but a rehash of Saw III with more gore and the same silly story.15".

I assumed that with basically every main character dead there would be no way of continuing the series.I was wrong.Saw IV from director Darren Lynn Bousman Saw II and III and writers Patrick Melton Marcus Dunstan and Thomas Fenton taking over for series veteran Leigh Whannell delivers a story that is thrilling poignant and disturbing taking the series in a slightly different direction in terms of tone and style while at the same time retaining the mood that made the first three films unique.It is honestly very hard to summarize the story without revealing the many twists and turns but here I go Jigsaw and Amanda are dead. However during the autopsy of Jigsaw's body an audio tape is discovered in his stomach. Detective Hoffman who you may remember from a brief cameo in Saw III hears the tape that warns Jigsaw's games will continue...At the same time SWAT leader Rigg of Saw II and III has become a shell of a man. Everyone he works with and treasures as friends have been killed. He is becoming reckless... burnt out and hollow.However something sinister is about to happen... and Rigg will have to play a part in a fiendish new game orchestrated by Jigsaw who despite being dead is still the master puppeteer of morals and torture.That is the basic plot line in a nutshell. However don't be fooled. Though he is dead Jigsaw is still very much an important part of the story. We get numerous flashbacks of him before his transformation into the brilliant madman we know from previous films and see exactly what events triggered his desire to turn... If you think his only problem was the cancer inside think again... There is much more to be discovered about John Kramer... And I think there is still more to the character to explore in future films...There are also other new characters including Jigsaw's ex and a pair of FBI agents who complicate the movie in a good way by creating numerous intersecting subplots.But onto the real fun of the series... The traps. I personally loved every trap in this film. We get to witness Jigsaw's first effort which I can only say is painful in many different ways and we get new disturbing and complicated setups... While the film might not have the ouch factor that past traps paticularly The Rack from III might have had they are certainly gory and zany enough to keep everyone entertained and revolted at the same time. In fact I would say the audience I saw the film with a soldout theater at 1025 opening night had the best reactions I have ever seen with a film. Bravo to the filmmakers! There were really very few downpoints in the film for me. I ateup everything that I saw and loved just about every second of it! Also the numerous twists and turns throughout kept me reeling. And for once I can honestly say I did not see the series staple twist ending coming... A real shocker!And while I did miss some of the characters from previous installments I wish Shawnee Smith's Amanda could have gotten more screen time the new characters have so much promise and potential I can forgive any complaints I might have.Here's to Saw IV... A frenzied and freakish sequel that has only fueled my hunger for future installments! 9 out of 10!".

	schema:headline " It surpassed my expectations...Saw reigns again for the fourth year in a row.";
	schema:reviewBody "As a die hard Saw fan Saw IV was one of my top must sees of 2007. Fortunately I didn't get my hopes up and therefore I wasn't disappointed. The movie has its fair share of flaws don't get me wrong. However the movie made this Saw fan happy because it maintained the spirit of the series. The movie's biggest flaw is that it is by far the most unrealistic of the series and relies too much on chance within the story. Too many events are contingent on others which makes Jigsaw look almost clairvoyant. However I was able to look past this and enjoy the fourth Saw film.Jigsaw Tobin Bell is dead. Though he is gone he vows that his work will continue. And it appears he is true to his word for SWAT Lt. Rigg from Saw 2  3 is the latest member of the police force to be thrust into one of Jigsaw's deadly games. Meanwhile Detective Hoffman Costas Mandylor is joined by a pair of FBI agents to help stop the Jigsaw killer once and for all...They'll start by looking into his past beginning with his ex wife Jill.The acting is pretty good. Costas Mandylor Tobin Bell and Scott Patterson are the standouts. Bell brings so much more to the character this time around through flashbacks as we learn more about John Kramer. Showing that he has created one of the most memorable characters of recent memory Bell makes us almost sympathize with him despite the acts he has committed. Mandylor is really good as Detective Hoffman even though he has limited screen time and dialog. I liked Patterson a lot because of the toughness and reality he brought to the character. Agent Strahm is a good character and definitely one of my favorites in the series. One big surprise was Lyric Bent as Rigg. He definitely showed a lot of range in this movie. He has a future.The plot is probably the most complex as there can be as many as 3 different subplots going on at the same time all while the audience has questions from the first 3 movies answered. The ending also leaves a little to be desired as it is the least impacting twist of the series and most obvious. However I really enjoyed the traps which were definitely a step up from Saw 3. The random gore was kept to a minimum but the beginning is absolutely horrifyingly gory. It also felt rushed which means I can't wait to see the unrated DVD. Hopefully it'll have more extra footage than the others. Saw 4 has the weakest script of the series but it's still better than I expected. At this point it appears as if Darren Bousman is going through the motions and that's what keeps the series spirit alive. As long as Bousman Wan or Whannell continue to be involved the spirit should live on. I also have to give props to the editor for the smooth and catchy transitions not to mention the production design is top notch. That and the lighting provide at least some horror realism as the plot does border on absurd at times. The sound is better than ever with the classic 'Hello Zepp' tune that has become one of the most recognizable tracks in movie history making its dramatic appearance in the climax of the film.

	onyx:emotionText "As a die hard Saw fan Saw IV was one of my top must sees of 2007. Fortunately I didn't get my hopes up and therefore I wasn't disappointed. The movie has its fair share of flaws don't get me wrong. However the movie made this Saw fan happy because it maintained the spirit of the series. The movie's biggest flaw is that it is by far the most unrealistic of the series and relies too much on chance within the story. Too many events are contingent on others which makes Jigsaw look almost clairvoyant. However I was able to look past this and enjoy the fourth Saw film.Jigsaw Tobin Bell is dead. Though he is gone he vows that his work will continue. And it appears he is true to his word for SWAT Lt. Rigg from Saw 2  3 is the latest member of the police force to be thrust into one of Jigsaw's deadly games. Meanwhile Detective Hoffman Costas Mandylor is joined by a pair of FBI agents to help stop the Jigsaw killer once and for all...They'll start by looking into his past beginning with his ex wife Jill.The acting is pretty good. Costas Mandylor Tobin Bell and Scott Patterson are the standouts. Bell brings so much more to the character this time around through flashbacks as we learn more about John Kramer. Showing that he has created one of the most memorable characters of recent memory Bell makes us almost sympathize with him despite the acts he has committed. Mandylor is really good as Detective Hoffman even though he has limited screen time and dialog. I liked Patterson a lot because of the toughness and reality he brought to the character. Agent Strahm is a good character and definitely one of my favorites in the series. One big surprise was Lyric Bent as Rigg. He definitely showed a lot of range in this movie. He has a future.The plot is probably the most complex as there can be as many as 3 different subplots going on at the same time all while the audience has questions from the first 3 movies answered. The ending also leaves a little to be desired as it is the least impacting twist of the series and most obvious. However I really enjoyed the traps which were definitely a step up from Saw 3. The random gore was kept to a minimum but the beginning is absolutely horrifyingly gory. It also felt rushed which means I can't wait to see the unrated DVD. Hopefully it'll have more extra footage than the others. Saw 4 has the weakest script of the series but it's still better than I expected. At this point it appears as if Darren Bousman is going through the motions and that's what keeps the series spirit alive. As long as Bousman Wan or Whannell continue to be involved the spirit should live on. I also have to give props to the editor for the smooth and catchy transitions not to mention the production design is top notch. That and the lighting provide at least some horror realism as the plot does border on absurd at times.

	schema:reviewBody "If it's Halloween...It must be Saw. That's the tagline for Saw IV the newest installment in the gory horror series of Saw. It's almost a tradition that every Halloween there's a new Saw sequel hence the tagline. But after this messy selfindulgent bloodbath I kind of wish that this tired series would just come to an end already.Saw IV involves a SWAT officer named Rigg Lyriq Bent who is kidnapped and placed in a deadly game by the supposedly deceased Jigsaw. He is told that his alsokidnapped partners Hoffman Costas Mandylor and Eric Matthews Donnie Wahlberg are playing a game of their own and that Rigg must resist saving them for a total of 90 minutes. While searching for his two friends Rigg continually finds people in lifeordeath situations on the path to his final test. Rigg must choose whether he wants to help save these people His usual reaction or follow Jigsaw's rules and let them get out by themselves. Who will win? Who will lose? Who will lose a limb? Or limbs? Who will care? A new Saw movie comes out every Halloween that means that the filmmakers only have about a year to write it cast it shoot it edit it and roll it. The first three movies all felt like for the most part well constructed films Saw II not as much. You could tell that they were well thought out and that a general effort was put forth to create a constant storyline where each movie follows the tracks of the others. Unlike horror flicks like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street Saw cannot just go off on a tangent it has to follow the footsteps of its predecessors in order to keep the Saw storyline chugging along. Saw IV is the first in the series that truly feels like a complete rushjob. Since Leigh Whannel Writer of the first three Saws has been replaced by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan it is obvious that these new writers of the series were pressured to write a coherent storyline so that the filmmakers could get Saw IV out by Halloween. Close to nothing in this vapid movie is well thoughtout there are plot holes all over the place and the characters are so incredibly stupid that even their idiot actions aren't funny. It's an assault on the eyes ears and stomach The squeamish will be puking and the Saw fans will be nauseous from its stupidity.About the only thing I enjoyed about this sequel were the revelations of John KramerJigsaw's past. Those are the only dramatic scenes that work but there aren't nearly enough of them to keep Saw IV afloat. I won't spoil anything but this movie during flashbacks shows us Jigsaw's first trap and it is without a doubt the best scene in the whole movie. That is the only scene where character development and story progress actually came together and made for a tense and excellently suspenseful scene. However that's about all that I liked about Saw IV.The story makes dangerously little sense and the characters are basically only there for a quick kill. For instance there's a scene involving a pedophilic rapist who is held at gunpoint and forced to get into a trap where either his limbs will be torn apart or he gets his eyes ripped out That means no more porn watching. Yikes!. Scenes like this won't even be enjoyable for the torture porn crowd. They are so horribly edited lit and acted that they are reduced to absymal trash that nobody will be able to appreciate. The editing in the Saw flicks have always looked like the result of an editor on acid. There are endless flashing lights fast zoomins Panshots that spin around faster than Linda Blair's head and repeated shots of screaming that should build tension...but only build laughs. I've had it up to here with Saw's editing because it gives me a headache and when it's all over I feel like I just woke up from a nightmare where I was addicted to crack.The effort put into making Saw IV is minimal to the point that you can tell it was just made so the series can thrive on till the final film Supposedly Saw VI. It's like the middle child or older brother that gets ignored while everybody is busy adoring the newborn baby. In other words the filmmakers didn't seem to care about this sequel as much. They're just stalling until they get to the big payoff with Saw V and Saw VI. And trust me Saw IV's twist ending is the epitome of both rush job and stalling. I give Saw IV a 1 out of 5. No wonder Darren Lynn Bousman walked away after this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jigsaw is dead but his game is far from over. A detective is on the hunt for clues around the city in which he must act in the same manner as Jigsaw with the victims he finds. He must do this in order to find the location of two of his colleagues and save them.It's easy to see how the SAW franchise as it is now called is turning into the same mess that struck Friday the 13th Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street. The story is over but the cash flow still has some juice in it. In this installment Jigsaw is dead but his cruel game continues. How you might ask? Well if I were to explain that it would ruin the film but it's hard to review this film without leaking something.The original SAW redefined the horror genre so much so that there are now countless imitators. It packed the goods in gore and a shocking twist at the end. The sequel which really was not needed tried to capitalize on the same system. It failed. Yet still made boatloads of money. Hence the 3rd and this film and of course the next one. SAW IV becomes a parody of itself unintentionally mind you. It tries to recapture the essence of the original from plot points to the twist which is a staple in the series now. Why SAW IV doesn't work as well as it wants to is because it's far too confusing and doesn't satisfy it's audience instead it leaves more holes that will be filled in by it's sequel much like how this one filled in some from the 3rd.SAW IV answers the questions such as who the blonde woman was in Jigsaw's dreams and why he covered the tape in wax. Yet leaves out other things specifically what the letter said to Amanda. It could have easily been explained but they wanted to leave as much story as possible to continue this franchise which should have been over at 1 and could have been wrapped up completely with 3. This leaves the audience confused as well as angry. When the final credits rolled up I sat back in my chair and asked myself if they really answered anything as to why it ended the way it didit doesn't. It throws in that twist that is expected but doesn't bother to explain it. I guess we have to wait another year to find out why things happened the way they did.SAW IV is gory probably the worst out of all of them but not quite as nerve flinching as the others. It doesn't have any scenes that make you squirm in your seat like when Dr. Gordon saws off his foot or when Amanda falls into the pit full of needles or even when Detective Matthews smashes hiss foot with the toilet cover. Those small things are the ones that get the audience this film simply shows the bloody entrails of people.I will give credit to where it's due. The film stays consistent with the others and I applause the actors and writers for continuing certain characters through out the entire series. It gives fans goose bumps when they see a familiar face. Also the twist which fails in comparison to the first two but it better then the third is adequate. In fact there is more then one twist. We also get some more background history on Jigsaw who he was before he became a psychopath. A little hint as to why as well. We can't connect to any of these characters. Characters from the previous films that show up here have very little screen time and are killed off. Why have them survive through all this stuff just to kill them off. It cheapens the films in which we root for them to live we know their fate in the end. There may have been characters that you cared for in previous installments that were trapped in Jigsaw's game this time around unless you knew them from before we know their fate we know we don't care.The ending will confuse the hell out of a lot of people I had to take a minute to figure it out myself. Maybe because it was really well written or horrible executed I haven't decided yet. I found myself sitting there with a confused look across my face wanting more not simply because I wanted more but because the film needed more. The film has a lot of stuff going on it's not to know who' who who's dead what's going on where and so on.If you've missed one film in the series you will most likely be lost in this film. It asks you as do the others to pay attention to the previous films. I really enjoy that it asks the audience to think a little bit which is usually missing from horror films these days. It's a tad better then the second and third but falls apart near the end. This time around we can't seem to care for the guy whose trapped in Jigsaw's mind game. We've come to expect the unexpected we've comes to be grossed out. Have the makers of this series run their course? Well after the next film to tie everything up I hope the answer is yes. The first is still the best and I cannot imagine the next one being any better.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a rare occurrence but get ready to see this more then once. Saw 4 plays more like a detective story lifted from a page of a whodunit novel. This time we delve deeper into John's past his exwife and the real secrets about what made him Jigsaw. During his autopsy it's reveled his stomach contains an audio tape. The tape warns that his work will continue.It seems that diehard fans don't wish to know about what's in the story since I had to reedit my comment so that none of the story would be revealed except that which you see in the ads anyway. In my previous comment I said nothing about the ending yet just giving away some of the plot is enough of a nono. I don't blame them since this 4th outing has too many elements that make it easier to predict what's going to happen. Regardless you'd have to be some kind of rare genius to figure out what will happen in the end.The series has flowed like a smooth welloiled Rube Goldberg machine. It's the most complex of the bunch in some ways outdoing the previous ones. I repeat it begs to be watched again. Just when you thought that the previous Saw Traps had done everything they can to a human body this one has some clever ones of it's own not as gruesome as Saw 3 though. The autopsy scene is set to the extreme the MPAA stating that most viewers have now gotten used to seeing programs like CSI and other medical procedures so they let this slide easier. Deceptive dark very edgy and well written the Saw series can easily end here. It's almost necessary to have watched the previous Saws but can stand on it's own as one of the best of the chapters. Of course it leaves it open for yet another in the series which will be in production soon. I don't know when I will tire of the series but honestly I can't wait to see what other delicious traps they cook up next.".

In my previous comment I said nothing about the ending yet just giving away some of the plot is enough of a nono. I don't blame them since this 4th outing has too many elements that make it easier to predict what's going to happen. Regardless you'd have to be some kind of rare genius to figure out what will happen in the end.The series has flowed like a smooth welloiled Rube Goldberg machine. It's the most complex of the bunch in some ways outdoing the previous ones. I repeat it begs to be watched again. Just when you thought that the previous Saw Traps had done everything they can to a human body this one has some clever ones of it's own not as gruesome as Saw 3 though. The autopsy scene is set to the extreme the MPAA stating that most viewers have now gotten used to seeing programs like CSI and other medical procedures so they let this slide easier. Deceptive dark very edgy and well written the Saw series can easily end here. It's almost necessary to have watched the previous Saws but can stand on it's own as one of the best of the chapters. Of course it leaves it open for yet another in the series which will be in production soon. I don't know when I will tire of the series but honestly I can't wait to see what other delicious traps they cook up next.";

	schema:reviewBody "Without a doubt Saw has become an absolute phenomenon. I find it quite impressive how a small 1 million horror film garnered strong word of mouth and made it big spawning a franchise which has become Lionsgate Films' yearly bread and butter. I've really enjoyed the Saw films and have been there since the beginning viewing the first film on opening day in the UK. It was refreshing to see something original and to my surprise the sequel Saw II was just as good. However the third instalment still good showed signs of clutching at straws.SWAT Commander Rigg Lyriq Bent has become obsessed with finding Jigsaw Tobin Bell particularly since his fellow officers have died via his sadistic games. However Jigsaw finds Rigg and has him play his own game. With two of his colleagues Officer Matthews and Hoffman Donnie Wahlberg Costas Mandylor held captive in one of Jigsaw's traps Rigg has 90 minutes to try and find them. Meanwhile FBI Agents Strahm and Perez Scott Patterson Athena Karkanis question Jigsaw's exwife Jill Betsy Russell in an effort to uncover Jigsaw's mysterious accomplice. Saw IV is a sequel that is struggling to stay consistent with the numerous plot strands and filling up of plot holes. It almost feels like an extreme connect the dots puzzle as one tries to piece together all the characters and incidents from the previous instalments. Even when watching it I could already imagine Internet forums swarming with hundreds of questions.What made the first film so unique was that the victims are often people who essentially deserved to be punished be they drug dealers or con artists frantically trying to save themselves from the macabre situation they were in. With Jigsaw as judge jury and executioner do we as an audience side with his objective or do we sympathise with the wrongdoing victim during their last few seconds before they die a fantastic death? As the sequels have progressed saving oneself appears to have been completely abandoned for in the third instalment as well as this one some victims simply have to wait to depend upon someone to help them. Also some supposedly innocent ? people are dragged in the guy with his eyes sewn shut is involved in the film's best trap but who the hell was he? while some injured victims are merely swept aside and we never know if they live or die.In an effort to try and make a bigger sequel games are no longer in one confined space but set in different locations across the city pushing 'suspension of disbelief' to the limit. For example Rigg's apartment is turned upsidedown within a matter of minutes with blood on the walls pictures hanging from the ceiling and how someone managed to get a scalping chair up there without anyone noticing is beyond me! Some may like the distancing from the previous movies but for me this is a slight shift towards conventional slasher movies. Acting wise it's rather mediocre. Apart from Tobin Bell quite a bankable name now because of the Saw franchise a number of small stars litter the film and help keep the costs down. For me the only other name that stands out is Donnie Wahlberg and even he is somewhat wasted. As expected it's reliant on flashbacks some of which made me feel like I was watching a soap opera rather than a horror. However director Darren Lynn Bousman does fulfil on account of gore pushing Saw IV with 'inyourface' violence and close ups that probably wouldn't have passed through the BBFC with an uncut 18 certificate five years ago. If you've been following the franchise then you can't help but be roped along for the ride. I certainly was. For something that was written shot edited and practically giftwrapped all inside one year it still works. It's just a shame that what was once so original three years ago now feels stale with hardly anything new to offer. Hell there aren't even any jumpy moments! Given the rushjob nature at dishing out sequels maybe they'll have more fun at turning it into some kind of weeklymonthly TV series.I really do hope that this is the last one because really now enough is enough. But as Jigsaw says the games have just begun. Rating  five out of ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I went to see Saw IV yesterday night. What do we actually gain from this movie? Basically it shows nothing new it's like a reprise of Saw III. And the question is do we prefer Saw III or Saw? Saw started with only two guys chained in a bathroom wondering where they are and what's this all actually about and those questions are typical for existentialism. The point of this movie reminded me a lot of No Exit written by JeanPaul Sartre.Both Saw II and Saw III distinguish from the first Saw but Saw IV doesn't bring anything new. It sticks to its prequel. We get to see the same scenes flashbacks the same places and again we face those Jigsaw traps that never seem to end. I think that we all know by now what Jigsaw really wants and how we are supposed to play. But the detectives and agents seem to lack intelligence and don't listen to his rules. That's how we face again the catastrophe of this spectacle. We also get to see a bit of John's past and his exwife Jill. I thought she was there to reveal something new about John but she never does.Actually Saw IV offers quite a lot many traps many people who got into them many stories and also a lot of blood and violence. The truth is I don't want to see those things anymore. I have already seen all of that in Saw III. It's like the creators of the movie are falling with every sequel deeper and deeper into meaninglessness. They have forgotten a long time ago about the meaning of this whole thing and rather decided to focus on blood and violence. Too bad the team Leigh Whannell and James Wan the founders of Saw does not any longer exist. Nothing can save Saw anymore.But the director Darren Lynn Bousman keeps on trying which is actually a big plus. He really can create the atmosphere that fits best to the movie.I have also nothing against the new actors that appear in Saw IV p.e. Costas Mandylor and Scott Patterson who played really professionally for those two roles that they got.I guess I still hope that they will save Saw because I'm a big fan although I already assume that the situation is hopeless. They have sunk too deep.Good luck with the next sequel. You will definitely need it.710".

It was a stretch you see because I think after the first one the movies went way downhill. Of course I didn't realize how badly they'd gone downhill until I saw this one.This is not the most grotesque of these films although the autopsy at the beginning of the film is enough to make you lose your lunch popcorn or whatever. Naturally a tape is found reminding the police that the game is just beginning.This in itself begs the question why exactly are the police the targets of Jigsaw's games? This was a man whose past victims included a man who wanted to die a swindler a drug addict an apathetic young man an uncaring doctor and criminals in general. So why does Jigsaw have it in for the cops? Okay the shady cop is one that made sense but why the others? Who knows? I don't think they care anymore.But wait...is it really Jigsaw at all? He died in the last one the said autopsy is proof of that. Well anyone who saw Saw 2 or 3 knows where this is going even a child could figure out that its not Jigsaw anymore but one of his students. To illustrate how ridiculous this film gets in the final scene you see the man from the third movie still looking for his daughter and the remains of the Doctor who got her head blown off. As Jigsaw died in this room along with his initial student why exactly wouldn't the coroners actually take the Doctor's body? Why would this man still be running around looking for his daughter? Are the rest of the bodies still littering the building? Of course if you've seen any of the other three Saw movies you realize there is a gory aftermath which is inevitably followed by a rehashing of ALL the events that have happened proving that everything is interconnected. Lets face it...the rehashing in itself is meant to say to the audience see you didn't notice how all of this is intertwined however how many times can this finale play over and over again before it simply patronizing? How about giving your audience some credit? We've been down this road three times before if you're going to change the direction of the films then do it in a way that doesn't rely on a cheap retelling of events that would make Aesop recoil in agony!If you're a torture porn fan there will be plenty of gore and torture for you to indulge in and no doubt Saw V will be out Halloween 2008. If you're looking for a good movie however you'd best try your luck with 30 Days of Night. Enough of this franchise it is just getting dumber and dumber.".

Okay sure this movie is gory but comparatively speaking it's SawLite. Here we have more of a back story of Jigsaw and the Mrs. as he had died in the previous film. That's not a spoiler the movie starts with his autopsy. It didn't really gross me out as it was all medical though it might be not for the squeamish. It does set the scene for some of his postmortem games  basically what parts IV are set up since they killed off the main characterringleader. Unfortunately as that's a key plot point to keep the series or games alive and incidentally its downfall. From there you never know if you're in the present or past. It is flashback upon flashback including hilariously the now madefamous flashback within the flashback. I saw that once on 'The Simpsons' and that was hysterical. Unfortunately here it's to be taken seriously though I still laughed. Just to jump ahead a bit in 'Saw V' it's more relevant but part 'IV' sets the stage where they simply just make up stuff that happened in the background to keep the story alive. If you watch this movie or the following ones you'll see where character's just appear where the writers want them to  around corners behind doors etc. I pity them as it seems like they're grasping at straws to keep the series going.

	schema:reviewBody "Will it ever end? I don't know but after this one I'm eager for more still! I know what you're thinking it's been overdone. I admit that it's your opinion and you can judge the series after three movies but you don't close the book on the 3rd movie when the story is just beginning.Should you bother seeing this movie if you haven't seen the other Saw movies? No. What if you like gore and suspense... sure. But this movie is strictly for the Saw fans who have seen the first three and followed every step and hint otherwise it's a big waste of time. The only thing that helps those people is that every Saw movie shows flashbacks. Honestly though it's not as useful as seeing them to begin with.Now to the movie...This was the first Saw movie that was not written by Leigh Whannel. Is this a problem? I don't really think so. Saw IV was just as riveting and plotdetailed as the first three. I watched the movie tonight with 2 friends in a closed theatre and we were all talking during the entire movie asking each other questions and trying to figure out the plot. I feel bad for the massive amounts of people cramming the theatre on opening night there's going to be so much talking it will be unbearable to follow. Who's that guy? Do you think he really died? I bet he's playing a game as well. Not so much fun.Let me be completely honest about this movie and that will be all for me. There were many twists and turns all what we hoped for. The details are superb everything clicked and was managed well. Most of all the gore violence and games were top notch. I was stunned at how amazing the tests were... seriously. It was a joy to watch.Completely entertaining. If you liked the first Saws then you will not want to miss this one. 7 out of 10. In my opinion it was better than Saw III but slightly below Saw II... and of course not near the original. But still Saw IV was brilliant.".

	schema:headline " The trap in Saw IV is the movie itself!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Saw movies always feature people stuck in terrible trap in which to survive they must go through excruciating torture. The latest installment in the series Saw IV is one of these traps itself in which you will either suffer through 95 minutes of excruciating torture or commit suicide before the end credits come up.The first Saw was an accomplished horror movie. It was new and interesting as well as very unsettling. Most of the film was spent in a single room and it focused more on suspense rather than gore. As new installments came to theaters there was a gradual decline of suspense and the focus was put more on gore and torture. By the time Saw III rolled around the entire movie was basically disturbing torture but there were at least a few scenes that attempted to be frightening.Now that Saw IV is out you can tell that they're really dragging this series out as far as it will go. This installment has two separate story lines one in which a police officer is put through a series of tests to save his friend. Although Saw IV had a new writing team the story is almost identical to the one in Saw III which wasn't a good story to begin with. The movie is set up to showcase as much gore and torture as possible which means the main character's trap is that he has to try and free other people from traps and more often than not they die excruciatingly painful deaths. The storyline isn't scary and there isn't even an attempt to be. The director Darren Lynn Bousman just tries to cram as much torture into the film as he can. This is exactly the same type of storyline we got in the third Saw. It sucked in the third one too but at least it was original. The only difference between the story lines is that in Saw III we got a lady's rib cage being torn open and in Saw IV it's a lady's scalp being torn off.Not only is the whole movie pointless it's poorly written too. This has to be the first Saw movie where I'm almost positive I could've escaped from at least two of the traps easily. They are so poorly designed. It's a miracle at least half the characters die in them as they rely solely on unlikely coincidences and chance. In the first Saw the characters tried many different attempts at escaping and all angles were covered. In this one everything just falls into place perfectly and the victims in the traps never do the smart thing. It doesn't even make sense. We never learn why the hell the main character couldn't just call the police and have them come help him work his way through the traps as there is nothing stopping him yes in Saw IV the main character actually has the option to not partake in the trap at all if he wanted.The second storyline is told through flashbacks and attempts to explain why Jigsaw the old man creating these gruesome devices got into the business of killing people. This new storyline provides absolutely nothing interesting or any insight into why he became what he is. The audience was already given enough of an explanation for his motives in the previous three films. Saw IV just adds a new unnecessary motive involving Jigsaw and his exwife. Not only is it pointless it's poorly done too. Tobin Bell wasn't a recognized actor before the Saw series and now I know why. He has no acting ability and can't convey any emotion. The flashbacks are supposed to show his progression from a regular guy into a crazy psycho but he acts exactly the same throughout the entire storyline. Even at a pivotal moment when something terrible happens to him that is supposed to change him we get shots of him standing there with the same damn expression on his face.A key part of the Saw movies is the twist ending but they aren't even trying anymore. It's as if they just threw in the first thing that came to mind. The twist comes out of nowhere and further insults the audience by showing flashbacks to different points throughout the course of the movie as if they are supposed to point in any way to the nonsensical twist. There are so many plot holes in the last 10 minutes including the fact that the characters all do random idiotic things that nobody on this planet would ever do in the given situation as well as a death straight out of Final Destination which I guess could happen but it's just cheesy.When it comes down to it if you liked Saw III there's an inkling of a possibility that you may enjoy Saw IV. They both lack suspense a good plot and good writing but at least Saw III was original. If you're looking for a good horror movie I suggest you go see 30 Days of Night. I'm not going to debate whether or not 30 Days was a good horror film in a review for Saw IV but it at least attempted to be good. Saw IV doesn't even try. It just tries to show off tons of gore and adds a twist at the end and hopes the fans will eat it up.".

Sure as a standalone movie it's quite confusing. I would strongly recommend viewing the previous three before this one otherwise as aforementioned you'll be lost throughout the movie. As expected IV had all the downright blood gore and grisly traps that I've come to know and love from the series in addition to explaining a bit more about Jigsaw's past and the inner workings of his little 'setup'. I understood that ALL of my questions wouldn't be answered that's what Saws V and VI are for. But I was satisfied that some of the most important 'puzzles' had gotten a few more pieces by the completion of IV. All in all I view the Saw franchise as a 'thinking man's horror' kind of series. If you can tie the four movies together in your mind it makes a lot more sense and you can understand what's happening better. So I'll give it a 1010 for avid Saw fans like myself and even a modest 710 for people that aren't too into it. Saw IV is definitely worth watching through regardless of your stand.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another year another Halloween approaching and thus another Saw film. Why oh why. The Saw franchise should of stopped producing sequels after the first one. Pehaps even after the second. It was blatantly a cash in. The first Saw epitomised the sheer genius of torture horror of the new millennium  which has sparked off subgenre type films like Hostel and Vacancy.Saw I was the king of psychological grim violence fest that had you hooked to the edge of your seat and with a finale to die for. It was sheer brilliance. The second movie saw the new apprentice from the survivor of Saw I taking over Jigsaw's work. Pretty much giving us flashbacks of the processes involved etc etc and giving a pretty cool twist at the end. It wasn't as good as Saw I but it was a decent sequel. In my opinion. It should of stopped here. But this wasn't enough. Instead they went the extra mile and made Saw III even gorier and even more grim for kicks. It was shoddy poor pathetically acted and a letdown.Saw IV however takes the biscuit. Not only was it bad all the way through and completely ridiculously over the top it was without a doubt one of the worst films I've seen this year. A few familiar faces couldn't even help it nurse its way upwards from Saw III in fact Saw III was just completely irrelevant. The whole point of Saw III was for Saw IV to pick up where it left off. Not kill off the poor bugger who had to do the rest of his tests to find his daughter. To be quite honest by the end of Saw IV I just didn't even care who was in it so many name checks so many people and the story and flashbacks just went all over the place. It was more confusing than a Rubik's cube.What really annoyed me was the cheese factor about the whole line at the end of the movie Game Over. As soon as this line flopped out of insert random character that really has no reference to the movie franchise what so ever here's mouth it just summed up what I really hope will happen. Saw. Game Over.It's been rinsed far too much now and its getting boring. No longer do I even care about people getting tortured and killed in the most interesting of ways. The spark has now disappeared from Saw. Its no longer a cult thing thanks to its sheer poor sequelsprequels.If you do like the Saw franchise you'll probably fall headover heels in love with this instalment and get suckerpunched ready for what can only be called a diabolical 5th and 6th movie. I personally want to get rid of the memory of watching this movie and the 3rd movie possibly even the second movie. The fact remains if you haven't seen any of the Saw movies stick with the first. It will at least give the franchise some sort of credibility for being one of the best films this genre has to offer.".

If you spend much time in Hawaii you'll notice hotels that don't exists yet and several that are even being built during the filming of this movie. Specifically you can see the Outrigger Waikiki under construction as well as what is now known as the Resortquest Waikiki Beach. Ironically the Resortquest Waikiki Beach is now an Elvis era themed hotel. The Sheraton Waikiki is an empty lot.Another really neat observation is the scene at the beach park near Chinaman's hat. It is literally timeless! The beach looks the same today as it does in the movie. Almost everything else has changed in many ways.The film won't be an example of great acting and certainly the plot leaves a lot to be desired. On the other hand it's fun to see the island from 40 years ago. Even Kalakaua Ave is a twoway street!".

Elvis was dropdead gorgeous in Blue Hawaii there were some great songs and it had Angela Lansbury in the cast.By the time this movie was made Elvis looked out of it and he was stuffed into a tapered shirt. Back in the old days they used to teach actors to pull their stomachs in when standing in profile. No one told Elvis. In some scenes he looks as if he doesn't know where he is.There is no plot just dazzling scenery. The songs are rotten. Donna Butterworth as the daughter of James Shigeta is excellent  what a voice. James Shigeta is good as well. There are a few good scenes  the one in the helicopter with the dogs is one. I'm sure I can think of more... The excuses for Elvis to burst into song are tragic.It's amazing how such an important career was peppered with so many unimportant films thanks to his management i.e. Colonel Parker. Elvis could have dumped him and gone to anyone in the world but he was a hillbilly with enormous gifts belief in his own power not being one of them. He was confident with his music but he was superstitious and felt he couldn't make without Colonel Parker. It's a shame  as brilliant a career as Elvis had it could have been so much more. He could have toured Europe and Japan for instance  if only Colonel Tom wasn't in the country illegally. And he could have made better movies. The offers were there but Colonel Tom was afraid of losing control.So Colonel Tom held a tight rein on Elvis. Paradise Hawaiian Style is one example of his brilliant management of one of the greatest talents that ever existed. Proceed at the risk of being hulaed to death.".

It's the famous theme from Donovan's Reef also shot in Hawaii and another favorite of mine.That center was the highlight of the attractions I saw in the Aloha State and should not be missed by any tourists.Another reviewer said the film must have been a deal with the Hawaiian Tourism Board with all the beautiful outdoor location shooting.

It's not an official sequel but that's a mere technicality.  The only real difference between the two films is that this one is infinitely worse.  Whereas Blue Hawaii was little more than a travelogue it was professional looking  with some decent songs and a star who still seemed to be in touch with some form of reality.  Paradise Hawaiian Style is a grubby grimy cheap looking thing with a pudgy seemingly zonked out Elvis warbling tunes so dreadful Queenie Wahine's Papaya Datin' they weren't worthy of the vinyl record on which they were pressed let alone a gold one.Watching Presley in this wretched vehicle one can only look on in amazement and wonder if this is indeed the same sneering guy who set the world on fire a decade earlier.  This is a Twilight Zone Elvis in a movie for those curious to know how the state of mind known as stunned disbelief really feels.".

Paradise Hawaiian Style is a grubby grimy cheap looking thing with a pudgy seemingly zonked out Elvis warbling tunes so dreadful Queenie Wahine's Papaya Datin' they weren't worthy of the vinyl record on which they were pressed let alone a gold one.Watching Presley in this wretched vehicle one can only look on in amazement and wonder if this is indeed the same sneering guy who set the world on fire a decade earlier.  This is a Twilight Zone Elvis in a movie for those curious to know how the state of mind known as stunned disbelief really feels.";

It has a silly plot and the scenery is more of an attraction than story itself. The one actress that steals the show is not one of the bevy of beauties that Elvis woos. It comes more in the form of 10year old Donna Butterworth. She steals every scene that she is in and not a bad singer at all. I have roamed heaven and earth to try to find out what has happened to young Donna. If anyone knows drop me an email. Anyway if you are looking for a good time killer watch this film.".

English beauty Suzanna Leigh plays the leading Elvis Girl in this Movie...what a fabulous figure!! 9 year old Donna Butterworth is arguably the most memorable female in the movie however with a series of scene stealing performances that makes it hard to understand how this was her final film. She sings two songs with Elvis  the silly Queenie Wahini's Papaya and the tongue in cheek Datin' as well as a number of her own at a party. Elvis plays out of work pilot Rick Richards sounds more like a Nascar driver! who sets up a helicopter tourist business with his pal Danny Kohana little Donna's dad and digs himself into a hole by loaning funds to back his business from a bevvie of beauties he'd fled from 2 years earlier. Like most Elvis movies  it's enjoyable. Silly but enjoyable entertainment never likely to win awards get nominated for awards or even top anybody's favourite film lists but sometimes it's good  especially for Elvis fans  to just sit back enjoy some easy entertaining viewing. These films might have been panned in their day  even by the man himself  but now it's great to have so much visual footage of The King singing talking romancing joking and fighting even though this is the movie where for the first time it looks apparent that Elvis had grown tired of Hollywood and his dreams of being a serious movie star. His previous few movies had been particularly soft and heavily criticised and mocked and Elvis doesn't look as good as he had even 6 months earlier in Harum Scarum a trend and a look that would continue over into his next few films most notably Clambake.".

	schema:reviewBody "Elvis Presley was a hugely influential performer with one of the most distinctive singing voices of anybody. He embarked on a film career consisting of 33 films from 1956 to 1969 films that did well at the boxoffice but mostly panned critically especially his later films and while he was a highly charismatic performer he was never considered a great actor.Am of the opinion that his early efforts pre'Kissin' Cousins' his first mediocre at best film ranged from decent to very good while his films between 'Kissin' Cousins' and 'Harum Scarum' were more variable. Of his films 'King Creole' 'Flaming Star' 'Jailhouse Rock' 'Viva Las Vegas' and 'Loving You' fare best. Those films and most of his late 50searly 60s films looked good had great soundtracks great supporting casts and showed that Elvis could be a very capable actor when his material allowed it even when the dialogue and stories were in a few of them were not strong suits 'King Creole' was a notable exception though. Am also of the opinion that Elvis' film career was an uneven one while there were good films and performances there were also bad films where he looked bored where the films had not so good soundtracks and looked cheap a notable example being his previous film 'Harum Scarum' widely considered one of his worst for good reason.Worse efforts than 'Paradise Hawaiian Style'? Marginally yes it is a little better than 'Harum Scarum' and some of his later films. It is still a lesser effort in his career though. Not terrible but very much mediocre and most components even less than that.There are good things with 'Paradise Hawaiian Style'. It looks pretty good with suitably exotic scenery beautifully photographed. It is not as cheaplooking as his later films or previous efforts like 'Kissin' Cousins' 'Harum Scarum' and 'Frankie  Johnny'.Of a pretty poor cast generally Donna Butterworth is the one good standout sweet and charming with a great voice. The soundtrack is one of the overall worst for an Elvis film but the title song just about passes muster as a nice enough song.Otherwise there is very little to recommend it. The material throughout is not up to par and it is abundantly clear that Elvis himself knows it. He is the most uncomfortable he's ever been up to that point and looks utterly bored and like he wasn't even trying to act. The supporting cast are no better with the girls having sex appeal but nothing more than that and the rest having little to do and doing nothing with it. Chemistry is nonexistent.As for the songs to say that they are unmemorable and subpar is being far too kind to these adjectives. Quite frankly apart from one they are a complete embarrassment with the titles and lyrics to make one groan feel thrown in are sloppily lipsynched indifferently staged and performed with no engagement. The direction is throughout dull.Have no better news to say about the script and story. The script will make the toes curl of even people not expecting much from the script in the first place after all people don't watch an Elvis film for the script or expecting it to be good in even some of the best efforts the dialogue is a weak link. The story is like a retread of 'Blue Hawaii' and by now is well shopworn it's also paper thin sluggishly paced and goes well overboard on the silliness. Complete with naff being annoying and far too saccharine scenes with children that just drag the film down even further.In conclusion mediocre at best film where describing it as paradise is very much ironic. 410 Bethany Cox".

He comes back to his island buddies in Hawaii to start a new helicopter charter business with his pilot friend. It seems to be working out well for them until his old ways start catching him Apart from throwing into a song every 10 minutes the film features a nice cast who play the various friends of Elvis Presley's character Rick. Of particular note is Donna Butterworth a young girl with a great voice who looks like she had a lot of fun making this 1966 film.The film also features a pair of everpresent Bell 47J Ranger helicopters quite often seen making max. performance takeoffs and hasty landings. The film is a real treat for aircraft and helicopter enthusiasts who get to see these old machines in great detail up close. A lot of backprojection is used for the flying scenes featuring closeups of Elvis and the other cast members and the scenery is beautiful.One particular scene has the chopper flying through a mountainous valley with dives and climbs not usually seen performed by such helicopters. Another scene has a bunch of canine passengers causing havoc for Elvis as he tries to fly the chopper getting low and fast scaring locals and crashing a car.The legendary Elvis is particularly wooden in this film just going through the motions to make a film with no real depth to his role otherwise it is an enjoyable film for the entire family.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paradise Hawaiian Style is a somewhat bizarre mix of Guy Lombardo and Magnum P.I.. Younger viewers seeking an answer to why the British Invasion of the mid1960's was almost instantly successfully need look no further than this film. By 1966 Elvis Presley had gone from a target audience of teenagers looking to scare their parents with his sensual style of rock and roll to being the heartthrob of the nursing home circuit electing to skip entirely the huge demographic between these two groups. The British Invasion was able to hit our beaches almost unopposed.A rather tired looking Elvis plays Rick Richards a sweettalking womanizing airline pilot who finds himself unemployed and back in the islands. Rick teams up with his old island buddy Danny Kohana James Shigeta of Flower Drum Song fame to open a helicopter charter service. Shigeta is pretty good in this role as a responsible family man who must ride herd on his philandering partner. Rick's female conquests prove useful in drumming up charter customers while these arrangements can be blamed for the repeatedly lame joke and song about scratching each others back.Setting back women's lib by several years is female pilot Judy Hudson played by Suzanna Leigh who is relegated to receptionist duties as the boys do all the flying. Leigh is a staggeringly untalented actress and could be a source of many mockfest moments if that's your idea of a good time.Marianne Hill a good actress who a couple years later turned in a memorable guest performance on Star Trek plays Rick's main love interest. My guess is that the two female parts were originally combined and that the producers owed some favors so they split up the character. A disservice to the movie as there is not enough remaining in either part to connect with an already unengaged audience.A touch of cuteness was added by casting Donna Butterworth as Rick's 10year old daughter. She and The King have a couple decent numbers together the only songs worthy of your attention. As in Blue Hawaii there are island themed musical productions but no actual island songs or music. And the geriatric garbage Elvis sings is surreal in its wholesomeness. Just a few years before many parents had been reluctant to let the television appearances of this dangerous predator into their living rooms.One thing to note is the total absence of closeups. Elvis had gone all Frank Sinatra by this point and was strictly limiting the amount of time he spent on the set. Since he appears in most of the movie this meant that the director had to make do with wide master shots and second unit stuff. A bad thing because pointofview acting for the camera and character identification are all casualties of this Minnelli style of filmmaking. Yet a good thing as the second unit does a great job with the aerial sequences the scenery and the natives all of which is nicely showcased on the DVD which was made from a excellent original.Also worth watching for from a film school perspective is one of the worst directed sequences you are likely to find in any mainstream production. Midway through the film Elvis and some unknown and eager looking starlet are placed in a scene with about a half dozen dogs. This is supposed to be a comic moment as the misbehaving dogs cause the copter to fly wildly around the island studio shots of Elvis cut into 2nd unit outdoor flying sequences and when it finally lands Elvis and the bubbly actress emerge looking completely disheveled. But they can't get much action from the sedated dogs and the director can't get much energy from the bored Elvis. So you have shot after shot of this overeager starlet mugging for the camera and overreacting to the phantom disruptions of the dogs who were too sleepy to be a factor.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

I guess I should start off by saying that Elvis gives a truly bad performance here but considering the script I guess you can't blame him nor can you blame him for doing so many drugs. It's strange but it's easy to tell that he's not interested in the film as he pretty much sleepwalks through the entire thing but I also noticed that a lot of the scenes seemed to be rushed by him as if he was wanting to get the film over very quickly and to do so he read the lines extremely fast. It also seems like he might not have even known the lines as he's constantly looking to the side of him and appears to be reading some of the lines. I wouldn't bash him too hard because the film is stupid from the opening titles to the very last scene. The supporting players are all pretty lousy and Dona Butterworth didn't impress me either. There's one incredibly silly scene with them two singing on a beach but there's an even worse scene with Elvis flying a helicopter while singing to a bunch of dogs who eventually get into a fight. There's some nice locations but that's pretty much it. I was also shocked to see that David Hess from The Last House on the Left wrote one of the songs.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Joneses is not topshelf satire. Its concept does suggest that it could be something of a great little suburban parable something that years ago could have come up on the Twilight Zone. An upper middle class or let's face it upper class family of four the Joneses Steve Kate Jenn and Mick move in to a very nice new house. The neighbors are impressed already and become even more impressed or just jealous of how they live which is quite well and with many little extravagances other people would want. This is because they actually aren't a 'real' family they're a corporate selling unit put together by a company looking to have a family sell to the richest yuppies young and middleaged or old in the area by creating envy and ultimately mass consumption.It's a wicked little game made up so that all of the relationships of the Jonses with the outside world are of a shallow synthetic nature by design. There can be attachments but it's preferred that things stay on a simple amiable socialnetworking level so that more people buy more stuff to fill in their bigass houses. What the filmmakers explore is this idea but also the nature of the family unit and what happens with these people when they're around each other for such a period of time. Kate Moore is the leader of the unit making sure everyone is up to par on their sale percentages especially Steve Duchovney a failed golf pro turned car salesman who is on shaky ground. He's not completely full of crap so it takes a little while for him to find his bearings selling the lifestyle he and the Jones' leads but at the same time he also has actual notfake feelings for Kate which throws a monkey wrench in things especially his oncoming icon status.A lot of this sounds good but the reason it's not really a topshelf satire is that it just stops short just when it looks like it will take off. It hints at being a dark look at suburbia and hints at a kind of underthemat aspect like American Beauty. But the characters don't get very well defined after their initial set up Steve is the good guy Kate is the slightly conflicted working woman Mick the closeted homosexual 'son' and Jenn the girl sleeping with a married man or whomever she can find i.e. Steve. This also goes for supporting characters like the one the talented Gary Cole plays as the Joneses nextdoor neighbor who is such a consumer whore that he doesn't see what harm he's causing to his busybody wife and marriage in general his downfall is very predictable. And the last several minutes of the film is especially too 'happy' meaning that whatever scathing undercurrent of capitalist nightmare realized going on in the first half of the film is resolved in such a way that is obvious.However this shouldn't discourage what is good about the film because what is good is very good. When the script is witty it's very witty and when the actors are likable they shine off the screen. Demi Moore hasn't been this appealing perhaps ironically so considering her cold businesslike character in years Duchovney does well as a genuinely good person who happens to be working like a conman Amber Heard is the newest hot girl on the block seemingly genetically engineered between Kiera Knightley and Kristen Stewart's good looks. It's simply an excellent premise that takes off only so much as to its conventional screenplay will allow some intrusive songs also don't help much and sort of detract from more dramatic points.".

Demi Moore hasn't been this appealing perhaps ironically so considering her cold businesslike character in years Duchovney does well as a genuinely good person who happens to be working like a conman Amber Heard is the newest hot girl on the block seemingly genetically engineered between Kiera Knightley and Kristen Stewart's good looks. It's simply an excellent premise that takes off only so much as to its conventional screenplay will allow some intrusive songs also don't help much and sort of detract from more dramatic points.";

If it was a romantic film it failed to make me care or be excited by the prospect of a relationship if it was a comedy it failed to make me laugh. The film didn't make me feel any empathy for the characters and while I enjoyed the actors' performances it fell flat on the entertainment value. I successfully predicted all the way through exactly what would happen. The film had no driving force didn't seem to be building up to anything and the clichd ending wasn't the closure I wanted.However it was not all bad. It was very well shot with beautiful sets and was visually exciting with first class editing. It was an original plot based on a solid concept. Because of this it could have been really good offering the audience a mirror in which to view themselves and what society has become. Whilst it did become a bit of a thinker and made me wonder what extent we go to to have the best of everything it ultimately failed to truly strike at the heart of the topic and left me feeling like there were gaps that should have been filled throughout the film.Overall a watchable film but not entirely enjoyable.".

I really liked his acting in Californication and was interested how he would act in a standard comedydrama film or so it would seem from the preview I saw. Because this movie is much more then a standard comedydrama film. It deals with much more moral questions about life. I won't give much away because you really have to go into this film not knowing anything as I did. The acting was just good with only Duchovny excelling. Once you understand what's going on in the movie the script is a bit predictable but not so much as that it would ruin the movie for you. Also I don't understand why this movie isn't much bigger. It's made hardly any money and no one's heard about it yet it's a film that stands out and should get more attention.I went into this movie because I'm a fan of Duchovny and was expecting a mediocre film but it turned out to be so much more.Go see this film you won't be disappointed.".

However the message keeps feeling valid and I also liked the humanity that screenwriter Derrick Borte who was also the director brought to the characters. Nevertheless it could be said from another point of view that the emphasis on the characters' relationships with each other withdraws force to the satire and as a consequence I could not feel an adequate connection between both aspects.I think that the performances are this film's main pro. I think that David Duchovny already surpassed the stigmata of Agent Mulder thanks to his work in independent films and in the excellent TV series Californication I think his performance in The Joneses shows him equally credible. As for Demi Moore she reminds us that she is not only a celebrity but also a solid actress whenever she works with the right material. Her work in The Joneses is subtle and honest something which can perfectly express the internal conflict her character has during the whole movie. And I also liked the performances from Gary Cole and Glenne Headly pretty much.In conclusion the lack of focus from the screenplay its bland satire and its weak ending make The Joneses not to be a very satisfactory film. However I can give it a slight recommendation because it kept me moderately entertained because of the solid performances and some interesting aspects from the screenplay.".

The idea is interesting the cast is credible and the film itself is totally worthwhile but overall it falls short in delivering what could've been a great capturing of our current culture and the way we behave as consumers.Being in advertising I know first hand the power of influence. Clients pay credible sources to promote a product and product sales go up. It's a pretty simple math equation. With the advent of the Internet bloggers and social media we're now seeing firsthand that consumers no longer rely on advertisements to change their behaviors they rely on their communities. The Joneses takes this simple concept just one step further. They are a perfect family paid to promote a lifestyle.On paper the Joneses are living the dream. A beautiful family with David Duchovny playing husband Demi Moore playing wife and two kids played by equally as attractive individuals that have everything they want and more. The twist? Everything they own from their house to their hour de' vours were paid for in return for a selfless promotion and subtle push of a product. With each family member responsible for a certain percentage of sales we see dad commandeering the sale of golf clubs brother slanging new products from Sony sister making waves in makeup sales and mom showcasing her newest line of shoes. It's all fake but it works. They are living the dream and everyone around them wants a piece of the action.The film quickly takes a slight turn for the worse when the Joneses realize despite all the glitz and glamor that they really aren't so happy after all. They alienate friends have no real family and influence those around them to spend so much money to attain something less substantial than they already have. A few emotional scenes after another lead to the final moments of the film that prove rewarding but at the same time less spectacular than what was expected from such a promising premise.All in all the Joneses brought something new to the table but in a way that didn't resonate too well with me or most individuals that saw it. It's a great mediocre movie but I'm typically now in the mood to recommend mediocre regardless of how good it is. The Joneses gets two stars I wouldn't work to hard to promote it but in the end I'll say that it's a semipleasant product.For more reviews visit httpwww.popcornjury.comMichael BuffaEditor Popcorn Jury".

This was pitched as a drama but there were laughs all the way through. Very cool. The chemistry between Duchovny and Demi was explosive and Amber Heard was even hotter. Great story very well told. I highly recommend it to all looking for a smart funny biting ride!!!! Like Truman Show meets American Beauty. Great music cinematography acting direction. This is just what America needs!!!! TIFF brochure said it best...We should start thinking about who we want to be not what we want to buy. This film will be the subject of watercooler discussions once it hits theaters.".

This was pitched as a drama but there were laughs all the way through. Very cool. The chemistry between Duchovny and Demi was explosive and Amber Heard was even hotter. Great story very well told.

Their performances are so understated and honest that you buy into and enjoy everything. Nothing is overdone. The dialogues by all the cast are also seamless and honest. No really uncomfortable moments. You know something is wrong with this family but what? Oh you do find out early on and when you know then you need to see how it ends.

Playing out like a social satire on consumerism and advertising and just about poking fun at everyone who's guilty of keeping up with the Joneses in literal fashion here a family of four becomes the quintessential personification of just those successful people whom we all aspire to become emulate or just plain desire to excel over.We're introduced to what seemed like the perfect household where Steve David Duchovny spends his time mowing the lawn and playing golf and you wonder how and how much dough and bacon he brings home. Kate Demi Moore occupying her time with all things necessary to look hot and beautiful Jenn Amber Heard being the beautiful teenage daughter who's the flower of the school and Mick Ben Hollingsworth the geeky but popular boy whose toys and gadgets make him the go to guy. Recently moving into a new neighbourhood the Jones family soon become the envy of their neighbours with everyone lapping up what they drive drink wear and have. If you want to be with the cool crowd then you need to well keep up with the Joneses.Until of course the facade is pulled back and we realize that it's all about inyourface yet sublime piece of advertising where product placement both in the reel and don't forget the real world are pretty much featured everywhere allowing you to make mental note to get that golf club or that Audi sports car if you have the dough. It's about the selling of a concept lifestyle and this form of getting the word out through actual talking about and sampling the product is nothing but a real world kind of inception with the planting of mindshare firmly in the minds of the masses.As mentioned it's a must for sales people to watch as it dwells on relationships or the lack thereof when we fervently pursue numbers that define the occupation with revenues sales and profits being the sole focus of existence. Will we trade relationship for that climb up the corporate ladder? Will we not team up with fellow colleagues to ensure we capitalize on each other's strengths? And why not also go all out with joint marketing efforts? It also pays off for looking physically attractive because like it or not a beautiful face with the right kind of networking contacts and connections get plenty of doors opened.There's plenty to like from this Derrick Borte film from a Randy T. Dinzler story which examines the effect of consumerism on relationships between family members neighbours and society in general critiquing in a nice manner without adding insult to injury when we see shades of ourselves in one or more of the characters. There's plenty of sharp wit cheeky winks and double meanings going around that you can't help but to chuckle at and with the characters who exercise the mantra of not mixing business with personal but soon find themselves through their various character arc subplots crossing the line with various consequences.In similar vein with Thank You For Smoking The Joneses had plenty going for it as you sit back and watch society's faults and woes on display with a dash of comedy and a tinge of pathos thrown in. For the cynic in me I would have liked it if it had ended on a bleaker note given how society selfdestructs when some of us spend beyond our means just to show off but I guess again in times like these where most parts of the world are bouncing out of a recession that glimmer of hope about the light at the end of the tunnel would likely be more welcome. Highly recommended and I'll not hesitate to shortlist this film as one of the best of this year!".

	schema:reviewBody "I like the general premise of this movie that people regularly allow their behavior to be controlled by market forces no matter how unscrupulous and exploitative those forces are. Directly exploring the idea that we all too easily allow greeddriven marketers to manipulate us into spending large amounts of money  which we often cannot afford as exemplified by the eventual fate of the nextdoor neighbor  is laudable and this film does not completely miss the mark on that point. However when one of the characters gets a new car in which the make of the car is so blatantly showcased by name and visually and several characters are fawning over the car I began to wonder just which group of oblivious innocents was really being sold a bill of marketing goods the neighbors via the plot or we the audience via yet another movie become multiple ads? The acting is good the script is weak and the plot is an interesting idea but not developed very well and is not believable at all. There seem to be many practical and even legal difficulties1. Is it really financially feasible to outlay the expenditure required to establish this affluent fake family to justify increasing the spending habits of the people they come into contact with? 2. Can the marketing corporation really track the success of individual members of the fake family well enough even to know specifically which family member has caused increased spending in specific industries? Mom is the only one who increases spending in makeup Dad is the only one who influences sporting goods sales Son is the only one who influences videogame sales etc? Please. 3. Are the family members who are posing as highschool students really highschool aged? If they are I would think there are all kinds of labor laws being broken and numerous other legal problems and if not then having an overage person enrolled in a high school and under a necessarily false identity is probably illegal in every state also. Either way the likely prospect of sexual activity between the fake kids and the minors they encounter which seems to be encouraged by the marketing company they work for the visiting supervisor pushes them to establish boyfriendgirlfriend relationships is a major legal stumbling block. 4. Can fake family units really be set up over and again with the necessary secrecy maintained? It seems a tactic destined to be exposed eventually and to cause a lot of damage to the marketing company involved and the products they promote.This is far too much disbelief to suspend. Even movie audiences have limits to our gullibility.".

	schema:reviewBody "Specifically nobody's family is perfect. But did we really need ninetyfive minutes of absolute nothing to tell us this? Probably not but it might have been excusable if it was actually done with some substance or style. Both of which are lacking in the Joneses. The Jones' family is not truly a family at all. They are a professional sales unit whose job it is to influence the demographics buying habits within the neighborhood their employer set them up in. There's a mother and father a teenage son and daughter but no dog. That seemed unusual to me considering what their employer was going for but hey it didn't really matter. In fact nothing in the movie really matters because you can never get a feel for the characters. No real interest in their situation or their feelings is established. So when problems do arise out of this makebelieve reality yes I know that's a contradiction you're not affected one way or the other. Apathy is probably the worst that can happen when watching a film and The Joneses succeeds admirably.Without a sense of who the characters are where they came from their motivations it's impossible to be involved in the unfolding of the plot. At about 50 minutes in I gave up hope of it kicking into gear and finished it only because I don't like to leave things incomplete. Maybe the writers should be more like me. This film seems underdeveloped to say the least. However Demi Moore does look absolutely fantastic even after all these years so I guess that's one bright spot in all this.Still unless you plan on ogling Moore's profile for the entire hour and half just skip it. Even if you do see it you'll forget all about it the second the credits roll.".

And things start to fall apart. And soon enough everyone is wondering who The Joneses really are.The Joneses is billed as a comedy. I didn't necessarily find it that funny. I found it more interesting than funny. The film is well acted. It's very entertainingand it's highly original. Is it as original as something like Inception? No. Well nothing this year will go against Inception.The Joneses isn't great. If it was aiming to be a comedy it fails. And I didn't fully understand parts of it.

Hmmm....this thing is perplexing.Upon exiting the theater this thought came came to mindthere's a program preceding Desperate Housewives that's all about building homes for free for unfortunate families. You know the show MCed by the guy with all the wild hair? Well anywayare we positive that the familial recipients of the free home are really family? Could it possibly be that they are actors hired as part of a  TV game to sell big ticket items by well known companies whose products must either be in or on every home in the United States or else the home really isn't a home? Before you come back and accuse me of being heartless which I'm notthink about the possibility and if you can't then by all means see The Jonses.Could it be that writer Randy T. Dinzler came up with the Jonses storyline from seeing that aforementioned program? Maybe. Maybe not but it's something to think about or then again maybe the reverse is true? At any rate it's fun to speculate.The Jonses is an ACE picture from start to finsh. The story is simply this a fake family moves into a ritzy neighborhood with the intention of selling everything possible but surreptitiously in order to make scads of money for the company for whom they work for themselves and to become an icon class i.e. a CELL with such a high volume selling status that manufacturers would have to consult with them first before releasing new products. The story isn't by a long shot all about selling. There is a heck of lot more to this film than that..you know stuff like lovedeceitsexual preferencesa bit of nudity but to go into specifics would spoil this terrific movie for you readers so all I can say is that if you want to spend 90 or so very enjoyable minutes watching a top notcher from 2010 The Joneses fits the bill.".

At times you get connected to the characters but in the next sequence it's all gone and again you're watch meritocracy at its best. Demi Moore looked stunning as always and David Duchovny well he is better then before.

Amber heard is Hot as usual  this time again we get to see her Beautiful Body. Ben Hollingsworth is a good looking guy and did a fine job.

The premise is interesting and is revealed in a really clever way and the ending was very satisfying and wrapped up the arc of the main characters in a very satisfying way.I looked at a number of reviews from professional journalists before watching the film and I have to say that some of them were pretty unfair. Other reviewers have talked about the ending being weak but I don't see what else the filmmakers could do  you have to resolve the characters otherwise what you get is the audience walking away wondering why they spent 90 minutes watching and caring about these characters in the first place.Which is how I felt at the end of Up in the Air  and I think the analogies work here. Up in the Air worked really well emotionally but thematically left me wondering how the main character had changed since the beginning of the film. And yet lots of critics have praised the film  makes me think there is something else that influences these reviews...and let's face it most journalists are themselves hacks that aren't talented enough to make a film.The theme in the Joneses is more interesting and the characters each arc in a very pleasing way. The logic makes sense whereas Up in the Air has the company fire people over the internet and then suddenly not even though the original complaints about the process are never answered the character arcs resolve and the tone which is a very difficult one to set here is it comedy is it biting satire is it a romantic comedy.no it's all of them always keeps you on your toes. I think directing this film would be very difficult and I have to give kudos to the first time director who walks a very tough line in this movie.Soif you liked Up in the Air but you felt there were big plot and thematic holes I would definitely go and see this filmand you'll come away glad that you did.".

There are just too many good things to be said about this movie can't believe some of the naysayers' comments.Every aspect of this movie stands out particularly the production values. The movie and actors are beautifully shot and directed in a way reminiscent of some of my favorite Australian movies Sirens comes to mind off the bat. The fluent editing and score carry the viewer through at just the right pace no artificial camera angst inflicted on the audience no fits and starts the feel is of a cool road trip wondering what will be seen next as opposed to the noxious shaky cam hyperrealism that plagues many movies today. Every single scene was well set and interesting. The script is excellent casting excellent. Bravo Mr. Borte and special kudos to Pam Mickelson casting Nick Urata music Susan Jacobs music direction.The acting is superb from all cast members. Duchovny manages to tone down the Californication wise ass persona into a still snarky but also genuine and lovable one of a lovesick man at a crossroads in life. Demi Moore also a crossroads character is outstanding as the hardened careerist who gradually cracks under Duchovny's persistent charms. The chemistry between Moore and Duchovny is sizzling and sincere. Cole and Headly are pros at the top of their game as usual perfectly subdued as foils who manage to bring humor and warmth to their roles in every scene. Lauren Hutton is a perfect icy corporate darksuit without becoming a typical Hollywood evil business caricature amazingly the movie is devoid of political slant so refreshing not to be banged about the head by some tooearnest filmmaker's agenda. Heard and Hollingsworth seem like old pros in measure with their youthful beauty and exuberance. Both of them are so otherworldly gorgeous yet they rise way above eye candy status.To the allegory part this movie moreso than American Beauty captures the modern American suburban condition and dilemma and unlike American Beauty manages to do so free of ideological baggage and heavyhanded clichs. By keeping the tone light we never feel preached down to or proselytized. The movie is devoid of an us v them feel that lots of modern allegories contain and is more wryly structured as us v us. Ironically the message of the movie is most applicable to the deluge of viral marketing devaluing the internet as an information source. The sales method in the Joneses is identical to the way entertainment is marketed on the net currently. Will coin the term here virola viral  payola to describe the obnoxious phenomenon. Movies like the Joneses memorialize what is going on without stepping on too many toes a great way to inoculate entertain and save the internet and other media just a bit at the same time.Could go on and on about this film could write a whole review about the symbolism tying the fake family to the average real consumer culture family will suffice it to say that the fake family is pretty obviously symbolic of all of us in our consumerist tendencies and in our desire to be socially accepted. We are all of us the Joneses. Had always hoped someone would do a treatment reminiscent of the Talking Heads song Found a Job worth googling the lyrics if you liked this movie and the Joneses is pretty spot on in doing that.I did take one star off a perfect ten for a test audience type ending that seemed tacked on. The movie should have Duchovny and Moore heading their separate ways having made their individual decisions.This review is admittedly gushy if you think it's shill hype read some of my others and you will know instantly it's fo real.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had high hopes for this film ever since I saw the teaser trailer of Gekko getting released from prison. It has everything you need for success. Iconic characters interesting subject good acting and great cinematography. Unfortunately I was greatly disappointed by snooze fest with a meandering story with no focus and some strange green message.The movie starts off trying to set up LeBeouf's characters motivation. But even that is never clear. Is he financially or morally invested in some fusion project or both? Does he want to get his girlfriend and her father back together for her or because he wants a new mentor? Is he a greedy Wall Street guy with great ideas or is he some Ecowarrior trying to change the world? And then there's some half assed revenge plot against some financial tycoon who ends up embodying the entire financial meltdown.Through out the film the audience is drug along as these plots come and go. At one point the most important thing to the main character is getting revenge against Brolin's character and ends up working for him. But instead of getting revenge he try's to get an investor in green technology. When his boss who's he trying to take down doesn't invest in the green technology LeBeouf's character breaks down and quits. So he forgets revenge and returns to getting his girlfriend back together with her father Gordon Gekko. At some point Gekko mentions he left his daughter 100 million which strangely enough is the exact amount that he wanted his last boss to invest in the green company. So he starts tricking his girlfriend into signing all the money over to her father who has promised to give it to the green company. LeBeouf's character is the only person on Earth who doesn't know that a guy who went to prison for insider trading might not be trust worthy. So surprise surprise Gekko runs off with the money and we are treated to a ripoff of The Usual Suspects as LeBeouf thinks back to all the situations that showed Gekko is lying. So he goes back to revenge.So all of that along with more uncomfortable close ups of a girl crying then I can count a number of strange transitions and the worst cameo I've ever seen with Charlie Sheen showing up as Bud Fox. He appears out of nowhere for no reason with two girls on his arm acting more like Charlie from Two and a Half Men than Bud Fox.All of this happens at a snails pace and makes you wonder if Stone has seen the first film in 20 years. I'm waiting for the sequel to Platoon where we skip the battle scenes and focus on a girl crying and some general who makes weird bird noises after every line.".

	schema:headline " Great premise spoiled by too many plot points";
	schema:reviewBody "The Wall Street Money Never Sleep had a great premise at the beginning  return of great characters from the original and very interesting subject matter worst financial and economical crisis since the World War II. While the movie succeeds in taking us through the financial crisis as it gradually unfolded it is constantly dragged down by way too many plot points but mainly the hardly believable revenge and very slow paced love story subplots.Let's get one thing clear at the beginning first. It is an immensely difficult task for the writers to portray the financial crisis into a movie for general masses while explaining the workings of the crisis not bogging down the viewers with too much financial jargon and at the same time keep the movie entertaining. This is the part that you can see the makers have made their homework and is something to be appreciated about the movie such as the Bear Sterns inspired collapse of Keller Zabel.My biggest problem with the movie is that the character with the most screen time Jacob Moore is not a believable character. It might be due to casting Shia LeBouf who for one looks too young and too soft to be earning 1.5m bonuses and living in a 6m apartment. Second he is a prop trader which means that his job is to constantly trade stocks on his company's account. Yet we see him trying to raise 100m for a renewable energy source which isn't the job of prop traders. Even he is pitching the idea to Chinese investors which is nonsense since he would have had nothing to say about the company unless he was an equity analyst responsible for the energy sector. This brings the obvious question why was he so interested in the little fusion plant project? His job is to make money not save the world.And than there are the inconsistencies and plot holes At the beginning of the movie Jacob invests 1m from his bonus on 50 margin into his firm Keller Zabel and keeps his position even as the stock is plummeting putting him into sizeable amount of debt film hinted 0.5 mil. Now first firms usually prohibit employees on speculating on their own stock due to the possibility of having insider information and second if Jacob was such an excellent prop trader he wouldn't have touched the stock if there were rumors of its impending collapse. This alone is hardly believable and our intelligence is assaulted again when the film somehow forgets his debt before he even admits the debt when proposing to his girlfriend when he writes his mom a check for 200000 without a second thought.Jacob spreads rumors about an African oil rig being nationalized in which Bretton's company has a big stake which ended up costing the company millions. And Gekko ends up explaining to Jacob that it was illegal because he pushed other people to make traders based on false information so Jacob realizes that the two are alike. How can a Wall Street rainmaker such as Jacob not realize that he manipulated the markets which is illegal? Other problems Gekko's London hedge fund growing from 100 mil to 1.1 bil during Winney's pregnancy? At one point we saw workers dismantling the fusion plant would it have been too little too late to give the 100m to an empty factory site?To conclude this is a revenge and redemption movie with Wall Street and market crash as a backdrop. If they had cut down the cryinggirl scenes to improve pacing maybe it could have turned out better. This way it's just plain bad.".

Now I find out that everything just went swimmingly and he's now a multi millionaire after selling the airline that was so much a focus of the original story. A huge insult to all of us and an embarrassment to Charlie Sheen as if he needed another one in a cameo that had no point other than to wreck the character from the first Wall Street.Don't like any of the actors here. Really miss Martin Sheen who always adds something in whatever he is in. Have no interest in the main characters this time around and I agree that Michael Douglas looks as if he can't stay awake and I don't blame him.Sequels are virtually never any good. Once you catch lightning in a bottle you don't go out and stand in a field in a rainstorm hoping you can do it again without getting electrocuted.

	schema:reviewBody "I have mentioned before that director Oliver Stone seriously thought about retiring after Natural Born Killers. That movie took so much out of him and I think the previous JFK did also in the aftermath of that film that he said I don't think I have another one in me. At that time I thought he was crazy. But looking back at what he has made since NBK. Maybe not Stone's new film has 3 maybe 4 good scenes and all of them were in the trailer. The scenes of the release of Gekko are well done and set up for a nice premise. But it all just falls apart. Or it really never gets going. Wall Street Money Never Sleeps fits perfectly in the new Oliver Stone trend. Before 1994 his films were raw edgy and a little rebellious. World Trade Center W. and Wall Street 2 all have the appearance of politically engaging or hardhitting films. But they are not. Tame would be an understatement. Pleasing would be better. Oliver Stone has lost his will to fight. He's got bills probably a big house swimming pool alimony and stuff. He just wants a job and please the studio and the audience. It almost looks like he doesn't want much hassle with his films after they come out.Wall Street 2 is such a disappointment I don't know where to start. Maybe the biggest let down was in the smallest amount of celluloid the cameo of Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox. His character Fox was a character we could relate to. Especially in his scene with his father Martin Sheen. But his cameo was so wrong so out of place so not Bud Fox it diminishes the entire first movie. Bud Fox is now Charlie from Two and a Half Man.Let me go on with the characters The successor of Bud Fox is now Jake Moore a kid who doesn't blink when he gets a 1.5 million dollar bonus. Off course in the banking industry this is normal. So it is authentic that Jake doesn't flinch. His girlfriend has an Iphone does something with a website but other then that they really don't have to work for a living seeing the house they live in. Live really has no challenges left for these two. So maybe that why Jake has such a hard on for his 'Green Project'. But I'm just guessing here. Bud Fox wanted to be filthy rich he wanted to be a player. Jake Moore doesn't want anything. And we should watch for him for 2 somewhat hours Josh Brolin the actor with the single most dangerous look in Hollywood comes off as such a whiny boy. You do not believe he is the successor of Gordon Gekko. One or two times Shia LaBoeuf's character Jake Moore went head to head with Brolin and I couldn't help but think This is so unbelievable. Brolin's character should clock this spoiled brat right on the nose. If anyone can tell me what value or what message I should take from the motorcyclescene you can email me.Wall Street Money Never Sleeps misses edge a believable script and ditto characters. It is a missed opportunity at best and a total failure if I am really honest. It demises it's classic predecessor has a weak script where the cutthroat mentality in the banking industry is played out in such a clich manner. Josh Brolin is grossly underused. Shia LaBoeuf is overplayed because he's not that great an actor. Not as a serious adult anyway. But that's Stone's fault. Charlie Sheen isn't a great actor but 20 years ago Stone could direct him in a way that made him believable. That Oliver Stone is no more as you can see with the awful cameo of Sheen. The problem for this sequel is that it totally diminishes the first film. It takes all the good things from the first film and throws it out. What's left is chewed up spit out and rehashed. Money never sleeps but the audience does.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I heard that Stone was filming a sequel to Wall Street and that the subject matter would be based around the collapse of Lehmans and Bear Stearns I was very excited indeed. What an excellent opportunity for a tense clever financial melodrama just like the original. Unfortunately Stone sold out. He instead decided to provide a back story around the daughter that Gekko left behind and that a human interest tale would be sufficient. I was shocked when Gekko wept for his past crimes. He came across as a wimp. This was not the way it should have been. Gekko should instead have come out of jail all guns blazing behaving the same way that he did before he went in and then come a cropper as a result of the financial collapse. I am also appalled at the casting of Shia LaBeouf as a top stockbroker. He doesn't act convincingly at all. Josh Brolin has great screen presence but he is cast in the role of a villain with no decent lines or material to get his teeth into. We don't get to see any shadowy business dealings that would give flesh to the premise that he is one of the bad guys. Instead a very weak plot line has Frank Langella play a mentor of the LaBeouf character who is betrayed by Brolin and commits suicide. This becomes the basis for LaBeouf's revenge. The revenge when it happens is not great. LaBeouf rats Brolin out to the authorities for insider trading. Hardly The Sting. Also when Gekko finally betrays his daughter it doesn't convince either.The ending was disappointing with it's Waltons sucrose sentimentality. This shoddy sequel makes it hard to watch the original Wall Street now without a bad taste in the mouth. One of the most objectionable scenes was the appearance of Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox the playboy with a model on either arm boasting about how much money he made when he sold Bluestar airlines and completely betraying the important life lessons he had discovered by the end of the original film. Thanks for taking a wrecking ball to my memories of your original Oscar winning film Oliver. Please don't do any more sequels or further destroy your CV.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wall Street Money Never Sleeps isn't the sharp critical film that its makers want you to think of it as. The sequel to the supremely influential endlessly quotable original from the 80's is a dull whimper about what triggered the present financial meltdown and though it's cut from the same cloth as the original it possess all of the bark yet sadly none of the bite.Gordon Gekko is a name that defined an era. Played by Michael Douglas twenty three years ago he reverberated in the minds of viewers as a ruthless amoral investor without a soul. Years later the sequel finds him released after serving his prison sentence. Cut to seven years after his release and its 2008 the dawn of the financial crisis. Gekko is now known as a speaker publicly vilifying the notion of greed in corporate America while simultaneously and some would reckon quite ironically publicizing his book inspiringly titled Is Greed Good. A loner who travels in subways he is estranged from his daughter Winnie Carey Mulligan androgynously unglamorous who is engaged to a young trader named Jake Moore Shia LaBeouf. Jake bumps into Gekko at one of his speeches the films finest scene and the two form a mentorprotg relationship that irks Winnie but allows Jake to benefit by plotting revenge from Bretton James Josh Brolin the films principle villain suspected of being responsible for the suicide of Louis Zabel a close friend and confidant of Jake.If the film sounds like a mess of relationships then it is. As muddled as Stone's own political activism it has no clarity on what its trying to say. From trying to rationalize the reasons behind the market crash to the impulsive nature of human behaviour it doesn't get either right. Not helping are the actors that Stone assembles. It's a mystery to me why Shia LaBeouf is constantly being thrust down viewer throats in film after film by studios convinced he is the next best thing. He is not and despite being dressed up in expensive designer garb cannot pass off as being anything more convincing than a working intern. His relationship with Gekko has none of the enticing quality that Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox did and a cameo appearance by Sheen only underscores this disparity. Douglas himself has none of the limelight. He has some powerful lines but feels largely sidelined by the revengerelationshipmurder subplots and behaves uncharacteristically especially in the very last scene these were probably added as an afterthought. After showing some promise of returning to his incendiary often infuriating filmmaking style and point of view with his previous film W director Stone seems to have gone back to being comfortable working with drab studio approved material.Not only was the original Wall Street a tremendously entertaining film but one that was blessed with the critical foresight of its maker. The sequel partially entertains but does not have a new perspective. It is neither critical nor insightful and could have with the same script and actors been the work of a lesser director than Stone. The films themes are also impersonal  none of the characters suffer directly from the financial crisis the way they did in the original they suffer from their own incompetent decision making a sharp departure from how the original handled and fused stock trading with personal loss and gain.".

Gekko Michael Douglas getting together with his daughter maybe was touching for a moment. But the girl crying all the time got on my nerves. She is supposed to be an adult. In stead she is acting like a little child. I like Shia but what on earth was he representing. At least Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox had a clear objective. Speaking of which his cameo as the guy we know from Two and a half men is so in contrast of the character Bud Fox that completely diminishes the first movie. I could not believe that they would make a parody of his role. Shia's character was a guy who was ambitious but stuck with his green energy project. While any men or woman with common sense would bail on it. No it is the right thing do. Oh please. Now this isn't Shia's fault. But I blame Oliver Stone for this what happened to you. He used to be brilliant. This movie is not even a good depiction of the economic crisis the world is in right now so it is not even enlightening. If there was one thing you could count on it was how meticulous Oliver Stone was when it comes to history and actual topics. In this film that is completely absent.I can't recommend this at all. In the first place there should have never been a sequel to Wall Street. That tale was ended. Secondly how is it possible that a sequel directed by Oliver Stone ruins the the spirit of the original one in every way it can. This is an incredible waste of time and celluloid. Don't bother.".

Carey Mulligan and Michael Douglas in particular delivered great performances. Shia Lebeouf is good enough. The writing is fairly unpredictable then everything seems to be tied into a nice bundle near the end. The problem was that Stone couldn't quite bring himself to put the bow on that bundle. He wanted to add a bit of glitter to it which seemed gaudy and completely out of place.Bottom line if this movie had ended on a somewhat dark note it would have reflected the reality of modern day Wall Street and it would have made for a tighter better movie.It's worth watching and if you liked the first Wall Street it probably won't disappoint you.

	schema:reviewBody "What actually happened to Gordon and Bud? That was the question I asked myself after seeing Wall Street for the first time. The film set in 1985 had an amazing loose end outside of a courthouse that lasted 23 years.Wall Street and its Greed is Good mantra set a standard for the future stockbrokers of America. It was the epitome of dogeatdog. Speaking of dogs one of the best lines from the film was If you need a friend get a dog. It set the tone for the era love will betray you and money will always be loyal.Wall Street Money Never Sleeps set in 2008 right before the financial bubble burst is Oliver Stone's sequel to his original. The title of the sequel takes its name from a line uttered by the legendary corporate raider Gordon Gekko played by Michael Douglas who also won an Academy Award for Best Actor in the first film.The story begins with Gekko being released from prison into a world that has forgotten about him in 2001. Fast forward to 2008 we are introduced to a young couple Jake Moore played by Shia LaBeouf and Winnie Gekko played by Carey Mulligan. Jake is an ambitious Wall Street investment banker. Winnie is an online activist and also Gekko's estranged daughter. The investment firm Jake works for is about to go under and his mentor Louis Zabel played by Frank Langella is making some bad decisions for their firm.Gekko doesn't reappear for another 30 minutes when he gives a grand opening speech at his alma mater to promote his new book. Greed is legal and everyone is doing it that's Gekko's message. He lets us know it's not solely the banks' fault nor is it entirely the government's fault. It is the consumer who helped put us into this dismal recession. Wait so is greed bad? It's starting to sound that way.The story turns back to Jake. After Louis passes on Jake is distraught and wants vengeance. He blames Bretton James played by Josh Brolin for pushing his mentor out of business. He also wants to bring Gordon and Winnie closer together. He devises a plan to take a good chunk of money from Bretton while simultaneously trading information with Gekko about both Bretton and Winnie. The plot does mirror Bud Fox's played by Charlie Sheen ambition in the first film. Both characters have the willingness to deceive those around them in order to succeed and also to gain Gekko's respect.Stone has changed the pace of the film from the original. In Wall Street the scenes of trading and the underhanded behaviors were intense and fast. There was the moment of Fox and Gekko bartering over stock on the phone that just jumped off the screen with tension and energy. It had the same feel and excitement of action shots from an Indiana Jones film.In Money Never Sleeps Stone takes his time and uses long brush strokes to paint his modern pictures of high society. We are no longer wearing power ties and eating steak tartar for lunch by the way lunch is for wimps. We are going green and eating less red meat. Stone understood the dynamic shift in the culture on Wall Street and captured that change on film.I am not a financial guy I know very little about Bulls and Bears. The great thing about Stone and the reliable cast is that they model for the audience the changes in the market. If you are still lost after the visual aids you can follow the actors' reactions to the events. We comprehend the tension in the room in a scene where the leaders of the top investment firms are sitting around an enormous oak table inside a boardroom arguing about selling off a company. The ardent back and forth at the table set the mood that things were not going improve for the economy.The story continues with several double cross events and even some heartfelt moments that we didn't see much of in the first film. The film does its job of being a sequel. It tells us what happens to the main characters including a fun cameo by Charlie Sheen and shows us more than one dimension of Gekko's Winner Takes All attitude.Should you see this movie? If you need closure on Gekko's corporate odyssey then yes go see it. If you want a snapshot of how we got into this economic mess two years ago then go ahead and see it.However I am disappointed in the title of the film. It's a powerful attractive title. I went in thinking it was going to be a film about money power and greed but it is a film about human relationships and redemption.Beware of the ending it's unGekkolike and even unStonelike. The message was that love is more powerful than money. Maybe the hippies were right. Maybe all we need is love.".

I thought he did OK with the part he was given. But Mulligan was such an annoying character as Winnie....or was it Whiney? Every time she was in a scene it was like fingernails on a blackboard.

I'm not real sure what Oliver Stone was thinking other than he wanted to make some dough at the expense of the public not unlike the majority of the characters in the film. Wall Street Money Never Sleeps does everything it can to paint Wall Street as a collection of evil soulless tyrants that were solely responsible for the recent economic downturn.The biggest problem with the film and there are a lot of problems mind you is that there are no less than four distinct story lines that are inelegantly and at times hamfistedly mashed together to form a disjointed central narrative. One story follows Gordon Gecko Michael Douglass the central and most interesting character from the previous Wall Street as he gets out of prison and tries to put his life back together. A second story follows the young hotshot Jake Moore Shia LeBeouf and his mentor Louis Zabel Frank Langella through the financial meltdown. The third story is that of Winnie Gecko Carey Mulligan and her fiance Jake Moore and their personal life and how Gordon Gecko's release from prison affects it. A fourth story follows Jake Moore as he begins working for his mentor's longtime rival Bretton James Josh Brolin in the cutthroat world of alternative energy acquisition and development. These plot lines are so ineptly woven together that it is possible to make four completely independent short films out of Wall Street Money Never Sleeps. Additionally because of this plot diffusion none of the story lines have any kind of emotional appeal or resonance with the audience there just isn't enough there to latch on to. The movie also reaches a logical climax and ending almost 30 minutes before the film's actual end and then reaches another then another eventually leading the audience to wish for an actual end to the film and completely destroying any sense of satisfaction or closure that might have been achieved by tying off the film sooner.The story is fractured the message trite and unimaginative the camerawork is at times questionable and Gordon Gecko is a mere shadow of the Academy Award winning character from the original. Sometimes it is best to sit on one's laurels and not attempt to relive the glory days of yesteryear. Wall Street Money Never Sleeps should never have been made and will hopefully be quickly forgotten.".

Twenty minutes could be cut and there would be little effect on the storytelling there's so little of it. Visual metaphors come in chunks and yes  we do get them.

This isn't a travelogue for God's sake. And exactly why is a slightly competitive motorbike ride brought into it? Because a couple of bikes happened to be available and the trees were turning? This is year 12 film club stuff Oliver.I gave this movie four out of ten but thinking about it i have come back to edit my review to a three. I'd better stay clear of IMDb or we could end up with one.....The general feeling of drift was for me not exactly helped by a pretty ordinary soundtrack. Some of the dialogue is indistinguishable from the background track and at times the score is also a hindrance rather than a necessary part of the experience.I have had to walk out of several films this last year there are so few movies being made that justify anything like the moolah being spent on them.

The story is lumbered with relationship issues centred around Gekko's daughter which only serve to slow the film down and dissipate what little interest the movie generates. Josh Brolin is served up as the villain but when the only victims of the villain shown on screen are fellow members of the financial services industry this hardly generates much in the way of sympathy. Stone also adds into the mix the 21st century tee shirts of political correctness and environmental issues. Yawn. As all the leading actors are horribly miscast contributing bland performances it's left to Michael Douglas to save the day. Alas an older and wiser Gekko is not what i particularly wanted to see and although he pulls off a sly trick three quarters of the way through Stone bottles it with the redemptive ending. So in comparison the original Wall Street was an engrossing rags to riches to rags morality play with characters you cared for including an unintentional anti hero.

	schema:reviewBody "I wouldn't go as far to say that a Wall Street sequel was long overdue but it was more or less necessary due to the open ending of the first film. Wall Street Money Never Sleeps takes place more than twenty years after the events of the first film. Gordon Gekko is now getting out of prison after serving an eight year term for trading insider information. He meets a young Wall Street broker named Jake Moore who is also his future soninlaw. He sees Jake's ambition and decides to aid him in his climbing of the Wall Street ladder. But as would be expected from the sly Mr. Gekko he has other intentions and we see almost a repeat of the first film just set in the future coinciding with the 2008 stock market crash. It seems unoriginal but I think the only reason it works is because it is a fairly intriguing alternate reality take on an event we all witnessed.This film starts out promising enough. Seeing Michael Douglas reprising his role as the infamous Gordon Gekkos is pleasing and putting his character in these modern times is interesting as he is now no longer a huge name on Wall Street and there are now crooks way more greedy than he ever was. The introduction of all the new characters is also interesting. Shia LaBeouf plays his eager young Wall Street fast talker role fairly well not as well as Charlie Sheen from the original but it's not bad. Carey Mulligan is as beautiful as ever and does a great job as Winnie Gekko Gordon's daughter. Frank Langella even has a brief role as an older stock broker who doesn't have anything left to live for after the crash. However great performances can only take a film so far.What Wall Street Money Never Sleeps suffers from the most is just being really boring. It starts out so interesting and promising but as the plot develops it eventually stops going anywhere and flat lines. This film doesn't help out the nonstock broker types like the original did. You have to know the lingo and you have to understand how Wall Street works and you need a lot of back story on the 2008 financial crash. I myself understand these things to a certain degree but this film just moves too fast and doesn't let you keep up with the lingo and the fast talking. And so once you get behind you're behind for the whole film. I understood enough to follow the gist of the plot but I also think that it is just too dull of a plot to really be that enticing whether you understand it or not. For a film that is over two hours long it really goes nowhere after a certain point.This isn't a terrible film but it just doesn't really amount to much. There are some good things about it like all the performances as well as Oliver Stone's direction. He pulls off some slick editing that gives the film a more technologically hip feel to it. If the film had kept with this same pace from start to finish it probably would have been a lot better. But when you boil it down there isn't much to see here and your mind moves right along as soon as the credits role.".

The result is an abstract and generalized account of the period. It may work if Tolstoy wrote it but in a movie it's too complex. The original Wall St worked because of simple architecture ambition and it's consequences. Simple human dramatic.Money Never Sleeps also suffers from having Gordon Gekko turned into a walking ethical aphorism generator. He is not a human not the real Gordon he just spews his wisdom to anyone. And worst of all its instantly forgettable. And the Jake Moore character is not interesting and appears barely capable of understanding the business.The financial journalism around this event and ongoing problems is much much better than anything in a movie and certainly what is offered in this movie.".

To me it seemed little more than an opportunity for folks like Oliver Stone to cash in on the financial collapse of 2008. I can almost see all those responsible for this sitting around a table and saying Hey! The market collapsed! What a great chance to bring back Gordon Gekko! So they did. But it didn't work.A big chunk of this seemed more like a soap opera than anything else as Jake Shia LaBeouf tries to reconcile his fianc Winnie Carey Mulligan with her dad  none other than Gordon Gekko himself once more played by Michael Douglas. Gekko is just released from prison as this opens having served time for insider training and his relationships with everyone  including Winnie  are destroyed. Now in Winnie's case that's not surprising since I don't remember Winnie from the first movie. What sort of relationship did they have to begin with? But that aside I didn't really care if they reconciled. It didn't matter to me. I didn't care much for the reflections on the market and for all the insider stuff. I just really didn't care much for this movie. I know the markets collapsed in 2008. I lost money because of it too. I really didn't need a movie to remind me! 210".

The movie should have been more serious and focused on the recession and the dark side of Wall Street and less of the gimmicky side stories and cutaways.

The original Wall Street had so many elements that could be used for a sequel plus the recent meltdown of the financial markets this was a GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY to make the sequel. Instead what you have is a movie that tries to be something to everyone. The dialog by Aaron Sorkin is excellent but the movie is flat shallow and not engaging at all.Let's start with the obvious  a central character in the new movie is the daughter of the villain Gordon Gekko but she didn't exist in the original. Gekko had a son Rudy who is discussed but he's now dead. He's discussed briefly and then oh well! The daughter is a blogger with a liberal blog and her boyfriendfianc is a trader. Yawn. The actor Shia Lebouf to me is not a great actor or interesting to watch.Gekko is older and wiser and the scene of him getting out of jail is the best part of the movie. Now he's older and wiser and time is more important than money. He writes a book in prison and goes around speaking about the overhyped markets and how it is all going to come crashing down. No one will listen and that part of the story line isn't really fleshed out. Too bad.The movie tried to include elements of the world we live in concern over energy for the future and investing in 'green' technology the real estate bubble. Individual characters are also used to represent current events and ideologies for example Shia Lebouf is big on environmental companies and money isn't that important to him Carey Mulligan Gekko's daughter is a 'modern woman' who also writes a liberal blog  the new 'Wall Street Chronicle' used to manipulate the market.Susan Sarandon as Shia Lebouf's real estate investing mother. Over leveraged when the market starts to crack but she USED to be a nurse! Selfish narcissistic she is the new greed. Why be a nurse when you can flip houses for more money? Hey nurses make real good money AND help people that's why.The NEW villain Josh Brolin is no Gordon Gekko. Instead he is BP Oil Goldman Sachs and George W. Bush. The scenes with him and Shia are a yawn.The NEW heromentorolder wiser guy with good values is Frank Langella. He represents Lehmann Brothers and the 'old way' things were done on Wall Street. 'Old' meaning the previous movie.There is too much time spent trying to tie the first movie into the second because two of the three main characters weren't even BORN when it was made! To add insult to injury is the cameo of Charlie Sheen. Basically you get Charlie Harper instead of Bud Fox.".

	schema:reviewBody "Handsome Euro western genre film here kind of straddling two genres at once. Gordon Scott is well cast  appropriately larger than life as the Indian fighter turned US Army scout Buffalo Bill Cody trading in his Samson tunic for a buckskin jacket  goatee. Not sure if the Italian French  Spanish filmmakers who made this followed much of Buffalo Bill's actual history for their plot but then again that isn't really the point of the film. Which was to find a wholesome heroic good guy for Gordon Scott to play in an early spaghetti western. And he plays Cody pretty much as he played the Son of Hercules Strapping brawny beefy but surprisingly intelligent insightful and considerate of even the guy whom he beats the stuffing out of in a bar room brawl. He is almost insufferably good working for the native Indians to live side by side with his fellow Palefaces and keep the two sides from massacring each other.Once you get down to it the basic premise of the film has been lifted more from the WinnetouOld Shatterhand films from Germany  Yugoslavia which precipitated the ItalianSpanish spaghetti western boom. Gordon Scott's appearance and mannerism is almost a dead ripoff of Lex Barker's Shatterhand though there's no Winnetou analog. Instead the film seems to want to experiment with putting this Shatterhand surrogate into some of the trappings of what would become the spaghetti western approach.Which is one of the things that makes the film unique  a genuine Hero rather than an ambiguous AntiHero and Scott was well prepared for the undertaking. Sure it's silly and potentially offensive to see Spanish supporting actors dressed up like Injun braves and dubbed by voice actors with midAtlantic quasi British accents. What the film may lack in terms of authenticity it makes up for with wideeyed innocence and they even have Scott ride off waving to the crowd in the end to the applause  cheers of those he had saved just like in his Maciste films. Not something you'd see Clint Eastwood do that's for sure.The film was most likely made in 1964 as the Italian Peplum sword  sandal era was coming to an end and from the looks of it the producing studio apparently figured that by bringing along one of their most popular Peplum matine stars they'd be able to translate the medium into a western and be guaranteed a hit. The production standards of the film are respectfully robust and there's quite a large supporting cast they spent some money on this one and while voters on the IMDb may not have thought much of the results it's a shame that they didn't get a little film series out of the effort.One of the problems was Gordon Scott who made one more Euro western for Albert Band the tragic Spanish romantic range drama THE TRAMPLERS which isn't nearly half as much fun as this one. Rumor has it that while preparing to make a third western Scott's nose was broken by costar Mario Brega who plays a Bud Spencerish lummox rogue in this one and found the disfigurement ruinous to his photogenic looks. Scott made two more actionadventure films of the spy genre ilk and abruptly retired from the industry in late 1965 the year this film was released.The spaghetti genre itself had also changed by the time this film was circulating with the more stylish approaches of DJANGO and Sergio Leone's Dollar films making the more traditionalist approach seen here look a bit old fashioned by comparison. And that's exactly why I adore it Here's a spaghetti western from the infancy of the genre when they were still making movies about good guys  bad guys Injuns and the cavalry and a dogooder hero designed to be rooted for like he was Audie Murphy or something. The change of pace is quite refreshing.710 Something Weird Video apparently has a widescreen English version on VHS  DVDR which you can order directly from their website. Take a look.".

And that's exactly why I adore it Here's a spaghetti western from the infancy of the genre when they were still making movies about good guys  bad guys Injuns and the cavalry and a dogooder hero designed to be rooted for like he was Audie Murphy or something. The change of pace is quite refreshing.710 Something Weird Video apparently has a widescreen English version on VHS  DVDR which you can order directly from their website. Take a look.";

However the story despite the presence of the colorful wild west figure Buffalo Bill is often kind of flat and predictable.

	schema:headline " Gordon Scott's second of three Westerns";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1965 and directed by Mario Costa Buffalo Bill Hero of the West stars Gordon Scott as the title character who is commissioned to avert an Indian war by stopping renegade Indians led by Yellow Hand Mirko Ellis who are illegally sold guns by Big Sam Donaldson Mario Brega. Roldano Lupi plays the rigid colonel of the local fort and Ingeborg Schner his beautiful daughter while Feodor Chaliapin Jr. plays Chief White Fox and Catherine Ribeiro his daughter Silver Moonray.Gordon Scott's acting career only lasted a dozen years from 19551967. He was tall with a lean waist but with muscular bulk and a likable almost innocent disposition think Brendan Fraser with big muscles. He's perhaps best known for playing Tarzan six times in as many years from 19551960 but also known for sword  sandal roles like Goliath Samson Remus and Hercules. I was curious to see how he'd do in a Western and was pleasantly surprised. While this is a Spaghetti Western it was made in 1964 and Sergio Leone's Man With No Name trilogy was just starting to skyrocket to popular success. As such don't expect the items usually associated with Spaghetti Westerns except badly dubbed dialogue Spanish locations substituting for the American West and Spaniards playing Native Americans. Beyond these factors this is more akin to American Westerns like John Wayne ones and of course 1944's excellent whitewashing of the same Western icon Buffalo Bill where Joel McCrea played the hero. Unlike that movie which is biopic this version is a sliceinthelife of Buffalo Bill. Actually the character of Yellow Hand was taken from that earlier movie being based on the reallife Cheyenne chief Yellow Hair whom Cody shot stabbed and scalped three weeks after Little Big Horn ! or so he claimed.At any rate this ain't no cheapo flick. Yes the Native dialogue is a tad stereotypical but that was typical at the time and it's not as bad as you would think like for instance in Elvis' Flaming Star 1960. The locations and sets are excellent such as the Western town and the fort and the costuming is quite good as well. On top of all this Scott shines as the winsome protagonist and you'll find yourself rooting for him and his sidekick. Not to mention the two women are quite fetching. The only problem I had with this movie is the poor dubbing and the washedout non colors of the public domain DVD I viewed. To add insult to injury it's a pan  scan version where one person talking in a scene might be totally off camera but thankfully I only really noticed that in one scene near the end. I would love to see a widescreen version with brighter colors. The movie runs about 90 minutes and was shot in Spain and Elios Studios Rome. GRADE B".

Buffalo Bill Hero of the Far West epitomizes the Italian western before Sergio Leone revolutionized the genre. Indeed most of the preLeone westerns resembled conventional 1950s era Hollywood horse operas and Buffalo Bill proves no exception. Mind you Scott is more than rugged enough for the largerthan life role and his goatee imparts a roguish appearance. Our buckskin clad hero is investigating the illegal sales of Winchester repeating rifles to renegade redskins. For the record this was Gladiator of Rome director Mario Costa's first and only cavalry versus the Native American epics. Costa doesn't let his actors stand around and chew the scenery. He stages quite a bit gunplay and A Fistful of Dollars lenser Massimo Dallamano makes everything look spectacular. The big showdown at the end of the action takes place in a cavalry fort with the Indians scaling the walls and giving our heroes hell to pay. The chief suspect is an obnoxious hulk named Sam Mario Brega of The Good the Bad and the Ugly and at one point he trades blows with brawny Scott. Reportedly Brega smashed Scott's nose and neither man got along with the other. Unlike later Spaghetti westerns Scott is not working for himself to obtain vast sums of money like the bounty hunters who would come to dominate the genre. Instead he is on a mission of mercy authorized by the President to root out injustice. The scenery the dames and the tough dudes all look exciting. This madeinSpain shoot'em up boasts lots of action but everything is formulaic with few narrative surprises. My chief complaint is the voice that they have used to dub Scott so that he sounds like an older man. Our hero has no romantic love interest but he runs into several pretty ladies.

One of my nitpicks with these films is that the harshness and brutality of life in the ghetto or concentration camp is not fully revealed. The films are products of their times I suppose. And one cannot make actors look like skeletons. The most brutal portrayal of the holocaust I have seen in a nondocumentary is in the TV miniseries War and Remembrance. Neither of Beyer's films comes close. Again I'm sure that there was so much an East German film director in the 1960's and 70's could do.

	schema:headline " Absolutely EXCELLENT Adaptation!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of many extremely interesting and important movies from East German Cinema a cinema that has been forgotten and ignored until recent years thanks First Run Features!!!. First off I read the English translation of Bruno Apitz' long novel BEFORE watching this movie so this may be longwinded and speaks of the adaptations and East German cinema.When I finally sat down to watch the adaptation by Apitz and others I was truly astounded by how close novel and movie were. Usually film directors edit written stories to the point that the original intent and story is nearly lost under a pile of rhetoric and nonsense oh Spielberg can you hear me??. Not here. There are some plot lines that are missing and characters that aren't fully developed andor missing from the novel like the character of Mandrill the biggest let down for me the janitor Zweilling's wife and many of the Nazis. It's not a huge problem when it comes to the smaller characters from the novel in my opinion because it is an adaptation. Where the problems lie is that the viewer must read the novel to get more 3dimensionality to the characters and understand what is being cut from their cinematic viewing through agendadriven censorship. Apitz gives readers the characters' thoughts and those thoughts can only be expressed through acting gestures which can seem flat sometimes silly in the movie. However this is East German cinema which tends to be stagy more than fluid and natural. It is just a fact. If you see the East German version of 'Jacob the Liar' also by director Beyer you'll understand.Let me backtrack with some info on East German cinema if I can. After watching several movies from this country it appears to me that censorship is extremely strong. East German filmmakers are NOT allowed to demean Germans whether they are Nazis as far as criticizing them being ethnic German or otherwise. It's just against the communist agenda one needs to get some history about the waning years of Soviet occupation to understand. A German is a German is a German and it's the ideology that makes a true whole spiritual entity read Communism. There are mean fascists and good communists. It's pretty straight forward. The Nazis are NOT allowed to be comrades communists they have individuality by having their own agendas and they weasel their way out of any situation like cowards. East German movies and novels are strictly about mass victimization not ethnicities or any groups. For instance the child is Jewish but his Jewishness is relatively ignored in the movie even though there is a reference to Auschwitz. The story is about comradery against the fascists. The ethnicities amongst the prisoners are erased even though they are mentioned in the book there is a Pole and a Russian in the movie but weren't those Bloc countries?? The Dutch and the French ethnicities disappear from their characterizations in the book.Back to the review... Most all of the acting is great even though some is stagey as I mentioned before. Armin Mueller Stahl is fantastic as usual and I wish he had more screen time. Glad he jumped out of East Germany because you can see his potential greatness in this early movie until his mastery of acting today with the range of his abilities! The cinematography and direction are excellent as much as the adaptation. This movie is a must for those studying East German cinema and the genre of concentration camp cinema. An excellent movie to analyze by noncommunist eyes. I wish the scenes of brutality were more realistic because they certainly are in the novel. Try to read the book BEFOREHAND it is VHTF. It will not be easy to follow the final 1520 minutes of the movie without some key information. Sometimes it just has to be done! The movie is a fine example of adaptation and adhering to novel's plot.9 of 10  E.".

It's not a huge problem when it comes to the smaller characters from the novel in my opinion because it is an adaptation. Where the problems lie is that the viewer must read the novel to get more 3dimensionality to the characters and understand what is being cut from their cinematic viewing through agendadriven censorship. Apitz gives readers the characters' thoughts and those thoughts can only be expressed through acting gestures which can seem flat sometimes silly in the movie. However this is East German cinema which tends to be stagy more than fluid and natural. It is just a fact. If you see the East German version of 'Jacob the Liar' also by director Beyer you'll understand.Let me backtrack with some info on East German cinema if I can. After watching several movies from this country it appears to me that censorship is extremely strong. East German filmmakers are NOT allowed to demean Germans whether they are Nazis as far as criticizing them being ethnic German or otherwise. It's just against the communist agenda one needs to get some history about the waning years of Soviet occupation to understand. A German is a German is a German and it's the ideology that makes a true whole spiritual entity read Communism. There are mean fascists and good communists. It's pretty straight forward. The Nazis are NOT allowed to be comrades communists they have individuality by having their own agendas and they weasel their way out of any situation like cowards. East German movies and novels are strictly about mass victimization not ethnicities or any groups. For instance the child is Jewish but his Jewishness is relatively ignored in the movie even though there is a reference to Auschwitz. The story is about comradery against the fascists. The ethnicities amongst the prisoners are erased even though they are mentioned in the book there is a Pole and a Russian in the movie but weren't those Bloc countries?? The Dutch and the French ethnicities disappear from their characterizations in the book.Back to the review... Most all of the acting is great even though some is stagey as I mentioned before. Armin Mueller Stahl is fantastic as usual and I wish he had more screen time. Glad he jumped out of East Germany because you can see his potential greatness in this early movie until his mastery of acting today with the range of his abilities! The cinematography and direction are excellent as much as the adaptation. This movie is a must for those studying East German cinema and the genre of concentration camp cinema. An excellent movie to analyze by noncommunist eyes. I wish the scenes of brutality were more realistic because they certainly are in the novel. Try to read the book BEFOREHAND it is VHTF. It will not be easy to follow the final 1520 minutes of the movie without some key information. Sometimes it just has to be done! The movie is a fine example of adaptation and adhering to novel's plot.9 of 10  E.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nackt unter Wlfen or Naked Among Wolves is an East German blackandwhite film from 1963 so already over 50 years old. The director is Frank Beyer and he is considered the GDR's most talented filmmaker by many. The fact that he also made the Oscarnominated Jacob the Liar certainly helps this theory. But back to this one here. Beyer also worked on the script together with Bruno Apitz the man who wrote the original novel. The title here is a reference to a child who gets found by inmates of a concentration camp and they need to decide what to do with the Jewish boy. Risk their own lives by trying to protect him or hand him to their captors and maybe get a reward? This is the major plot of the film even if their decision becomes obvious really quickly which certainly took out a lot of tension from the film and may have kept it from becoming a better work and more thrilling watch.The novel has been adapted 3 times so far and this was the second shot at the material I believe. The 3rd one was extremely recent a television movie from last year and both approaches did not convince me unfortunately. The struggles were of a different kind but neither filmmaker managed to make this a compelling watch. In this old version here every time the action moves away from the child story it becomes fairly boring and uninteresting and sadly it does on many occasions. Another problem here is that many of the characters seem interchangeable. The cast includes a couple names who may be known to fans of old East German cinema but I personally would not call myself like that and that is probably why the only one I am familiar with here is the fairly young Armin MuellerStahl almost half a century before his Academy Award nomination. All in all I thought this movie here had too many lengths and too little interesting content especially for a film that ends just seconds before the 2hour mark. Thumbs down and I do not recommend the watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "To put this review in context I went to see this film with no previous interest in contemporary dance. I have always put it into that category of 'things I just don't understand'. I understand it's a way of communication but it's one that has never communicated to me. So my thoughts on this film probably won't have any interest to you if you are already a dance fan or a dancer or a fan of Pina Bausch in particular. But if like me you have heard that this is a visual feast of a film or just that it is a Wim Wenders documentary and are wondering whether to go see it for those reasons this might help you decide.I was a reluctant viewer because it was clear from the beginning that I still didn't 'get' it  what did it all mean? But visually physically this film ended up astounding me. It has stuck with me such that I can't stop thinking about it.As a documentary it doesn't do much to reveal its subject. It doesn't say much about how this woman thought how she felt her journey and what influenced it what tortured her what she was in denial about and how she related to the wider society. These are the revelations I expect in a 'great' documentary film. Films such as 'Man on Wire' 'Grizzly Man' or 'When We Were Kings'. Maybe those things are communicated though the dance itself. I don't know. Almost the whole film is dancing interspersed with very short recollections from individual dancers. What these do get across are that Pina Bausch had a way of communicating with people and a depth of feeling that is unusual and wonderful. Those who worked with her at least those that were interviewed have the greatest love and admiration for her and what she was able to bring out of them. I ended up with a great feeling of admiration for her myself. Perhaps that was the point of the documentary.But for me it was the dancing and the way it was filmed that was astounding. It comes across with such intensity such belief and such love that I almost became a fan of contemporary dance. The sheer physicality. The bodies and what people could do with them. The beauty of movement. It is simply a joy to watch.The quality of the visuals is startling. I saw it at a local arts centre which has a very good screen but I've never seen anything as sharp and as detailed as this. And the colours seemed more vivid than is usual. It was like discovering a new form of super high definition film. I understand it was filmed in 3D although I saw the 2D version. Still it was amazing to watch. The way it is filmed also seems to work very well. It seems pretty straightforward. Most of the dance sequences are filmed quite simply on stage but the framing seems to bring out the subjects well even in 2D. Wenders has also filmed individual dancers or pairs of dancers in various outdoor locations  a city street a road intersection a train an open cast mine. These little pieces are so beautiful and so unexpected. There is even one that is intentionally funny where a girl gets on a train and pretends to be a robot monster. It's hilarious! So for me a wonderful surprise. I still didn't end up understanding much of what Pina Bausch was trying to communicate but I enjoyed watching her try.".

Her living dancers different ages  different nations different cultures different languages one common goal Dancing as a High Expression of Art and Inner Being are her legacy. Some of them speak shortly to the camera about their teacher and her remarks to them  some others only stare at us. They express whatever they have to say through their dance. Words are not necessary. Doesn't the same thing apply to Pina herself? The most important thing in Great Art is the Art itself and not the personal details of the private lives of the artists themselves. Wenders understands that completely paying respect to her unexpected death as well as the fact that if Pina had been alive by the time of the filming he could have made a completely different documentary than the one he delivered to us. So he leaves her choreographies to talk on her behalf. A wise decision along with the other great one to keep himself as a director in as a low profile as he can. After all his film glorifies Pina not himself. Rarely have we met such a maturity as that in a director's job. And don't worry through the few minutes we see Pina herself dancing we can appreciate her supreme and unsurpassed art of her dancing. Watching the film proves to be a very moving and rewarding experience a true homage to great art.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whether Wender's work is considered a film eulogy or a documentary I can say that I have never felt so much for a production of moving pictures before that I would feel the necessity to express my thoughts through written words.I have a great passion for dance and used to practice it a lot more a few years ago. Hence this film was a mustsee for me whatever whoever says. The downside with dance on film is the failure of the screen to convey depth and I didn't find the 3D effects particularly impressing here I must admit. But then again without it I am sure it would be hard not to get dull watching 100 minutes of flat images sometimes randomly and unexpectedly cut of the context.Because there is no storyline in the film. Not very much of replicas either to explain in clear words why or if the different pieces are linked together and definitely nothing to tell about Pina Bausch's private life. But that is also what makes this film so clean and consistent dance says it all. If Pina lived today her presence in the film would certainly be more evident to us. The film would let us follow her and her dance company on performances with more straight forward dialogues. Instead the spirit of Pina is expressed through dance here. Dance is the way she would use to communicate her messages to the world so why would words then be necessary? Even less why would personal details of her life matter in this film when what we will remember of her as with other known names throughout the history will be for their creations inspirations and contributions to our world? Pina's art is shown piece by piece in the film featuring choreographies and performing arts carried out by her closest dancers in different milieux. Both outdoors in the open landscape and modern cityscape as well as indoors on a stage. It expresses diversity and unity at the same time gives life to poetry and most remarkably making music visible in a way that I have not seen in a film before. It describes relationships between men and women young and old human and nature along with senses of loneliness yearning passion pain and joy mixed with a dose of subtle humour.And they are all performed by a group of highly skillful professionals of different ages nationalities and languages whom sometimes through open monologues give us an insight on Pina's character. Not only do they reach out to touch by movements but also through empathy and facial expressions of compassion making them very credible actorsactresses.To sum up If you can deal with lack of dialogues without getting bored make sure then to have some understanding about dance or a general interest in art and scenography to truly appreciate this film. It is a definition of beauty and a way to remember Pina Bausch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pina Bausch died just prior to this being made. I was familiar with her just briefly from Almodovar's Talk To Her but sadly not more and not live. So at least for the time being this is as much as we'll get to know her independent of her being here to explain assuming she would at all and this is perhaps the most fitting part. We'll get to know her in the purest sense possible by what dance stirred her heart. Because in a sense you are what you have embodied and made life from everything else being words roles playacting it is more than enough to have just this. It is what dance is all about.And this is how she handled her troupe as a director herself. Hints abstract frameworks. How it comes across in the actual dance is a marvel the debris of unfinished thoughts in the midst of empty space of course the entire flow framed small in empty stages but in each person as well bits of recognizable motion in the midst of syncopated blurs halffinished gestures of story.We see plenty of I assume excerpts of her dances all of them more or less captivating. I do not know a thing about the medium so I will let aficionados explain the importance of how she innovated form. She might as well have been an inverse Beckett for all I know danced acting out hurt that he repressed.But I am interested in film and how images can seduce into the surface the core of our being. And what Pina do the images reveal? Lonely hurt strong frantic search. An anxious sexuality at heart or better yet anxious at the prospect of touch connection.And it is important to note this connection with her players and by extension ourselves as viewers. All of them without exception are baffled to communicate their relationship with her as though it was so visceral so 'now' it is impossible to relate after the fact disembodied in words. I'm sure they could all say it with a dance wonderfully so. It is even possible that not all of them got her  one of them dedicates weightlessness in her memory where the Pina I saw was all about weight and pull.But the're all definitely sure of one thing that she looked into their innermost self.Meddlesome words again 'that she looked into their innermost self'. Watching the film this is what I get the sense Pina accomplished she allowed empty space around these people not overdirecting not explaining every gesture perhaps not even communicating a whole point or story reflecting this in the actually sparse surroundings she prepared around them so at her smallest hint they poured into that space their own spontaneous being. They came out having bared self having made sense  body motion  what used to be words ideas having been one with just the moment. Pina had only made it possible they do.She asked one of her dancers to portray joy as simple as this. He offered his version personal self and she choreographed a scene around it.So there it is in a nutshell a valuable insight for us viewers. This is something you watch without the need to know what it means trusting it does in the exchange.Oh there is Wenders in all this. Wenders is a frame artist always looking for something to frame and apply colors to. Most of the time he has dull insights. In TokyoGa he set out to frame Ozu but missed by so much it made me cringe. Here he comes across a woman that is unfettered soul. He does not puzzle about how you film dance trusting she has taken care of even that. He does not get in the way too much most of the time carving with his camera soft paths inside the dance. His dull insight in an attempt to somehow address the cinematic experience is the whole as one more staged performance before an audience  many reenactions on different stages occur in the film some of them projected on a screen. But he does not turn any of this into a story which is bound to alienate most viewers.It is perhaps lucky that Wenders did this opposed to say someone like Almodovar who commands deeply layered vision. Like Pina's dancers he is an empty vessel. She fills with the joy of color.".

	schema:headline " A cinematic eulogy";
	schema:reviewBody "Pina is being classed as a musical but it's more of a documentary. More than this it's a cinematic eulogy to Pina Bausch one of the world's most influential dancers.The filmic concept is simple. Footage consisting mainly of contemporary performances of Pina's ballets performed by her dancers is interposed with archive footage of the legendary figure herself. Each dancer at their turn looks squarely at the camera and offers their own recollection of how Pina inspired them. This is followed by a demonstration of their learning.It seems that filming dance is making a comeback in cinema. But after seeing 'Black Swan' and now this I wonder if dance loses something on the big screen? Maybe the realism or the urgency. Definitely something. It's the same with music concerts. You have to be there. I'm of the opinion that you have to be an artist to understand other artists. They're a different breed. Where else for instance would the remark 'you just have to get crazier' be appropriate if not in dance? Some scenes are bizarre. No they're not. They're mad. Mad like Pina told her students to be. There are some arresting images which to tease us Wenders doesn't linger on. The predictable comment being made of Wenders' film is that it is surreal. I don't believe it is truly surreal. Yes some of the visuals are unusual  like the Australian dancer who dances with abandon on a street corner with cars driving past and a train travelling upside down. Or the act involving two men spitting water at each other. Or better still the act with a man pulling his trousers up and down. But I swear the effects seem remarkably natural.I was agape throughout the scene where one dancer in a serene industrial site shows a couple of cuts of meat to us and shouts 'veal!' before dancing on her tiptoes for what seemed like forever. Where was the beauty? I wondered after. I can't explain it. It is just there.There's nothing snobbish about this film. There's not much that is esoteric either.

	onyx:emotionText "Pina is being classed as a musical but it's more of a documentary. More than this it's a cinematic eulogy to Pina Bausch one of the world's most influential dancers.The filmic concept is simple. Footage consisting mainly of contemporary performances of Pina's ballets performed by her dancers is interposed with archive footage of the legendary figure herself. Each dancer at their turn looks squarely at the camera and offers their own recollection of how Pina inspired them. This is followed by a demonstration of their learning.It seems that filming dance is making a comeback in cinema. But after seeing 'Black Swan' and now this I wonder if dance loses something on the big screen? Maybe the realism or the urgency. Definitely something. It's the same with music concerts. You have to be there. I'm of the opinion that you have to be an artist to understand other artists. They're a different breed. Where else for instance would the remark 'you just have to get crazier' be appropriate if not in dance? Some scenes are bizarre. No they're not. They're mad. Mad like Pina told her students to be. There are some arresting images which to tease us Wenders doesn't linger on. The predictable comment being made of Wenders' film is that it is surreal. I don't believe it is truly surreal. Yes some of the visuals are unusual  like the Australian dancer who dances with abandon on a street corner with cars driving past and a train travelling upside down. Or the act involving two men spitting water at each other. Or better still the act with a man pulling his trousers up and down. But I swear the effects seem remarkably natural.I was agape throughout the scene where one dancer in a serene industrial site shows a couple of cuts of meat to us and shouts 'veal!' before dancing on her tiptoes for what seemed like forever. Where was the beauty? I wondered after. I can't explain it. It is just there.There's nothing snobbish about this film. There's not much that is esoteric either. The music is eclectic and the nationalities of the dancers are diverse. Pina united people. This film isn't exclusively for dance lovers it's for admirers of culture.Although I would find a second viewing of Pina to be quite taxing I have no trouble in recommending it to anyone.

Spoiler ahead The movie starts with big portions of the Sacre in 3D. Wow! For two reasons. The 3D creates a very spatial experience duhhh... that I've never seen applied to realistic footage. Secondly some of the shots are taken from the perspective of one of the dancers.  end spoiler So after ten minutes I was totally taken away by it. It's a wonderful eulogy. I felt hot tears running down my cheeks frequently and at unexpected moments. The imagery is jaw dropping. some sequences are breathtaking.

Repetitive and simplistic monologues from the dancers about Bausch that unfortunately never seem to even scratch the surface of what the choreographer must have been. If you're looking to know something about her don't bother. For me as I didn't go see it to know about her fairly ignorant on modern dance I must confess it has very interesting visual moments. I was very curious to see what Wenders would do with 3d and I wasn't disappointed. For the critics that say that 3d made the some characters seem too clean almost virtual and the background sometimes blurry this is a movie not a documentary in fact a Wenders movie not a live Bausch dance performance. And the 3d moments as visual interpretations made by Wenders are very very smart and beautiful.One thing keeps me annoyed in Wenders movies anyway he's too cocky and full of himself. It shows again in Pina. He just keeps being meddlesome. The camera doesn't stand still enough time as he tries to show artistic camera movements. There are beautiful framed shots that he trashes in a few seconds making sudden closeups shifts and this modern tendency to very slowly keep the camera in movement as if the viewer would fall asleep if the goddamn shot is still for more than half a second or the small straighten up of the camera to reframe.

	schema:reviewBody "For those of you not immersed in the dance world Pina is a movie about German choreographer Pina Bausch who recently died at the age of 68. She was a pioneer in her field to say the least really breaking boundaries with Modern and sitespecific dance. I'd obviously heard her name many times in my course of study in college but really wasn't that familiar with her or her work before going to see the movie. The movie isn't so much a biography of her life as just a presentation of her work by the dancers in her company interspersed with brief interviews. The dancers each in turn share their impressions of her and what it was like to work with her while showing some of her most aweinspiring choreography. I was so moved! Dancer or not this movie is worth 15 spent to see it in 3D.What really made an impression on me about Pina's choreography and her dancers was the authenticity of the emotional content. Her work is so emotional by nature often very sad but sometimes extremely joyous as well. The dancers weren't faking it though. The things they were feeling were real. Obviously I'm not in their heads but something in the way they carried themselves and executed each movement indicated to me that this was a very real and meaningful experience for them. It transcended the mime and pretend of much concert dance I've seen. They were so committed I couldn't help but feel what they were feeling.Another aspect of her choreography that I found very unique was the sitespecific elements she incorporated into her work. She made wonderful use of nature be it dirt water leaves rocks trees or even things found in a city. She used these things the same way Balanchine would use the cavalier in relation to the ballerina. There was a partnership between dancer and environment. The surroundings weren't just a setting they were part of the dance and without them the meaning would not be the same. I found it so inspiring! In all honesty I've never been one for sitespecific dance. My own experiences with it have been far from satisfying. In Pina's choreography however I found inspiration! I would like to dabble in sitespecific work more now.I don't feel that I have the words to do this movie justice. Just go see it. It was candy for my eyes and food for my soul. I feel so inspired and so thankful to have a person like Pina Bausch pave the way in the art I'm so passionate about.".

It is not a film that got me interested in the multilayered world of dancing. You already need to have a profound interest before watching in order to appreciate this film or in a bestcasescenario either be a dancer himself or have a personal connection to Bausch. I must say I did not even know her. She was certainly not particularly famous to the general public even here in Germany. There weren't many sequences in this documentary that I found captivating or memorable not to say any at all.

Some have nothing to say and are just silent. Excellent in keeping with an elusive concept of modern dance. I love a film that doesn't hit you over the head but asks you to participate in the process as in this poetic film. Poetic film doesn't necessarily follow a narrative arc but presents its own structure.As to 3D. Don't look at it as 3D a la Avatar. Wenders 3D is really contouring the image. As a 2D image it works OK but the added contouring of the image really makes it come alive. True there is no 3D effect of a chair flinging at you. There is a subtle effect of the image reflecting the contouring of the body dancemovementspace and image.Pina's dance choreography is amazing. I loved the use of indoor outdoor dancespace performances. Many sequences are really amazing and wonderful.Herzog be warned. There is a new camera in town and he is out looking for you. I love Herzog too. Is this the resurgence of German cinema post Fassbinder?Go see it and enjoy. It will win an academy award.

My first reactions during the screening was that it is a competent filming of some strong choreography and dancing of that choreography.Wenders has greater ambitions though no doubt coloured by the death of the eponymous choreographer during the film's development. Short reflections on Bausch's working atmosphere are offered by the dancers over footage of their mute posed headshots. Preparations for dancing in the theatre are shown as well as the occasional shot of the back of the first few rows of the audience. It's a stubbornly artistic attempt to homogenise the mode of expression.I appreciate that this is a consistent way of approaching this film. However I longed for a little more straightforward discussion to offset the dance rather than a stream of inarticulate platitude and pretentious gloss which actually rather muddles the art on show. This isn't just as I am a dance ignoramus. It also affects the integrity of the recreated dance and the film in which it's couched. The Cafe Mller discussion is a particular lost opportunity with the reconvened production team failing to string a sentence together whilst the gripping dance is chopped up to accommodate it.I'm not sure that the 3D arrangement lends all that much to the film  the extra dimension does enrich the experience. However the technology still can't remove ghost images blurred motion or translucent patches in welllit sequences. Certainly compared to the inconvenience of having to wear the wretched spectacles and suffering the subsequently darkened images it's a meagre return. Still for all my resistance I did find myself rather absorbed by the dance at its centre which as a triumph for Bausch stands for something. 610".

Perhaps the technology isn't quite good enough yet or this just wasn't the type of film that would benefit from the 3D effects. I found it a distraction from the beauty of the dance. We all know dance happens on a stage in three dimensions and our brains compensate for this when we see a film. We don't need to have the dancers coming at us out of the screen.

	schema:headline " An interesting experiment that fails as a documentary";
	schema:reviewBody "Pina was a mixed bag for me. I'm an avid fan of dance but I will admit I was never that familiar with Pina Bausch's repertoire. I didn't know much about her going into the film and unfortunately I knew just as little leaving the theatre.Pina is less a documentary than a montage of tributes to her memory performed affectionately by members of her academy past and present. It also showcases snippets from her most famous works over the last 3 decades. Visually the film is spectacular and is probably one of the few films I've seen this year to actually benefit from being in stereoscopic 3D. The sense of depth is powerful and involving for the audience making them feel like they are in the midst of the dancers as they twirl sweat leap and thrash about the stage.The imagery is stark painterly and epic at times most notably in extracts from the dark primal piece The Rite Of Spring in which the dancers' anguished fearful expressions tell a hundred stories. Throughout the film there are moments of artistic genius surreal giggles and feats of aweinspiring technical skill. However there are also those unavoidable moments of sheer boredom confusion and eyerolling pomposity which unfortunately for me summed up the bulk of the experience. At around 40 minutes in I began to feel the film's length and its initial intrigue soon turned into an endurance test. Structurally it is a pellmell assortment of dance excerpts interviews and the odd sepia hued shot of Pina rehearsing or conveying words of wisdom to her students. Very little is said about the woman herself except that she was a perfectionist and a passionate lover of art a vignette that could be used to describe most people in the world of performance I would think. Every so often the dancing would break to reveal a past colleague or pupil of hers hamming into the camera while an effusive voiceover recalled the little clichd anecdotes she would offer to inspire each one of them to dance a method which in my view felt insincere and unsatisfying.With so little factual information given about the artist I could only engage on a superficial sensory level with the dancing. As I mentioned one cannot help being captivated by the visceral power of The Rite of Spring or the frantic humour of Dance Hall but some of the tribute pieces just seemed abstract to the point of being inaccessible and annoying. For example a man dressed in a tutu rides a mining cart doing ballet squats. He falls on his back gets up and starts squatting again. This happens several times until the cart slowly and puzzlingly rolls out of frame. In another scene entitled Lean on Me the camera trucks out on a woman in a yellow dress swaying precariously from side to side into the arms of a man. It all looks very elegant however the same concept appears earlier in another tribute with a different couple only the woman falls face first instead of sideways. The repetition of motifs in dance is to be expected but in so many different pieces all randomly edited together the amount of repetition is staggering. I could almost predict when a dancer was going to fall to the floor and spasm whip their hair back and gesture to their heart. By the time the scene of the woman getting soil shovelled on her back arrived I felt sufficiently numb enough to walk out which I would've done had my dancer friends not been sitting bug eyed with rapt attention either side of me.I think had Wenders given a more honest investigation into Pina's life and perhaps left the more bizarre and uninspiring tribute clips as DVD extras it might've been a better film. I must say any future dance features should be shot in 3D because if Pina hadn't benefited so much from this medium I probably wouldn't have given it a 510.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems the idea about biography  the standard biography  is to be exposed to great souls. The greater and more complex the better and as long as we stay coherent the more exposure the better. Apparently German filmmaker Wenders had for decades planned such an exposure of Pina Bausch.She surely is a banquet of a soul and any film that captures morsels would be worth it. I was not aware of her before being introduced by a trusted friend and now I am hungry for more. She is something of a radical in dance a Rolfer of motion.Dance for her is something you must do you must. Her troupe is drawn from all over the world and we see them all here intense beauties throwing their lives. She seems to have touched every one of them with some deep insight into the linkage among the urge to live the danger of movement and the fearlessness to let go. Of each of these faces the film has one minute or so with their voice over stating some way that Pina pulled 'size' from them. Then usually we see that soul in motion. Sometimes we are captivated sometimes simply thrilled. Once in a while we must puzzle about something that seems just silly. But the fact that the same disciplined passion can be brought to it all makes the puzzling bits all the more valuable. Pina died immediately before the thing was made and one wonders what she would have let show what she would have rejected because it seems so uneven.We have a disconnect here that may not be so obvious on the first round through. Wenders is a skilled filmmaker but his approach is storytelling. Staging and motion is in his films only as one of several devices to tell a story. Pina is superficially in the same mold her choreography has 'explanations' attached and the tone is overtly theatrical but this is of a completely different nature. We are in Pina's world as an artifact of the performance an essential entity like a floor and by no stretch the nexus. We are there to be performed to to be scared to be shined upon so that the dancers will know they have light. But they are also scaring and performing for themselves each other even for the floor. The moment matters. Short form  the immediate  is the only form for Pina. Wenders in contrast is a long form guy a relative pedestrian. What he brings is a disciplined cold eye that can capture with perfection. His filmmaking has no passion no risk only craft.I have to admit that I greatly admire what he did here though I did not see it in the lauded 3D format. His staging sometimes tricky and some of the dance edits are wonderful. But I had the feeling that I had radios tuned to two different Germanspeaking stations and had to consciously switch my attention from the cinema to the dance. It would have been wonderful if we had DVD extras that just let a dance go without the cinematic imposition. The one German filmmaker that I find worthwhile is Herzog and that is because he is more like Pina than Wenders. He takes risks in his early days these were also physically dangerous. His films are not very intellectual but have visceral energy that seems to have been dug from Nature's absolute core. I wonder if he had attempted this film if there would have been a clash a competition of such digging.Perhaps it is wise to have Wenders a placid but attentive viewer intermediate for us. But see then we allow him to make the decision for us about how committed we can be in terms of reach into the space of these dances. And I want more depth  not the perception of depth but participation in the fluid skin.The only extra on this region 2 ! DVD was a short interview with Wenders with such poor sound one wonders what he was thinking. Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Wenders offers the dancers their chance to say how Pina got them to perform some say nothing but express their thoughts in dance often in the streets or on the overhead train in Wuppertal where Pina's theatre was based.

Finally Kay has had enough and finds a book by Dr. Feld which inspires her to sign them up for the Doctor's intense week long marriage counseling session. Although Arnold sees nothing wrong with their 30 year long marriage he reluctantly agrees to go on the expensive excursion. What follows is an insightful experience as Dr. Feld manages to help the couple understand how they have emotionally drifted apart and what they can do to reignite their passion. Even with the Doctor's advice Kay and Arnold find that renewing their marriage's fire is a daunting challenge for them both.";

	schema:reviewBody "I am a single 67 year old retiree who has been married and divorced twice and this movie really touched me. It acted as a sort of cinematic mirror to prompt me to reflect upon the many daily choices or even finer gradations of volition that make up a healthy or dysfunctional marriage or relationship of any kind. The movie was about how we create our own heaven or hell in the house in the kitchen in the bedroom and in life. We lose our grip on our passionate love affairs almost the way that dust slowly collects on the floor. Didn't I just vacuum that dust yesterday? That is how a marriage can ossify degrade itself as if consciousness itself were shot full of some sort of novocaine by sneaky subtle injections over the years one feeling at a time numbed.Meryl Streep Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carrell are excellent and break new emotional and acting ground for all three master actors.The movie made me think about my entire life and it made me reflect upon my parents' marriage too.Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Arnold a man who has been an accountant so long he can simply function on automatic with his customers not really giving his passionate self to his business or his marriage ran the gamut from acceptance of various ruts to various kinds of rage embarrassment and stubbornness refusal to drop his pride or make compromises that would have been in the best interests of himself his wife and the marriage.The camera does not editorialize. It shows Arnold falling asleep watching golf instruction on television. The camera directly above the frying pan and close up depicts Meryl Streep's Kay sizzling a strip of bacon and one sunny side up egg for Arnold every day day after day. He eats his breakfast with his back to her as he reads the paper then gets up every day and gives her a peck on the check without even making eye contact and he's off to work again like an unemotional little engine that could.When Sisyphus pushed that boulder up to the top of the hill his punishment by the gods he had to watch it roll back down to the bottom of the hill whereupon he repeated this process  for eternity. But Sisyphus smiled  at least according to Albert Camus he smiled. It occurred to me that relationships and marriages devolve into accommodations and that passion like air being spent out the tiny leaks in a worn tire can evanesce before either party truly deeply realizes what they are doing what they have done. The smiles in this movie are forced automatic defensive painful. Boulders are not openly acknowledged.In this movie every scene is slightly underplayed. No line or gesture is over the top. Almost every word of dialogue is realistic. I never felt that I was being lectured or preached to. I did think that the background music was too intrusive several times however almost as if someone did not trust Meryl Streep to carry the emotional load of the scene  an error of judgement. This movie needed no such authorial or directorial intrusion  That is my only criticism.Hope Springs is a movie about the ingredients of happiness or lack of same and the finesse of the actors the director the cinematographer and the editors is magnificent. They never stooped to dwell on any sort of clich dialogue or acting flourishes. It was believable.I felt that the movie really opened up my life. I wish I had seen it 45 years ago when I married for the first time. It is that good.".

I went there with such expectations and I was pleasantly surprised and amazed.I am about the same age as the couple and I deal with divorcing couples every day. This film is so real and truetolife with no big fight or overthetop scene which is appropriate since so many marriages end as a result of a collection of little unintended cruelties becoming unbearable.I cannot think of any film in which Tommy Lee Jones or Meryl Streep gave a more astonishing performance. Tommy Lee going to a couples therapy session run by Steve Carell? The perfect setup for lots of laughs but then we realize the situation is really not funny.Imagine a film in which Steve Carell has absolutely no gags routines or funny bits. Yet I can't imagine anyone doing that role better. He was in another film dealing in part with a relationship gone bad Crazy Stupid Love which was a comic take and a marvelous film. Trying to find another film for comparison the closest that comes to mind is Bergman's Scenes From A Marriage. But I think this film about the same general subject is much more accessible.I would have given this film a 10 but the soundtrack of obvious songs to underscore the plot became somewhat distracting. The song most appropriate here but not used is That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be. The couple here would be from the same generation as Carly Simon.I'm going back.".

It is difficult to play a man who is unable to be vulnerable and he truly excelled.Of course as with every cinematic experience depends on your state of mind and your demographic. The couple sitting in front of me were elderly and mid way through the movie the lady leaned over and put her head on her partner's shoulder and stayed like that through the rest of the movie.

That's why I though his realization is so poignant. The film is based on a solid script but the direction is sluggish and uncertain to say the least.

	schema:reviewBody "There is no feeling of being lonesome so crushing as being in a room with someone in a relationship with somebody when the feeling is gone. This couple married thirty one years have discovered this as some of us have at different times in our lives. Tommy Lee Jones is the husband marred down in his married life that has dimmed into something he feels will never be bright again. Never expects it to be. Is perfectly willing to plod along through life as is with his anger and dismay at how things have turned out hidden and suppressed. Meryl Streep is his wife loving and longing to be loved feeling that marriage should not be this way no longer feeling attractive or appreciated. Willing to come out of her shell to try for change. Elizabeth Shue who we don't see nearly enough of lately was excellent. I have never liked Steve Carell so much in a role as I did in his part as the marriage counselor trying to inflate this flattened union. Many many couples married for decades will feel parts if not all of this movie in a personal way. I go to a lot of films and the number of people in the theater for the showing of this movie was more than I've seen gathered for an afternoon in the theater in years. I mean years. That's how infrequently we have a decent movie with fabulous actors come out with no filthy language no gratuitous sex.nothing to detract from a solid screenplay a story well told and well acted. This one was exasperating touching amusing in spots made you smile caused you to shake your head..it has it all. At the end of this film everyoneand I mean everyonewas smiling happy that they had come to see this one. Wow. That doesn't happen often. Perhaps the young people won't see or appreciate the truth of this film so much but let me tell you the young are not the only folks buying tickets to movies. And every person with a few years under his or her belt married to the same spouse for decades will understand it and love it!".

This couple married thirty one years have discovered this as some of us have at different times in our lives. Tommy Lee Jones is the husband marred down in his married life that has dimmed into something he feels will never be bright again. Never expects it to be. Is perfectly willing to plod along through life as is with his anger and dismay at how things have turned out hidden and suppressed. Meryl Streep is his wife loving and longing to be loved feeling that marriage should not be this way no longer feeling attractive or appreciated. Willing to come out of her shell to try for change. Elizabeth Shue who we don't see nearly enough of lately was excellent. I have never liked Steve Carell so much in a role as I did in his part as the marriage counselor trying to inflate this flattened union. Many many couples married for decades will feel parts if not all of this movie in a personal way. I go to a lot of films and the number of people in the theater for the showing of this movie was more than I've seen gathered for an afternoon in the theater in years. I mean years. That's how infrequently we have a decent movie with fabulous actors come out with no filthy language no gratuitous sex.nothing to detract from a solid screenplay a story well told and well acted. This one was exasperating touching amusing in spots made you smile caused you to shake your head..it has it all. At the end of this film everyoneand I mean everyonewas smiling happy that they had come to see this one. Wow. That doesn't happen often. Perhaps the young people won't see or appreciate the truth of this film so much but let me tell you the young are not the only folks buying tickets to movies. And every person with a few years under his or her belt married to the same spouse for decades will understand it and love it!";

	schema:reviewBody "There are movies that come along that fall in numerous genres. The latest Hope Springs seems to be pushing the comedy but sports a story that could easily be delivering the drama so going in is already somewhat of a mystery on what to really expect. With a stellar cast of Meryl Streep Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carell is there any way this film couldn't work on some level? Hope Springs follows a married couple who have grown apart. They head out to Hope Springs to attempt to rekindle their lost spark but with a skeptical husband reluctant to take on the treatment is there any chance of saving this marriage? This is one of those movies that actually hit the mark successfully being both a comedy and a drama. When it's funny it hit a lot of really funny sometimes uncomfortable funny moments. These are not a bad thing but more uncomfortable for the characters in the situation thus causing a bit for the audience. What makes this film go from something pretty average to deliver something a bit more is the cast. Jones and Streep have both great chemistry throughout the film and feel like a real couple during the problem times as well as the emotional affection ones. This is their movie to shine and the emotional roller coaster they both deliver really makes this film work. They bounce around from typical married couple to acting like teenagers in love like only someone with their talent could do. Carell does a great job playing the straight laced doctor but really only serves as a buffer to help this story of these too move along. This does showcase another chance to show he is more than just a funny man but just doesn't bring a whole lot to the film but what he does works well. The story isn't anything all that new but will easily affect any age couple in a relationship that have experienced something like this from the emotional moments to the comedic ones.This is a memorable cute heartfelt movie that is usually saved for the younger cast but gives it this new twist using the older couple. Jones and Streep show that they still have it in both the acting chops and the love story delivering some unexpected sexual humor that elevated this movie just out of average and into a fun worthwhile cute film.httpwww.examiner.commovieindallasbobbyblakey".

	schema:reviewBody "Hope Springs 2012  out of 4 Charming comedy about a married couple Meryl Streep Tommy Lee Jones who have been together for thirtyone years but the wife starts to think they're losing everything. She forces her husband to go to a marriage counselor Steve Carell and soon they realize that a lot more is wrong than they thought. If you're looking for some deep hard hitting marriage drama then I highly recommend you check out Ingmar Bergman's SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE. If you're looking for some light entertainment that will make you laugh then HOPE SPRINGS is just the film for you. Yes I understand you could argue that Streep and Jones are too talented to appear in such a simple comedy but I personally don't think it matters and especially since both of them are so enjoyable here. What really struck me is that the two really do come across as a real couple who have been together for over thirtyyears. Both actors are clearly into their roles and this is especially true for Jones who easily steals the picture. He can play grumpy like no other person out there and he does a terrific job here. His replies to being pressured by the doctor have a certain comic timing which I found downright hilarious at times. Carell is also very good as the man in the middle. He basically just has to sit there and ask questions but the actor made the role quite memorable. The film is far from perfect as there's no doubt that it starts to wear down in the final fifteen minutes or so but the two actors are simply so charming that it's still worth watching.".

One reviewer said they were robotic and yes that was it...the morning routine right down to placing the briefcase and jacket in the same spot every...single...day...DULLSVILLE! It was correct! It was perfectly handled reserved wife doesn't speak up or complain but instead heads to couples therapy ALONE. How many couplehalves have done that? Can I get an AMEN? But there is a voice of fear deep under all that gruff redundancy in Tommy Lee Jones' character and he relents and goes. WATCH HIS FACE. His rugged face transforms from one scene to the next in the most remarkable way. He nearly looks like a different person once the ice is broken and they actually touch affectionately again after years of lack.I can't think of anything to say about Meryl other than beauty excellence and never disappointing. She just exudes joy even when she's miserable...greatness...depth...layers and layers. Steve Carrel played the straight man with tenderness and subtlety beyond my wildest imaginings. The closeups had me expecting a typical goofball break in his demeanor and it never happened. He was the quintessential good counselor. Well of course in a perfect world all marital problems wouldcould be solved in a week but face it...not going to happen. However the key elements rose to the top...persevere if it is important and let it go if it's not. Communication MUST exist. Tear down those walls. Sexuality doesn't end at 50 and having someone who knows you intimately helps a lot. And let me just add...after age 50 the face starts to change! Yes TLJ looked haggard. Yes MS looked uncomfortable matronly. But look at their transformation! The breakthrough took 10 years off each of them and I don't think it was the magic of Botox either. They looked REAL! They looked like me...they looked like US. THANK YOU! So if you still believe marriages and relationships can withstand the tests of time seven year itch and whatever else life throws at you then see this movie. It might renew your belief that good things can still happen if you work for it. I was inspired.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a deep sadness in Kay's eyes the night that she puts on a sexy nightgown and enters her husband's bedroom hoping that he will take the hint. She already knows what will happen. They haven't slept in the same room in years. She finds her husband Arnold propped up in the bed reading a Golf magazine and when he looks at her he assumes that she has come to complain that her room is too cold. Minutes pass before he realizes what she wants. Fumbling at her wordless suggestion he makes an excuse about not feeling well. We sense that this has become a routine.Hope Springs is a flawed but intelligent comicdrama about a marriage that has slipped into a repetitive rut. Arnold and Kay Soames have been married for 31 years and have been alone in the house since their last child left for college four years ago. Arnold is happy in his routine and Kay is too afraid of starting an argument to tell him that she is bored stiff. His life is perfectly content. He gets up in the morning has the same thing for breakfast  two eggs sunnyside up side of bacon with coffee and orange juice. He goes to work then comes home has dinner natters a bit about his job he's an accountant then falls asleep in front of the golf channel. He acknowledges Kay more or less the same way that he does the refrigerator. He loves her but seems to regard her more as a fixture. All around him Kay wanders about her daily routine trying to find some way to break it. The couple is at odds emotionally and physically he hasn't touched her in years until finally Kay has had enough.One night over dinner she presents him with a bold announcement. She has signed them up for a weeklong couples counseling session with a certain Dr. Feld Steve Carrell in Maine with money that she has been saving. Arnold's natural instinct is to give Kay's suggestion a resounding Hell no but Kay is ready for this. She tells him that the plane leaves in the morning and she will be on it whether he is there or not. No points for guessing what his decision will be.What you think will happen based on a very misleading trailer is that Hope Springs will be loaded with all kinds of classic misunderstandings colorful supporting characters pratfalls and foolish oneliners in the service of trekking Arnold and Kay on the road to marital bliss. You'd be halfright. The best parts of Hope Springs take place in the therapist's office as the goodnatured and very patient Dr. Feld tries to get Arnold and Kay to open up about where their marriage stalled. Arnold doesn't want to talk because he has longsince given up his emotions for grouchy indifference. Kay is afraid to talk because doesn't want to rock the boat but the further that Dr. Feld digs into their relationship the more he gets them to open up.Not much of what happens to Arnold and Kay is a surprise. Hope Springs is an often complicated drama that draws them toward reigniting the fire in their marriage but it doesn't get any more complicated than it needs to be. What is refreshing is that the plot is thin enough that it gets out of their way. This is more of a character study than a fullblooded story. There are no needless sideplots no useless pratfalls no unnecessary characters. What we have here is a very involving portrait of two people who have lived in each other's company for 31 years and now have to reestablish what it means to be married.The most brilliant decision was the casting. Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep are so familiar to us that we get comfortable with them right away. We can believe from the first moment we see them that they have been married for three decades. Streep of course is the most expressive of actors always able to reveal hidden dimensions without uttering a word. There are moments in the therapist's office when she doesn't speak and we can see her thinking. But it is Tommy Lee Jones that surprises us she's great but he's a revelation. This is a very rare role for him. He often plays police officers and military men but here he is required to play a man who must crack his tough exterior to be more of a sensitive and loving man for his wife. He's the perfect actor to do it and knowing that Arnold isn't that far from Jones' personality it real life this must have been a difficult role for him to play.Most of the therapy deals with their sex life they don't have one. Dr. Feld asks some very pointed and often painfully uncomfortable questions in an effort to get these two to open up. The scene in which he digs under their sex life is played with blinding honestly and is made all the more uncomfortable by the director's wise decision not to undercut it with a musical score. Even better is the fact that Steve Carrell  one of our best comic talents  plays the role of the therapist completely straight. He is bold he is honest and he quietly hammers Arnold and Kay with questions that they are clearly illequipped to answer.If there is one weakness in the film it is the ending. The movie is about 20 minutes too long and gives us a happy ending that spongecleans all of Arnold and Kay's problems until they don't seem to exist anymore. A more lifegoeson ending might have been more appropriate here based on what has gone before but still this is a good movie wellwritten and well played. out of four".

	schema:reviewBody "The story does not have anything that would be even slightly interesting. It was to the point that after therapy session number three I turned to my husband and asked if we would have to sit through ALL of their therapy sessions for the price of the admission to the movie? What was the whole point of the movie? Was it intended to be an educational manual to various things the couples 55 should try while attempting to save their marriage? Some ratings stated that this is an issue of the whole aging generation. What is exactly the issue?

	schema:headline " Hope Springs Eternal for a Marriage That Has Lost Its Way Thanks to Masterful Work from Streep and Jones";
	schema:reviewBody "When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago Ulu Grosbard's Falling in Love 1984 in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect Robert De Niro on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel The Devil Wears Prada and firsttime screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum a 31yearold marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on autopilot she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties.An optimist despite the odds Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs Maine where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the LifetimeTV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling largerthanlife figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized inchoate marriage as Arnold does.At 63 the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their ageold emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves or each other to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straightup without an iota of irony and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works parttime Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely and yes sassy neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple. Frankel overdoes the soundtrack music when moments of silence would have been far more effective but otherwise the tone feels spoton.".

She's too shy and inhibited to express her loneliness he's too clueless to even notice much less care how robotic their roles have become. Streep finally musters the combined desperation and courage to coerce her hubby to fly with her to a small town in Maine for a week of intensive counseling with a selfhelp author Steve Carell.The idea is about as timely as it could be for a generation of Boomers approaching that stage of life. The stars would seem to be ideally suited to depict the nascent angst of a generation offering warmth wit and insights into their own situations. But when the film starts that hope begins to fizzle. The problem is the script the whole script and nothing but the script. Writer Vanessa Taylor creates mere caricatures of the demographics Streep and Jones should represent. She's far too wimpy and he's far too grumpy for the dramedy with heart and substance such actors could deliver. Films like Shirley Valentine About Schmidt or Something's Gotta Give to name a few have far more successfully mixed laughs with learning in romantic matters among the graying. The course we slog through with these cardboard cutouts becomes more excruciating for the viewer than for the characters. Carell is wasted Jean Smart and Elizabeth Shue have such brief inconsequential parts that one wonders if better scenes with them missed the final cut adding yet another level of failure to the package.About 20 years ago a movie called Dying Young sugarcoated the course of terminal cancer on a young man Campbell Scott and the woman Julia Roberts who loved him. Fine actors were stuck in a turgid soaper that not only made a lame film but possibly an affront to anyone who'd actually lived through the loss of a loved one to debilitating illnesses. This one trivializes the real emotions of another group by showing a couple too simplistically for substance but not broadly enough for farce.Those old enough to remember or at least get Guy Lombardo's joke that when he dies he's taking New Year's Eve with him can join in my hope that this film is not the first sign that Nora Ephron's recent passing means the same for romantic comedies that nourish both the heart and the mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "Remember after Jaws people saying they had a fear of getting back into the water? After Hope Springs you may have a fear of getting back into bed. The shark here played by Meryl Streep is in halfhearted pursuit of Tommy Lee Jones perhaps this shark is a vegetarian or at least that's how Tommy appears to view her. He plays a kind of reverse Ahab wanting to flee at the very sight of her. Why she doesn't want to flee at the very sight of him is a bit of a mystery. If you found Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris misogynistic try to get your head around this film. This No Tango in Maine makes Last Tango look like Romeo  Juliet. Last Tango is all about sex with sex. Hope Springs is all about sex with no sex. Which is not that unusual really since most American films that are all about sex have no sex e.g. any film starring Sarah Jessica Parker Jennifer Aniston etc.Back to Hope Springs. The premise The secret of a good relationship is oral sex. That's the premise of most porn films you say. You say right.As with all porn films few people seem to have stayed for the ending of Hope Springs. This may be the most walkedoutof film of the year. So how and why does something this trashy get made? How does something by Lars von Trier Melancholia get made? There seems to be an audience for films that express a fear and loathing of straight sex marriage and common decency. Loveless without wit or charm Hope Springs is described in many of the one star reviews as creepy creepy being the secular equivalent of evil in our tiresomely nonjudgmental way of skirting the issue. But how can you skirt around it? Everything this film says about marriage is degrading and twisted. The writer of this film Vanessa Taylor is nominated in the Outstanding Film or Show Written by a Woman category at The Women's Image Network Awards for 2012.".

	onyx:emotionText "Remember after Jaws people saying they had a fear of getting back into the water? After Hope Springs you may have a fear of getting back into bed. The shark here played by Meryl Streep is in halfhearted pursuit of Tommy Lee Jones perhaps this shark is a vegetarian or at least that's how Tommy appears to view her. He plays a kind of reverse Ahab wanting to flee at the very sight of her. Why she doesn't want to flee at the very sight of him is a bit of a mystery. If you found Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris misogynistic try to get your head around this film. This No Tango in Maine makes Last Tango look like Romeo  Juliet. Last Tango is all about sex with sex. Hope Springs is all about sex with no sex.

Although Carrell and Streep are at their best Tommy Lee Jones is in a state of grace for this film. He is brilliant funny fiercely believable. If you know him as an actor it's obvious that he is capable of effortless brilliance as in The Fugitive where he stole the movie without having a great deal to do. Here he finally gets his teeth into a subtle and substantial lead which asks him to give it his all. He delivers an Oscar worthy performance that means 'exceptional' not 'his character goes through hell and is either disabled or a historical figure'.In fact Hope Springs is a mindblowing lifealtering kind of film the subject matter is plain as a daytime talk show what sets it apart is the delivery of the simple story the care and attention and sensitivity afforded the characters everyday lives and feelings.Thrilling work.".

	schema:reviewBody "The marriage between Kay Meryl Streep and Arnold Tommy Lee Jones has evolved after thirtyone years into a daily routine with no spark left. Arnold goes to work comes home eats and watches Golf Channel. Kay figures that she does not want to go on with business as usual and signs up for intensive couples counseling with Dr. Feld Steve Carell. The movie details their efforts to work through their problems under the direction of Dr. Feld. If you have ever had someone reveal personal information to you that had you saying to yourself Whoa too much information that was exactly my reaction to this movie. Did I really want to see Kay trying to administer oral sex to Arnold in a movie theater? Well no.The main problem I had with this movie is that Dr. Feld immediately zeros in on sex. There are a lot of ways that relationships can be intimate and successful without sex being the pivotal issue. Clearly Kay and Arnold had some serious communication issues dating back for years. I should think that a start would have been to have Kay and Arnold talk honestly to each other on all manner of topics. Were they compatible with respect to religion politics their relationships with their kids?I know older people have sex and that sexual incompatibility can cause problems but I just did not feel comfortable getting into the intimate details of this particular marriage. Of course my being made uncomfortable is not cause for criticism of the movie but for that discomfort I wanted some reward and there was little here. Given the main plot line there were few surprises offered in route to an inevitable happy ending that had all participants running around on a beach and jumping in ecstasy like a final scene in a Viagra advertisement.Given that sex is what Dr. Feld concentrates on younger people will probably not be engaged by this since the thought of older people having sex is hard for them to comprehend and the thought that they may wind up like this couple would be horrifying. I figure that the target audience would be older couples particularly ones who are having problems. A couple I know found that seeing this was personally meaningful and told me that it helped open a beneficial conversation between them. So I don't doubt that there is value here for some people but for me the movie was mainly cringeworthy.Streep and Jones are sincere in their approaches and turn in good performances. These must have been challenging roles for them and I admire them for not disguising their ages. The scenes with Dr. Feld are played pretty straight and realistic but I felt the whole enterprise was compromised by the introduction of forced comedic elements like the bar scene the banana scene the bookstore scene and so forth.".

Fortunately for us the lovely Ms. Streep works very well with Lee Jones as a couple who have been married more than 30 years and have lost their romantic spark. Kay Streep is determined to save the relationship and engages the services of a professional counselortherapist Carrell and things don't go too smoothly at first.It would be easy to say the film belongs to either star and this might be true because they complement each other so well it's hard to imagine either one not being part of a true relationship. That's how good their acting is here. Streep as usual is on top of every minor detail as the wife who suffers quietly for the most part and yearns to regain what she once had. Lee Jones is the surprise here as the man who grunts and makes a lot of noise to protect his privacy and vulnerable side. Some of the best scenes have him interacting with Carrell who is very good as the insightful and caring professional.Hope Springs is very good film because it manages to stay small not go for cheap histrionics and shows plenty of quiet moments that help you understand how partners in a marriage fail to communicate at crucial times tentatively endangering a beautiful relationship. It is also an appeal to those members of the audience who might understand how precious it is to find and lose a soul mate. Overall the film communicates its themes in an engaging and efficient manner.In my opinion the film shows some of the best work done by the two leads an example that we don't need serious costume dramas all the time to witness an artist at the top of her  his craft.".

No you won't go home a better person for having seen this. And you won't carry the images with you or ponder great philosophies because of it.

I was at the edge of my seat. The plot takes several unexpected turns and is packed with continuous action while the characters are very believable. O.k. fine it does not deal with deep moral issues if you want a movie that will make you want to go out and change the world this is not it. But if you want an entertaining movie that will give you a big dose of adrenaline will have you raise yourself from your seat I strongly recommend it. By the way I am not a big fun of horror teenage movies like Scream I just don't find them believable and find the characters shallow. The best part about this movie is that you actually feel sympathy for the victims the plot is probable and the action scenes do not require that the actors possess superhuman strength. At the end of the movie the only thing I could think of was holy cow a response I usually associate with a great roller coaster ride.".

But if you want an entertaining movie that will give you a big dose of adrenaline will have you raise yourself from your seat I strongly recommend it. By the way I am not a big fun of horror teenage movies like Scream I just don't find them believable and find the characters shallow. The best part about this movie is that you actually feel sympathy for the victims the plot is probable and the action scenes do not require that the actors possess superhuman strength. At the end of the movie the only thing I could think of was holy cow a response I usually associate with a great roller coaster ride.";

	schema:reviewBody "A kidnapped woman Kim Basinger frantically dials a random number on a broken telephone reaching the cellular phone of a young man in a different state Chris Evans who begins a race against time to find and save her before the connection is lost or she is killed.Cellular is a fast paced exciting and entertaining movie. It is a simple film yet an interesting one. The plot isn't new or anything but the execution is pretty good. They manage to keep the audience glued to the screen and at the edge of their seats. Keep in mind though that the film is highly unrealistic. There are a few eye rolling moments and some of the scenes may be hard to buy. I didn't have any real problems with it but some other people may complain about it. The movie is also pretty predictable. It is easy to see where things are going and the inside man is also easy to figure out.The acting is pretty good with the best being William H. Macy. He plays the cop role pretty well and he has a few funny lines. Chris Evans gives a decent performance and he is now forgiven for appearing in the Perfect Score. Kim Basinger gives an okay performance. Sometimes she was a little too weak while other times she was just average. Jessica Biel was in the movie for about 10 minutes so it's not really worth watching. Jason Statham gives a pretty convincing performance as the bad guy though sometimes he seemed a little bored. Noah Emmerich gives an awful performance as Jack. He was just reading his lines the entire time. One of the worst performances of 2004.David R. Ellis does a good job at directing. He keeps the audience entertained and he never lets stupidity bring down the movie. If you do give the movie a shot just ignore any plot holes. Cellular is a thrilleraction movie and if you take it seriously then you will hate the movie. The film is advertised as a harmless thriller and it succeeds as one. In the end Cellular is a B movie at heart and a pretty good one. It never takes itself too seriously and it never becomes dull. Rating 810".

	schema:headline " A thriller worth watching for its exhilaratingly fast pace situational humor and Chris Evans' starmaking performance.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of  Gimmicky thriller premises are a dime a dozen. Fox's 24 essentially expounds on that idea every episode without any rhythm or consistency. The real trick is executing the idea with the right panache and skill to weave it all into a fun thriller. So is David R. Ellis' Cellular worthy of Phone Booth acclaim or is it just another Nick of Time? You just might be surprised to see it's every bit as enjoyable as the former with only occasional hints at the pure cheese of the latter.Young beach bum Ryan Chris Evans is having just another typical day of sun and fun at the beach but his girlfriend Jessica Biel sees his behavior as lazy and irresponsible. To try and patch things up he promises to run a few errands for her but on the way he receives a call on his cell phone from a stranger named Jessica Martin Kim Basinger a woman who claims she's been kidnapped and is being held in the attic of an unfamiliar house. Her call to Ryan was completely random but the catch is she has to stay on the line or the signal may be lost for good.Though initially dubious of her outrageous claims Ryan quickly comes to believe her after he overhears one of the kidnappers on the phone. Deciding to help out in any possible way he can Ryan tries to locate her family before the kidnappers do. Unfortunately obstacles to keeping the phone signal going present themselves at every turn and Ryan finds he must go through some extreme measures to keep Jessica on the line.It's these obstacles that make up at least half the fun of watching Cellular. Whether it's a dying battery typical close call encounters with the villains car chases that require driving backwards or on the wrong side of the road director Ellis keeps the pace lightning fast by presenting every plausible hindrance there is to keeping a cell phone signal alive. That might not be as immediately catchy a premise as keeping a bus above 50 mph but it's hard to care when the gimmick is delivered with this much fresh skill and energy. Ellis also directed the enjoyable Final Destination 2 proving he has what it takes to deliver straightfaced thrillers in spite of their naturally ridiculous premises.But as terrific a job as Ellis does it's the cast that keeps the momentum going even when the story starts to sag. As the everyman caught in this horrifying situation Chris Evans is wholly convincing and immensely appealing as Ryan playing out an otherwise simple role for all its worth. Most of the movie rests on his shoulders so it's to no small amount of praise when I say that we eagerly want to follow him through every move of his daylong adventure. Kim Basinger is surprisingly just as good as the kidnapped woman proving that much like her physical features her acting skills are improving with age. The other major standout is Jason Statham as the head kidnapper he's obviously affecting an American accent that's not all that believable but he brings an intensity to the role that makes him fiercely menacing.The plot boasts the expected coincidences and contrivances that are needed to fuel the story and most of these are easy enough to accept but there are admittedly a few nagging problems. While I could reasonably believe that the kidnappers wouldn't tie up Jessica and could also accept that she knows just enough about phones to fix one up well enough to make one call I found it less easy to swallow that the kidnappers wouldn't at least keep a guard posted right outside or inside her room. No biggie though.The more bothersome bits involve a few unlikely coincidences that allow a cop played by William H. Macy who delivers another one of his requisite subtly funny performances to conveniently piece together a number of the clues. Even more troublesome is the climax which has the unfortunate task of resolving every introduced plot strand and while the results are still highly entertaining it comes across a bit messy though ironically finishing things up on a nice and tidy final note.Still the story makes a lot of right choices when a lesser movie would have simply veered off course for good. A plot twist involving the villains' identities and their motives is smart and surprising. The movie also satisfyingly chooses to reveal its surprise villain halfway through rather than saving it for a silly lastminute unveiling.The film also boasts a good sense of humor a lot of it coming from Evans who handles the comic moments with natural ease no real surprise he was also very funny in Not Another Teen Movie. His best moment comes in one scene where he's in a private school searching for Jessica's kid flabbergasted over his name which is particularly funny and how identical every student looks in the same brand of clothing. The laughs don't defuse the tension though and it's with this fun mixture of suspense and occasional comic ingenuity that makes this a highly recommended thriller.".

It is a sign that the writer andor the director are thrilled with the sheer joy of creative exploration. They aren't just playing by the numbers but are eager to go beyond expectations. This is filmmaking as a challenging game.CELLULAR while not in the same league as GROUNDHOG DAY is nonetheless a good example of this type of storytelling. This time the linchpin of the story is the cell phone. The filmmakers seem to have made a list of everything that makes cell phones great emergency use portability digital photography etc. as well as what makes them a nuisance ringing at inappropriate times crossed connections lost signals dying batteries etc. and incorporated both lists into a story. The trick isn't just to gerryrig the list into a story but to do so in a coherent and plausible fashion. CELLULAR is a crackerjack piece of storytelling. The storyline is unlikely but not impossible and it all unfolds at a steady clip that makes any loophole or implausibility fly by so fast that the viewer has little time to raise a question. Beyond the gimmickry of the storytelling the film also benefits from being a solid efficient nononsense piece of filmmaking. Directed by actorturnedstuntmanturneddirector David R. Ellis this is an actionpacked thriller that knows the value of blending action with humor and character. Without loosing its manic pace the film nevertheless takes time for puckish humor and character development. As the damsel in distress the Hitchcockian innocent man sucked into a web of intrigue and the retiring cop facing his one last case the actors could have been saddled with onenote clich characters. But Kim Basinger Chris Evans and William H. Macy are given ample room to not only act but to create characters who are more importantly smart. They aren't at the mercy of the complicated plot they are what moves it along. My one genuine reservation with CELLULAR is that it is destined to become dated so very fast. Technology the film's driving force will quickly be its undoing. It brings to mind old episodes of the Columbo TV series where Peter Falk's Lt. Columbo is seen to be in awe of computers and answering machines and video cameras and VCRs and he has to go into great detail explaining how such gadgets and gizmos work and how they can be used as part of a murder plot. The cutting edge technology of the time now seems so elementary that Columbo's naivete seems rather silly. Yet the Columbo stories still hold up thanks to clever storytelling and strong characters played by good actors. And from that perspective CELLULAR just might hold up to be a minor classic albeit as a period piece.".

Implausible from the get go laughingly stilted dialog you name it this film has it. Why in the heck would Wm. Macy and Kim Bassinger submit to this trash? And yet some critics compare it favorably to Phone Booth  what are you guys smoking?Just an example of the terrible writing  The kidnappers steal Kim's Porsche Cayanne and then all she can say to her cell buddy when attempting to thwart the kidnapping of her son is that her car is a black SUV. Come on!!! She HAS to know that it's a Porsche for Chrissakes  not to mention that giving the license number may have helped. DUH!And then when there's nobody home on the fourth floor of the PD  yeah sure. I finally had had enough when the slacker dude takes off after the Porsche in the tiny Security car  uh huh like he could keep up with the Porsche or that the Security Car wouldn't look conspicuous and the kidnappers realizing that they were being followed would simply put pedal to the metal and say see ya  a premise that seems beyond the reasoning of our hero.I'm all for action films but you have to at least have some basis in reality and this film truly lacks that basis. Maybe someone thought the whole idea was clever  1001 ways to make use of a cell phone but when there is absolutely no reality quotient.... well it just makes a bad film.Anyone else wonder 1 how a school teacher would be home in the middle of the day and able to then pick up her son after school 2 how a school teacher who by her own admission doesn't have a lot of money lives in a fancy house has a maid drives a 70000 dollar car and has her son enrolled in a private school.

DUH!And then when there's nobody home on the fourth floor of the PD  yeah sure. I finally had had enough when the slacker dude takes off after the Porsche in the tiny Security car  uh huh like he could keep up with the Porsche or that the Security Car wouldn't look conspicuous and the kidnappers realizing that they were being followed would simply put pedal to the metal and say see ya  a premise that seems beyond the reasoning of our hero.I'm all for action films but you have to at least have some basis in reality and this film truly lacks that basis. Maybe someone thought the whole idea was clever  1001 ways to make use of a cell phone but when there is absolutely no reality quotient.... well it just makes a bad film.Anyone else wonder 1 how a school teacher would be home in the middle of the day and able to then pick up her son after school 2 how a school teacher who by her own admission doesn't have a lot of money lives in a fancy house has a maid drives a 70000 dollar car and has her son enrolled in a private school. Totally laughable.";

Near the end just the two flying whirls in the air by William Macy shooting are enough to get you out of the theater!. A boy crying out loud ...that kid is being kidnapped... and everyone goes after him and not the kidnappers in their car!. A biology teacher Bassinger who handles phone cables left after the phone was beaten up to crack by the bad guyhow about taking it out the room you moron! better than expert phone service technicians!. Everyone steals a car and other stuff in front of people and policemen and no one no one does a single thing!. No one cares about plates in this movie they are not being jotted down nor searched at computers and databases nothing. Main actor Chris Evans looks as a Ricky Nelson just arrived in 2004 with his time machine. In short besides entertaining a little bit this movie was an overall insult to my intelligence and probably to those of many others too.".

If you expect substance this movie is not it  director Michael Mann's recent film Collateral 2004 with Tom Cruise Jaimie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith did optimize the cellular phone as part of a substantial plot progression. To be more esoteric try the Iranian film by wd Abbas Kiarostami of A Taste of Cherry fame The Wind Will Carry Us 2000 which also featured the cellular phone in a down to earth way. Also brings to mind is the Danish film by Dogma wd Thomas Vintenberg The Celebration aka Festen 1998 an emotional powerhouse surrounding the reunion of a dysfunctional family and the PBS TV series Reckless 199798 with the irresistible mnage a trois of Robson Green Francesca Annis and Michael Kitchen the cellular phone was well featured as a plot 'crutch' in both. It's a timely reflection or reminder of how cellular technology is consumingly inhabiting our lives and here in this breeze of a movie we have a life saver adventure  a day in the life of Ryan Chris Evans to the rescue of a civilian family from the claws of relentless bad cops well nothing so complicated or devastatingly psychoplay as Training Day of course. This is a lightweight fare. Just enjoy it as it is. Kim Basinger and William H. Macy didn't have to exert much acting chops per se. Evans and the video cellphones yes not just one there's two needed to complete the plot turns sure carried the movie alright. One would forgive or welcome the convenient plot points that Basinger happens to be a teacher of sciencebiology handy with wires harkens the beginning credit of production company name  Electric Entertainment hm and Macy's soon to retire good cop happens to follow his curiosity instinct and thank goodness Evan's character turned out to be not so goofy but smarter and thinking by the minute. It's relaxing entertainment with no need of foul language involved  straightforward ride with adequate supporting roles including Jason Statham The Transporter 2002 and The Italian Job 2003 and a seemingly unsuspecting role as the cop boss by Noah Emmerich last seen in Beyond Borders 2003 opposite Clive Owen and Angelina Jolie.".

Each situation just has no credibility. Ryan's feeble attempts to keep the line connection to Jessica the chase's from the kidnappers the car chase through apposing traffic which is lifted straight out of Ronin lack so much tension and suspension not being helped by one atrocious music score.With bland and flavourless action the acting is stiffer than rigor mortis with no sign of a pulse anywhere. Kim Basinger is woeful with her fragile distressed damsel it's depressing after she gave such a great performance in The Door in the Floor. Chris Evans is his usual cocky self. William H. Macy is sorely underused wasting such talent. Jason Statham never evokes menace as Ethan relying to much on his deep husky voice for fear.The enter film is a joke but your not laughing.".

Ryan's feeble attempts to keep the line connection to Jessica the chase's from the kidnappers the car chase through apposing traffic which is lifted straight out of Ronin lack so much tension and suspension not being helped by one atrocious music score.With bland and flavourless action the acting is stiffer than rigor mortis with no sign of a pulse anywhere. Kim Basinger is woeful with her fragile distressed damsel it's depressing after she gave such a great performance in The Door in the Floor. Chris Evans is his usual cocky self. William H. Macy is sorely underused wasting such talent. Jason Statham never evokes menace as Ethan relying to much on his deep husky voice for fear.The enter film is a joke but your not laughing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Do you know what I liked about this story? I loved the imagination that was created when the film ended. If you don't know what I am talking about let me explain. I walked away from this film interested in seeing where Ryan and Basinger's relationship was going to go. After a traumatic incident like the one they experienced together you can't help but wonder if possibly they will have this darker and haunting relationship built off that trauma after the credits finish rolling. Just a thought that I had. There has to be some psychological issues going on between them though with the acting that both possessed I don't think you could tell and I think that would make for a better story than what was presented here. Nonetheless that is what I like to call wishful thinking and another genuine story that will never be created. So faced with the challenge  wait  my cell phone is ringing  OK I'm back  faced with the challenge of writing this review I must try to be as clich as possible it would only be respectful.This action packed cellular ride showcased the poor acting ability of Kim Basinger and the honest proof that Oscar's are sometimes just handed out to anyone. Couldn't they have afforded Marisa Tomei? Either way from the unbelievable turn as a science teacher to also a doctor there was nothing real about her performance. Even when she was frightened she wasn't actually frightened but instead acting frightened. There was no depth or range to her character. I didn't care if she survived or died throughout this entire story. There was nothing that attached me to her other than the fact that she was like a feminine MacGyver of sorts. Then if Basinger's acting wasn't poor enough you also had to deal with the ability of Chris Evans to work with a cell phone. I mean please if you were given a script and your coactor was a piece of machinery you really have to start thinking about which direction you want your career to go. Evans only has about three faces of surprise and excitement and he used them all within the first three minutes of the film. The rest of the time we are left with nothing more than recycled emotions as he attempts to upstage his cell phone. It was pathetic. With these two actors anchoring the film down on both ends it made me happy to have a cell phone in this picture. Without it I don't think there would have been any value to this. Could you image this film with a rotary phone? HA. That would have made a much better film than what was presented here.I would like to take a moment to compliment the cell phone on its ability in this film. I don't know about you but I hope that it was paid better than the actors that were involved. I hope it had its own trailer its own entourage and everything it desired. Was there an audition for this cell phone? I think I would have enjoyed seeing the audition tapes as a supplemental feature to this DVD. When Oscars come around again this year I would not be surprised to see the cell phone perhaps be nominated? Is that too much to ask? I mean look at the world today. Cell phone is at the peak of its game. Everyone has one and everyone is talking to one. It is the biggest star this world has ever seen and finally it has the ability to showcase its talent in this film. I loved everything this cell phone did in this movie especially the ending. While you may think that it was a climactic moment between Statham and Macy I thought that I was biting my fingers over the cell phone more than the human element. When it rang at the end I nearly jumped. What other actor could bring that much emotion to the screen  none  other than this multitalented cell phone. I wouldn't be surprised it the next picture that it chose to do would be perhaps a period piece film. You know stretch its talent. Don't be surprised if you see more from this amazing actor as the years progress. I think it is likely to take the place of the Hall of Fame actor the cigarette. Just watch and see! Overall outside of the cell phone this was a poor film. This film is labeled as an action film but for some reason laughter bellowed from me more than actual excitement. Cellular was riddled with implausible events coupled with clichd moments that screamed Hollywood control. While it did showcase some great actors who have developed a fine body of work this film proves that even the mighty can fall. Statham needs to stop working for money and Macy was just getting paid. Basinger needs to remarry Baldwin and live off his money for awhile. With bad acting and just this hysterical dilemma the mixed bag of messages seemed to just get further and further away from reality. It became a comedy instead of an action film. From the beginning to the end there was nothing redeeming about this picture outside of the acting from the cell phone. I have trouble seeing what people loved about this film. Honestly if this were to happen to you would you steal cars shoot people and cause explosions? Nope I think the general public would just hang up. Test this theory out when you have the time.Grade two bars out of five".

Chris Evans is nice  he has a good future . Chris Evans did his own car stunts. Before production began he was trained for five weeks at a Los Angeles stunt school. Most of the stunts are done by the actors themselves too . The support cast is riveting  Jason Statham makes an fascinating villain and William H. Macy interprets magnificently an agreeable plice .The motion picture was well directed by David R. Ellis a good craftsman who started as stuntsman and director assistant .

	schema:headline " One of the most unique and daringly good films in years";
	schema:reviewBody "Ghost Dog Way of the Samurai       Stars Forest Whitaker stars in this amazingly good character driven film. Whitaker is Ghost Dog a New York hitman who lives by the code of the ancient samurai. When a job for the mob goes wrong they decide to cut their losses and put a hit out on him. But since he's a samurai and not just a normal hitman this proves to be a huge mistake for them. This film really works on three levels. First is the duality of the film's coolness factor and the strength of Whitaker's performance. Whitaker radiates cool in this film. In every scene and every frame through both action and inaction we know he is being of awesome power. His performance is note perfect. There's one scene where a grievous wrong has been done and we see Whitaker absorb the devastation then he narrates that when a making decision it should be done in the space of seven breathes. Once that decision is made and we realize Whitaker's full fury will now be unleashed upon his enemies it sends a tingle up the spine of the viewer. Whitaker's resolve shines through the screen and through his subsequent acting the pace builds until we reach the film's ultimate battle which is a really really good fight sceneone of the most satisfying ever filmed.Furthermore we have the film's philosophy. This aspect of the film is the most important of all even more so than Whitaker's superb performance. As the film's tale unfolds we do need learn about the Way of the Samurai through the eastern philosophy Whitaker espouses as he narrates the film. Often times the film breaks from the action just to linger on the narration and let in sink in. It's a technique that helps set the tone of the film and makes it a completely absorbing experience. The third thing that the film does really well is it is character and not plot driven. At least just as much time is spent following Whitaker through his day to day life as he interacts with people in his community as is spent on the action parts of the plot. In many ways the film works as commentary on the values of modern society. The scenes with Whitaker and his best friend a Haitian ice cream vendor provide this film with true heart and soul. We see repeatedly that the two friends can understand each other because they are at peace with the world and in tune with their surroundings so that their bond transcends mere language. Ghost Dog also has a touching relationship with a young girl that he hopes to impart his code to so that she may one day have the tools of knowledge necessary to escape life in the inner city. These are characters that would have been interesting a twohour film just living their lives without the samurai and hitman aspects of the film. However both aspects work exceptionally well the effect taken as a whole make this one of the best films of the past few years.Besides Whitaker and his friends one other great performance is given by Tricia Vessey as Louise Vargo the young girl that sets all that happens in motion. It's a small part but a key one that she does an admirable job with.If there is a flaw with this film it is that the gangster villains are unnecessarily racist. These scenes are somewhat jarring on first viewing but are at least consistent with the film's ultimate tone that the gangster's way of life is dying while the code of the samurai is timeless. It is no coincidence that all the mobsters are much older than Whitaker. Both characters note numerous times that the world is changing the difference is the gangsters say it with fear and trepidation while Whitaker notices it as observation. Like the changing of the wind the changing of time and circumstance is neither good nor bad when weighed against his code.While Whitaker deserves infinite praise for his performance almost just as much praise must be given to director Jim Jarmush. His directing of this film is quite daring and even more skillfull. His approach to the narration is unusual and yet it works on multiple levels and lets us this is a film more about tone than action. The character driven film is a rare commodity. Most films are plot driven moving from point A to point B with no more creativity than a child connecting a dottodot. Here we have a film that starts with its characters and lets them live the lives they've always lived before the central plot elements invaded their existence. The plot is addressed in a timely enough manner but we see the characters have their own commitments to fulfill too. It's a hard trick to make a character driven film really work without seeming disjointed or slowly paced but Jarmush succeeds masterfully. Jarmush also fills the film with other references in the background that emphasize the character's naturessuch as book on bears or the dialogue of a few cartoons here and there. Many films of try to do this but few films I have ever seen do it as well as Ghost Dog does.A final note the ending of this film that is one that will be very divisive. People will either love it or hate personally I loved it. It is an ending that is true to all that his come before for both the characters and their conflicting codes but also one that is both surprising despite being adequately foreshadowed.".

Delicate finite cinematography by Robby Mueller who's other superb collaboration with Jarmusch was on Down By Law. A performance from Forrest Whitaker as the dedicated unhingedfrom reality 'samurai' known as Ghost Dog which ranks among his best and shows in plain sight that he can carry an action film with patience and cool. And the film also carries a fine sense of humor to many scenes  the fact that these gangsters one of which Dog's boss watch more cartoons than take care of business is as funny as the way they interact sometimes. While it tends to streak on parody in the characters there's still the fascinating Jarmusch has in mixing the cultures. It's a hard film to classify for even though it's a martialarts movie the only sight of a sword is used for practice and not a bloodbath in Kill Bill. It's a gangster movie but every five minutes or so there's philosophical notes on the way of the samurai that seems more in place in a good thematically engaging art film than a good shootemup Hollywood actioner. It's a movie about urbanlife yet the only signs of Urbana are shown from a distance where the only two who will talk to Ghost Dog are a Haitian ice cream guy who provides a wonderfully weird scene on the roof with Ghost Dog and a little girl who likes to read. But it's this mixture that can keep a viewer on his or her toes especially once you realize the psychological state of the lead as much as his spiritual state.Parts of the film might turn off one group but the other parts of the film might keep the same group enthralled. In fact it's as interesting a comparison to be made to Kill Bill itself a hybrid as it is in the spiritual and stylistic parent Le Samourai by Melville.

One of the Mafia wiseguys must be killed as he is having an affair with the daughter of the Mafia Don.The person they get to do it is an African American who lives by the code of the Samurai and goes by the name of Ghost Dog. To be honest I have met many Japanafiles so this is not so unbelievable. But the code of the Mafia means that if you kill a wiseguy then you must be killed or the Mafia person who hired him must be killed.Jim Jarmusch makes movies where the characters close relations based on only very small things. The Mafia wiseguy saved Ghost Dogs life so now he must be his retainer. He lives off the land lives on a roof steals the cars and equipment he needs to do a job. There is also a friendship between 2 people who don't speak the same language. It is the connection between people that is so important here. If you saw Dead man and like it then you will love Ghost Dog. It is funny serious dark tragic and beautiful all at the same time. Dead man missed the mark with some similar themes though the DVD of Dead man has some deleted scenes that would have made the movie much better and reflected better the idea of small connections being strong connections.I loved this movie and I don't expect everyone else to. Art house movies have small audiences for this exact reason. I know a lot of people who avoided this movie because they thought it was cheesy. The answer is yes it is and most of the bad reviews reflect this same idea.Also I love the sound track with lots of Phat beats and uses Hip Hop African American culture to reflect Japanese culture.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the strangest and most likable movies I have ever seen....and I have seen a lot believe me. Scene after scene was bizarre. I watched an amazement on the first viewing chuckling here and there. By the third viewing I just laughing out loud throughout much of it. The dark subtle humor in here is as good as I've ever seen on film....even though it may be classified more of a gangster film than a comedy.The humor mainly involved the gangsters who were a bunch of old Mafia men. A mob never looked this pathetic but they were characters. It was especially fun to see Henry Silva again a man who used to be an effective villain back on a lot of TV shows in the 1960s. He didn't say much in this movie but the looks on his face were priceless. The funniest guy at least to me was the mobster who sang and danced to rap music!The byplay between Ghost Dog the hero of the movie played wonderfully by Forest Whitaker and the ice cream man who only spoke French also was fun and entertaining.Almost every character in here was a strange led by Whitaker who plays a modernday hitman who lives by the code of the ancient Samurai warriors. He also trains and communicates through carrier pigeons. Hey I said this was a bizarre movie!The violence was nononsense however nothing played for laughs and unlike Rambomentality people who were shot at were hit and usually killed right away.Along the way on this strange tale was a lesson or two on loyalty racism philosophies kindness communication etc. How much of this you take seriously and how much as a gag is up to you I guess. The more I watch this the more I see it as clever puton comedy....yet sad. It's not to easy to describe but you wind up getting involved with these odd people.The movie changes rapidly as Whitaker does in this story. One minute he is a brutally bearlike hitman and the next minute the gentlest of souls.A very unique film. The title looks a bit stupid and one you would easily dismiss as moronic but it is far from it. Great entertainment.".

	schema:headline " A big surprise that really works";
	schema:reviewBody "Jim Jarmusch isn't exactly a household name when it comes to Hollywood directors. I don't know about other people but personally I had heard of his name before but certainly couldn't name any of his movies. Now that has changed. Since I've seen Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai I'll try to see at least a couple of his other movies as well because I really liked this one.Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai is a quite unique movie. It tells the story of an AfricanAmerican mafia hitman in New York who lives by the rules of the Samurai in simplicity and alone with his pigeons who calls himself Ghost Dog and who is always faithful to his master a local mobster who has saved his life several years ago. When the daughter of the local mob boss witnesses one of Ghost Dog's hits he must die himself. The first victims are his birds and in response Ghost Dog goes right at his attackers. He is lethal but does not want to harm his master or the young woman. And while his life is in constant danger the only people he ever has contact with are a little girl with whom he discusses books and a Haitian ice cream man who only speaks French and doesn't understand a word of what Ghost Dog tells him.I guess the best way to categorize this movie is to call it a mix of the movie Lon the Samurai code and hiphop culture. Normally you would think that such a mix could never work but this time it does. I admit that it certainly isn't a normal mix but Jarmusch avoids the traps that would make this original and daring movie a complete waste of time and which would turn it into one unbelievable and unrealistic mess. I know it sounds strange how can a movie that combines Italian Japanese and hiphop culture into one ever become one solid movie? Don't ask me I don't even know how he came up with the idea but it works and that's all that matters.This movie has several strong points. One is the way everything is told and shown which make this a sober but powerful movie. Especially with the quotes that are taken from the Way of the Samurai and that are voiced by Forest Whitaker a solid base is formed. This helps you to understand why the man does what he does why he lives his life like that and why he will always respect his master. If this hadn't been in the movie I would probably not have liked it a bit. The other strong point is the acting. The mobsters look a bit stereotypical but are well portrayed by people like Cliff Gorman John Tormey Richard Portnow... but the best performance definitely comes from Forest Whitaker. Normally Whitaker plays the role of a good guy like for instance Jody in The Crying Game or Captain Ramey in Phone Boot and it has to be said he really has some talent for that kind of roles. But as he proves with this movie he is capable of a lot more. He plays the role of the samurai hit man doesn't look like he's fit for that role at all at least I would never think of him when it comes to that role but does it really very well. As a conclusion I would like to add that the sound track is also very nice. Normally I'm not too much a fan of hip hop in the movies although I can appreciate it as a form of music on itself but this time it really works. Add to this some nice acting a cool and wellwritten story some funny moments like for instance a rapping mobster and what you'll get is a movie that is fun and interesting to watch. I give it an 810.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jim Jarmusch isn't exactly a household name when it comes to Hollywood directors. I don't know about other people but personally I had heard of his name before but certainly couldn't name any of his movies. Now that has changed. Since I've seen Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai I'll try to see at least a couple of his other movies as well because I really liked this one.Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai is a quite unique movie. It tells the story of an AfricanAmerican mafia hitman in New York who lives by the rules of the Samurai in simplicity and alone with his pigeons who calls himself Ghost Dog and who is always faithful to his master a local mobster who has saved his life several years ago. When the daughter of the local mob boss witnesses one of Ghost Dog's hits he must die himself. The first victims are his birds and in response Ghost Dog goes right at his attackers. He is lethal but does not want to harm his master or the young woman. And while his life is in constant danger the only people he ever has contact with are a little girl with whom he discusses books and a Haitian ice cream man who only speaks French and doesn't understand a word of what Ghost Dog tells him.I guess the best way to categorize this movie is to call it a mix of the movie Lon the Samurai code and hiphop culture. Normally you would think that such a mix could never work but this time it does. I admit that it certainly isn't a normal mix but Jarmusch avoids the traps that would make this original and daring movie a complete waste of time and which would turn it into one unbelievable and unrealistic mess. I know it sounds strange how can a movie that combines Italian Japanese and hiphop culture into one ever become one solid movie? Don't ask me I don't even know how he came up with the idea but it works and that's all that matters.This movie has several strong points. One is the way everything is told and shown which make this a sober but powerful movie. Especially with the quotes that are taken from the Way of the Samurai and that are voiced by Forest Whitaker a solid base is formed. This helps you to understand why the man does what he does why he lives his life like that and why he will always respect his master. If this hadn't been in the movie I would probably not have liked it a bit. The other strong point is the acting. The mobsters look a bit stereotypical but are well portrayed by people like Cliff Gorman John Tormey Richard Portnow... but the best performance definitely comes from Forest Whitaker. Normally Whitaker plays the role of a good guy like for instance Jody in The Crying Game or Captain Ramey in Phone Boot and it has to be said he really has some talent for that kind of roles.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great film it has pretty much everything a great film needs a great score great actors great performances etc. The film revolves around Ghost Dog perfectly portrayed by Forest Whitaker. He is a assassin who lives by the code of the Samurai. Apart from him we also follow the fate of several mafia menthough nowhere near as intimately as we follow Ghost Dog. These two very different groups Samurai and mafia are both depicted reasonably well giving us insight to how the groups work and more importantly their code. Both groups live and die by the code and this is probably the most important thing in the movie and it's shown with respect with both Samurai and mafia I'm not entirely sure that it's correct all the way through but that's not what's most important anyway. The film has reasonably little action but it's not supposed to be an action film by any means. It's fairly slow throughout the film but it never really bores you to the point of not watching any more I've seen the film at least five times now so believe me I know. The film is very stylized and cool throughout which definitely has some part in keeping you interested but the theme and storyplot plays a bigger part I think. The plot is pretty good and though it keeps a fairly slow pace throughout the film it also keeps your interest for the entire duration of the film. The acting is all good though not everyone pulls off as excellent a performance as Whitaker. Isaach De Bankol portrays Ghost Dog's best friend and he does gives a great performance. So does Camille Winbush who portrays a girl who Ghost Dog befriends and discusses books with. The characters are wellwritten andmostly credible. I'm not entirely sure that the film does provide a totally correct version of the Code of the Samurai. The soundtrack is great it's made by the hiphop artist RZA but most of it will be enjoyable to people who aren't into hiphop. Also I guess it's more of a score than a soundtrack there isn't any time where the music feels out of place in a scene. All in all a great film but not for all tastes. Don't go in expecting an action film don't go in expecting a very deep an entirely intellectual film don't go in expecting a regular movie go in expecting to see a decentif not good representation of both the mafia code and the Samurai code. I've heard some people describe the ending as an anticlimax I don't know what they were expecting... I won't say that I saw it coming but I wasn't disappointed when it happened. It had to end it and I think the director Jim Jarmusch made a good decision on that. I recommend this film to people with an interest in Samurai fans of Jarmusch and people looking for a reasonably deep film. I don't recommend this to fans of action movies as there's fairly little action in the film. No matter who you are if you're going to see this film make sure you have the patience for it it's worth sitting through the two reasonably slow hours for. 810".

Interesting how G.D. says me  him we're from different ancient tribes and now we're both almost extinct. Almost prophetic as it leads to the High Noon style Western showdown where G.D. sacrifices himself in order to remain honourable.The best friend marvelously played by Issach de Bankole is able to communicate back and forth with G.D. even though neither of them speak the same language. Yet they always know what the other is saying.This is a classic samurai tale and a classic fairy tale. A fascinating connection to Rashomon featured in the film which takes the same story which changes drastically as its recounted by different witnesses. Yo have the sens in this film that those who are involved on the same plane are separated by different understandings of reality.You really need patience to appreciate this film and its various divergences. Many of the slow moments are extremely pertinent to the parent themes of the film.

	schema:headline " Out of Character For Jarmusch";
	schema:reviewBody "Ghost Dog certainly is an intriguing film. It breaks some new ground for writerdirector Jim Jarmusch who usually creates simple funny and heartfelt black and white films with many underlying themes. Ghost Dog is one of his few color films and it is also the most out of character picture he has made to date. Instead of a slowpaced comedic drama Ghost Dog is a slowpaced bloody crime film.The plot deals with Ghost Dog Whitaker an expert mafia assassin living in presentday New York City who lives his life according to the ancient code of the Samurai.Jarmusch somewhat reverses what Akira Kurosawa did in Throne of Blood by bringing Eastern culture to a Western setting. It's a rather fascinating idea but I can't help but feel that Jarmusch kind of falls into a trap he teeters on almost constantly in his films while he's so busy creating a slow brooding atmosphere and interweaving subtle underlying themes he occasionally forgets that this is still a movie. He still needs to keep the audience entertained. Ghost Dog sometimes moves so slowly that one becomes a little bit bored and anxious.Another thing that doesn't work particularly well in Ghost Dog are Jarmusch's signature scenes of offbeat humor that often just come completely out of nowhere. They usually work quite well such as Iggy Pop's and Billy Bob Thornton's blackly funny scene in Dead Man but they just feel awkward here. E.g. Jarmusch develops a very peculiar group of gangsters in Ghost Dog gangsters who think they're straight out of GoodFellas but are so incompetent that they can't even pay their rent nor figure out who they're trying to whack. This is often quite amusing but sometimes Jarmusch just goes over the top such as when he makes one of the fiftysomething Italian gangsters begin going on about how he loves rap and even start rapping his favorite verses right in the middle of a meeting of criminals. It's just uncomfortable.Still there's plenty to like here and there are quite a few homages for avid filmlovers to spot such as a cool little nod to the butterfly scene in Seijun Suzuki's Branded To Kill. Also the acting is often spoton. Forest Whitaker is absolutely perfect as Ghost Dog  detached subtle nuanced and most importantly human.Still I hesitate to recommend this film. Jim Jarmusch is most definitely an acquired taste but even his fans may find their patience tried during Ghost Dog.".

	schema:reviewBody "This new film written and directed by the Dean of Independent film makers Down by Law Night on Earth and Dead Man just to name a few of his masterpieces is a WONDERFUL entertaining and powerful work about a New York City inner city young man played marvellously by Forest Whitaker who studies and lives the way of the ancient Samurai warriors.  He has adopted the role of retainer to a minor  mob boss whose orders he carries out with flawless precision. Jarmusch once again pairs up with cinematographer Robby Muller with the predictable result that the film is visually magnificent. In typical Jarmusch fashion the hip hop sound track music by RZA is also masterful. Ghost Dog is exciting emotional even touching engaging and most unexpectedly funny.".

	onyx:emotionText "This new film written and directed by the Dean of Independent film makers Down by Law Night on Earth and Dead Man just to name a few of his masterpieces is a WONDERFUL entertaining and powerful work about a New York City inner city young man played marvellously by Forest Whitaker who studies and lives the way of the ancient Samurai warriors.  He has adopted the role of retainer to a minor  mob boss whose orders he carries out with flawless precision. Jarmusch once again pairs up with cinematographer Robby Muller with the predictable result that the film is visually magnificent. In typical Jarmusch fashion the hip hop sound track music by RZA is also masterful. Ghost Dog is exciting emotional even touching engaging and most unexpectedly funny.";

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't know what to expect with this movie. I don't even recall why I put it in my Netflix queue. Probably a friend of mine recommended it. Although I knew already that I think highly of both Forrest Whitaker and Jim Jarmusch. So I guess I had an idea that this was probably good times ahead. And let me tell you people I was not disappointed. During the almost 2 hours this movie lasts I didn't think one second that such scene or that one was too long. This goes completely against some of the critics that I have read in here. I don't know how anyone who's got some critical abilities could come up with such complaints. If you want to see a movie with real dead time please go see Cach by Michael Haneke. seriously you probably don't want to watch this movieAnyway I am not about to relate all the events that happen in Ghost Dog. It's been already done by so many people. And yes the concept of the assassin following the Samurai's code in the midst of the Mafia world is just a wonderful idea. And this movie certainly contains a lot of great concepts. Such is the one where Ghost dog's friend the icecream guy speaks only French. This is really fun to watch as they both figure out what the other one was saying despite the language barrier. True friendship goes beyond that barrier!But there are a few other observations I would like to make. It seemed strange to me that the Mafia gangsters were always watching cartoons. Sure they are other clues to get us to see how incompetent and uncultured they are. For instance they can't pay all their dues they haven't paid the rent in 3 months they sit in the back room just playing cards etc. But the cartoons? I think that this could have been avoided. Also the scene of the killing through the sink was a bit too far fetched for me. On another hand there is this mysterious dog. What did he symbolize? Was that the animal spirit who tried to remind him of his duties? I loved also the handing over of the Samurai's code book to the young girl. Truly a key moment for us to realize that he's done. His mission is over and he will follow the code of the samurai all the way. What else? Ah yes excellent acting from Forrest Whitaker but this is probably not really surprising to anyone who knows him.I highly recommend this movie!".

I knew it had to be one extreme or the other which does count in it's favour as I'll take awful over mediocre any day. It seemed to be made up of really great and really cringe worthy scenes but lots of the greatest films ever are like this Brazil and The Man Who fell to Earth spring to mind. Put Apocalypse Now in the flawed masterpiece category as well while you're at it. Weighing up the good and the bad in ghost Dog produces a different result though. Bad points include Jarmusch's insistence on studding the film with such toe curling moments as when the main protagonist is greeted respectfully by the gang of Bloods and you just have to wait for the other shoe to drop for him to be greeted equally by yes you guessed it the Krips. You pray it won't happen because it would just be too corny and excuses involving irony won't help but no there it isthe money shot ....S'up GDawg. Another shocker the we's gonna shoot uz a big BLACK Beyah Ezeikiel scene. Jesus what did they put that in for ? It bears no coherent or cohesive relevance to the film in any way and is another waiting for the other shoe to drop moments. You're Jim Jarmusch for God's sake. Don't be predictable. That scene really annoyed me though because it follows a lecture about the ways of Bushido about how the samurai serves with honour and cannot be distracted by a personal emotion and b superfluous tasks such as shooting cartoon hillbillies The other really bad point was the films signposting of its cultural references and assuming that the audience know nothing. ....Yes there's a girl on a sofa reading Rashomon we all know what it is we've all seen the Kurosawa some of us have read it some of us have read in the shady grove etc. But they can't leave it at that. I really expected and wanted to like this film. It stars the mighty Forrest Whittaker a true great. It's by Jim Jarmusch another titan and that alone made me enter the film with a feeling of goodwill that it was impossible to lose entirely however bad it might be. The other point was the bird landing on the gun sight and the plughole sink assassination. OH how I loved them how I hugged myself with smug glee knowing that they were a homage to Koroshi No Rakuin I even looked around wondering who else recognised it and trying to spot those who didn't..... hoho the saps. I later realised though that all the film was doing was massaging filmnerdy egos giving us a cheap thrill of semiobscure film recognition and I think I hate the film more for doing that. There was nothing original in the whole ghost dog film it was just a hotch potch of direct lifts from other filmsliterally stylistically and thematically.Lifting good scenes from a good film and splicing them whole sale into a mediocre one is not really homage nor does it make a bad film good. It just gives nerds something to get excited about and possibly makes you think Shouldn't I just watch Koroshi No Rakuin instead ? Like Mick Jagger so nobly said what's the point of listening to us playing 'I'm a King Bee' when you can listen to Slim Harpo doing it ? Exactly. Why watch pseudy references to other films when you could be watching something with its own ideas. I give this film 1 star not because it doesn't deserve more but just to lower it's overall average".

Now I wish I had my 2 hours back or was it 3?. The movie starts off slowly and never really picks up. It felt as if an entire half of the film consisted of scenes where the main character was driving his car to rap music in the background or of scenes where mobsters watched classic cartoons. There are but 1 or 2 characters that you might actually care about and they don't include Ghost Dog who pretty much always has the same expression throughout the movie. There are some funny moments thrown here and there but they are far too sparse. There isn't any character development or plot for that matter.Before you dismiss this review as coming from someone who seems to have a short attention span I'd like to say I'm an avid film watcher and a huge advocate of independent andor artistic films including 12 Angry Men and The Man From Earth both of which are films that take place almost entirely in one room and consist of mainly dialogue. This film on the other hand kept the word boring running through my mind. Ghost Dog is not a thriller because the bad guys are so inept and unrealistic that any sense of danger disappears nor is it a drama because the characters are mostly stereotypes and show no development nor is it action because of its focus characters sleeping driving watching TV etc etc. If I had to make up a genre for the film it would be hip hop comedy spy movie that isn't that funny with cultural references. Even from a technical standpoint the director doesn't do any interesting as far as camera shots and cinematography goes. Perhaps if this film was 1.5 hours shorter I would have liked it.If you read a few dozen Japanese haiku poems instead of watching this movie you won't miss out on anything.".

I disliked this movie.  To be more  specific I disliked the concept of this movie.  The cinematography was good.  The mood was nice.  And the acting was satisfactory. However the story is fatuous unacurate and misleading.  It is also offensive.I am a quarter Cree Indian and for some reason I feel insulted on a personal level by the nature of Whitaker's character.     First of all he's a black guy.  And this isn't a racist remark I swear.  The thought of a White Hispanic or even Native American swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents.  The katana represents the soul of a Samurai imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the Samurai.  For Ghost Dog to use his guns instead of the Katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside and where the heck did he get a Katana anyway?  It must be one of those replicas which insults the Samurai caste even more.Also Ghost Dog showed no honor.  Near the end of the movie he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain.  Not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy it's more like a ninjas way silent assassins a group that samurais deny exists but hates nonetheless.Then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out his boss is a baddie.  You know what a true Samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable?  He kills himself to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master.Everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all Samurai adhere to Bushido.So we have great cinematography good ambiance and soso acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it  making it an unsatisfactory overall film and an insult to everything a honorable bushisamurai holds dear. 2.510  Bleah".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in the late eighties and early nineties Jim Jarmusch had established himself as the coolest cat in film directing. Films like Down by the Law and Night on Earth had made him a favourite long before the likes of Quentin Tarantino came on the scene and Jarmusch was most definitely at the height of American cinema. These days Jarmusch isn't quite as well liked as he once was but this hasn't stopped him directing good movies. Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai is much more down to earth than most of Jarmusch's earlier films but it still has that coolness in it's essence and although it isn't vintage Jarmusch it's still a very good movie. The film isn't quite like anything I've ever seen before and that isn't something I see much of these days! as it's plotting is so relaxed that it's pretty much at walking pace throughout and it's relaxed atmosphere isn't something that has been seen too many times in cinema especially not modern cinema. All in all what it lacks in coolness Ghost Dog makes up for in originality.This movie is very much what film fans would class as an indie. It's just too absurd and daring to possibly have studio backing and that is credit to it's director as this film helps to prove that indie films are often far more likable and inventive than their big budget counterparts. The director has made best use of the casting and Forest Whitaker despite not being an actor with an impressive list of lead roles to his credit pulls out an excellent performance that brilliantly fits the tone of the movie. This is the sort of casting that shows you don't need a well respected and highly paid actor in your movie for it to work just one that fits the role. Jarmusch has written lots of great and absurdly funny scenes for the movie the best of which is the one in which Ghost Dog's employer explains the arrangement to a baffled group of colleagues  it's comedy genius! The film at times gets a little bit too arty for it's own good and that may make some viewers roll their eyes. It's also perhaps just a little too relaxed. Still it's not bad.".

The director has made best use of the casting and Forest Whitaker despite not being an actor with an impressive list of lead roles to his credit pulls out an excellent performance that brilliantly fits the tone of the movie. This is the sort of casting that shows you don't need a well respected and highly paid actor in your movie for it to work just one that fits the role. Jarmusch has written lots of great and absurdly funny scenes for the movie the best of which is the one in which Ghost Dog's employer explains the arrangement to a baffled group of colleagues  it's comedy genius! The film at times gets a little bit too arty for it's own good and that may make some viewers roll their eyes. It's also perhaps just a little too relaxed. Still it's not bad.";

Surrilistic movie about ancient ethics in the modern world with Forest Whitaker as the Man as hard and tough as Samurai Steel the mystical Ghost Dog. John Tormey is Louie his savior and master Louie who in the end has to shoot it out like in an old western movie with Ghost Dog to make amends for both theirs mistakes and wrong doings in life. A bit deep in some places but still interesting movie with Ghost Dog using his brains brawn's and belief in the Code of the Samurai to do in the entire Vergo Mob.

However Ulli Lommel and Michael Ballhaus both agree that this is Fassbinder's 5th movie.  That would mean this amazingly photographed sweeping epicwhich boasts by far the best production designs of any of Fassbinder's first moviesfollowed the crude looking excruciating black comedy Why Does Herr R.

Judging by the fact that Lommel and Ballhaus make a few factual mistakes this was not the first Fassbinder movie with Gnther Kaufmann Gods of the Plague was maybe they're a bit off.  My guess is probably number 8 or 9. If it is number 5 that's amazing.Anyhow this is easily the most polished of Fassbinder's first movies. It's also probably up there with The American Soldier in terms of perverse bizarreness.  You'll find lots of flaggelating KKK incestual undertones homoerotism prostitutes bleached eyebrows and eyelashes bad hair greenishwhite cakey makeup and some severe mental retardation all in these frames.  The odd thing is none of it seems to be played for laughs which only adds to the perversity.  Fassbinder thought this movie was so personal to him that he didn't want anyone else to see it or any movie theaters to show it.Also of note the ending of this movie is highly unusual for Fassbinder. No suicide no crying no corpses?  I guess for the final shot Fassbinder had his convertable engine running so he could drive off forever into the distance the second it was completed.  It just seems directors don't have that type of dedication or personal anguish attached to their movies anymore.  All the more reason to keep watching Fassbinder's I guess.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seemingly a triumphant parable about a slave's emancipation from a cruel inbred patriarchy Fassbinder's outr Spanish Western employs a unique hybrid of incisive scabrous character examination eerie stretches of silence and a deadpan editing scheme that makes empathy desirable but never attainable. The eponymous character is the son of despotic aristocrat Ben Nicholson whose children look and behave like grotesque zombies their faces are caked with a putrid green sheen of powder whose wife is a sexually manipulative hussy and whose onetime mistress and Whity's mother is the other servant in the house a proud anthemsinging woman whose charcoaldarkened face renders her an indistinguishable void.This artificial hue also serves as a contrast to Whity Gnter Kaufmann who is caught between fealty to the father and his tradition of old money and his mother's tradition of slavery. In the film's first scene Whity tells his mother that black music isn't welcome in the house she responds by spitting in his face and derisively labeling him Whity. Such an extreme example of stratification illustrates Whity's dual identity and his confusion about how he'd like to be perceived. The mother's rebuke is especially cruel when one considers her role in his figurative schizophrenia copulating with her white master and the selfsame compromise of racial identity inherent in his conception.There are further signs of ambiguity he dresses to the specifications of his masters looking the part of an Uncle Tom in the opening tilt shot which pans slowly up Whity's body from his spitshined shoes to his immaculate red dust jacket he proudly pledges his gratitude after severe beatings and he may be romantically involved with Nicholson's disabled son. Whity's brutal turn in the final sequence in which he methodically executes the entire family is a particularly definitive choice of identity though hardly from an outside perspective one of vindication or clarity given Whity's contrary choices or are they necessities of survival? throughout the film. Like the other two Fassbinder films I've seenThe American Soldier and Rio Das Mortescharacter motivations intentions and actions are anything but clearcut and the director is prone to selfamusing stretches of bizarre revelry. But also similar to those films is a sense of spontaneity and social conscience along with an analytical rigor that reminds me of a lesspolished and less selfregarding Godard. If his later films are equally resistant to the cinema of spectacle of which the closest he's come is the extraordinary ending to The American Soldier I may yet come to fully appreciate this most enigmatic auteur.".

Whity's brutal turn in the final sequence in which he methodically executes the entire family is a particularly definitive choice of identity though hardly from an outside perspective one of vindication or clarity given Whity's contrary choices or are they necessities of survival? throughout the film. Like the other two Fassbinder films I've seenThe American Soldier and Rio Das Mortescharacter motivations intentions and actions are anything but clearcut and the director is prone to selfamusing stretches of bizarre revelry. But also similar to those films is a sense of spontaneity and social conscience along with an analytical rigor that reminds me of a lesspolished and less selfregarding Godard. If his later films are equally resistant to the cinema of spectacle of which the closest he's come is the extraordinary ending to The American Soldier I may yet come to fully appreciate this most enigmatic auteur.";

	schema:headline " Rarely screened but must be seen by all lovers of the German New Wave Fassbinder in particular and high camp.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rarely screened forgotten by even the most devoted admirers of Fassbinder Whity is nonetheless a crucial film in Fassbinder's own development as a filmartist.  For one the style of the film marks Fassbinder's turn away from his earlier Neorealistic efforts notably Katzelmacher and Why Does Herr R. Run Amok? and turn towards the flamboyant  melodramatic form favored by him until his untimely death in 1982.  Melodrama turns out to be the best possible style for the film's story which chronicles the fall of the seigniorial Nicholson family in the Mexican 19th century.  Indeed this film should be seen for no other reason than the inescapable weirdness one feels in watching German actors play Mexicans in the Old West.  It's like seeing Peter Lorre playing John Wayne  ridiculous if only it weren't so creepy.  Decadent and dysfunctional are words redefined by the Nicholson family  the patriarch Ben Nicholson is remote and cruel the wife a nymphomaniac the older son a flaming homosexual and his brother a severely retarded adolescent.  Then there's Whity the ironically named mulatto slave of the Nicholson family an inadvertent focus point of each family member's perverse obsessions. It is this mutual obsession with Whity an obsession shared by the viewer by film's end which allows Fassbinder to explore the themes which were to comprise his greatest contribution to film's development as a medium including  dominance and submission the role of the Other sexuality the doppelganger the economy of familial relationships and the obstacles fate puts in the way of consumating love.  These issues gain complexity when one considers that the slave Whity is played by Fassbinder's thenlover Gunther Kaufmann.  Given this what is the viewer to make of such  stylistic scenes as when Whity is disciplined by his master while the other family members garrulously look onknowing that Fassbinder himself is also watching from his directordictator's chair?  The complex interrelationships of Fassbinder and the actors during the filming of Whity were later chronicled by Fassbinder in his film  Beware of a Holy Whore which is based on the reallife melodrama that occurred off the set of Whity.  If nothing else Whity deserves to be included in with the other Fassbinder films such as Despair which are so justly celebrated for their psychological depth and complexity. Beyond this two aspects of Fassbinder's technique in making Whity deserve special mention.  The first is that in Whity one of the first of his films to employ a halfway reputable color process Fassbinder shows himself to be a great colorist in the tradition of Delacroix bathing the eyes with the lushest oranges browns and reds to be seen this side of a sunset.  The palette is one that seems to have existed in film only in the late 60s and early 70s finding similarly gorgeous expression in Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451 Boorman's Point Blank Godard's La Chinoise and Nicolas Roeg's early efforts A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to The Forum  Performance Walkabout Don't Look Now  The Man Who Fell to Earth. The second aspect of noteworthy technique is a camera movement that truly has no precedent in film historya fact which makes the obscurity of Whity among film scholars all the more remarkable.  The best example of the technique occurs in a scene in which Ben Nicholson reads his last will and testament to the silent family members surrounding him.  During an unbroken tenminute take the actors remain virtually motionless as if posed in some Rembrantian tableaux and in this way recalling Dreyer's Day of Wrath.  Against this stasis the camera pans slowly from one family member to another following their own sightlines as if the camera were recording the trace of their attention.  For ten minutes the camera repeats this zigzag path with methodical precision while psychedelic tranceinducing music drones in the background. The greatest merit of the technique seen also in an equally static scene between Whity and the retarded son in the horse barn is that it allows the viewer time enough to meditate on the relationships among the characters involved in the tableauxin this case most profoundly on the relationships of power among family members.  It's as if Fassbinder using film technique took a snapshot of the family and then spent ten minutes tracing out with his finger exactly who is dominated by whom who resents the domination who is perceiving whom and how and so on.  The technique which to my knowledge Fassbinder never used again to such great effect can only be seen as the great innovation that it is and as such a powerful tool for the revelation of psychological truth. However let none of these deeper concerns eclipse the enjoyment to be had watching this bizarre Teutonic Dallas unfold.  Like the best moments in a Warhol film the high camp of Whity is very very funny to watchcertainly because it is absurd which is not to say it is without profound meaning.".

	schema:headline " Fassbinder conveying his typical themes in a stylistically Leonesque film";
	schema:reviewBody " For people who haven't seen the film I recommend skipping the first part of the comment to start reading right at  The Style   What's noteworthy is how much more this relatively early Fassbinder has in common with his later films such as the BRD trilogy than with anything he did before. For example the fact that the main character is trying to integrate into a familysociety against all odds with fatal consequences. Not only do those familiessocieties reject the main characters of the RWF films in question but those systems turn out to be miserable and integration into them turn out to be undesirable. The propagated Weltanschauung is downright pessimistic with no realistic hope anywhere in sight.So the movie's title character Whity is trying to integrate even to the point of lacking much of a personality. He doesn't care if he is black or white or even straight or gay he just wants to be a part of something that is bigger that himself.The Themes  Interestingly the film doesn't seem to be much concerned with racial issues. I don't see Whity to be representative of the black man in America but rather it uses a black man in the West as an example of slavery and a man who tries to integrate into a system that doesn't want him for superimposed reasons all the while he is more competent than most other people around him.The white members of the Nicholson family all have makeup that makes them look sickly pale which could be to empathize those people's degeneration compared to Whity. They are free he is not they have power he hasn't purely because of superficial reasons and not because they are actually stronger.What's also important is the capitalism versus love theme. In the family everyone is ridden by greed money is their biggest concern and this reflects their decadence. Whity doesn't have much desires at all he is the best example of happiness in slavery. He doesn't know a better life so he is satisfied with his position. That was until he found love. It's partly through this love that he realizes the degenerated state of his family the Nicholsons and it's love that is enough of a substitute that it makes him want to radically leave behind his family in the end.But the movie doesn't give a solution for Whity's tragic situation in the end he leaves the system that he fought to be a part of all along just to go into the vastness of the desert a nonsystem if you will a place where money and power doesn't matter just to die suggesting that there in fact is no solution other than death. This is why I find the film to be extremely pessimistic. Whity has found love but not only is it not considered a solution but it implies that there is none by Whity consciously deciding to end his life basically.The Style  As for the style obviously the film is much more inspired by Spaghetti Westerns than by American ones which starts with the opening credits with the names flying towards the audience and continues with the intentionally slowpaced nature of the film its melancholic atmosphere and the exaggerated ambient sound. In fact it's directly reminiscent of Leone but the big difference is the small scale of RWF's film. I found the slow pace more tedious than anything else. It's too much of an imitation and not enough its own thing.As good as Ballhaus' camera work is on its own the concept of frozen subjects captured in fluid images doesn't work well if there is little appropriate content to back it up not to mention that this is pretty much the opposite of Leone's cinematography which is mostly rigid camera where even the smallest protagonist movement looks epic. If Leone's camera moves it is to follow the protagonist not to pan to another protagonist. He fearlessly employed a cut to show another character which made every character the star of his own shot.The Resume  Although the film certainly isn't devoid of appealing themes the way it is I can't say that it tells an interesting story. Apart from Whity all the characters are just too empty they are just pawns in Whity's story which wouldn't be as bad if there weren't so many scenes in which he isn't much more than a spectator or isn't even present.As implied before the content simply doesn't lend itself to a Leonesque Western. A Leone Western lends itself to strangers being unpredictable dangerladen atmosphere and situations and gunslinging it doesn't lend itself to internal family affairs everyday life and character studies. I would consider 'Whity' a failed experiment Fassbinder's storytelling sensibilities combined with an imitation of Leone's style is a system into which integration is undesirable.".

	schema:headline " WHITY Rainer Werner Fassbinder 1971 ";
	schema:reviewBody "When is a Western not really a Western? When its directed by Fassbinder! WHITY is only my sixth film from the socalled German wunderkind I admire Fassbinder for his prolific and versatile output though Ive yet to be won over completely by a film of his frankly I was hoping this would prove to be the one  but as it turned out I couldnt have been more wrong! For the record Ive got four more titles from him to watch still considering my dismal experience with WHITY especially since I had fully expected it to be the most accessible of the lot! I dont know when Ill muster the courage to get to them noweven if DESPAIR 1978 is a reasonably enticing title given the participation of Dirk Bogarde and the Vladimir Nabokov source.To be fair the Western ambiance is delivered in spades throughout. The film was stunningly shot in Widescreen  by Michael Ballhaus later a valued collaborator of Martin Scorsese  in Almeria location site of many a Spaghetti Western. It generally has the right feel for time and place with regards to settings and wardrobe while the allimportant score is highlighted by a decidedly infectious riff.

	onyx:emotionText "When is a Western not really a Western? When its directed by Fassbinder! WHITY is only my sixth film from the socalled German wunderkind I admire Fassbinder for his prolific and versatile output though Ive yet to be won over completely by a film of his frankly I was hoping this would prove to be the one  but as it turned out I couldnt have been more wrong! For the record Ive got four more titles from him to watch still considering my dismal experience with WHITY especially since I had fully expected it to be the most accessible of the lot! I dont know when Ill muster the courage to get to them noweven if DESPAIR 1978 is a reasonably enticing title given the participation of Dirk Bogarde and the Vladimir Nabokov source.To be fair the Western ambiance is delivered in spades throughout. The film was stunningly shot in Widescreen  by Michael Ballhaus later a valued collaborator of Martin Scorsese  in Almeria location site of many a Spaghetti Western. It generally has the right feel for time and place with regards to settings and wardrobe while the allimportant score is highlighted by a decidedly infectious riff.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1970 the German film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder wrote and directed a German language American Western film that unlike the Spaghetti Westerns of that era also filmed in Almera Andaluca Spain was not played straight but more like a silent era Expressionistic film replete with melodramatic music cartoonish face makeup and over the top acting especially in the physical movements of the actors' bodies. It's one of those films that is so highly stylized so earnestly trying to be deep andor profound that it is instead really really bad but in the best possible sense of the word bad. It's so bad a film that it is often hysterically funny. This starts from the very notion of Old American West gunslingers sprechen in Deutsch as well as having them speak German even though all of the signs and Wanted Posters are in English. It's absurd but wonderfully so.To say that it is absurd or bizarre is however an understatement yet the film is obviously a satire unlike say Werner Herzog's Even Dwarfs Started Small or Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. In a sense this film also reminded me in terms of lighting and stillnesses of Kubrick's 1975 costume epic Barry Lyndon crossed with some of the manifestly fake Western sets in American television shows of that era especially those that were not Western based shows but those that had Western themed special episodes like Star Trek or The Prisoner. Then added to that there is mental retardation transvestism homosexuality prostitution racism Ku Klux Klan hoods wholly displaced in the Old West something a German likely did not know thinking it merely the American equivalent of the swastika incest bestiality bleached eyebrows greenwhite cake makeup and sadomasochism. Yet what makes this film so uproariously funny is that Fassbinder's camera and style seem to be oblivious to how truly and uniquely bad and funny the film is. One might even believe that he was a German version of Ed Wood if this film is any indication of his talents for true camp comes unwittingly when an artist is being serious and is oblivious to the worst aspects of his work.Whity was filmed in garish color in Cinemascope where the palette leaps out at you and this is in keeping with the rest of the over the top nature of the film and suggest Fassbinder must have known he was making a Carnivalesque romp if not an outright burlesque. This gaudiness includes the art direction of Kurt Raab which also won a German Academy Award. While a bit too much there is no denying that the color palette used by Fassbinder sears into the viewer's head on an emotional level and the film seems almost like an Impressionist painting especially a Monet watercolor come to life with its rich reds ripe oranges sensuous yellows burnt browns and other lesser colors that texture the film like some narcotic fantasy. Also Ballhaus provides some interesting camera movement that makes the ill written and acted scenes at least interesting to watch if nothing else and since film is a visual medium this is worth noting even if there's no intellectual reason behind it. For example in the scene where Ben Nicholson reads his last will and testament the rest of the actors are standing still as if composed out of something from one of Ingmar Bergman's hypercomposed 1960s filmic experiments. The camera slowly sweeps over all of them for minutes at a time while weird music by Peer Raben who scored the film and remanent of the just passed psychedelic era drones on. Some critics contend that this is meant to allow the viewer to ponder the psychological bonds between all the family members but really it's a funeral dirge for any remaining health the clan might have had and the filmmaker taking stock of the coming body count.Thankfully Whity does not push its tenuous humorous likability by being too long. It's only 95 minutes and its manifest flaws lead one to believe that part of the problem was that Fassbinder probably did not spend enough time crafting the film which was shot in only thirty days. Before he overdosed in 1982 at the age of thirtyseven he would make fortythree films direct fourteen plays write four radio plays and direct twentyfour television projects. It is interesting to note these flaws and compare them to the flaws that followed him across the films of his career. As for Whity it's simply a bad bad film but more in line with Robot Monster or Plan 9 From Outer Space good bad than with The Hours or Brokeback Mountain or Crash bad bad. As for whether Fassbinder realized he'd made a camp classic a film that is funny enough to give Blazing Saddles a run for its money? I don't know. Nor do I care just as I so not care how one labels this film satire camp classic NeoExpressionist masterpiece black comedy melodrama for funny is funny and the hour and a half of laughs I got from this dreadful little film was worth something. Perhaps even what little I paid for it.".

He's also sitting for a portrait painted by his friend Basil Hallward when it's done Dorian complains he will grow old while the painting stays unchanged. On the same night he slaps Sybil and sends her away then accepts the seductive offer of a party's hostess to sleep with her. The next day the painting looks slightly older as he becomes corrupt and amoral capable of destroying many lives inclusive Sybil's. In horror and fascination Dorian hides away the portrait and continues a life of degradation. Over time as the portrait becomes hideous he's unchanged by debauched life finally he and Basil face the painting.";

Best known as the protege of Luchino Visconti the beauteous Berger here proves himself as an actor in his own right. In or out of his deliciously camp Carnaby Street wardrobe Berger glows with goldenlimbed hedonism and seductive evil! Backing him up is a splendid supporting cast. Herbert Lom as the sinister gay aesthete Lord Henry Wotton whose barbed witticisms are lifted directly from Wilde. Margaret Lee and Eleonora Rossi Drago as two Sapphic jetsetters. Isa Miranda as a raunchy and vulgar American millionairess. Her outfits would make Fellini blush for shame! Not too sure about Europorn starlet Marie Liljedahl  and Richard Todd is a bore as the painter Basil Hallward. But even when the acting falters the outrageously kitsch costumes and settings make this film a visual delight! Will I ever recover from that first sight of Dorian's zebralined 60s shag pad? Somehow I doubt it. This whole film is sleazy trashy vulgar overthetop...a shameless piece of camp on every level. Poor old Oscar Wilde would have adored every minute of it! And so do I!".

	schema:headline " Berger makes the perfect Dorian Gray";
	schema:reviewBody "Probably the best screen version of Oscar Wilde's novel mostly due to the casting of Helmet Berger as Dorian. Berger is a fascinating actor physically beautiful but with a classic European aristocratic sense of petulance superiority and catlike selfishness the film's first sequence ends with Dorian stroking a black cat.The film is updated to the fagend of the swinging sixties in the city at the heart of the era London when and where it was becoming apparent to everyone that clubbing screwing around and dressing in the latest designer fashions did not a satisfying life make. Dorian is the employment free scion of some wealthy family trading on his looks and the land left to him in his parent's will. He falls in with some fashionable upper class bohemians  Richard Todd's painter Basil Hallwood and Herbert Lom's homosexual wit Henry Wotton. At the same time he picks up a pretty actress playing Juliet at some crummy fringe theatre Sybil Vane. The film's version of the Sybil and Dorian affair gives her a little more mouth pluck and vibrancy than the novel or most adaptations and she is as to blame as he when the relationship goes belly up with her jealousy and nagging  even her death seems more an unhappy accident than the wilful victimized suicide of Wilde's book.Once Sybil has died and shortly after Dorian has made the usual wish to sell his soul in front of Basil's picture the film turns into an episodic trawl through the sexual conquests of the antihero who with Berger's looks and body understandably is able to seduce anyone. Old women pay for it wives stray from their husbands and kinky scene hangerson take a beating from his belt but Dorian soon gets a taste for the boys as well as the girls not entirely understandable given that his first taste of gay sex is with Lom in the shower! But he's cruising the yachts along the marina on the Riviera and picking up black men from the cabin crews.The film is racy for its time and probably outside of porn takes the most raunchy version of the book to have hit the screen nevertheless the sex is pretty nonexplicit and Berger can be seen rather too obviously hiding his genitals in the scenes where he is nude. Yet each of the sexual episodes plants the seed of a fantasy scenario in the audiences mind and they are left to guess quite what Dorian is doing behind his old mare of a sponsor when he stands behind her causing her to gasp at a stable door what exactly Dorian and that black man are doing to get up to when they leave the public toilet they are admiring each other at the urinals in and quite what is that black magic ceremony Dorian attends at the house of pleasure. The film's opening sequence is shot from Dorian's point of view as he staggers out of the room in which he has killed Basil it's a flashforwards and at one point he gazes at himself in the mirror the film encourages its audience to catch themselves gazing at Berger and to fill in the things which its moving pictures of Dorian Gray leave out.Near the end Dorian who has increasingly been dressed in costumes which teeter between sexy and ludicrous stalks down somewhere like the King's Road in an absurd Zebrastriped costume turning everyone's head but utterly hollow in himself. So the film suggests ends the decade of free love fashion and frolics  an attractive but hollow shell doomed to suicide or age both of which come together in the film's closetothebook final scene.Massimo Dallamano shoots the film like a cross between a travelogue and a giallo which feels appropriate and Peppino De Luca exquisitely scores it to match. There's a Raro Video DVD release which has a lovely to look at transfer and includes English and Italian language tracks sadly the sound is rather mashed and fuzzy but the film is well worth seeing as a visual feast for the eye in which one can't help but fall under the spell of Berger as Dorian.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story is familiar  Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray wishes his painting would grow old whilst he remain young. This film version certainly does not equal the production quality of Albert Lewin's The Picture of Dorian Gray 1945 but it is superior in several other ways.Foremost the casting of Helmut Berger as Dorian is perfect. Mr. Berger has the beautifulhandsome balance necessary to essay the role he matches his looks with a fine performance taking Dorian from youth to decadence. Richard Todd as Basil and Herbert Lom as Henry support Berger well. Dorian's decadent slide is more appropriately depicted in this modernized version however the sexual situations run on way too long  for a time the screen is filled with one sexual romp after another and the film loses focus. The sexual situations must have been very risqu at the time but Dorian Gray is not Xrated. The film may remain titillating because there are numerous sexual escapades and Mr. Berger and the women are very attractive.The final confrontation between Dorian and Basil is used to effectively begin this version with a flashback it might have helped to begin the 1945 version in this manner. The passage of time could have been better depicted during the early part the 1940s1950s of this 1970 version but the 1960s look terrific. The aging of Dorian's portrait is much more realistic in this version and it somehow seems much truer to the spirit of Oscar Wilde's original work.  Dorian Gray 42470 Massimo Dallamano  Helmut Berger Herbert Lom Richard Todd Marie Liljedahl".

	schema:reviewBody "Once you see DORIAN GRAY you can't forget it. It's an updated version of the famous story updated for the swinging 60s70s which today is now outdated which only adds to its many memorable aspects.There's no point of giving a brief synopsis of the story as we all know it's about a man who remains perpetually young while a painting of himself ages in the attic. But what's really new or different here is the tone. It's trashy or should I say Eurotrashy. Helmut Berger plays Dorian Gray as a bisexual jetsetter who likes to mingle with beautiful young women but also with men on the side. The moral of the story is that Dorian has no morals and Helmut is perfectly cast as Dorian.The one big problem with this version is that it was made a bit too early in the 70s. Had this been made in the mid to late 70s there would have been a bit more sex or violence. It was sorta ahead of its times with the lurid update of the Dorian Gray story but it could have used a bit more explicitness to make it more true to its intentions. As it is it hints at things it almost never shows and it's just a big tease of sorts. With a bit more sex it could have enjoyed a wider success like the Emmanuelle films.But the main reason to watch DORIAN GRAY is for Helmut. It's one of his few starring roles and he shines here as the decadent title character.Trashy fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "This updating of Oscar Wilde's Victorianage novel The Picture of Dorian Gray to the 1970s and translating of the Englishlanguage text to Italian is surprisingly faithfulmore so in some ways than the classic 1945 MGM version among others. I generally don't find faithfulness important for an adaptation but in this case it's usually for the best. And the ways in which it does diverge from Wilde are interesting including all of the 1970s style. I also believe that this is the first screen version to be explicit about homosexuality which of course even the book wasn't although granted chronologically this is only the third Dorian Gray film I've found available after the 1945 one and a 1915 silent tworeeler.Some of the film techniques employed leave much to be desired including the abruptness of the opening prolepsis and its pointofview shots of bloody hands. Some of the sex scenes are too long as well although they're not very explicit because the bodies are generally obscured by foreground objects. Consequently some consider this trashy or a sexploitation film but I don't necessarily agree. At least it could've been a lot more risqu considering its source. Anyways it's not the gorgeous piece of art that the MGM film remains. It does however have plenty of 1970s fashion and style and a groovy soundtrack. It also benefits from the mostappropriatelooking as far being blonde blueeyed young and handsome and probably bestlooking Dorian to ever appear on screen Helmut Berger. The removal of many of Wilde's epigrams however leaves an unusually dull Henry.Unlike other versions including the 1945 and 2009 ones this film doesn't do away almost entirely with the details of Sybil Vance's Shakespearean acting. It keeps the reason that Dorian rejects her because of her poor performance even though she still has sex with him as in the other movies and as just about everyone else in this film does. It bothers me that other adaptations miss the selfreflexive implications and theme of artistic illusion of this plot point. Another thing I like here is that it doesn't add a second grand romance who is either related to Basil or Henry for Dorian. It's entirely unnecessary. The Gladys here is an actual character from the book who partly fits that bill instead as well as the host of other characters from Wilde who Dorian shags here. One of these liaisons explains his wealth as 1970s Dorian apparently must work unlike his 19thcentury counterpart. Another is the source of his blackmail of Alan Campbell which is unexplained in the novel. The Alan storyline also involves photography which is better employed here than it was in the 2009 Dorian Gray.Most sensationally however is the scene where Dorian drops the soap in the shower and Henry picks it up and there are a few more homosexual hookups besides that. Oddly the two characters I thought were most coded as gay when reading the novel are straight here Basil who gushes over his feelings for Dorian's looks in the book and fears that his portrait will expose those feelings is merely a painter for hire here and the usual theory of Alan's blackmail in the book is that Dorian threatened to expose his homosexualitya crime back then for which the author Wilde would later be sentenced. Dorian Henry and Gwendolyn on other hand all take part in this iteration. I'm also rather surprised by the lack of drugs for a 1970s lowbudget supposed exploitation film. Even Wilde had Dorian visit an opium den. Regardless this remains the most daring Dorian Gray screen adaptation to that date which benefited by its updating to the sexual revolution.".

Some of the sex scenes are too long as well although they're not very explicit because the bodies are generally obscured by foreground objects. Consequently some consider this trashy or a sexploitation film but I don't necessarily agree. At least it could've been a lot more risqu considering its source. Anyways it's not the gorgeous piece of art that the MGM film remains. It does however have plenty of 1970s fashion and style and a groovy soundtrack. It also benefits from the mostappropriatelooking as far being blonde blueeyed young and handsome and probably bestlooking Dorian to ever appear on screen Helmut Berger. The removal of many of Wilde's epigrams however leaves an unusually dull Henry.Unlike other versions including the 1945 and 2009 ones this film doesn't do away almost entirely with the details of Sybil Vance's Shakespearean acting. It keeps the reason that Dorian rejects her because of her poor performance even though she still has sex with him as in the other movies and as just about everyone else in this film does. It bothers me that other adaptations miss the selfreflexive implications and theme of artistic illusion of this plot point. Another thing I like here is that it doesn't add a second grand romance who is either related to Basil or Henry for Dorian. It's entirely unnecessary. The Gladys here is an actual character from the book who partly fits that bill instead as well as the host of other characters from Wilde who Dorian shags here. One of these liaisons explains his wealth as 1970s Dorian apparently must work unlike his 19thcentury counterpart. Another is the source of his blackmail of Alan Campbell which is unexplained in the novel. The Alan storyline also involves photography which is better employed here than it was in the 2009 Dorian Gray.Most sensationally however is the scene where Dorian drops the soap in the shower and Henry picks it up and there are a few more homosexual hookups besides that. Oddly the two characters I thought were most coded as gay when reading the novel are straight here Basil who gushes over his feelings for Dorian's looks in the book and fears that his portrait will expose those feelings is merely a painter for hire here and the usual theory of Alan's blackmail in the book is that Dorian threatened to expose his homosexualitya crime back then for which the author Wilde would later be sentenced. Dorian Henry and Gwendolyn on other hand all take part in this iteration. I'm also rather surprised by the lack of drugs for a 1970s lowbudget supposed exploitation film. Even Wilde had Dorian visit an opium den. Regardless this remains the most daring Dorian Gray screen adaptation to that date which benefited by its updating to the sexual revolution.";

This one provoked tears many times it's overwhelming on so easy nonpretentious way. Let's back to the subject. The story is very true complex convincing. Acting brilliant. Although the movie is a bit slow it attracts like a magnet so you can not keep an eye out of it. There are maybe some strange coincidences but they do not spoil anything. Sunspense and thriller is present all the time.It raises many questions What would I do if I were him What is the limit of my love to my child... Great psychological dilemma makes you think all the time. It is true European movie with some American influence but only on a good way. If you like at least for a moment to escape from Hollywood crap I recommend this movie 100.".

	onyx:emotionText "I gave mark 1010 to this movie. Maybe the reason is that lately since Sideways actually I haven't seen any movie that would touch me at all. And I watch a lot of movies. This one provoked tears many times it's overwhelming on so easy nonpretentious way. Let's back to the subject. The story is very true complex convincing. Acting brilliant. Although the movie is a bit slow it attracts like a magnet so you can not keep an eye out of it. There are maybe some strange coincidences but they do not spoil anything. Sunspense and thriller is present all the time.It raises many questions What would I do if I were him What is the limit of my love to my child... Great psychological dilemma makes you think all the time. It is true European movie with some American influence but only on a good way. If you like at least for a moment to escape from Hollywood crap I recommend this movie 100.";

It's a tense thriller which addresses many moral questions. In many ways it reminds me of last year's The Lives of Others.

	schema:reviewBody "The woman had never bothered to introduce herself. Late in Klopka MladenNebojsa Glogovac learns from his wife that the unconscious woman whose life he saved by rushing her to the emergency room gave the name JelenaAnica Dobra over the phone. This anonymity comes as a shock to the viewer since the recently widowed mother of a young girl seemingly conveyed an impression of friendliness towards Mladen just like the day they first met outside their children's school. In retrospect though after learning exactly how disparate the two families are classwise in the newly democratized Serbia Jelena's niceness gains an opaqueness an edge. After Nemanja misreads Isidora's instigation of a snowball fight as a friendly overture he offers the girl his gloves to alleviate the coldness in her hands. When she snatches them away Jelena explains the girl's bratty behavior as a symptom of her husband overindulging their child. For good measure once their ride arrives Isidora throws the gloves on the ground then throws a snowball in the boy's face. Nemanja looks hurt and confused he's slackjawed as the snow clings to his face humiliated by the girl's lack of grace. Through all of this Jelena never corrects her daughter's insolent boorishness. Needless to say the husband doesn't drive a Renault. Men like Jelena's husband stopped driving inferior cars after privatization became Serbian law in 2001 setting up a situation of class warfare that Klopka dramatizes with great complexity almost as an afterthought.Due to rising medical costs Mladen finds himself in the absurd position of accepting a contract killing job when a man named KostaMiki Manojilovic responds to the newspaper ad for Nemanja's condition which MarijaNatasa Ninkovic placed over her husband's steady protestations. The target in a Crashlike coincidence turns out to be Jelena's husband. More than a contract killer the father acts as his son's vigilante in which Ivkovich's assassination outside his home bears an unmistakable subtext of working class retribution against the elitist mindset of the nouveau rich that had given Isidora the agency to treat Mladen's son like a nothing without apology. This subtext of vigilantism becomes more readily apparent in later scenes where both husband and wife vent their frustrations against the new Serbia where a picture frame Marija learns is worth more than a child's life. Clearly Klonka implicitly endorses a return to socialism as the film itself is a rally cry against the consumer culture of a democratic government which values things over people. Clearly the parents are suffering from culture shock. The disdainful manner in which IvkovichDejan Cukic approaches Mladen becomes the film's main motif. Although Mladen aims a gun at Ivkovich's chest the proletarian man isn't taken seriouslyjust like the cops who don't believe his confession nor Kosta who asks for a cup of coffee at gunpoint. I'm gonna kick your a are Ivkovich's last words before he's riddled with bullets.The snowball that Isidora had thrown at Nemanja just keeps getting biggerthere's no doubt that the snowball is a metaphor for Serbia's growing pains with the newlyinstalled democratic government. In the film's most intriguing scene what are we to make of Mladen's expression after Jelena tells him That money isn't much for me and it would solve everything for you when she offers to pay for Nemanja's operation. Does he pick up on her condescending tone even though he's still racked with guilt? Does he equate Jelena with the rich clubhopper whose car window he smashes in with a rock? While the snowball is the inevitable cause of Mladen's death the child redeems herself during a pointed scene at the hospital in which the egalitarian ways of socialism makes a brief comeback when the bourgeoisie girl shares her earphone with the proletarian man as they sit sidebyside in the hospital waiting room. That small gesture is the heart of Klopka in a film that quietly endorses anarchy.".

More than a contract killer the father acts as his son's vigilante in which Ivkovich's assassination outside his home bears an unmistakable subtext of working class retribution against the elitist mindset of the nouveau rich that had given Isidora the agency to treat Mladen's son like a nothing without apology. This subtext of vigilantism becomes more readily apparent in later scenes where both husband and wife vent their frustrations against the new Serbia where a picture frame Marija learns is worth more than a child's life. Clearly Klonka implicitly endorses a return to socialism as the film itself is a rally cry against the consumer culture of a democratic government which values things over people. Clearly the parents are suffering from culture shock. The disdainful manner in which IvkovichDejan Cukic approaches Mladen becomes the film's main motif. Although Mladen aims a gun at Ivkovich's chest the proletarian man isn't taken seriouslyjust like the cops who don't believe his confession nor Kosta who asks for a cup of coffee at gunpoint. I'm gonna kick your a are Ivkovich's last words before he's riddled with bullets.The snowball that Isidora had thrown at Nemanja just keeps getting biggerthere's no doubt that the snowball is a metaphor for Serbia's growing pains with the newlyinstalled democratic government. In the film's most intriguing scene what are we to make of Mladen's expression after Jelena tells him That money isn't much for me and it would solve everything for you when she offers to pay for Nemanja's operation. Does he pick up on her condescending tone even though he's still racked with guilt? Does he equate Jelena with the rich clubhopper whose car window he smashes in with a rock? While the snowball is the inevitable cause of Mladen's death the child redeems herself during a pointed scene at the hospital in which the egalitarian ways of socialism makes a brief comeback when the bourgeoisie girl shares her earphone with the proletarian man as they sit sidebyside in the hospital waiting room. That small gesture is the heart of Klopka in a film that quietly endorses anarchy.";

Nearly each shot in the film can be blown up as a still photograph and displayed in an exhibition. He is in control  perhaps excessively so Ultimately the film collapses under its own relentless depression. We are not free to question as to how a professional couple leading modest and frugal lives without any debt burden cannot raise 26000 Euros. Certainly it is not because they splash on fashion.

If you don't know any better you'd come out of cinema thinking that this could happen only in Serbia and society is to blame. The truth is that Serbia's poor is much better off than those of the United States. At least there is a public health system in Serbia that works  mostly It is a pity.

Does the quality of the practical  literal picture  frame by frame  photography matter? Does it affect the overall impression and judgement of whether a film is good or bad? For example if one takes a certain story  a particular script  will the film be better if you put in a good cinematography  and worse if you put in a not so good cinematography. In my humble opinion  it certainly does. After all  lets all say it once more .. IT IS A VISUAL EXPERIENCE.And so goes down the drain Klopka... Each scene is filmed with a camera. I can say that much. About lighting  scene decoration  vibrant  intense colors and such  there are none. They did shoot the film  you can watch it. Its just that throughout the whole thing  you are thinking its your buddy filming with his homecamera. And it doesn't add the realistic vibe. Its just bad lights  bad photography  nothing to do with realism.So thats one. Two  even if this film had great mainstream photography like a Nolan's film or an Alfonso Cuaron's one  the story isn't good itself.Like i mentioned  its Denzel Washington's John Q 2002 that is 5 years earlier ... its the same story  just with a worse photography  and switch the famous actors for unknown Serbian ones. It doesn't offer new insight in the topic. Desperate father has a sick son with a defective heart  goes bad to get the money for the operation.It has some weak improbable points too. This section contains SPOILERS! For example after confessing the murder to the police  they let him go  showing that the mafia guy has the police boss on his side. Well combining this fact and then having the mafia guy being broke and owing money with his house almost in ruins ... i wonder  how the hell does he still have the police on his side? End of SPOILERS!I read good comments over here  and someone did a comparison of this film to the German  The lives of others . So me  having firm respect for the lives of others  was convinced to see this with an open mind but slightly high expectations  because believe it or not  i am into foreign gems  Korean cinema  french  Italian  Belgian whatever...Well i saw this thing and this is the review. Nothing special  i give it a 510 because of the bad photography and strongly because its a story that was made better in a film five years earlier.To be fair  the actors were alright. Nothing great  but nothing bad. It was decent acting.".

Does the quality of the practical  literal picture  frame by frame  photography matter? Does it affect the overall impression and judgement of whether a film is good or bad? For example if one takes a certain story  a particular script  will the film be better if you put in a good cinematography  and worse if you put in a not so good cinematography. In my humble opinion  it certainly does. After all  lets all say it once more .. IT IS A VISUAL EXPERIENCE.And so goes down the drain Klopka... Each scene is filmed with a camera. I can say that much. About lighting  scene decoration  vibrant  intense colors and such  there are none. They did shoot the film  you can watch it. Its just that throughout the whole thing  you are thinking its your buddy filming with his homecamera. And it doesn't add the realistic vibe. Its just bad lights  bad photography  nothing to do with realism.So thats one. Two  even if this film had great mainstream photography like a Nolan's film or an Alfonso Cuaron's one  the story isn't good itself.Like i mentioned  its Denzel Washington's John Q 2002 that is 5 years earlier ... its the same story  just with a worse photography  and switch the famous actors for unknown Serbian ones. It doesn't offer new insight in the topic. Desperate father has a sick son with a defective heart  goes bad to get the money for the operation.It has some weak improbable points too. This section contains SPOILERS! For example after confessing the murder to the police  they let him go  showing that the mafia guy has the police boss on his side. Well combining this fact and then having the mafia guy being broke and owing money with his house almost in ruins ... i wonder  how the hell does he still have the police on his side? End of SPOILERS!I read good comments over here  and someone did a comparison of this film to the German  The lives of others . So me  having firm respect for the lives of others  was convinced to see this with an open mind but slightly high expectations  because believe it or not  i am into foreign gems  Korean cinema  french  Italian  Belgian whatever...Well i saw this thing and this is the review. Nothing special  i give it a 510 because of the bad photography and strongly because its a story that was made better in a film five years earlier.To be fair  the actors were alright. Nothing great  but nothing bad. It was decent acting.";

This is very much the case with the German but almost entirely Englishspoken 'Same same but different' it's the first German film in a long time that makes abundant use of cinematography instead of television aesthetics not counting Tom Tykwer's recent international oeuvre. Upon its premiere in Locarno last year it received an award by Variety for its international potential  well deserved indeed. But apparently it failed to strike a cord in most viewers nevertheless probably because the story sounds more depressing than romantic.Well it isn't really it's very much a love story. One reason why I initially bypassed it was director Detlev Buck's previous record of lightweight comedies of limited entertainment value but here he somewhat returns to his early90s beginnings the films he built his reputation on 'Karniggels' 1990 and 'Wir knnen auch anders' 1993. In these little marvels Buck managed to convey character depth by small gestures which made you forget the budget constraints these productions had. With his success he would later abandon this laconic narrative style in search of big screen liability which was very unfortunate for his early fans. 'Same same but different' reveals Buck as one of the few real professionals German cinema has because he combines this big production with the simplicity of his auteur days.That effort would be in vain if he wouldn't have the cast to support him and that's where this film becomes really interesting to me. Much has been said about the freshness of David Kross who has been fortunate to land a lead in a bigbudget production at very young age 'The Reader' and therefore manages to bring a genuine sense of guilelessness into his acting. But given that he has been portraying so far average characters thrown into extraordinary situations I believe that his roles cannot be taken for a proof of talent as he's just interpreting things in a way most people would. The few moments when 'Same same but different' feels awkward arise when his character Ben is forced into individual actions he's unwilling to take  most of the time he just allows everything to happen and it is this passivity that fits Kross more than anything else.The real star of the film  and the reason why I seriously regret not having watched this in the cinema  is Apinya Sakuljaroensuk. It was essentially her minimalistic performance in Penek Ratanaruang's Ploy which made that film one of my favorites of 2008. There's something absolutely commanding about her from the very first moment she appears on screen something that forces you to gaze at her as intensely as she does a beatific ephemeral shroud of what I would in lack of better terms call beauty from the inside. If the comparison is not too bold I had an equal sense of awe at an actress only when I watched 'Roman Holiday' for the first time. Yes I'm talking about Audrey Hepburn believe it or not. I'm rather curious as to what future may hold for this barely 20yearold who handles the complexities of her part so well  a young woman balancing love and calculation dream and reality in precarious yet purposeful ways.In short a surprisingly deep tale of love against all odds not as depressing as some of you may think and lacking only in a supporting cast to make the story as believable as it actually  being based on a true story  is.".

Most won't recognize the name but will remember Kross' performance as Kate Winslet's young lover in the awardwinning The Reader. An epic sweeping love story spanning two continents Same Same But Different is Romeo and Juliet meets Dr. Zhivago meets Pretty Woman. Kross carries this film from opening to closing credits. Just as he startled the world in The Reader the now 19yearold enters leading man status here. Same Same But Different is a mustsee for lovers of romance and who doesn't made all the more touching because it's based on a true story.

	schema:headline " Not enough potential for a quality movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Same Same But Different is a German movie from 7 years ago directed by the pretty famous Detlev Buck. He is also part of the team that adapted Benjamin Prfer's autobiographical book here. In there Prfer tells his own story how he met a prostitute in Asia and fell in love with her. The two are still together today living in Asia now and more importantly she is also still alive and apparently at good health despite her HIV infection. The main character here is played by David Kross who has worked with Buck on several occasions already. Unfortunately I do not see a great deal of talent in Kross neither in this film nor in pretty much everything else I have seen him in. I guess I may have liked this more with another lead actor. Luckily though I did like lead actress Apinya Sakuljaroensuk who is not only quite a discovery in here but it's also impressive what she went through for starring in this film in terms of learning new language within a short amount of time. Of course she is immensely cute which also helps a lot.Overall I have to say that the story is not really interesting enough to me to justify a movie on these characters. Many people make holidays abroad fall in love and start having a life together despite potential language barriers. If course the distance was extremely long here and the whole prostituteHIV background is also something pretty extraordinary but overall I just couldn't get emotionally invested in this film even if I really tried. It may have to do with Kross though too. If you like him more than I do then you will certainly also enjoy these 100 minutes more than I did. On a more positive note it was fun to see Charly Hbner and Olli Dittrich in smaller roles here as I like these two a lot. But their presence was too minimal to let me recommend this one. Thumbs down.".

Luckily though I did like lead actress Apinya Sakuljaroensuk who is not only quite a discovery in here but it's also impressive what she went through for starring in this film in terms of learning new language within a short amount of time. Of course she is immensely cute which also helps a lot.Overall I have to say that the story is not really interesting enough to me to justify a movie on these characters. Many people make holidays abroad fall in love and start having a life together despite potential language barriers. If course the distance was extremely long here and the whole prostituteHIV background is also something pretty extraordinary but overall I just couldn't get emotionally invested in this film even if I really tried. It may have to do with Kross though too. If you like him more than I do then you will certainly also enjoy these 100 minutes more than I did. On a more positive note it was fun to see Charly Hbner and Olli Dittrich in smaller roles here as I like these two a lot. But their presence was too minimal to let me recommend this one. Thumbs down.";

Made on a budget of only 375000 the film is surprisingly accomplished on a technical level. The effects although they do look fake by today's standards hold up a lot better than you might have expected and the stop motion sequence at the end which looks a lot faker than anything else in the movie was accomplished for its time and budget.The Evil Dead is about a group of young adults who travel to a cabin in the woods and discover a 'book of the dead'. No prizes for guessing what happens next as each character is possessed except for Ash and disposed of via an intriguing variety of methods. Considering its budget unknown director at the time and typical slasher plot The Evil Dead would almost certainly seem headed towards forgotten Bmovie status and yet it has stood the test of time and remains one of the most widely acclaimed horror films of all time. Why? It's simple. Although The Evil Dead is nowhere near as funny as its sequels it's still a humorous selfsatire while also being terrifying despite its age. This odd combination only perfected in this film's sequels and Creepshow works because Raimi crafts a tense and moody environment puts his characters in there and then ruthlessly disposes of them sometimes doing so several times for the same character. What's worse is that there's nowhere to go. Raimi creates a claustrophobic feeling in anyone watching he wants you to think about being in a situation where you're trapped with nothing but death and destruction surrounding you. For most people he probably succeeds. As far as acting goes none of it is really very good but Bruce Campbell is instantly likable as Ash who just has to be one of the most memorable horror film characters of all time.Gory desolate hopeless and still funny The Evil Dead is a horror masterpiece that isn't quite the strongest entry in the series but is shockingly accomplished and entertaining despite its low budget and inexperienced cast and crew.

Possibly nothing but I'll try. Before Spiderman and before the countless spinoffs of this movie were made or even conceived Raimi and friends decided to make a low budget zombie flick mainly for fun and surprisingly it has become a masterpiece of shock and horror. Possibly a perfect example of how to make an entertaining film on a shoestring budget The Evil Dead delivers what it promises the ultimate in grueling horror. Even with it's mild budget and sometimes shaky acting TED shocks and spooks the audience through chilling atmosphere and some of the most violent effects ever put on film. Those who are squeamish need not apply. As a matter of fact just run for your girly life.There are several reasons this film succeeds. First Raimi's camera work is truly masterful. By using fast camera work and aggressive shots Raimi has created an eerie world that is sometimes hard to look at but too entertaining to turn away from. His style from behind the camera is absolutely unmistakable. This is perfectly exemplified in the beginning of the film where the camera alone creates enough atmosphere to leave you biting your nails in suspense of what's to come. You feel at any moment someone is going to get their neck chomped on by some zombie hiding just out of view. One of the most impressive openings I can think of perfection in pacing and atmosphere. It gets even better once the action starts. Some shots hold for a seeming eternity and part of you wishes for it to stop for it's unrestrained gore and violence...but the other part of you is getting a sick kick out of it. One of the most impressive shots is where the darkness from the trees begins to chase people knocking any tree or obstacle down that happens to be in it's way. Truly magnificent technique however they did it. TED also succeeds because it's selfaware of the fact that it's a simple zombie movie and never takes itself too seriously and doesn't expect the audience to do so either. It's meant to be campy cheesy revolting and chilling at the same time. There are moments in the film where it seems to be making fun of itself and the genre in general. For this fact alone one cannot hold certain things against it such as sometimes questionable acting from the supporting cast and sometimes the downright implausibility of certain situations. If you can accept this and you're not put off by mannequin ultraviolence then you should find yourself on the supporter's side of the fence. I think some don't like it because it can be ridiculous and cheesy in parts although it was meant to be. Even with the fact that it's sometimes cheesy there are some downright chilling moments in this film that most horror films nowadays cannot begin to muster. Case in point the zombie screaming from the cellar door. The zombie growls and howls themselves are enough to send shivers up one's spine. And let's not forget the unforgettable tree love scene ridiculous and hilarious simultaneously.Last but certainly not least Bruce Campbell as Ash the badass of all zombie films. Campbell is Ash period and always will be.In my opinion this is by far the best of the trilogy and although there could have been more of the chainsaw this is the definitive zombie film and probably always will be. I feel it succeeds over it's sequels due to it's increased violence and lack of humor in comparison. It's blood gore camera work and shock factor are still formidable even today and are what make this such a cult classic. If you've ever liked any horror film this is an absolute mustsee.Love or hate it there it is.".

	schema:headline " The ultimate in terror";
	schema:reviewBody "It's the early 80's what do you expect?  This is a scary scary film.  And I think I know why films now a days can't hold a candle to films like Halloween and Evil Dead.  And that is because a photo copy is never as good as the original.  That is the bottom line.  Directors don't care about a lot of the material that they are filming today especially when it comes to horror films and that is because they don't write their own stories.  They do someone elses work.  But not Evil Dead.  This was Raimi's baby from the outset.  When films like the two mentioned were filmed they were filmed by two directors that were complete unknowns.  They had no pressure to make a great film and they did it on an incredibly low budget.  Halloween was made for 150000 and Evil Dead for 50 000.  So what that meant is that the directors could stick to their visions but they had to find innovative ways to do so.  Their budgets didn't allow a heap of special effects so they had to rely on what they knew.  And that was how to create atmosphere using the camera.  And Evil Dead is one of the best at doing that.  There is one scene in this film that I will never forget and that is one of the early scenes where the cast arrives at the cabin.  Here we see a long shot of the cabin and it has very eerie music playing.  This shows the cabin as being menacing.  It lets you know that there is evil in that cabin.  And that we are in for a hell of a ride.Sam Raimi made a masterpiece here that I believe stands the test of time. You can put this film up against any of today's so called horror films and I guarantee you this scares you more.  Raimi cares about his movie and he does everything to make you feel the terror that the cabin people feel.  We are scared and disgusted at what happens when one of the women goes outside alone at night and meets a tree that does unspeakable things.  And when the book is first introduced.... that is horror movie history there.  What a brilliant concept.  A book that is evil.  I have often wondered about such books.  We hear about them all the time in movies about ancient Egypt and ancient times.  But here we have a book that has weird incantations from another world and another language and you just know that as soon as some idiot utters the words that they are not supposed to say well they won't be around much longer.The Evil Dead is a miracle.  It was made on a rock bottom budget yet it is scarier than any Hollywood movie that is made for 20 million could ever hope to be.  If you want to truly experience a frightening experience rent this film it knows what it wants to say.  And it knows how to make you afraid. So be afraid.  Be very afraid.  You may never look at the forest the same again.".

And that is because a photo copy is never as good as the original.  That is the bottom line.  Directors don't care about a lot of the material that they are filming today especially when it comes to horror films and that is because they don't write their own stories.  They do someone elses work.  But not Evil Dead.  This was Raimi's baby from the outset.  When films like the two mentioned were filmed they were filmed by two directors that were complete unknowns.  They had no pressure to make a great film and they did it on an incredibly low budget.  Halloween was made for 150000 and Evil Dead for 50 000.  So what that meant is that the directors could stick to their visions but they had to find innovative ways to do so.  Their budgets didn't allow a heap of special effects so they had to rely on what they knew.  And that was how to create atmosphere using the camera.  And Evil Dead is one of the best at doing that.  There is one scene in this film that I will never forget and that is one of the early scenes where the cast arrives at the cabin.  Here we see a long shot of the cabin and it has very eerie music playing.  This shows the cabin as being menacing.  It lets you know that there is evil in that cabin.  And that we are in for a hell of a ride.Sam Raimi made a masterpiece here that I believe stands the test of time. You can put this film up against any of today's so called horror films and I guarantee you this scares you more.  Raimi cares about his movie and he does everything to make you feel the terror that the cabin people feel.  We are scared and disgusted at what happens when one of the women goes outside alone at night and meets a tree that does unspeakable things.  And when the book is first introduced.... that is horror movie history there.  What a brilliant concept.  A book that is evil.  I have often wondered about such books.  We hear about them all the time in movies about ancient Egypt and ancient times.  But here we have a book that has weird incantations from another world and another language and you just know that as soon as some idiot utters the words that they are not supposed to say well they won't be around much longer.The Evil Dead is a miracle.  It was made on a rock bottom budget yet it is scarier than any Hollywood movie that is made for 20 million could ever hope to be.  If you want to truly experience a frightening experience rent this film it knows what it wants to say.  And it knows how to make you afraid. So be afraid.  Be very afraid.  You may never look at the forest the same again.";

	schema:reviewBody "For a film that was made on a budget that would make Steven Spielberg die laughing Evil Dead was one for the most interesting pieces of horror cinema I've ever seen. I watched the series backwards so Army of Darkness was the film I saw first then Evil Dead II. While Evil Dead II is probably still my favorite it was interesting to see where it all started.The camera work is incredibly good and the fast motion sequences showing the demon's approach was pretty well done if not completely original. Though also interesting and kinda funny to note is that we see the characters running away but when the camera switches away from the demon's view we don't see the demon and that seems like a touch of genius...we know it's there but we can't see it and while it probably was a limitation of the budget it actually proved to be a great method of suspense.The special effects are as laughable as they were in the rest of the series but there's something to be said for a film that takes its chances and goes to the extreme in lieu of lacking resources. People complain about this a lot but I have to say to them get a sense of humor. The whole point of the Evil Dead series was to mock horror films and show how campy they were and that they could get even worse. It's humor is in that the film tries to take itself seriously but the lack of a big budget makes this not only impossible but even funny in spite of the fact that it could conceivable be a serious film.The acting is also terrible but again in that way that it's so obviously bad that it's hard to tell were the actors just plain bad or were they doing that deliberately to serve the purpose of mocking the genre. Bruce Campbell's introduction into the world of abused heroes is interesting since his character is actually less of a chauvinist in this one than he ultimately became famous for. But it works and the horror on his face when his friend has no reservations about chopping up his possessed girlfriend is actually believable.Overall this movie is a great piece of cinema. It's humorous but serious as well and its greatest strength is its ability to draw the line between being part of the genre and mocking it. There are plenty of moments of original horror I don't think anybody could keep their composure during the Tree Rape scene which they repeated to lesser effect in Evil Dead II but let's face it that movie was supposed to be a rehash and extension. Give the film a chance and don't take it too seriously. Otherwise you're missing the point.".

It was like the 68th viewing for me  I think...lost count somewhere around 50 but it still only means one thing to me PARTY !! Many feeling can occur when watching this delicious masterpiece by Sam Raimi. You can either adore it be frightened by it or be disgusted by it. But it always leaves a big impression on you and I can't imagine anyone would hate it. And there is ONE feeling that everyone should have towards this movie...RESPECT ! Mostly respect regarding the achievement of Sam Raimi. This guy was 21 years old when he made this film and that's impressive to say the least. I'm around that age at the moment and I sure as hell haven't pulled it off yet...I strongly doubt I ever will actually. No when you're able to come up with such an original and dared idea for a horror film you belong to the greatest minds in the film industry. Sam Raimi did it and his further career only confirmed his status of being a genius with every single movie he directed afterwards. Tons of respect towards Bruce Campbell as well. Sure his performance in this movie is far from great but at the time he did it because of his friendship with Sam Raimi. And because The Evil Dead became a big hit his career was launched too and he certainly grew as an actor. Bruce Campbell is now in the favorite actorlist of many Bmovie fans...And I'm one of them.Then there's Tom Sullivan...responsible for the makeup. What a fine job he did. The Evil Dead gave a whole new meaning to the word gore and we have this man to thank for that. Most nowadays horror films still can't live up to the standard of Evil Dead...not even close. The plot of this film is as simple as can be...but it works. Five friends drive to a small cabin in the woods to spend a small vacation. They find a tape recorder with a message...Out of curiosity they play it and pure evil is rised in the woods. One by one they become possessed and turn into horrible demons who try to kill those who're still alive...That's it !!! And that's all there is needed to create a fun and very original horror movie. The same story already came out in 1978 as a short film called Within the Woods. It was meant to fund money for this film and it's great Bmovie fun as well. If you're a big fan of The Evil Dead trilogy it's certainly worth searching for.Anno 2003 Sam Raimi has grown out to one of Hollywood's favorite directors. He became immortal in the eyes of the big budget audience with his movie Spiderman. The sequel of that one is in production while I write this. I'm sure it will be as decent as the first Spiderman was but I'd still prefer to see Evil Dead 4 coming from the brain of Sam Raimi.A fun trivia element to finish this review with  If you're watching the end credits of the Evil Dead you'll see Joel Coen is credited as Assistent Editor. Coen now is a famous director as well and may be considered as the best director alive. Back in 1981 he and Sam Raimi were close friends and even shared a studio when they were in collage. Joel Coen made his debut in 1984 with Blood Simple. One of the best cult movies ever made...Join us....".

	schema:reviewBody "Looking for a fun weekend away Ash Cheryl Scotty Shelley and Linda all head up to a cabin in the woods for drinking and fun aplenty. Having found it in the midst of the woods they ignore the mysterious things they see and settle in. However a clock stops and a mysterious trap door opens on its own and the boys go to investigate. Finding an old book and a tape recorder they discover that something happened here but don't believe claims of the wood being alive. However when strange things start happening they find it is too late to try and leave and that they have awakened demons that will kill them all before dawn.I wonder if this film would have been as famous in the UK if it were not for the outrage that it got involved in with the whole video nasties affair I guess we'll never know but whatever factors helped it on its way it is undeniable that Evil Dead has been a great influence on many subsequent films. It is easy to look at the things like the tacking shots done by running with camera on planks the excessive gore and the cabin in the woods setting and call it obvious and clichd but that is to forget that some of these things have become the norm since this film maybe even because of it. This is not to say that the film isn't cheesy poorly acted and rather low cost but then that is a fair claim because it is all these things but it is actually more impressive when you know the limitations it was made under. The gore and effects may have dated now but they are still very effective  not because they are cutting edge effects but because they are delivered with a real nasty eye and a sense of horror and brutality that really helps the action. I will admit that ED2 is delivered with real comedy but this film is a lot nastier and I defy anyone to be amused by some scenes. Specifically the BBFC's excised pencil in wound scene is hard to watch but is not as genuinely disturbing as the tree rape  this is not a funny scene but one that really delivers the horror of this film.Given that this is a low budget horror then I think it succeeds well because it is gory and although not that scary coming from a man who is freaked out by all zombie films the gore is hard to watch at times and made me flinch. The performances play second fiddle to the director who marks out the style that he carried with him on his way to becoming the director of blockbusters that he now is his camerawork is clever and he has a sense for the manic and the brutal. The cast are mostly forgotten and it is only Campbell who has gone on to cult status but even his performance is not remarkable here much much better in ED2 and the rest are just kids in a cabin fodder.Overall this is a good film that is a low budget horror that works thanks to constant gore clever and energetic direction and a real sense of brutality in the action. It isn't wonderful and many will dismiss it as just one of many don't go into the woods horror movies but that is to forget how early it came in that clich. People who dislike gore will find little else here and I personally prefer the horror comedy of Evil Dead 2 that is more or less a remake with a bigger budget less brutality and more laughs but this is still an influential film that should be seen for that reason.".

When I first watched this film I wanted the good guys to die because I felt sorry for them.This film is one of the great horrors like The Omen Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Nightmare on Elm Street.

The other really scary scene is where the demon is in the cellarI couldn't stop thinking about that scene.The best horror films are the ones where the characters are in hopeless situations with no easy way out.

Right from the beginning with the eerie spinechilling music and the sense of dark evil in the woods I knew that this movie was going to be unique in the amount of atmospheric terror it would strike into my very soul.Nearly every single scene scared me to death  the most frightening moments for me were when the camera was zooming around the steamy swamps through the woods and approaching the cabin at breakneck speed only to retreat quickly back when the poor soul running from the darkness made it to safety and slammed the door behind them.The zombies were excellent  the best I have ever seen or ever likely to see in any horror movie and their voices were deeply disturbing.After viewing it I told my friends at school how I felt about it and they all agreed that they were deeply disturbed by the whole experience and to me this will always be the ultimate in scary horror  no other film before or since has come anywhere near the mark for heartstriking terror for me.Even to this day I have to pluck up the courage to spin this disc in the DVD player  the effect it had on me back on the 80's lies firmly planted within me and even when I hear anyone mention the title of this film today it strikes me full of terror.It just goes to show that you don't need a huge pile of cash to make a fantastic chilling movie.Evil Dead is the best horror film of all time and with the rubbish they produce today I think I can confidently say that no other movie could ever scare me again as much as this one does.Excellent!".

In the basement they find an ancient book read a few passage out of it and all hell literally breaks loose! Several characters quickly become possessed by demons whose only mission is to kill the living. And that's all the plot this terrific little fright flick really needs. It's not a plot movie anyway it's an exercise in horror in the purest sense with atmosphere mood pacing camerawork and splatter all at the forefront. Sam Raimi's nowclassic film set new standards for levels of blood and gore way back in 1981 and the film stands the test of time miraculously well considering all the advancements in special effects since it was made. In fact I actually prefer this old style mix of makeup effects and stop motion animation to pretty much all of today's films. Also of note is the invigorating pointofview camerawork which has been copied endlessly sense. Evil Dead is a fantastic scary funny imaginative and gory good time not to be missed! I know a lot of people seem to prefer the 1987 sequel or even 1991's third installment Army of Darkness but I'm still a much bigger fan of the look feel and tone of the original.".

You probably shouldn't have gone to my high school you'd just be cowering in a corner somewhere. The gore effects were about as ridiculous as one could imagine. The stopmotion at the end had me laughing like I was watching an episode of MST3K. For comparison it made a Doctor Who episode of the same era look like Avatar.

Remakes such as The Grudge take place in Japan but the main characters are replaced with an American or European cast and sometimes the story just doesn't quite fit the way it should with that type of a cast. In this film the A Tale of Two Sisters story is completely translated into an American setting in the north in a small town. The characters are tweaked a little to accommodate the new setting and so are some of the scenes and plot lines. This is where many fans of the original get upset and get their panties in a bunch.If this film was truly remade true to the original it would just be the original film itself being remade 5 years later with the same cast and same script. This film is honestly one of the best Asianhorror remakes that has been made in the past 3 or 4 years if not ever. The cast gives solid performances and there were little or no plot holes. There were actually less plot holes in this film than the original. Of course I liked the original more but I'm just saying this film executed certain things that the first film didn't just like the first film executed certain things this film didn't. They are meant to be similar but different and that is what makes both of them worth seeing.8.510".

Visually the pictures are very satisfying another thing you would not expect. The acting is also professional along the score all these parts I have no complaints about. The movie was for some reasons I don't fully understand certified as not fresh enough. I do agree some moments are painfully clich but in this case I found it charming. Isn't it a part of the horror movie to expect that a hand will try to reach you under the bed? It will make you jump in your place either way so what's the deal? As long it's not cheesy it's good enough for me. I think that if the creators maybe took a risk and avoided those couple of clichs the movie would have been praised by critics.

	schema:reviewBody "The Uninvited is about teenager Anna Emily Browning who spent time in a psychiatry institution after the accidental death of her sickly mother in a fire. But after ten months she returns home to her spacious New England house that rests on edge of the coast. While happy to be back with her older sister Alex Arielle Kebbel she is not so happy with her father's David Strathairn new girlfriend Rachael Elizabeth Banks a nurse who took care of her mother up until the accident and is now living in her house. Rachael seems to be hiding something and the girls become convinced that she was responsible for the fire that killed their mother. As they dig deeper into Rachael's past more suspicions arise and Anna finds herself being contacted by the ghosts of both her mother and three mysterious children that have a connection to Rachael...I was somewhat skeptical going into this movie seeing that it was a remake of the Korean A Tale of Two Sisters and the fact that it was a PG13 horror movie which is often a bad sign. But I was pleasantly surprised with The Uninvited because it ended up being much more than your typical teenage horror thriller. First off the screen writing is wonderful here. The same evil stepparent setup has been done before but there are a number of plot twists turns of events and nice little quirks that keep it from being too average. The film overall was really unpredictable in most respects that is unless you have seen the original Korean film which I have not so I was very interested all along. The supernatural lacing in the story is well done too combining ghosts and spirits with reallife danger that threatens our two leading ladies.The cinematography is impressive and setting is remarkable too as the entire film unfolds in the confines of a beautiful large New England home that sits perched on the side of the rocky ocean cliffs a location that gives plenty of space for creepy action to unfold. It's atmospheric because of this as well and has a comfortable  yet more often than not creepy feel to it. I like the fact that the film takes its time building itself shying away from being too shocking and posing plenty of questions in its first act and then kicking into gear in the second and tossing the shocking truth behind all of the events right at your face. The evertiring jump scares are limited here with suspense being the more the main focus which was really welcome and a change from the norm. The pacing is delectable and the tension is present as it grows toward the climax which is nothing short of jawdropping.Also I'd like to mention the cast here. Emily Browning of 2002's Ghost Ship plays the leading role as the curious and quiet younger sister playing her role perfectly with the face of an angel. Arielle Kebbel is also very good as her older partyloving but serious sister who aids her in the uncovering of Rachael's past. Rachael herself the devilish stepmother figure is played by Elizabeth Banks whom I have seen mainly do comedy work and manages to be threatening and elusive despite her good looks. Also notable is David Strathairn whom I recognized from Dolores Claiborne as the unbelieving father. The ensemble of actors here is strong and their chemistry with each other surprisingly really works which I think added a lot to the film.As far as the ending is concerned I won't spoil things but it's clever really. It completely came out of left field for me and I was dumbfounded and giddy with anxiousness within the final ten minutes. Sure similar plot twists have come about before  but it was really unexpected and the funny thing is after thinking about it there are clues that are dropped along the way. Problem is they're so subtle that the viewer doesn't even notice and I really liked that. I was completely caught offguard. And the final shot is an innocently creepy seal on the envelope of a clever and entertaining horror movie.Overall The Uninvited is a very welcome change from the standard PG13 horror pictures and has the caliber of much more sophisticated horror movies. The classic horror atmosphere creepy sets and tense character interactions make this movie work not to mention the twisted ending which is an unexpected smack in the face. The Uninvited is an enormously fun wellconstructed flick that retains an elegance that most horror movies nowadays especially PG13 thrillers fail to achieve. Also note this film is in no relation to the 1940s ghost film of the same name 910.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Uninvited is about teenager Anna Emily Browning who spent time in a psychiatry institution after the accidental death of her sickly mother in a fire. But after ten months she returns home to her spacious New England house that rests on edge of the coast. While happy to be back with her older sister Alex Arielle Kebbel she is not so happy with her father's David Strathairn new girlfriend Rachael Elizabeth Banks a nurse who took care of her mother up until the accident and is now living in her house. Rachael seems to be hiding something and the girls become convinced that she was responsible for the fire that killed their mother. As they dig deeper into Rachael's past more suspicions arise and Anna finds herself being contacted by the ghosts of both her mother and three mysterious children that have a connection to Rachael...I was somewhat skeptical going into this movie seeing that it was a remake of the Korean A Tale of Two Sisters and the fact that it was a PG13 horror movie which is often a bad sign. But I was pleasantly surprised with The Uninvited because it ended up being much more than your typical teenage horror thriller. First off the screen writing is wonderful here.

Especially Browning. I really liked the cinematic effect. The cinematographer Dan Landin did an excellent job. The lighting was good. The camera angles were good. The sound was also good thanks to the Sound Department. The Uninvited is very different and unique. It may have a few clich jumps and scares but in the end it was really worth seeing.

She turns in a credible performance. You believe in her makes you fear for her and that's half the battle. So it's such a shame that the directors and screenwriters drop the ball so badly. Everything in this movie is SO geared to a major twist in the last reel that instead of making you bug out with its rugpulling impact like Sixth Sense or Usual Suspects do it instead just makes you roll your eyes. Why? Because like those 2 films i've mentioned this flick lacks of any preceding foreshadowing or character nuance thus robbing the end twist of its intended impact. Oh and the cheesy J Horror ghosts moments seem more Scary Movie than The Ring.The Korean original was creepier confusing in parts but it comes together in the end and the cinematography is beautifully framed one impressive shot comes out from underwater and up onto a deck where the titular sisters are sitting. The Guard Brothers ignore such artistry and go for a generic approach and when they do breakaway its to copyhomage a Kubrick helicopter shot from 'The Shining'.Strathairn fantastic in Good Night  Good Luck is wasted. Banks who has proved her on screen versatility in an eclectic choice of roles in multiple pics over the past year here goes for the fairy tale Step mother  the steel under her smile was borderline hammy but she definitely is one of the best and overlooked actresses in the business.All in all  avoid this film and seek out the Korean original instead but if it turns up on cable and you have 87 minutes to waste  watch it for Browning and Banks and the fun of yawning at a schlocky story.

	schema:reviewBody "After being cleared for release from a mental hospital Anna Emily Browning returns home to her writer father Steven David Strathairn and sister Alex Arielle Kebbel. In her absence Emily's father has grown closer to her late mother's former caretaker Rachel Elizabeth Banks. Anna is continually hallucinating and seeing her dead mother insisting that her death was not an accident and that Rachel had something to do with it. With this in mind she sets out with Alex to prove Rachel is not everything she seems.I did not expect much from The Uninvited but surprisingly I received a lot more than I expected.Despite being an American remake of the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters The Uninvited does enough to make it stand out on its own. I never saw the original film but I imagine it looked different than this film does. It is dark and atmospheric from the very beginning and continues on the same wavelength to the very end of the film. It frequently blends horror with psychological terror developing a movie that could have easily been a throwaway scareflick for preteens to scream through but ends up being a fairly accomplished film. This is not a film anywhere near the quality of the greatness found in the likes of The Silence of the Lambs but it is a film that was not just scraped out for a profit.The story itself as twisty and loopy as it gets is fairly well done. Although I was not too interested at the beginning the film draws you in rather tightly revealing itself quite nicely over its short 87minute running time. Yes there are plenty of predictable moments laced throughout the film but there are a few moments of genuine surprise as well. The film never makes the claim that it is trying to be original but it does a unique enough job that you can only see shades of what has come before as opposed to a standard American horror film basically spelling out exactly what it is ripping off or homaging sort to speak. Even with the cheap scares around every corner it still managed to make me jump back more than once.What does not make sense however is how some things are explicitly stated while others are briefly alluded to. A lot of what happens is fairly obvious for even the least astute of audiences yet the film dumbs itself down more than once to fit the conventions of 2000era PG13 horror. When something ambiguous comes up it is either explained indepth or done away with entirely. A rather crucial character element of Anna's is revealed very close to the beginning of the film but is never explored in any capacity. We understand her motivations and what drives her quest for the truth but there are a few background details that even after the film concludes still left me a bit baffled. Why explain some things that are obvious but not bother touching on ones that are not? Despite not having starred in a lot of things Browning is quite good in her role as Anna. Struggling throughout the film with mental anguish and hallucinations Browning makes this young teenage character convincing in a way only someone so young could do. She is not perfect in the role but you can see the desperation and heartbreak in her face and her actions. This is an actress who becomes her role and never falters out of it. She carries the film from beginning to end and never looks the worst for it. She is a young actress I hope to continue to see more of especially in higher fare.Kebbel while not as powerful as Browning commands when she is onscreen. She works beautifully off of Browning and makes their relationship clear and pure from their first moment together. Their chemistry makes the film as surprising as it is. It easily could have been something that was clouded over or underplayed. But the filmmakers use every opportunity to stress the strength of the relationship of the two sisters and their willingness to go the distance for each other. Some moments are just heartbreaking seeing the lengths they are willing to go but Kebbel keeps herself in check at all times and gives a great performance.Strathairn despite the Oscarnomination for Good Night and Good Luck. seems to have fallen on being the wise older character in every movie since and gives the same old performance here. He is good as always but seems more mellowed down than he should be. Banks on the other hand is completely out of her comfort zone and her performance is an obvious reflection. In some scenes she is downright terrifying as the evil potential stepmother and in others she is laughably bad. There is no middle ground and no one seems to have been able to suggest any consistency tips for her. While she gives a decent performance anyway it could have been stronger with a more confident actress.But what the film is guilty of is its lack of reinvention. It is a unique piece of horror for 2009 but the film never strives to be anything bigger or better. It lacks the motivations to really make something of itself and never even tries to be something better than it could be. The Uninvited really surprised me for how good it actually was but surprised me more in how easily it could have been even better. A lean running time a great pair of young actresses and some decent supporting acting could have made this small picture quite the notorious horror flick. But instead it seems content just being an above average runofthemill psychological thriller.710.Portions of this review originally appeared on httpwww.dvdfanatic.com.".

The fact that they TOLD you she was going crazy and still didn't bring a twist to it was a little disappointing. Also the whole sister thing is a lot overplayed. Obviously all of these complains could probably fire away at the original but I never saw the original. I might actually give it a shot and judge it a little more fairly depending on when it was made haha I don't even know that I think a lot of people are going on and rating it for how it appears and not what's actually happening here and what's actually happening I actually didn't really like. That being said the cast was good the acting is decent I just don't feel like it was all that shocking or surprising. And the only times I jumped were the cheap thrills due to loud booming noises. Not that anything really scares me unless I'm alone in a dark theater while all this is happening anyway. It still seemed like the movie could have been a little better in that aspect as well.I give it a mediocre rating but that's not to say I hated it.".

I was willing to give the remake The Uninvited a chance and put it on this afternoon and could not believe my eyes.This remake does not deserve even 1 point out of 10 on the IMDb. What absolute disgusting garbage! ANYONE who has seen the Korean film would be mortified to watch the American version. There is no comparison at all. It would be like going into a restaurant and asking for Prime Rib and being served chopped liver instead.It starts with a make out session with scantily clad drunken teens on a beach. Then Anna Sumi in the Korean masterpiece gets up and leaves her make out partner on the beach and runs into the woods and sees a garbage bag filled with dolls. One comes alive and looks like Linda Blair in The Exorcist. Then she goes to a beach house where she sees her mother who looks to be about 75 years old with an IV in her arm and she is trying to cry out for help. So Anna runs up to the main mansion why does the Father live in a mansion while his sick wife is relegated to a beach house? STUPID! Eventually the mother is burned alive in the beach house!Then suddenly Anna is talking like a normal person to her psychologist in the mental institution and calmly describing her dream. WHAT???? In the Korean masterpiece Sumi Anna is so psychologically damaged schizophrenic multiple personality she cannot even speak! Then the Father picks Anna Sumi up from the mental institution and they are all happy and smiling without a care in the world. They get to the mansion and Anna Sumi runs to her room  calling her sister. Sis is nowhere to be found so she goes downstairs again and has a happy conversation with the stepmother. In the Korean masterpiece Sumi hates the step mom! In The Uninvited Anna hugs the step mom!!! Didn't this director and producer watch the Korean masterpiece AT ALL? Did they arrogantly think they could improve it? What a joke!Then the killer of all Alex Suyeon in the Korean version is at least a foot taller than Anna Sumi!. Alex Suyeon is supposed to be the YOUNGER sister!. Alex dressed in a bikini!! asks Anna Sumi why she never responded to her letters while she was in the mental institution. Anna Sumi says she never got them. So Alex Suyeon starts screaming and cursing blaming the father! She even uses the word Ahole! great sympathetic role model for teens that you've got there Dreamworks. Did you REALLY have to hire such vapid actors that have more in common with a Disney Channel sitcom?.I'll spare you anymore. Just watch the brilliant Korean film A Tale Of Two Sisters and throw the American piece of garbage The Uninvited in the dung heap of forgotten film bombs where it belongs.".

Depth and characterisation suffer accordingly  though the waifish Browning impresses a tiny pink flower with fraying petals turned in on themselves. She has an unusual interesting face and an assured future at least in playing damaged poppets. Hopefully she'll soon put such bland fare behind her although Banks and Srathairn should frankly be sent to bed without any supper. At the film's prerelease press screening the final reveal elicited a single irritated 'Tch!' from some anonymous critic in the dark. That little noise pretty much sums up this entire production.".

At the film's prerelease press screening the final reveal elicited a single irritated 'Tch!' from some anonymous critic in the dark. That little noise pretty much sums up this entire production.";

Ten months later Anna still has a blackout about what had happened in that night but her psychiatric Dr. Silberling Dean Paul Gibson discharges her telling that she has resolved her issues.

Along the days Anna is haunted by ghosts and she believes that Rachel killed her mother. Alex and she decide to look for evidences to prove that Rachel is a greedy murderer and Anna discovers the truth about the fire in the boat house.I usually hate remakes but The Uninvited is a great remake of the excellent but confused Janghwa Hongryeon a.k.a. The Tale of the Two Sisters. I liked to see in the Extras of the DVD the interview with the writers of the screenplay producers and directors Charles and Thomas Guard since they have been very honest in their words recognizing the merits of the original Asian movie that was the base of their script. Further they had the skill of using the original storyline with an intriguing supernatural and noncomplicated plot and an excellent plot point that provides a satisfactory explanation for the events that triggered the whole process in Anna's mind. I do not recall seeing the sweet Emily Browning in another movie but she proves that she is an excellent actress participating in practically every scene and giving credibility to Anna. The efficient David Strathairn and Elizabeth Banks and the also unknown Arielle Kebbel have also great performances in this highly recommended supernatural feature. My vote is eight.Title Brazil O Mistrio das Duas Irms The Mystery of the Two Sisters".

	schema:reviewBody "Man... How do I put this without sounding unhinged...Okay first and foremost ANY time I wish to read about a film that I am interested in I ALWAYS read the 'External' reviews first which for me personally especially where Horror films are involved I rely on COMPLETELY as opposed to the 'User' reviews. Those are usually much more balanced and you can count of the fact that they are genuine and NOT 'plants'. Admittedly Horror is EXTREMELY subjective so perhaps some may enjoy this film although I'm sorry but I must admit that I most certainly did not and to me at least some of these 'rave reviews' are so calculatingly worded as to how 'wonderful' the film is in EVERY way that it makes me a bit nauseous. I don't know maybe I just have a bad case of gas...For what it's worth at least for my personal taste ANY time there is a Horror film that catches my eye I always try to see if 'Slasherpool's site has reviewed it because many times I do agree with their taste and their reviews. This one had 1 star out of a possible 5. He had seen the original and felt that this one was a complete travesty by comparison. He also stated that as a stand alone film not taking into account the original that it was just very poor instead of abysmal. Just thought I'd share that since I don't know how many take the time to read the 'External Reviews. To me his are usually right on the nose and what I really appreciate about his reviews is that whether it is a tame PG13 film like this one or a horrendous Slasher film he treats them all equally as to their cinematic merits. UPDATE Sadly since my writing this the site no longer exists Now from MY standpoint. First off the reason I even give this film 2 stars is because the production values and photography and the technical aspects of it are very good. But... sadly that is about it. Primarily I just did NOT like the acting at all sure Strathairn is an excellent actor but right from the beginning Emily Browning's acting in the Psychiatrists office her little predictable 'pensive' and 'ooh do you really think so' expressions etc. just did NOT ring true to me at all at any level whatsoever. The interaction between the two sisters including the 'acting' of the other sister pretty much the same thing. The direction... Well I don't know maybe it's personal preference but I just felt we were being led along a very VERY predictable path from the first scene in her bedroom after she had gone to sleep not giving any specifics away of course Honestly the whole thing just felt like complete cardboard. Like 'Okay let's show how scared she is... okay now lets play the scary sounds... okay now lets build up the 'suspense'...' Sorry the film just did absolutely NOTHING for me. Didn't care wasn't moved didn't like the girl at all...It strikes me that perhaps what was sorely missing was a GENUINE atmosphere. I just did not FEEL it at all. Her reactions were completely 'plastic' and unbelievable which could have been the fault of the director either not bringing the right performance out of her because she IS supposed to be a good actress or perhaps in the editing choosing the wrong takes I don't know. It just wasn't working for me...So what we are left with is a very nice looking movie with good production values but completely unmoving sterile unrealistic and unbelievable. The interactions between characters are artificial. The film has absolutely NO atmosphere at all which is COMPLETELY unforgivable for a Ghost Story...".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen the original Tale of Two Sisters by Kim Jiwoon to begin with so I won't be able to do any meaningful comparisons. But if a remake is any indication of how the original is generally miles better especially if done by Hollywood hen it probably is worth my while to put the Korean horror movie in my towatch list. After all Kim Jiwoon's film is one of Korea's top box office draws when released.There have been more misses than hits when Hollywood adapts what it thinks could be instant box office gold with its fountain of Asian content and since there have been only a limited number of successful Asian horror releases in recent years it had looked inwards and cannibalized on remaking its own shockslasher films. This one took a long while to translate to The Uninvited and I guess taking some 6 years indicated the filmmakers wanted to do things right instead of rushing through and come out with crap.As such the directing duo of the Guard Brothers Charles and Thomas managed to find some balance between telling a psychological thriller and moments where they can properly employ tricks from the usual formula book to scare an audience with the usual light and shadows smoke and mirrors warped beings decomposed bodies and jump cuts with ghouls staring down at you. Surprisingly it didn't rely on sound or lack thereof to add a further sensory dimension to set pulse racing which I thought was a little let down in its moments to build up to the next Boo! If anything the acting duo of Emily Browning Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events with pouty lips to rival Angelina Jolie's and given special attention too in this narrative and Arielle Kebbel shine as skimpily clad sisters Anna and Alex respectively who have to rely on each other as they uncover the truth behind the death of their mom Maya Massar. It doesn't help of course with Anna just being certified sane and safe to be released from a mental institution and their suspect happens to be their nannyturnednewstepmomtobe Rachel Elizabeth Banks whom dad David Strathairn intends to marry. Given the short run time of under 90 minutes the pace is kept compact with little room wasted to pump in unnecessary subplots unless set up just to provide an additional avenue to unleash horrific mayhem focusing very much of the relationship between the two sisters and their strained one with their father. Emily Browning as the lead of course had enough latitude to showcase a doublehead snake role in being nice to Rachel in order for some fishing of information.That isn't to say there isn't any loophole that a jumbo jet can't fly through. Even if you have no background knowledge gained from the original Korean film it is easy enough for sharpeyed viewers or those whose cinematic staple is horror films to stay one step ahead and deduce just what is exactly going on. Which makes me wonder just how much it'll take for shockmeisters to scare seasoned audiences since they're getting savvier and easily bored with the same old bag of tricks.If anything The Uninvited would have piqued your interest in the original which has a longer run time and in all likelihood the exploitation of mood and atmosphere that are quite standard tools for horror films from Asia which is sorely lacking in this version. Nonetheless it's still one of the better Western remakes of Asian horror attempted.".

	schema:reviewBody "2009 has already seen a great supply of horror films with The Unborn and My Bloody Valentine headlining the bunch. Enter 'The Uninvited' an original thriller with some mildly scary moments that is not a horrible way to spend 2 hours. The film borrows from a few other films while forging a decent identity of its own thus making it somewhat memorable and by no means terrible.The film deals with a girl the beautiful Emily Browning who is released from a psychiatric facility months after being involved in a terrible tragedy. When she returns to find her father David Strathairn in the arms of a new woman Elizabeth Banks she begins to doubt her family her life but never her sanity as she looks to find something against her future step mother.The biggest allure of this film is that it has a massive plot twist in the end that really excuses the film from the somewhat weird performance of Elizabeth Banks. The film is a great psychological exercise and the twist really makes her performance much better once you understand why her character was so weirdly over the top at moments. I felt Browning did an excellent job of making us side with her character while making her just mysterious enough to doubt her. It really kept me on my toes. David Strathairn is going through the motions in a role that almost any decent actor could play. His only job in the film is to pretend to be in love with Elizabeth Banks and we all know how hard that is.Really there isn't too much going on here with 'The Uninvited'. It does nothing new but a lot of things right. Hell the twist will remind you of a couple of other thrillers that seem supernatural as the film is. I did enjoy the film's score a lot and I appreciated that the film didn't take the general clich route. In the modern slightly horrorthriller it becomes all to easy to just borrow way too much from other films become the 'Eagle Eye' of the genre and become laughable in the end. Fortunately in my theater of about 25 people the film got just one mild and feeble laugh and a lot more yelps of surprise.In the end 'The Uninvited' is worth a look if you have some time on your hands and is the exception not the rule to the long standing beliefs about films released in January. I should also mention that every main character is very easy on the eyes especially Browning who is simply stunning in every scene. Yes even the one where she...well you should see it to find out for yourself.".

And also they have to work on the scary parts its got to old for zombies crawling to your bed and jumping out of the garbage just play the game FEAR 2 and you will have some clues what to do.".

And also they have to work on the scary parts its got to old for zombies crawling to your bed and jumping out of the garbage just play the game FEAR 2 and you will have some clues what to do.";

	schema:headline " Overreaching film nonetheless has merits to savour";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a highly ambitious Iranian film following the lives of several women in 1950s Iran. It may be of interest to American viewers in that the backdrop to the movie is the 1953 coup where the CIA in support of an absolute monarch the Shah helped overthrow a democratically elected government. That assumes that anyone is still interested in finding out why the world hates America I think it's become pass to ruminate on that now. But if you flick CNN on and see the latest wranglings with Iran well here is where the story started it's a good idea not to start reading at chapter 56.The main focus of the film though is the treatment of several Iranian women by the society in which they live and their retreat to a magical garden without men. It's an awesomely ambitious adaptation of a famous novel of the same name by Shahrnush Parsipur who has a cameo appearance as the brothel madam. It's not particularly successful I don't like saying that but I think even Shirin Neshat who was present for the screening was not happy with the finished article which took a very long time to film. She has simply tried to weave too many strands. The most successful story perhaps is of the young prostitute Zarin who is anorexic and actually played very well by a Hungarian actress Orsolya Tth. It's no surprise to me that Neshat actually made a 20 minute short starring the same actress in 2005 called Zarin which was very well received.In the Women Without Men Zarin who runs away from a brothel is seen furiously rubbing her body raw in some public baths. She speaks not a single word in the whole movie and that is the most effective condemnation of the society she lives in.We can see some of the terrible attitudes prevailing then and perhaps now as well about women. Amir Khan played very ably by Essa Zahir at one point approaches one of the women Faezeh played by Pegah Ferydoni and gives her this line about how women are flowers who blossom and then wither. He then asks her to become his second wife his first wife who has withered will of course become her servant. Khan has absolutely no idea of the level of misogyny he's communicating. One of the women is a general's wife her husband ends an incredibly oafish rant with an order for her to come and eat some melon because he wants her to. In the movie we see a distillation of the unfortunate insensitivities to which a group of Iranian women have been subjected. It's important to note that it would be an overreaction to condemn Iranian male society en masse.It's a very beautiful movie the garden of the villa that the general's wife sets herself up in after a very scandalous separation is really very magical and shot wondrously. I was worried that the movie was getting a bit lost in it's quest for aesthetic perfection and thusly becomes almost soporific. The stories of the different women became a bit cacophonic there was no unison message. It's got to be pretty unbalanced as well men are almost uniformly comedy sketch buffoons the women martyrs.".

But if you flick CNN on and see the latest wranglings with Iran well here is where the story started it's a good idea not to start reading at chapter 56.The main focus of the film though is the treatment of several Iranian women by the society in which they live and their retreat to a magical garden without men. It's an awesomely ambitious adaptation of a famous novel of the same name by Shahrnush Parsipur who has a cameo appearance as the brothel madam. It's not particularly successful I don't like saying that but I think even Shirin Neshat who was present for the screening was not happy with the finished article which took a very long time to film. She has simply tried to weave too many strands. The most successful story perhaps is of the young prostitute Zarin who is anorexic and actually played very well by a Hungarian actress Orsolya Tth. It's no surprise to me that Neshat actually made a 20 minute short starring the same actress in 2005 called Zarin which was very well received.In the Women Without Men Zarin who runs away from a brothel is seen furiously rubbing her body raw in some public baths. She speaks not a single word in the whole movie and that is the most effective condemnation of the society she lives in.We can see some of the terrible attitudes prevailing then and perhaps now as well about women. Amir Khan played very ably by Essa Zahir at one point approaches one of the women Faezeh played by Pegah Ferydoni and gives her this line about how women are flowers who blossom and then wither. He then asks her to become his second wife his first wife who has withered will of course become her servant. Khan has absolutely no idea of the level of misogyny he's communicating. One of the women is a general's wife her husband ends an incredibly oafish rant with an order for her to come and eat some melon because he wants her to. In the movie we see a distillation of the unfortunate insensitivities to which a group of Iranian women have been subjected. It's important to note that it would be an overreaction to condemn Iranian male society en masse.It's a very beautiful movie the garden of the villa that the general's wife sets herself up in after a very scandalous separation is really very magical and shot wondrously. I was worried that the movie was getting a bit lost in it's quest for aesthetic perfection and thusly becomes almost soporific. The stories of the different women became a bit cacophonic there was no unison message. It's got to be pretty unbalanced as well men are almost uniformly comedy sketch buffoons the women martyrs.";

	schema:reviewBody "My take on the movie was more metaphoric than the reviews I've read about this movie. The lives of the characters in the movie represented different elements of Iranian society full of contradictions where clashes and hopes live side by side. The 1953 democratic revolution was perceived differently by different elements of Iranian society. The key point of the film as I see it is manifested through the four women who represented various forms of struggle within the Iranian society and the gardener who represented the core of Iranian culture with a focus on creating beauty and providing hospitality to all.I see Zarin the prostitute portraying the victimization of Iran which had been suffering from abuse inflicted on her by various elements that humiliate her robbing her of her dignity with complete disregard to her pain and true desires. Zarin's soul was awakened by a visit from the gardener who offered her hope of a new start through the wind of change that was taking shape through the political awakening that was promising revolutionary changes. She runs away from the brothel and is seen in a public bath furiously rubbing her body in a symbolic way of ridding herself of her sinsvictimization as a first step toward regaining her dignity. She then walked into the garden of hope where she found peace and became part of the garden to be nurtured by those victims who represent the masses of the Iranian people who found hope of a better future for Iran through the revolution. They felt strong connections to Zarin and needed her to heal in order for their hope to be realized. Zarin's silence throughout the movie reflects the absence of her voice Iran's voice in the political process an effective way of portraying the country's victimization by the Shah's dictatorship and his backers the West.Munis the sister was victimized by the culturereligious restrictions manifested through Amir her brother who isolated her and prevented her from participating Iran's political process thus limiting her role in society to a mere servant. Munis' frustration led her to destroy her body in order to liberate her soul. Her spirit was finally liberated and joined the revolution by embodying one of the leaders of the revolution.Faeza the friend of the sister portrayed the majority of Iranian women who are traditionally and culturally compliant. She has no interest in any political changes. Her only aspiration is to live according to traditions by getting married and be a good wife. Her conscious was tested when she witnessed her friend Munis' suicide in frustration over her brother control. She imagined her friend calling on her to set her free which she did but while she wandered the street in pursuit of her friend's spirit she was raped by two traditional men causing her to lose her innocence and feel ashamed. She then became an outcast and destitute and in need of help. Munis' spirit guided her to the garden of hope where she met with the other victims women and together they formed a support group spirited by the revolution which they hoped would bring them rejuvenation and a better life. But in order for their aspirations to come true the revolution embodied by Munis must survive. Unfortunately the Shah backed by the CIA killed any hope of liberation by instigating a coup led by the Shah and the corrupt elites of Iranian society.The wife of the general represent ed the upper classintellectuals of the Iranian society who dreamed of a meaningful and fulfilling life that would allow her to grow .The man who nurtured the garden represents the essence or foundation of Iran itself where all are welcome and hope is eternal. The magical garden the general's wife purchased is a place where hope lives and die.".

It is kind of dreamlike in its exposure of its ideas and some situations are more like drawings of a feeling than a real plot developing. It is almost white and black which suits well with the bleak spirit of the story which is quite gloomy in general and it looks quite good. The actors in general do quite a good job even if the material is a little bit thin.Sadly the director tries to encompass too much and show too many things and the films paddles and loses itself. It doesn't help that it has been directed in a very languid style with little action and long shots. I am not expecting Michael Bay's style to pop by in these kind of movies but slow can be too slow. And this is one of those cases. On top of that the story per se is not very original as we have seen these kind of situations before for example the wife who married and meets again the love of her youth so the movie is not very original either.A good effort but kind of a misfire.".

	schema:reviewBody "Women Without Men 2009 is an Iranian film whose original title is Zanane bedune mardan. It was directed by Shirin Neshat and Shoja Azari. The title Women Without Men is misleading because the women are only without men because they are able temporarily to escape from the men in their lives by moving to a rural estate.The movie takes place in 1953 when the CIA helped overthrow the democratic government of Iran and put the Shah into power. Some of the women are running from government oppression and some of them are running from the oppression of the men in their lives. The women in the film had few acceptable optionsprobably an accurate reflection of the lives of women in Iran during this period. It's a grim situation and it's depicted in a grim film. I don't have the expertise to know how faithful the film is to the novel on which it's based or to the reality of events in 1950's Iraq. That information will have to come from an expert. My guess is that the portrayal of women's lives is pretty accurate.This is a powerful film. We saw it at the excellent Rochester 360365 film festivaldumb name but great festival. There's enough in this film to make it worth seeing but in my opinion not enough to warrant seeking it out at all costs. It should work well on a small screen.".

	onyx:emotionText "Women Without Men 2009 is an Iranian film whose original title is Zanane bedune mardan. It was directed by Shirin Neshat and Shoja Azari. The title Women Without Men is misleading because the women are only without men because they are able temporarily to escape from the men in their lives by moving to a rural estate.The movie takes place in 1953 when the CIA helped overthrow the democratic government of Iran and put the Shah into power. Some of the women are running from government oppression and some of them are running from the oppression of the men in their lives. The women in the film had few acceptable optionsprobably an accurate reflection of the lives of women in Iran during this period. It's a grim situation and it's depicted in a grim film. I don't have the expertise to know how faithful the film is to the novel on which it's based or to the reality of events in 1950's Iraq. That information will have to come from an expert. My guess is that the portrayal of women's lives is pretty accurate.This is a powerful film. We saw it at the excellent Rochester 360365 film festivaldumb name but great festival. There's enough in this film to make it worth seeing but in my opinion not enough to warrant seeking it out at all costs. It should work well on a small screen.";

	schema:reviewBody "Women without men is an Iranian film which was directed by Shirin Neshat and Shoja Azari in 2009. The movie reflects women issues in Iran and the oriental culture generally. The film based on an Iranian novel which has the same name. It was written by Shahrnush Parsipur in 1989. The writer was prisoned five years because of this novel and it is forbidden until now to be distributed in the Iranian land. The film has four main women characters embodying a several situations in the Iranian society. The writer and the directors criticize enslaving women and considering them as bodies controlled by men or even by some dominate women. The film take a place in 1953 where there was a coup against Mohammed Mosaddegh by the UK and USA. None of the film characters is politically active but Munis has the interest of supporting Mosaddegh and follow up the news while her brother prevent her from that. The four main characters are Munis Faezeh Zarin and Fakhri. Munis is a liberal woman reached the age of thirty without getting married and her brother tries to arrange her a husband because he feels ashamed of that. Faezeh is the best friend of Munis and she loves Munis's brother secretly. Bothe women are middle class women. Zarin is a prostitute woman she hates her life and wants to change it hardly and she sets at the bottom of the social pyramid. Fakhri is an upper class woman who is tired of her husband and wants to dislocate her husband. The movie starts with Azzan Islamic call for prayer which reflects the religion issue in the film as one of the most important elements. Munis stands alone on the roof wearing her Islamic dress Higabscarf she takes it off and the scarf falls on the ground as she throws herself into the sky. She seems like flying in freedom after she took off her heavy weights of religious and cultural thoughts that were forced on her by the society and the dominant power of men. She says while she is flying into the sky I'll have silence silence and nothing and I realize the only freedom from pain is to be free from the world. The scene shows the hardness of her life with the Hijab which portrays religious and traditional barriers that she can't break so she decided to leave them on the earth and go away to the sky where she can find freedom to enjoy. The four women decide to survive from the society and have their own freedom as they all meet in a strange garden. The garden is outside the city and it has its own gatekeeper. Whenever the woman come near of the garden the door is opened by the gatekeeper without any knocking. In this garden women have their own freedom to live their live as they always wanted as they also face their fears and challenges. The concept of the garden goes all the way back to the Babylon time which it has the oldest texts that talk about the sacred secret garden. The space that devoted for love symbolizing the Garden of Eden. The bible has also mentioned the sacred garden and describe its beauty as the woman body and the act of love. The film is one of the best films I have watched which deals with symbolism and it is so rich with it so I will give one of the best examples in the film. When Zarin was doing her job as a prostitute as she is sick of her life and she seems like a dead woman. She has a strange costumer. She usually doesn't look into the face of her costumer. She waits the costumer until he finishes having sex with her. But the strange costumer has touched her differently he softly touches her arm and then her face. She might has felt that he touches her soul not her body with a dirty and sexualized desire. So she decides to see that different man. When she opens her eyes she sees a faceless man and then she runs away. The faceless human in dreams can be explained by discovering the one self's hidden character. As she doesn't want to continue her life under the pressure and the ashamed society who forced her in a way or another to have such a dirty life. surprisingly the man is the garden gatekeeper himself as he is shown later on.".

However when the Sheriff from a neighbouring town posts a Missing notice advertising a reward for revealing her whereabouts the townsfolk require a better deal from Grace in return for their silence and when the Sheriff returns some weeks later with a Wanted poster even though the citizens know her to be innocent of the false charges against her the town's sense of goodness takes a sinister turn and the price of Grace's freedom becomes a workload and treatment akin to that of a slave.

	schema:reviewBody "I started watching Dogsville and felt like turning it off.. after all what kind of movie could occur with no scenery? No doors.. it seemed like some sort of playmovie hybrid but after a shortwhile all those things faded away until I realized how much I would have missed if I had turned it off  it is now one of my favourite movies of all time.Why? It is so brave to criticse humanity like this and admit just how 'dark' a race we truly are  not matter how much each of us profess to being 'good' we all know that most of us are anything but. Through this movie you see a woman who learns the cold harsh truth in a place where she expected to find the goodness that her faith told her existed. And then on not finding it discovered that even within her lay a wrath that echoed the darkness that she herself wished did not feature so dominant in our race. And the biggest test of this is to observe your own emotions throughout this movie until what you feel at the end as perfect evidence...I honestly believe those people that don't believe what this movie is expressing needs to take a cold hard look around them. And if they still don't believe they are just like the people in this movie  unwilling to see the truth and coming up with excuses and reasons when nothing justifies the horrible world we live in.A true masterpiece  one of the few pure pieces of art in cinema with amazing acting from Nicole Kidman especially and the lack of a set causes you to be immersed in the characters like no other movie. And its 'them' and human nature that is the focus. Will leave you thinking and astounded unless you don't like to think and can't watch a movie that isn't afraid to do something unique in which case there a countless movies for 'you'.".

Through this movie you see a woman who learns the cold harsh truth in a place where she expected to find the goodness that her faith told her existed. And then on not finding it discovered that even within her lay a wrath that echoed the darkness that she herself wished did not feature so dominant in our race. And the biggest test of this is to observe your own emotions throughout this movie until what you feel at the end as perfect evidence...I honestly believe those people that don't believe what this movie is expressing needs to take a cold hard look around them. And if they still don't believe they are just like the people in this movie  unwilling to see the truth and coming up with excuses and reasons when nothing justifies the horrible world we live in.A true masterpiece  one of the few pure pieces of art in cinema with amazing acting from Nicole Kidman especially and the lack of a set causes you to be immersed in the characters like no other movie. And its 'them' and human nature that is the focus. Will leave you thinking and astounded unless you don't like to think and can't watch a movie that isn't afraid to do something unique in which case there a countless movies for 'you'.";

Dogville begins with a prologue and extends to nine chapters in almost three hours of daring exquisite filmmaking.Nicole Kidman gives the performance of her career in my opinion.

Human beings are really this bad? we wonder by the end. Dogville wasn't made to make you feel good but it's a compulsory film for everybody.Dogville is a much better work than Dancer in the Dark Von Trier's previous film which gave him the Golden Palm at Cannes and proves definitely he's one of the greatest filmmakers nowadays. He led his ensemble cast wonderfully and all of them are superb that's no surprise however regarding Kidman Ben Gazzara Lauren Bacall James Caan Chlo Sevigny Paul Bettany Stellan Skarsgrd Jeremy Davies Patricia Clarkson Harriet Andersson Udo Kier Zeljko Ivanek and Philip Baker Hall among others  honourable mention to John Hurt's excellent ironic narration. 1010.P.S.

From the beginning you know that things can only get worse but I doubt that one can figure out neither what's to come nor the powerful conclusion. Nicole Kidman's interpretation is perfect  intense poignant passionate you name it. She is fantastic and so is the small cast locked inside Dogville's scenario a wonderful creation  I wonder how something so simple can bring such a strong effect. Again the entire cast is fantastic and for that goes an extra credit for Lars von Trier. His capability of pushing actors to the limit and extracting painful emotions from them creates a heavy atmosphere full of tension and at the same time so familiar. It is not that Dogville represents the essence of our communities but it exposes some aspects of our lives that we prefer to hide under the carpet.".

	schema:reviewBody "I find it quite amusing that so many Americans were outraged that Lars von Trier had the temerity to criticise their country without having visited it. After all we do it all the time don't we? Millions of us are quite content to sit on our sofas and criticise China North Korea Zimbabwe Israel and countless other countries without having visited their shores. And we're perfectly justified in doing so. So why should Von Trier be vilified for criticising America from a few thousand miles away? Well of course I don't think he should. He's perfectly entitled to his opinion and those that cry and moan are symptomatic of America's biggest problem  its inability to take criticism without getting its pants in a twist. Surely every great country should thrive on criticism. It should help it grow and develop. But instead America seems to resemble a child sometimes spouting unhelpful phrases like America love it or leave it or You're either with us or against us. Therefore a film like Dogville one that refuses to revel in the hollow American Dream is vital and it's a film that should be embraced not shunned.But anyway what the detractors seem to overlook is the fact that Dogville could really be a small town anywhere. It may be the first part in an American trilogy but the small town values with their prejudices and hypocrisy are universal. Everyone can relate...The film begins and ends with a God's eye view of the proceedings and it isn't hard to imagine that Von Trier is looking down on the characters judging them. In fact as Tom himself says everything is a game a test and Von Trier is the one pulling the strings.The game begins when Grace enters the town. The townsfolk are frightened but Tom thinks it's a gift. He wants to see if Dogville has a problem with acceptance. Well at the beginning the citizens are understandably cautious but they're eventually placated when Grace proves that she can help them out. And so at the beginning she develops a good relationship with the town and its citizens. But even at the beginning the relationship is far from equal. She may like everyone but she's essential a slave. Yet the townsfolk like her best like this when she's happily subservient.As the film progresses the town is tested further. The police post wanted posters and accuse Grace of crimes that she couldn't have committed as she was in the town at the time. But rather than this bringing everyone around to her cause the town gets cold feet. It wants to help but only as long as it doesn't put them at risk. Therefore they decide to doubly enslave Grace to make themselves feel better. It's an extraordinary move but one that is anything but farfetched. Individuals are brave but people have worrying habit of proving themselves to be spineless.And seeing as Grace affects the status quo the townsfolk decide to take their frustrations out on her. The men rape her physically and the women rape her psychologically. In fact the most upsetting scene isn't one of the numerous rape scenes  although Chuck's rape scene does prove the brilliance of the set what with it showing everyone going about their daily business and turning a blind eye to what is going on  it is instead the womens' abuse of Grace and the destruction of her figurines. It's more than just a physical violation. It's a violation of everything. Her dreams are being smashed right before her eyes.But why do the people of Dogville react this way? Surely their behaviour is an exaggeration. Well it is and it isn't. Of course the film paints a bleak portrait of human nature that you might not find down your street but I think that the film proves that we all have darkness present in us. It only takes the right conditions and the right buttons to be pressed for it to emerge. In the case of Dogville it emerges for many reasons but I think the main reason is because Grace shows everyone what they are. Before her arrival everyone is happily stuck in a rut but once she arrives everything changes. Everyone is faced with their mediocrity and everyone's lies are exposed. In one scene McKay after having finally admitted his blindness indeed thanks Grace for showing us who you are but during her time in Dogville she also forces Bill to realise his stupidity by playing checkers for him Liz her unattractiveness by catching Tom's eye Ben his loneliness by providing for him Chuck and Vera their unhappy marriage by catching Chuck's eye and Tom his cowardice through his refusal to kiss her even though she's admitted her love for him. Needless to say not everyone likes being exposed. It's hard to face yourself when you don't like what you see. And therefore the person that you're going to punish is the one that made you look at your reflection The ending is certainly bleak but I think it forces us to take a hard look at ourselves. How often have we taken advantage of other people when we should have helped? How often have our intentions been selfish? And Grace's final actions suggest one thing to me if you treat someone like an animal you shouldn't be surprised when they treat you like one too.".

The buzz in the U.S. press was that the film was slanted and reflected Lars Von Trier's ignorance of American society. Such arguments are specious on their facethere are examples of great literature and film making where the creator never set foot in the setting as any reader of Shakespeare well knows. So discounting the selfappointed guardians of America what exactly is this film about what are the film's merits and why does it evoke such strong feelings from its audience especially American ones? What Von Trier has done is take several American icons the gangster the small town the woman in distress the ideal of the common person the local sage and the wise elder gentleman doctor and has turned them on their head to create a timeless play about human motivation greed and the corrupting influence of power. The people of Dogville are on the surface simple and decent people. Grace's arrival and her helplessness is the catalyst that step by step tempts the people of Dogville to inflict upon her greater and greater humiliations to feed their now unrestrained desires. So complete is her humiliation that the twist at the end leaves the viewer very little sympathy for the fate of Dogville's citizens. It is a powerful message and the judgment of the characters is one that takes no prisoners. That there are more than a few examples of this behavior in contemporary American society and in the American past and that it confronts these issues directly is the reason for the controversy surrounding it andapart from the brilliant acting especially by Ms. Kidman and Paul Bettanywhat makes it great art. Von Trier has made a movie that is part of the quintessential American proletarian artistic tradition and its setting in 1930s America is part of the film's genius. That he is not an American and that this movie did not originate in Hollywood should give us all pause. There is a scene in which Grace confronts the people of Dogville with a critique of their bad behavior. Their response is to either deny the truth of what she has said or to blame Grace herself for tempting them. This movie without being preachy or dogmatic attempts to provide its own critique and received much the same reaction as the movie's protagonist. I would not be surprised if this was Von Trier's original intent. Dogville is a disturbing and powerful film.".

There are no special effects nor camera tricks and makeup is kept to a bare minimum which allows us to focus purely on the story and the quality of the acting both of which are exemplary. Nicole Kidman is amazing as usual bringing a wonderful vulnerability and frailty to her character which conceals an underlying ruthlessness and brutality. Ample support comes from costars Betthany and Chloe Sevigny and in truth the whole cast is frighteningly convincing.The story is simple a young woman who it appears is on the run from the mob seeks refuge in a small town known as Dogville. The residents who are initially wary of her soon warm to her and welcome her into their midst. This however comes with a price she must do small favours in return for refuge. Inevitably greed desire and mistrust take over the residents which corrupts them and has devastating consequences for all involved. The dramatic shift in the mentality of the townspeople is so well handled and expertly crafted by Von Trier that it makes the emotional payoff which one receives at the end of this film even greater. It is utterly compelling and has universal themes. Ultimately this is a film which may serve as a cautionary tale for all selfproclaimed 'civilised' societies and as a treatise upon karmic retribution.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the Great Depression the fragile and beautiful Grace Nicole Kidman arrives in Dogville a small town in Colorado escaping from the mob. Tom Henson Paul Bettany a young local man welcomes and introduces her to the distrustful community. They decide to vote whether she could stay with them or not. After a brief meeting they decide to lodge her for fourteen days when they could judge her behavior and come up to a final decision. Meanwhile she should perform some small jobs for them in a sort of retribution receiving a symbolic payment. Later the police come to the town with some pictures of her informing she was a missing person. The vulnerable Grace becomes a slave of the community being used by the locals in the most sordid and cravenly way. The conclusion of the story is spectacular. Two days ago I started seeing this long unusual movie indeed a filmed play. It surprised me in the first moment but a friend of mine told me that this movie was a sort of 'love it' or 'hate it' film. Yesterday I finished watching the DVD and actually it is one of the best stories about human exploitation and pay back I have ever seen. In some moments the unfair misery of Grace recalled me Victor Hugo's Jean Valjean. It is amazing the tendency of the human race when having some kind of power to exploit those who need. The lack of scenarios or special effects highlights the stunning performance of the cast in a very original screenplay. This film is a great homage to the theatrical world and for great actors and actresses. My vote is ten.Title Brazil 'Dogville' 'Dogville'".

I will not review the film's plot because prior posts have amply covered the many questions that are presented and only partly answered. This was an unforgettable film for me even though I do not accept its ideological foundations.One of the subtextual layers of the film involves what I see as a severe criticism of the film industry as a whole. I'm sure that most readers are aware of Lars von Trier's grievances. In many ways the things he has said about modern cinema ring true. How many times have we viewers left the movie hall after watching the latest blockbuster shaking our heads? The special effects may have astounded us but the characters seemed petty and onedimensional or even worse a GLORIFICATION of all that is bad about our culture. I emphasized the word glorification in the previous sentence because I do not believe that a film should ignore the bad  just that it shouldn't make the antagonist the hero.The moving picture was invented by Thomas Edison. Because of him we have the gift of film. Dogville begins with a fatherson duo named after this famous inventor and it is here that I detect a critique of contemporary films. The younger Tom struggles to come up with a story he wants to create something of value but he can only manage a meager three words. He walks around Dogville wanting to help its citizens but he cannot relate to their situations. He unlike them does not have any financial worries because he lives with his father Thomas Edison Sr. who brings in a comfortable pension.Tom the younger is living off of his father's success. Edison Sr. represents old Hollywood and is presented in a kinder light than the other town residents  i.e. he does not molest Grace. Ineffectual in influencing his culture young Tom is the first to recognize that Grace played by Kidman is a gift. He introduces her to the townspeople.Grace is accepted by the townspeople and for a while all are content to share in her sunshine. But then the benefactors begin to long for a greater exploitation of Grace. Through Tom the younger's mediation they seek more balance from their relationship with Grace. No longer interested in her goodness and humanity they want physical gratification at her expense and ultimately Tom's. Tom eventually goes along with them and is corrupted himself. Tom representing modern cinema panders to them by wooing Grace even as he furthers her captivity. He gives them the equivalent of the gratuitous sex scene car chase or mass explosion with resulting body count.Grace leaves Dogville and in the spirit of the Dogme manifesto decides that the world would be better off if the current societal malaise were eradicated along with all of the money and capital of the modern film industry. Hence Grace provides the coup de grace to young Tom.".

	schema:headline " Morally challenging but still a gripping well written and well acted film";
	schema:reviewBody "Dogville is a small mountain village outside of George Town it is a tight community of good people who look after each other.  However Tom the town's writer and moral heart feels that the people are not caring deep down.  He has the opportunity to test this theory when a woman Grace stumbles into the village to escape gangsters.  He challenges them to hide Grace and take her in  and is pleasantly surprised as they gradually do.  In return she agrees to do work for the villagers  however the relationship begins decreasingly pure and increasingly exploitative.I have a natural dislike for films that come across as pretentious or arty for art's sake so you can imagine I approached this film with slight trepidation despite not having seen any clips of it.  However I did really like the film and was surprised just how quickly the three hours flew by. In terms of the plot it is more than up to the task of the threehour running time  in fact I and most of the audience stayed in my seat until the very last credit had run over great photographs and the great Bowie's Young Americans'.  The plot is good enough to be accepted but you do need to see past the script and look at what it is saying to appreciate it  although having said that it would still grip me even if it hadn't made me think.Leaving the cinema I felt that I hadn't really bought the film's moral that nobody is really good' because I felt that most people are not bad and certainly not to this extent but I think my mind was stuck on the specifics of the film rather than the meaning.  In the film everyone is socially polite and restrained but once the chance to take advantage comes it is increasingly taken albeit to extremes. I felt the film was particularly harsh to Tom who was actually a good' person  however I think time has allowed me to understand it better.  We are not good people.  We do take advantage of others whether it be individuals while trying to keep up our good public image as much as we want or groups.  Even those who turn a blind eye are bad' simply because they could have acted for good and they didn't.I saw this film two weeks after illegal immigrants drowned in the UK while picking cockles for very very low wages  they were caught in mudflats by the rising tide.  While the obvious bad' people are those who made them work like this many others knew of the work and ignored it.  More pertinently to the film is the fact that a vulnerable and needy group were exploited by society  just as Grace was here.  I didn't get the photographs over the end credit I was into the music! but they were all of the poor or minorities etc on the fringe of society  I found this challenging.  When many of us see people in need we will do enough to look good' and keep our social niceties ie put a  in the cup just like those in Dogville did. We all feel good after this but this film challenges that idea of good' as wholly inadequate and that just being polite and moving on is still bad' even if it is on a sliding scale.  This is not to say that the film's plot and themes are perfect but even flawed they are clear and will keep you thinking of the film long after it ends.Of course it is unrelentingly bleak for the entire second half but this is the film and I had to accept it for what it was.  In terms of being arty I found the bleak stage to work very well.  The only downside of it was cuts from very black scenes to white scenes hurt my eyes in the cinema.  This is not just theatre being filmed the film uses the lack of scenery well. Sure it focuses the attention on the actors but it also highlights how the people turn a blind eye.  In my favourite shot a rape occurs in one house' and the camera shoots it through all the others they are unable to hide from it even if they don't look  it is a very simple way of showing the audience that everyone knows but is socially polite.  The film still uses makeup and props except for inexplicably Nicole Kidman herself.  She starts the film looking good but ends it looking as good  when really she would have looked tired or bedraggled and destroyed.In fairness Kidman manages to do that without makeup and her performance is very good throughout the film  it is easy to dismiss hers and the other stars' roles as some sort of justification of themselves as real artists' but it was still a brave move for a business that is more about dollars than art.  The rest of the cast more than match her and I was surprised to see so many big names.  Bettany is very good as are Bacall Hall Ivanek Sevigny and Skarsgrd.  Even the child actor is very selfassured and Hurt's homely narration is colourful and funny.  Ironically the two black characters have little to do  the script says they are there as a token indication of Edison Sr's openmindedness but it is almost like they were token at times  sadly Shims' whole contribution is going shhhh' twice!  Despite that there are no weak links the acting is superb and it certainly appears as if von Trier's aim of stripping the film away to focus on performances has paid off in a big way.  Acting awards may not come but I have not seen more daring performances from a Hollywood cast for quite a while.Overall this is a bleak and challenging film  not only to watch but to think about and apply to myself too.  I left the cinema enjoying it but disagreeing with it's moral point of view however I allowed myself to look and I now agree with it as sad as that sounds.  As a story and a film it is wonderful the fact that it has come to the multiplexes' forcing thought and emotion is even better.  The saddest thing is that so many teenagers at the screening I was in walked out  they saw something they were not used to and they rejected it within 30 minutes I find that horribly depressing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dogville is long and if you don't have the patience for a slow rampup of tension it'll turn you right off. There are a couple story devices Von Trier uses that really bugged me and I almost shut it off once. I'm glad I stuck with him though because he really took it somewhere and I came away really enjoying the experience..Critics who hated Dogville talk about it's hamhanded antiAmerican slant Lars von Trier refuses ever to set foot in that country. I knew nothing about this film or Von Trier before seeing it and I have to say I entirely missed the antiAmerica thing until the backcredits. Don't get me wrong there are several scenes that make commentary about rampant nationalism prejudice towards immigrants and small town xenophobia but those comments could be made about the zealous in ANY region of ANY nation at ANY time.If we are to criticize 21st Century America and there are plenty of reasons to criticize it we must also criticize other peoples and governments who are screwing up royally. I think if Dogville has a point to make to America its not that it is uniquely problematic but that it is as problematic as any other nation. Where on this planet can you NOT find a group of people who thinkTHE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE IF EVERYONE WAS JUST LIKE US.That statement is the kernel of failure for every major conqueror and every major religion in history and it portends the long inevitable swirl down the toilet and the people who want you toppled have only to sit back and watch you do it to yourself.America is a great nation with a lot of culture history and art to be proud of and maybe that's why modern artists feel the need to make pieces like Dogville. To remind America that as great as it is it's still a nation of crying barfing excreting whining greedy worried scared mouths to feed just like the rest of us  no better or worse.That's all I think Dogville does as an antiAmerican piece. If Von Trier meant to just poo on America he missed his mark and ended up making a point about all of us. Regardless he among many others wants America to change it's mind about itself and it doesn't matter if he hates it or loves it. Much more interesting to me is the blatantly obvious point Dogville makes  to what point do you forgive the transgressions upon you by others who may be less fortunate but are nonetheless doing wrong? It sure made me take a look at my own pacifism.Nicole Kidman was brilliant as was Paul Bettany and the simpler townsfolk who will play so skillfully with your emotions. It seems I've been flooded with Kidman movies regularly for a couple weeks now and this is my favourite of her performances.Good film Dogville.".

	schema:headline " A Different But Entirely Wonderful Film";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to begin this review by pointing out that this movie has some very very very slow points in it. So slow that I would occasionally flip through a book I was reading at the time until something of interest caught my attention and I was watching again. But the parts that got my attention were well worth the dragging moments inbetween. This may contain spoilers so you are warned again. Nicole Kidman's character Grace is running from the mafia for currently unknown reasons and seeks shelter in a small little town out in the middle of nowhere. The town actually reminds me of what the original American colonies might have looked like or an Amish town but with technology. The townspeople reluctantly agree to hide her but they ask that in return she work for them just like everyone else in the town. Of course the grateful Grace agrees willingly and eagerly sets to work to help the community that had accepted her despite the obvious dangers. But gradually Grace's jobs become more demanding the play less and less. One of the happy things in the town though is that she finds love in a man named Tom who is a soft spoken gentle man who likes to ponder things. Unfortunately the other men also take notice of Grace's outstanding beauty and begin to threaten her with her safety if she refuses to sleep with them. In turn the women blame this fact on Grace herself and punish her by breaking some of her most prized possessions. Grace finds she cannot escape from the demented town and is forced to put up with their cruelties despite whatever small help she gets from her lover Tom. Again one thing that I LOVED is the filming and set design of this film. It's almost as if you're watching a play. Everything is labeled in chalk the streets the graveled path the bushes snow etc. the houses are represented by tall wooden flat pieces of... wood there's an actual truck though and tables and other such things. I loved this concept... it's like seeing a play but paying the price for a movie. Now to talk about the things that horrified me the most. And this is where the SPOILERS come in.  When Grace tries to escape in the truck only to be returned to the town why they were so hellbent on keeping her I have no idea... it seemed rather silly but it made them all seem the more crazy and forced to wear a chain around her neck that was attached to a large metal wheel that she was forced to drag around. This was complete with a metal collar with a bell attached to it so that they all knew where she was.  When Vera forced Grace to watch her shatter the beautiful ceramic figures that she and Tom had been saving for months to buy when she found out that Grace had slept with her husband though this was more of a rape as Grace tried to tell the upset Vera who would not listen. This made me sob to put it mildly.  Tom's betrayal. It broke my heart that he should defend Grace this entire time only to realize that he had never really truly loved her and had only been afraid and had been using her. He then calls up the mafia to come and get Grace hoping that it would be the end of it. Which brings us to the ending MAJOR SPOILERS!!. I LOVED the ending more than words can say. I was hardly surprised when it turned out that the mafia man who had been hunting her had really been her father the entire time and that he really had no intent of killing her but instead to make her a partner something she wanted nothing of. He also offers to take her away from the town for somehow he knew all the cruelties she had been put through here and that his men would kill them all if she so wished. She replies that she would rather live with them than with him and that none of them were cruel at heart. Her father then asks her to step outside and take a walk to think it over which she gladly does. I love what happens next. She sits on a bench looking down at the town and thinks about how the townspeople were really just scared. She thinks about how she would have done the same if she were them and that she never really thought them wicked at all. And then the light changes and in classic literary style she sees the townspeople's true natures in this new light. She then calmly gets back into her father's car says that she wishes them dead and tells him about a mother with children. When the killing is done and all of Dogvilleis dead Grace sees Tom whom she asks the men not to shoot. She then takes a gun herself listens to his pleas for forgiveness and kills him herself. Like I said I love this ending more than words can describe. At first I was really REALLY upset that she would just forgive them. I was outraged that she might let them live. Then I breathed a sigh of relief. It was truly a very moving beautiful moment. One of the most moving that I've seen in a movie in a long time and in a way it was almost poetic. This movie could not have ended any other way. Bravo!".

All I knew was that Dogville had Nicole Kidman in it an actress I have always liked and Lars von Trier a director I have always respected. I was quickly surprised by what the film was. Set entirely on a stagesound stage I couldn't believe my eyes. As a theatre actor it was exciting to see how this all was going to work out. Dogville did not disappoint. Lars von Trier clearly creates a town that may seen ordinary and odd into masterful. Nicole Kidman was excellent and the supporting cast was flawless. It was great to see Lauren Bacall and I enjoyed her performance. When I first saw Paul Beattany in the film all I could think of was the awful film A Knight's Tale that he is also in. However he proved me wrong in his well developed character. Patricia Clarkson was great in her role as Vera she is a stunning actress. If she keeps getting these great roles an Oscar is sure to be in her future. The film on the whole is wonderful. My only complaint was the length. Around the 2 hour mark I was getting kind of antsy but the film brought me back to finish the roller coaster ride that the film gave. Truly an original. Go see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday I saw Dogville after almost one year of waiting its release in Mexico. I didn't know anything about the movie besides the basic plotline a fugitive from justice seeks refugee in a small town that takes advantage of her. I knew that it was shot in a stage and that it was being criticized for being anti american. To my surprise and being a big admirer of both Von Trier and Kidman Dogville exceeded all my expectations. The movie is about major issues and throughout its exciting imagery raw performances and sharp script Dogville digs deeper than what its detractors are saying about it. It is not in no way an anti american film. WARNING. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD My interpretation is that it is metaphor on Jesus as a female character an arrogant rebel that denies her own father because she doesn't understand his and thus her power and doesn't want to be her daughter.She's kind noble and teaches everyone how to be a better person and how to be useful but in the end they turn against her condemning her and metaphorically speaking crucifying her. Then in a surprise ending that is literally taken from the Bible she decides to do God's will in Dogville. It is a really brave decision from Nicole Kidman to do this character that may cause some heavy conflict in some viewers and its is a triumph for Von Trier to choose such an exciting way to shoot the film after all if God is everywhere and see us from the top he should see trough walls and ceilings. This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen.".

Good on her.Trouble is when she says it about a movie like this Dogville you just realise how dumb she is. Dogville is tremendous. Powerful clever and brutal. No doubt my checkout chick had never seen a play or heard of Albee Pinter etc. Short story is that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Sure it's slow has no set to speak of and has far too much voiceover narrative no doubt in a vain effort to entertain the poor Jane's of the world. It makes up for that in the raw emotion it shows.Don't be swayed. This is a story about one thing and one thing only. It's about how naive immigrantsvisitors to a new country inevitably get screwed by their new community. It's a beautiful cometary on how new arrivals try hard only to get rammed by the society they arrive in. This ISN'T just anti American as many too many commentators have said. It's the same in Australia where I live and Britain Spain France  anywhere where refugees go.The point is human nature is the same everywhere. Osama Bin Laden are you listening? Creed religion upbringing mean little when put up against the basic human urges. Have a look at this movie and you'll understand that what's inside people is all the terrorism we can stand.I'm not a great fan of Nicole Kidman's acting well until now. She is superb. I don't know when I've seen a film that has 'wierded' me out as much as this one. It's absolutely tremendous. The only criticism I have is that the ending is a bit contrived and quick but I guess after you've tortured and audience for 120 minutes the end should be swift.".

Full of metaphorsI already heard some people saying that Dogville can be a metaphor of GodChrist and Human race and many of the parallels can really fit in the story. Look here httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0276919boardflat23839682Dogville looks a peaceful city with nice habitants but in reality is like everywhere else and humanssadly are the same in everywhere.".

Full of metaphorsI already heard some people saying that Dogville can be a metaphor of GodChrist and Human race and many of the parallels can really fit in the story. Look here httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0276919boardflat23839682Dogville looks a peaceful city with nice habitants but in reality is like everywhere else and humanssadly are the same in everywhere.";

The chalked set is not a problem it in fact becomes an effective technique von Trier wrings to shock and appall the audience.  The performance was superb especially by Kidman.  American English is not my native tongue but I think Paul Bettany spoke it fine.  All that craftsmanship and art however went into a questionable allegory.  I don't think there is any doubt that von Trier targeted USA.  I'm sure cruelty worse than what Grace suffered is inflicted to immigrants and people in general everyday.

There are a number of winks and nudges by the director suggesting that after all in a town where a dog is represented by a chalked outline one shouldn't take it too seriously.  I didn't laugh though.  In fact I felt manipulated and betrayed by the cruelty Grace had to go through and her seemingly infinite patience.  By the time chapter 9 came around I really didn't care enough to take any pleasure from the payoff.The director's heavy hand tried to tug me along every scene and it had the opposite effect.

	schema:reviewBody "I really did not like this movie. I have followed Lars von Triers career for a long time and have seen all his movies and the only one i really enjoyed was RIKET The Kingdom and Breaking the Waves. What annoyed me about Dogville was a lot of things The main thing is that it never really gets to me i dont feel anything while I see it. And Von Trier himself once said Film er flelser or Films are feelings. Dogville is surprisingly cold and it leaves a great distance between me and the characters. Another thing is the experiment in form. For those who havent seen it It all takes place in the studio. The actors are in costume but instead of streets houses and trees and bushes there are markings on the floor that the actors were forced to relate to. The move through invisible doors and you hear an invisible dog barking. Far away form his DOGME film THE IDIOT. Its all very neat but it all becomes very artificial. Which off course is why he did it. It all looks like a theatrical play that is being filmed which is a thing i really hate. The story is ok I was never really bored during this 3hour movie and the main reason for that is the wonderful actors. But if you come from Scandinavia you will find the story no more advanced than a Finnish tvdrama filled with really evil people pretending to be nice and the problems in small towns. Finnish tvdrama is an expression in these countries and a genre Von Triers knows a lot about. But this kind of story demands an intimacy with the characters that you dont get in Dogville. The theatrical appearance of the film creates a huge distance to the whole story and the film falls between two chairs. It never moves or inspires. It just tells a long long story that frankly is not very believable specially the ending when we find out who Nicole Kidmans characters is and she orders the whole village to be executed. A scene that never would have worked if Von Trier had uses film effects in stead of theatrical effects. It would have been to violent and the N. Kidman character would have been even more difficult to swallow. The last thing that annoyed me during the entire film is John Hurts voiceover. He has a fantastic voice and presence in the film but I hate it when a voiceover is telling me what Im looking at. Now youre seeing this and now youre seeing that! It is overstated the whole way through and it creates even more distance. All in all a HUGE disappointment. Lars Von Triers experiment with the form of cinema fails big time. And I really feel a lot of people like this film just because it is weird and strange and experimental. And I really feel sorry for the actors see DOGVILLE CONFESSIONS and find out why. That doesnt really matter Hitchcock was terrible to his actors too. But go see it if you get the chance find out what you think I would love to discuss it and as I said the actors really save this movie from total failure.".

But after proving his abilities with the remarkable and heartrending Dancer in the Dark it's hard to take Dogville as anything less than a cry for help. This movie is flat out awful. The plot could kindly be called allegorical by people who don't want to say implausible or more honestly shitty. The characters might be called onedimensional if they even had reliable static traits which they don't. The story is a sensationalistic overthetop account of rape slavery and murder and yet it manages to be crushingly ploddingly maddeningly SLOW nearly 3 hours. The cameras were in focus and Nicole Kidman was attractive but other than that it is hard to think of a single thing that went right. Now I understand that a lot of people love this movie because they think it exposes the seedy underbelly of human nature in general and of the American national character in specific. I certainly won't question Von Trier's credentials as a commentator on American culture having lived all his life in Copenhagen a city with several American fast food restaurants. And I imagine you really could make a great movie about a woman who is initially welcomed and eventually enslaved and violated by a small American town. However this ain't that movie. In order to understand the depths of awfulness that this film achieves maybe it would be helpful to enumerate some of the things that would be different in this highly theoretical 'good' version of 'Dogville' relative to the alltooactual 'Mongolian clusterfuck' version I review here.1 It would have very little voiceover. Voiceovers are to movies what bandages are to people both indicate that that something has gone wrong. Voiceovers usually mean that a director made a major change to the movie after principle photography generally because he Von Trier being a he has realized in editing that the movie he shot sucks dick. Our theoretical 'good' Dogville would have no need of repeated voiceover because the story would actually tell itself.2 Grace Kidman would be a rational human being. She would do things that would help her avoid suffering like resisting at least one of her many rapists or telling someone that Tom had stolen the 10 or pressuring Tom to get her out of town early on or saving up her money for a damn bicycle instead of those cheap figurines or trying to make friends with someone in the town in order to solidify her precarious position. Something like that. She definitely wouldn't spend the first 2.5 hours suffering silently like some martyred saint and then last 20 minutes burning the place down like Attila the Hun. 3 Tom would be a rational human being. He would be bookish but not completely insane. He would fall in love with Grace and then show some actual concern for her safety instead of wandering around for two hours spouting nonsense. And most importantly when he found out about the rape it would have some kind of emotional effect on him any normal person would FLIP OUT. He certainly wouldn't go to this woman that he apparently loves and gently bitch to her about how unfair it is that he is the only person who doesn't get to rape her. And even if he DID do that Grace would respond with something a little more salty than a lecture from a graduate level philosophy seminar on the nature of love in a slave society. 4 The other townspeople would be rational human beings. There would be less of them say 9 instead of 15 which would allow each one to appear on screen more than once every 30 minutes. There would be a good reason why say the church organist who befriends Grace doesn't protest when Grace is literally placed in shackles a reason better than Boy it would be inconvenient if I had to start sweeping the stairs again. Even if there was a reason some of the townsfolk would at least be SOMEWHAT conflicted about the whole idea. Oh and there would be a good reason why the first person to take a disliking to Grace wouldn't immediately drop a dime in order to get the 5000 reward.5 The movie would be about 75 minutes shorter. The extra time would come from all the time the characters spend milling about doing chores talking about nothing. Grace would show up in the first five minutes she would be raped within the first 60 minutes and the town would be burning by the 100 minute mark. Tom wouldn't get more than a minute to yammer on about moral rearmament nor would anyone get to spend 10 minutes shouting the word arrogant repeatedly. These are just some of the things that would happen in a good version of Dogville. Two thing you wouldn't need to change is the excellent ensemble cast and a director who when properly medicated is quite talented. But then as flawed as Dogville is this amounts to no more than installing expensive toilets on the Titanic. IN CONCLUSION Do not see Dogville. It isn't worth your time even in a sobadit'sgood sort of way. If you like Americabashing rent a Michael Moore film. Moore is at least funny and concise. Dogville is a muddled frustrating ridiculous mess. None of the characters ring true and as a result the horror and shock that should accompany this story never materialize. If you just have to know what you are missing go see Dancer in the Dark and try to imagine a horribly botched sequel. But again do not see Dogville under any circumstances.".

This dichotomy can explain why the value ascribed to the live can be so different. The distinction allows otherwise 'good people' suspend their ordinary moral rules when it comes to outsiders. In extreme cases this resulted in persecution of Jews by the 'good Germans' torture of terrorists by the 'good Americans' or bombing hundreds of thousands of German civilians to death during WWII by the 'good British'. And in this respect Grace's social status allows for this selective morality to take place. She has never been accepted by the villagers and hence ordinary moral rules did not have to apply to her.Another aspect is that morality often gives in to other more pragmatic considerations including those of economic benefit. Again one of the contemporary examples could be the oil grab by the US branded as 'energy independence' policies which has the popular support across the entire country. And in the movie as villagers start to realize clear economic benefits associated with Grace's presence their conflicting economic interests escalate the situation to her downright exploitation. Since ordinary ingroup morality does not apply in her case there is no limit to how sinister this exploitation can develop. As long as she remains excluded from their tight social group it is not immoral even to slave her sexually.Finally van Trier clearly believes that moral rules can be equally suspended by anyone in the society. So in this respect there is no difference between evil gangsters and righteous villagers rationalizing philosophers and primitive philistines spiritual churchgoers and pragmatic atheists or even corrupted adults and innocent children. All members of these usually contrasted social groups manage to participate in tormenting Grace due to psychopathic economic or political reasons.Perhaps this startling uniform complicity of entire society is the focal point of van Trier's work. This irresolvable problem in which every individual and society at large is responsible for horrendous crimes committed throughout the history of humankind is so grandeur it begs for some sort of solution. And although the director's solution might seem containing a selfreferential problem which might require extermination of entire humanity nevertheless under this vision it is clear why even a baby was killed in the aftermath to save the world from the 'human plague' before it has the potential to harm anyone.The story is thus a startling critique of both society for being a cruel divisive exploitative authority and the concept of 'morality' for being fragile and essentially meaningless.

	schema:reviewBody "I agree with those who say this film is a disappointment. Funny I watched this the same day I watched Tree of Life. Within 5 minutes of Tree I knew I would love it and I did. Within 5 minutes I knew I would hate this film and I did. But not for the story since I hadn't seen much yet but for the as the French say mise en scne. It was a theater piece but if I want to see a theater piece I can go to the theater. But unfortunately it got worse. The acting was too theatrical except perhaps from Kidman. The story was numbing in its non development. First the town people help her then they demand more for some nonsensical reason it costs double to protect her then Tom's solution is absurd. Then they turn to sadistic tortures physical and mental but it's not really punishment. Unbelievable for a film that takes 3 hours to tell. And of course the cruel finale that shocked many. Some have said that this could be an antiJewish film. Could be but I see it more as a modern version of Sodom and Gomorrah. Grace is Abraham and at first wants to save the town before the revealing light of the moon convinces her to have it destroyed. Whatever this film is not worth the trouble thinking over long. It is not clearly a brain teaser like Mulholland Dr or Tree of Life. It is pseudo intellectual at its finest like other films by this director like the equally mediocre Melancholia. Final note while watching this I didn't think it was especially anti American but once the end credits started rolling it was a shock to hear Young Americans and to see images of poor Americans. Then and only then I thought that this piece is antiAmerican and I believe it is. The song itself is antiAmericana at its best. Then I thought that the cheap set might reflect the idea that American life is seen as cheap and artificial compared to the real authentic European life. In any case I can't recommend this film. It is over touted like most if not all of von Trier's films.".

	onyx:emotionText "I agree with those who say this film is a disappointment. Funny I watched this the same day I watched Tree of Life. Within 5 minutes of Tree I knew I would love it and I did. Within 5 minutes I knew I would hate this film and I did. But not for the story since I hadn't seen much yet but for the as the French say mise en scne. It was a theater piece but if I want to see a theater piece I can go to the theater. But unfortunately it got worse. The acting was too theatrical except perhaps from Kidman. The story was numbing in its non development. First the town people help her then they demand more for some nonsensical reason it costs double to protect her then Tom's solution is absurd. Then they turn to sadistic tortures physical and mental but it's not really punishment. Unbelievable for a film that takes 3 hours to tell. And of course the cruel finale that shocked many. Some have said that this could be an antiJewish film. Could be but I see it more as a modern version of Sodom and Gomorrah. Grace is Abraham and at first wants to save the town before the revealing light of the moon convinces her to have it destroyed. Whatever this film is not worth the trouble thinking over long. It is not clearly a brain teaser like Mulholland Dr or Tree of Life. It is pseudo intellectual at its finest like other films by this director like the equally mediocre Melancholia. Final note while watching this I didn't think it was especially anti American but once the end credits started rolling it was a shock to hear Young Americans and to see images of poor Americans. Then and only then I thought that this piece is antiAmerican and I believe it is. The song itself is antiAmericana at its best. Then I thought that the cheap set might reflect the idea that American life is seen as cheap and artificial compared to the real authentic European life. In any case I can't recommend this film. It is over touted like most if not all of von Trier's films.";

I wasn't planning on watching it but my best friend wanted to see it and I gave in. Bad idea. It was a waste of my money. First and foremost let us point out what a lot of people have already mentioned. Jayden Smith cannot act. Like at all. I don't care if he's Will Smith's son it's not like acting is genetic. He was just trying too hard to be funny and too hard to be serious. It didn't seem natural like he was in the moment. Just him... acting. Of course I can't say the same for Jackie Chan. He didn't do much and that was good! Not that I don't like Jackie Chan it's just it's good to see him as a trainer for once. I wish he would have fought more though.Secondly the plot sucked. I mean it was a bunch of middleschoolers flying. Like I get China is a little crazy on the Kung Fu but come on! The fighting scene where Dre is running from the Chinese kids is not that bad of a scene I'll admit but it kept occurring to me that these kids are like 10 and 12. Then there's the whole Dre and Chinese girl romance thing. I was falling asleep every time they were together. I mean you're 12! As someone else on IMDb said there is no sexual tension! Sure it's familyorientated but it's uninteresting to the rest.Then the predictability. The friend who dragged me there told me half of the whole movie and she's never watched it before. It's so boring sitting there knowing what's going to happen. Of course he was going to win of course he was going to run faster. Of course Jackie Chan would save him like I didn't even have to watch the whole thing to know what was going to happen. Also a lot of the scenes were pointless. I can see why the movie was so long. I can only imagine if they have an extended version! Dre drinking from the Dragon water or whatever what did that do? I also didn't understand why Jackie was so reluctant to teach Dre at first. I imagined it had something to do with the crazy trainer but with all the time they had never developed a true story. Okay so he got into an accident and killed his wife and kid... I'm sorry? Like what does that have to really do with anything? Overall it wasn't worth watching. Or maybe it's not a movie you'd watch twice because I sure as hell won't. God forbid they make a sequel.".

	schema:headline " Very Very Poor Execution of the Exact Script of the Original";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is a perfect example of how difficult it is to actually make a good film. Even using a proved script and story that led to a monumental film in 1984 couldn't save this reboot. It is simply awful in every way. Poor acting poor cinematography poor directing poor editing poor poor poor. The best scenes from the original are inexplicably absent. In the original Daniel spends half the film working on Mr. Miyagi's house. He is forced to do the work because he made the promise of i karate teach and you karate learn. In this film Dre hangs up a jacket a thousand times and then knows kung fu. They had the opportunity to really cross the generational gap by coming up with some original takes on paint the fence wax the car sand the floor. I remember as a kid spending hours joking around with friends mimicking these motions. Now kids just get to hang up their jacket? I'm sure their parents love that their kids hang up jackets now but they are just missing out. I'm surprised they didn't do make your bed brush your teeth clean the dishes. If they are going to follow the original script then either fully commit or don't commit at all. This movie couldn't figure out if it was making fun of the original redoing the original or just going through some motions. What's shocking is how successful this movie was. It is obviously because of the terrific story and a whole new generation of kids watching this tale unfold for the first time. And i'm sure parents loved taking their kids to go see it because they can share something that meant so much to them 25 years ago. Let me save everyone from sitting through this mess and suggest that you can experience this story with your kids by watching the original. Even today the original stands up much better than this disaster. this is easily my worst attempt at a review on IMDb and that's exactly what this film deserved. Long Live Daniel San.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is a perfect example of how difficult it is to actually make a good film. Even using a proved script and story that led to a monumental film in 1984 couldn't save this reboot. It is simply awful in every way. Poor acting poor cinematography poor directing poor editing poor poor poor. The best scenes from the original are inexplicably absent. In the original Daniel spends half the film working on Mr. Miyagi's house. He is forced to do the work because he made the promise of i karate teach and you karate learn. In this film Dre hangs up a jacket a thousand times and then knows kung fu. They had the opportunity to really cross the generational gap by coming up with some original takes on paint the fence wax the car sand the floor. I remember as a kid spending hours joking around with friends mimicking these motions. Now kids just get to hang up their jacket? I'm sure their parents love that their kids hang up jackets now but they are just missing out. I'm surprised they didn't do make your bed brush your teeth clean the dishes. If they are going to follow the original script then either fully commit or don't commit at all. This movie couldn't figure out if it was making fun of the original redoing the original or just going through some motions. What's shocking is how successful this movie was. It is obviously because of the terrific story and a whole new generation of kids watching this tale unfold for the first time. And i'm sure parents loved taking their kids to go see it because they can share something that meant so much to them 25 years ago. Let me save everyone from sitting through this mess and suggest that you can experience this story with your kids by watching the original. Even today the original stands up much better than this disaster. this is easily my worst attempt at a review on IMDb and that's exactly what this film deserved. Long Live Daniel San.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't envy writer Christopher Murphey's task in this reinvention of the original 1984 underdog tale. Firstly the second time scribe is dealing with source material which was dull at best but strangely transcended that to become an absolute cult classic for all children of the 80s. This was in part down to Joe Esposito's 'You're the best around' inspired soundtrack mixed with an innocent fighting spirit which beat much of societies ills to the black belted punch  questions such as why is this old man taking such special interest in the Ralph Macchio character? Will all these kids become obese when they invent video games?Karate as I remember it involved the fairly peculiar kids at school wearing white terry towelling suits under normal anoraks while standing at bus stops rather too late at night. Clearly Hollywood remembers something far different as we find Dre Parker Jaden Smith high kicking high above the Chinese landscape atop the Great Walls highest turret with Jackie Chan's Mr Han watching attentively. Yes the reimagining takes the action to Beijing where Dre's somewhat distant widower Mother has relocated their family to teach English. Her small part is all too evident as a bit part under considered and stilted to Smith's Dre and almost entirely inconsiderate and sometimes rude. While the Chinese backdrop plays up the traditions and values of karate almost entirely referenced as Kung Fu which I believe to be different it is repeatedly demonised by Americanisms whether that be the basketball court hustle Dre encounters on his arrival or the bonkers set piece where Dre's mother walks through a slummy shopping Market carrying a Bloomingdales style bag  give the girl a Starbucks latte in a takeout cup. Hollywood interpretations aside Karate Kid struggles with an average performance from debut lead Smith whose dialogue and regards to his largely Chinese cocast are on the same time time delay that his character complains of early in the movie. Chan of course is his brilliant sole choreographed self but even after so much time is sometimes barely understandable yet the subtitles ignore him completely. When he's riffing with Dre's Detroit Street it makes the entire film impossible to follow were it not for a plot lifted directly from the original. Sure wax on wax off is now pick up coat hang up coat and the action labours toward the tournament fight at the end which disappointingly relies on CGI and wire stunts unlike the early training sequences and conflict fights that are sparky and original  one of the only elements of this film that is. Knowing the plot you'd think the script would rattle through at a 90 minute pace but instead labours to 2 hours where the first plot point  arrival in China  comes little more than 8 minutes in but we wait 40 minutes before Chan agrees to train his protg and beyond an hour before the classic training montage begins demanded by a genre which just doesn't appear to allow snake training temples and Chinese festivals in some of the movies dullest moments. I can't see kids enjoying this now in a world where it would be Tekken over training any day and it's just not kitsch or fun enough for their parents wanting a throwback experience with the kids. The pluses are definitely Chan and some elements of the fight production far outweighed by a nonexistent soundtrack average acting drawn out and unnecessary plotting plus dialogue which barely works said in English and translates even worse when presented on screen in subtitles  an interesting consideration and challenge for screenwriters and filmmakers everywhere  but one in which Murphey fails.Of course this isn't all his problem but I wouldn't expect a sequel to be optioned anytime soon and we can be thankful of that.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will be the first to admit that I am a major fan of the the first Karate Kid and not a fan of Jaden Smith. However I went into this movie expecting to be disappointed in Jaden and walked away disappointed in 3 totally different things. After watching this film I am convinced that Will Smith bought off the critics and those that voted this highly or said this was better than the original were 1 of 3 things 1 A plant of the studio or close friends. 2 under the influence or 3 too busy getting physically pleasured to really focus. This film had 3 major flaws and Jadens acting ability or lack thereof was the least of this films worries and truthfully though I don't think Jaden can act his way out of a paper bag his performance didn't help or hurt the film I think he was the same as he was in the others. with that said I will say that his martial arts skills were good and it's obvious that he put in a lot of work and effort into learning the form. I'll give credit where credit is due and for that reason I give this a 4. However this film lacks the 3 C's. Cohesion Chemistry and Character development. Lets start with Cohesion.Cohesion For those that don't know what cohesion means its the glue that holds and strings things together makes it flow seamlessly. If you have AC cohesion would be B. There were a lot of A's and C's no B's.This film left you wondering many times how did we get here? Lets put aside the fact that Jaden is in a new country and doesn't know the language. I found it very interesting how he and his mother got around so well with just having got there. There was no explanation for much of anything at all and at times it appeared that things were thrown in just to have an excuse to have a love interest or for Jaden to be bullied or for his mom to have some dialogue. Like the original Karate Kid or not did you at any point feel this movie is dragging along? Which brings me to...Chemistry There was none AT ALL it felt like a 1 night stand. No ones performance made me give a damn about their cause. Some say well Ralph Macchio didn't give an Oscar worthy performance. Well he didn't have to be Daniel Day Lewis in the film because he and Pat Morita had chemistry. Ralph was raw and natural and Pat's comedic timing and seriousness was on point every time. You cared about them. Billy Zabka and his croonies had personality you hated them and even cheered for Johnny at times Daniels mom Lucille had ridiculous personality even sensei was personable. I felt too much was rushed and an attempt to include nostalgia. Chan was decent in here but he and Jaden did not bond well at all nor did Jaden and his mother. This was not a role for Taraji Elise Neal would have been better. The girl was just thrown in for the sake of a cute girl and introduction to the bully which takes me to my final point..Character development It is hard to have cohesiveness and chemistry if your characters are poorly developed. Yes this is a Karate Kid remake and don't lie and say its not some of the exact same dialogue exact same scenarios changing the country and traininglearning tools does not make it a reimagining a re imagined film doesn't use anything pre existing. But how you can not build the characters is beyond me. Again Dre's mom was just in their for the sake of Dre having a mother. She did a lot of non sensible things. I mean where did she work for heavens sakes? We knew Lucille was working at the computer place and then the orient restaurant. She let him just do kung fu with Mr. Han without any knowledge of him. Han didn't fix a bike or anything. Lucille knew Miyagi he did a few things before befriending Daniel. Johnny the spoiled brat had great development Ali from the hills Sensei the Vietnam vet who was militant. Can you honestly tell me why the bully in this remake was the way he was and who in the hell was sensei what is his background? The story telling was simply awful everything was just plain rushed. So I am not going to bash this movie because of Jadens braids or his skin color or because of his rich daddy. I am recommending not to see this because its flat out boring. My 10 year old daughter finds joy in almost any film she fell asleep on this one we were at the drive in people where driving away. Oh and Jadens dialogue near the end before his absurd comeback sounded like he was tired of filming and just wanted to get the lines over with. Ralph may not be stellar but at least you cared about his character and the supporting cast. Remove the characters from this film and see what difference it makes. Meaning if you take out Ali from KK1 you will feel something is missing. Remove the chick from this one and any cause could replace her not saying she wasn't good at her role it just wasn't memorable or necessary.I'll put it like this when you walked away from the original KK and even to this day you don't call Pat Morita Pat Morita you see his photo and you say that's Mr. Miyagi you see Ralph you don't call him Ralph you call him Daniel san Their characters were believable. you walk from this and its Jaden and Jackie Chan. I hope JW Jerry Weintraub got paid good for this because this is beneath him. Poor character development poor story. The end".

Being a fan of the original that came out when i was a kid I'm a little biased but looking at it apart from the original series it still REALLY SUCKED. Of course one of the biggest fouls is they're labeling it the Karate Kid the Japanese martial art when in the movie Jaden Smith's character learns Kung Fu the Chinese martial art. Even for franchising purposes it's still pretty stupid. For me the movie painted several very unrealistic scenarios. The biggest one was the casting of Taraji P. Henson to play the role of Sherry. The whole movie she presents her character as a complete idiot who knows almost nothing about the world or her son and has somehow miraculously survived layoffs  firings to be transferred to the same job in Beijing. She portrays her character so poorly it makes the plot extremely unbelievable in that no one would ever move someone this dumb to what would presumably be a somewhat important position or any position for that matter half way across the world. Somehow they must be short of workers in China and need ours for some reason or another. Another unrealistic scenario was the portrayal of the Chinese students portraying than a group of Americanized thugs completely removed from their parents  their culture. I've been many places in the world but there's no other place on earth where respect  honor are held in such high regard and the extent of their actions are far beyond what you would even see here in the U.S. . Not only that but the script makes it seem like everyone in Beijing looks the other way when this kid is getting the crap beat out of him. It's really an insult to the Chinese culture on many levels. And are to believe that Jaden Smith's Character learned several months if not a years worth of Kung Fu  strength training in the matter of days only by hanging up a jacket on a mere peg? NO NO WAY!!! It's about as stupid as thinking you will learn a martial art from Diamond Dave The Redneck Ninja. I get they're trying to recycle the Wax on Wax off example from the Karate Kid 1 but this is just ridiculous. As for the acting of Jaden Smith his interaction with every cast member is flaky at best and so was his acting overall especially with his Chinese love interest which seemed more like two 10 year olds trying to carry out a teenage relationship. As a whole the script is downright terrible and the acting was extremely weak if not dreadful. Although it was entertaining enough and it's definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen you should save you money  look for something else.".

To begin what was the point in calling it Karate Kid it was kung Fu! Call it something else. The fighting also in the movie they are saying that you learn Kung Fu for yourself not to fight and clearly many of the scenes were about hurting someone. Bad form for a kids movie i can imgine the amount of kids watching it who think oh yeah I can flip my sister or brother over my head and they fall on their back and they will be fine. Really thought the violence was a little bit much in the original yes there were fight scenes but never to this nature. Plus mm why are the kids so young in it found that really odd a little sad. Wills son too not the correct role for him at all he just comes across as annoying and cocky. What was with the wall of China also they just tried to do too much with such a simple and perfect movie to begin with in the first place. Lots of silly mistakes in the movie too where does Dre school bag go too when he throws the bucket of skunk over the bullies head and how did he get a new change of clothes when going to the puppet show I have more but I will say nought. The end was just the icing on the cake first why would a tournament be held where all the kids are different ages some of them were toddlers then if the moves the badies done were real then they would have been disqualified the stupid kick not even possible for a human to do it and the silly eye thing I think thats when I nearly cried in pain... If companies are so made into their remakes why not just rerelease the older version of the movies get a lot more for them".

Bad form for a kids movie i can imgine the amount of kids watching it who think oh yeah I can flip my sister or brother over my head and they fall on their back and they will be fine. Really thought the violence was a little bit much in the original yes there were fight scenes but never to this nature. Plus mm why are the kids so young in it found that really odd a little sad. Wills son too not the correct role for him at all he just comes across as annoying and cocky. What was with the wall of China also they just tried to do too much with such a simple and perfect movie to begin with in the first place. Lots of silly mistakes in the movie too where does Dre school bag go too when he throws the bucket of skunk over the bullies head and how did he get a new change of clothes when going to the puppet show I have more but I will say nought. The end was just the icing on the cake first why would a tournament be held where all the kids are different ages some of them were toddlers then if the moves the badies done were real then they would have been disqualified the stupid kick not even possible for a human to do it and the silly eye thing I think thats when I nearly cried in pain... If companies are so made into their remakes why not just rerelease the older version of the movies get a lot more for them";

	schema:headline " This is how to do a remake";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie more so than any film this year has had the most noise generated. Mostly from people ignorant of the film and just exactly how good or bad it is. The discussion has been centered on why call it The Karate Kid if he is learning Kung Fu. It is easy the name is recognition and Kung Fu Kid sounds like a ripoff not a remake and this is a remake and they are not hiding the fact. Enough said explanation done go back to your bowl of cereal.This film takes what was done in the original film and has nicely upgraded across the board. First we have more of a threat from the kid doing the bullying this time around rather than a caricature. The motherson dynamic is stronger and given much more screen time. The romance is more playful and innocent with the friendship aspect ultimately being the plot focus. The studentteacher dynamic has an even stronger fatherson underlying tone and finally the action is much much improved upon.All of the above is due to excellent performances across the board. Jaden Smith shows to be a more than capable actor in the making and with no doubt observation of Chan who we FINALLY get to see in a dramatic role rather than actioncomedy role. Smith and Chan have a fun chemistry that helps make the film enjoyable.I was afraid through the ads that Smith's abilities would be over the top great but through an excellent training montage and philosophical lessons we buy that this kid is as good as he is in the tournament.A standout moment for me was the final bonding scene between Chan and Smith. It is during a moment reminiscent of the original film's scene where Daniel finds out about Mr. Miagi's family. Here we have a similar scene but it is what happens after it that establishes their relationship and seals the audiences relationship to these two characters. Excellent excellent scene.One other standout moment is the climax where they do a great job of ending the movie on a pitch perfect note. I had heard of audiences literally standing up and cheering but I figured that was embellished. That is until the very same thing happened at the showing I caught this afternoon. You literally do want to stand up and cheer. They also take the moment a step further than the original did and provided an close to the lesson that Jackie's Mr Han was teaching Smith's Dre. It became a full circle lesson and really helped the movie have an even more satisfying end.The extended scenes of life in China really help to ground this film in the philosophical realm even more so than the original. There is a richness and texture to everything that takes place against the backdrop of China. It has an even more fish out of water feel that lends to the believability and desperation of Smith's character. We also have a lot more character building time spent in this film that gives it about 13 more minutes run time than the original but those extra moments really pay off in a big way. As I mentioned previously we get more of Dre and his mom. They don't just show up and then she gets thrown into a few scenes like in the original. She is an important part of Dre's life and it is shown. The one thing I noticed the most about this film was the amount of families that attended it. I think it is the first film of the year where adults and kids can go and enjoy a film together and both come out with the same emotions and lessons learned. That would be a reflection of the film itself as it shows Mr Han learning from his student something that gives the film a welcome twist when compared to the original.Those that have prejudged this film or gotten caught up in the name game really need to see the film before they make any judgments. This film is a VERY welcome surprise and more than holds it own against the original. It stays loyal to the lessons and relationships of the original film and brings them forward 25 years later.".

Secondly while I'm also a big fan of Jackie Chan he only had 1 fight scene with a bunch of kids and that lacked his usual comedic and well choreographed fight sequences. Its either his age has finally caught up with him or the kids just didn't have enough training.The next problem with the movie is Jaden Smith was just not suitable for this role. Although he showed promise as an actor with a bright future He lacked the strength and the skills to be the Karate Kid. I know Ralph Macchio wasn't exactly muscular either but at least he was not as tiny and fragile looking as Jaden.Lastly I could not quite see the chemistry between Jackie and Jaden that everyone was raving about throughout the first half of the film it just looked like a dirty old man plotting something sinister on that innocent little new kid in a foreign country.".

I really hate it when stories explain directly what is painfully obvious or try to insert it in unrealistic and absurd ways.Jacket on and Jacket off is no wax on wax off. At least in the original film Daniel thought he was being put to work here it's just outright bizarre. Jaden's character seems to be oblivious of the obvious and unquestioning of the ridiculous.Ralph Macchio's performance was far more believable. Jaden Smith goes way to far way too quick from wimp to kung fu champion. The exaggeration and elaborate fight scenes really removed me from a sense of realism that its predecessor had.I found the mother character to be at odds with this move. I would have preferred if her role was downplayed. She was ultimately lacking chemistry with Jaden and not an interesting character mostly annoying.Just a quick comparison with Pat Morita and Jacky Chan. Chan is flash with Chinese superstition. Pat was subtle with universal wisdom and was far more endearing.There is just far too much mundane filler it really slows the movie down and in conclusion when this movie wasn't extremely bizarre I found it to be more flash than substance.".

But then again I am a male and the two girls I went with loved it but they also liked The Last Airbender and the Twilight series.The soundtrack was awful. The soundtrack of a movie is a MAJOR part of it since music can bring out emotions in you but it didn't.The relationship between Jaden Smith and Wenwen Han was completely unrealistic. For example do any of you remember Padme and Anakin's relationship in Episode II? It was worse than that. I made me LAUGH how pathetic it was. Jaden My mom says that if you stand while eating it gives you gas! Wenwen HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Pathetic right?This is what made me laugh though. Jackie Chan made Jaden take his jacket on off and hang it up take it off drop it and repeat. In my mind I was thinking You've got to be kidding me.

Not many remakes shine better than the originals and this one is no different except that it does much to make the original look like a super nova.";

Columbia pictures has taken a great beloved film and recycled it for cheap profit.The original Karate Kid film is a beloved gem for several reasons. Pat Morita a beloved character actor and a fine man was given the chance to be the star of a movie and he delivered beyond anyone's wildest dreams. The relationship between Morita and Ralph Macchio's Daniel was touching and perfectly done.Part of what made the original movie work is that it was about class differences. You really believed that Daniel was a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks who was struggling to fit in at a new school. And you believed in the awkward puppy love with rich girl Elizabeth Shue. With Jaden Smith the son of a multimillionaire actor you don't believe in for a millisecond. This kid has never had to struggle for anything in his life. The entire emotional premise of the film doesn't work at all.Everything that is any good in this disgusting Jaden SmithJackie Chan remake is lifted out of the original film. There is nothing redeeming about it beyond that. Jaden Smith can't act he can't emote and you don't believe him for a second. Beyond that he's too young and too small to play the role. You simply don't believe for a moment that he could actually beat these other kids in a tournament. It's ridiculous. The scene where Jackie Chan breaks down crying has to be one of the worstacted horrible dramatic moments ever put to film. Like the remake of Willy Wonka The new Karate Kid movie is an instance of Hollywood cannibalizing its own best work for short term profit. There were dozens of original creative magical new stories that were turned down so that this movie could be made. We are all the poorer for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Over the years I have taken a lot of grief from friends for making The Karate Kid the 1984 movie directed by Rocky Oscar winner John G. Avildsen one of my five favorite movies of all time. So it was with apprehension and low expectations that I went to see the remake.Wow what a magnificent job of recreating the first film while modernizing it setting it in China and bringing all the tension manlove and depth back to the big screen. This time Dutch director Harald Zwart added wonderful scenic views of China and lost a bit of the sometimescheesy dialog. But to his credit he kept a great deal of the original plot intact. Mom is transferred to Beijing and takes her son with her without much worrying about his feelings. Dre immediately finds trouble as the American outsider who befriends the beautiful Chinese girl. There is the evil sensei of the trainedtomaim thugs who rule the school that our hero Dre Parker Jaden Smith has been thrown into. The bad kids target him and he gets the heck beat out of him.To the rescue comes the maintenance guy in the apartment building in which he lives. Played by Jackie Chan Mr. Han isn't quite as sage as Mr. Miyagi but he uses almost the same technique not exactly waxonwaxoff paintthefence and sandthefloor but close. His personal secret remains essentially intact too which when discovered by Dre motivates him to work harder. The role of Dre's mom played here by Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is beefed up from the part that Randee Heller played in the original. The young girl Meiying Wanwan Han in her first role looks vaguely like Tamlyn Tomita who played the love interest in The Karate Kid Part 2. The rest of the film plays close to the original as well but I won't tell you if he wins as Daniel LaRusso did in the original or loses as Rocky did.Jaden Smith proves that he may be a force in the business for a long time. His parents of course are Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith and they have created a natural. That was evident in The Pursuit of Happiness. Hand it to the kid he worked really hard to learn kung fu it's not karate. And while I preferred Ralph Macchio because he was so raw and not talented as an actor Jaden Smith knows the camera is always there which I think he will grow out of over time. Jackie Chan is really quite good here shedding the recent tongueincheek comedy roles. This part fits him perfectly and Morita would have been proud had he lived to see it.After my disappointments with so many other remakes I was pleasantly surprised. The director and cast clearly found the balance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not see this movie when it first came out in the theaters. I had watched the previews during How to train a dragon and I thought to myself... wow... pretty insulting to the original Karate Kid. Then I started to read some reviews saying that it was not that bad and that Smith was brilliant as the Karate Kid. So I found myself at the Naval base in San Diego where we have a free movie theater and it happened that they were showing The Karate Kid so I decided to go and check it out... after all I didn't have to pay for it right? Anyway since the movie started it began to look like it was going in the wrong direction. I could pretty much tell what the next line was having watch the original Karate Kid thousands of times. I got the feeling that the writers of this movie got really really lazy and just decide to grab the old script tweek a thing or two here and there and throw some Chinese dialogs in there to make it look more authentic. To begin with Jackie Chan's rendition of Mr. Miyagi was pitiful. Even Pat Morita was funnier than Chan was in this movie. Then the whole single mother moving the kid to work at her new job... I don't know it just seemed too obvious. What about the scene of Jackie Chan drunk in the car remembering his family's death? I guess now a days they couldn't have him offering Smith a drink of alcohol right? Then the whole don't hang out with my daughter cause we are different.. really? I am not even going to get into the training parts... too easy. What was the straw that broke the camel's back was the whole tournament sequence... OMG! They just took the script from the original movie translate the villain parts to Chinese and BAM! ready to go! No no no.... shame shame!.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps it is a strong sense of nostalgia that invokes a real sense of happiness when i hear the name The Karate Kid it is a film from my youth that i will cherish fond memories of forever. However after sitting through the abomination that is the 2010 version of this movie i am extremely irked. The film that taught so many of us about a culture and martial art that was relatively unknown at the time has been sullied and urinated on from a great height.To call a film the Karate kid when it has absolutely nothing to do about karate is just in my opinion a vein attempt to invoke a connection to the original. The film now set in China yes the original was set in America but the premise was an elderly Japanese man teaching a youth about his culture martial art and becoming the father figure he needed and focusing on the martial art of Kung Fu is so far removed from the original they may have well just given it a new name and made it into a new film although i suppose The Kung Fu Kid doesn't have quite the same ring to it.The film is 2 hours and 20 minutes of feeling a little ashamed at yourself for wishing harm to children which is pretty much all it is for that ridiculously long run time kids beating up kids. It takes all of about 15 minutes before Jaden Smith gets his arse handed to him by a Chinese kid but of course Chinese kids beating up an AfricanAmerican child is so much more P.C than white kids picking on a white kid right? Oh and we do get the rip off of it being a Kung Fu tourament now wouldn't want to make it a original at all would we America? They didn't even attempt to make this its own movie other than changing the scenery and lowering the age limit for getting a whoopin' it even starts the same Mom gets a transfer so our young protagonist must uproot himself and move to a new city and make new friends and find his new love interest even though the kids are far too young for love interests we are given the sickeningly sweet moment where young Jaden Smith gets his first kiss aww... yuck! The ONLY saving grace to this movie is Jackie Chan who although does not give off his usual performance still gives off his usual charm that we all know and love... but unless you are a DIE HARD Jackie Chan fan just avoid this movie. Forget it exists because i wish i could erase the last two and a half hours of my life. My Vote this gets a below average score of 310. The film actually could have been good if they did things a little different. I know they wanted to make it its own movie which is why it is so far removed from its far superior original But in doing so they have just made it even more obvious that it is something it will never be... A time tested classic gem from our generation.Do yourself a favor go out buy yourself the rereleased digitally remastered box set get some popcorn on the go and have yourself a good old fashioned good night in with one of the greatest movies of my generation.".

Today's remakes have little to do with the original inspirations behind the films. The original Karate Kid was a coming of age movie which had Karate as a means to set the characters in motion. The casting was brilliant Morita was the old unassuming teacher that imparted more than just how to block with his famous wax onwax off lesson. Macchio was the perfect teen counterpart  he was every teen not one with super human or special effects induced skills. The original focused on development of the movie characters not the action  and it is the simple basics of Macchio's Karate that made his character work and be strong against the more highly skilled Cobra Kai team.I can buy into the current movie's location in China. With a child as the protagonist it no longer is a coming of age film. And while Chan is a great action actor he is not the aged all knowing teacher like Morita. The current movie focuses on action  to begin cultivating Smith's kid into the next action hero incarnation. This completely misses the point of a remake! Really there is no need to use the Karate Kid title!Lastly the shift to Chan teaching Smith Kung Fu is just annoyingly inconsistent with the movie title although that will likely be lost on the masses. Karate is from Japan Kung Fu is from China. Although they share roots they are different. I think to have Smith learn Karate would have been an ingenious story line given the China location contrasting the martial arts and the cultures and ultimately showing the similar underlying goals of each form. Ah but that would mean the movie needed more than just action to make it work something lacking in most scripts today and something the director just does not get.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been a decade since the last MIB film was released. We kind of missed the series even though Men In Black 2 wasn't really that good. In this sequel it's pretty small and unnecessary but it still has the charms and bright imagination. Great Performances and Solid Visuals. It also has the same tone of the original Men In Black films. It's a wonderful action adventure movie with nonstop enjoyment.Thankfully it does not follow the modern blockbuster roots and stay loyal to its own. By the way this is a comical action film. It may not be a large one but what matters here is the fun characters. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones still got it but who shines here is Josh Brolin. He can perfectly imitate the facial expression and voice of Agent K and it's a lot better when he's around.The plot sounds like a generic time traveling story but there are imaginative and wonderful sequences in these. The humor is still clever. There is still a heart. The action is not quite appealing but the time jump scene was spectacular. A lot of people will be rooting for the design of the villain Boris the Animal. At first glance you might think it's creepy but you'll realize how awesome he actually looks.Blockbusters like this are now obsolete. Our usual modern blockbusters are generic and bland cookiecutters that are easy to be forgotten. This actually stays to its own kind. It's comical it has life it cares to the characters no matter how small and absurd the story is. Yes it's small but there are so many merits that are worth seeing. Either you're a fan of the series or not you'll find it very enjoyable. The Men in Black series is still imaginative and fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not exactly a Will Smith fan. I think the last Will Smith film I watched and liked was the first Men in Black film back in 1997. I was surprised to learn that there will be another installment of Men in Black this year the third of the series. The second MiB was shown in 2002 and I did not even care to finish that one. Will the ten years between the last episode and this one make a difference? I needed to see that.In this film a vicious alien villain known as Boris the Animal escapes from his prison on the moon where he had been locked up since being arrested by Agent K Tommy Lee Jones back in 1969. One day Agent K disappears from the present day. His partner Agent J Will Smith realizes that K had been assassinated by Boris forty years ago which caused a major change of events allowing Boris' alien race to overrun the Earth. J had to find a way to travel back in time to 1969 in order to save K and rectify the tragic consequences of his death. Can J save K and in turn save the Earth from the clutches of Boris?The odd couple was just as they were before in the first films. Will Smith is still his old loudmouth Agent J as Tommy Lee Jones was his tightlipped Agent K. As J goes back to the past he will interact with the young 29year old K perfectly played by Josh Brolin. Brolin amazingly captures the laconic persona and even the distinct voice of Jones so well that they seemed to have been one and the same actor. It was also good to see Emma Thompson again in a major film as she portrayed Agent O another senior agent with a soft spot for K. The younger Agent O was played by a cutie named Alice Eve but she certainly did not convince us that she would look or act like Emma Thompson when she grows older.I must say that this film was really a most entertaining one. Well maybe more for me than for my kids. Younger audiences may find the jokes about 1969 cultural references such as the hippies the racial tension etc. to be a bit difficult to grasp. But the fun action sequences with some exciting futuristic vehicles and weaponry the imaginative and repulsive aliens made by no less than the master monstermaker Rick Baker the thrilling integration of the historic Apollo 11 liftoff and the touching revelation of K's big secret made this a very good and enjoyable movie to watch. 3D did not seem necessary. Director Barry Sonnenfeld got it right this time and this segment certainly gave perfect closure to the story arc of the whole series.".

	schema:reviewBody "A decade away from the movie scene has given the Men In Black series a chance at a fresher newer perspective. Taking its cue from Shrek Forever After MIB 3 takes on a tired concept time travel in this case if only to acknowledge the failure of its dull sequel and take us back to a different era allowing us to view the franchise from an unsullied angle. The result is a film that returns to its roots and gives audiences the chance to relive much of what they first enjoyed  a smart scifi buddy comedy that embraces everything weird and wonderful about the unknown universe.In his first cinematic role in nearly 4 years Will Smith's Agent J is the usual charming witty wiseass we expect him to be. Still teamed up with the laconic Agent K wrinkly Tommy Lee Jones he is no closer to cracking his older partners deadpan demeanour but their relationship issues take a back seat when a nemesis from Kay's past Boris the animal turns up to exact revenge for having been imprisoned on the moon 40 years ago. His elaborate plan takes him back in the past to the day he was caught and sets ripples in the present where K no longer exists and a different reality results. J has to then literally time jump off the Empire State building no less and fix the past for normalcy to return in the present.Directly Barry Sonnenfeld seems to find his groove once again with the zany and icky shenanigans that put him on the map with the original. Using plenty of the wide angle camera work that gave him fame as the Coen's favourite lenser the resulting imagery should work wonders for those who decide to pay extra and catch the film on 3D converted. Boris the animal is also a return to series villains being screwball and menacing in equal measure remember Vincent D'Onofrio? and Rick Baker's excellent makeup effects are both incredible and revolting. The big surprise is how well Josh Brolin impersonates Jones in the role of a younger K  which should not be a surprise considering Brolin's recent impressive body of work as a bonafide actor most notably in W. So chameleonlike is his performance that you forget it's him and actually completely believe it's just a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones that you're seeing.The films primary achievement and a true signal of its return to form though are the scenes set in the past. Not only is Josh Brolin a deadringer for Tommy Lee's K during his youth but the hip musical vibes of the late 60'searly 70's allow for plenty of playfulness to ensue with a particularly hilarious segment devoted to Andy Warhol. If that isn't enough everything very neatly ties into another epochal scientific moment from that time period and ends on a moment of curiously satisfying emotionality that provides not only closure to the film but the series as a whole. If that doesn't make you forgive all the wrongs that the sequel did and embrace this film as one of the years better movie franchise offerings the only thing that might work on you is a neuralizer.".

Quick action colorful villains beautifully designed settings and CGI comic relief in the face of imminent destruction all those made the first two movies great as well as successful in the box office. Could they better the formula in the face of all the other bad sequels we have been seeing for years? This is one of the reasons I had stepped into the cinema with trepidation. Good grief was it 1997 when I saw the first and ten years ago the second? How time flies. The other reason was the pitfall of time travel.Time travel is one of the favorite themes in sci fi movies but it needs to be handled carefully. My humble word of advice to the script writers KeepItSimple. Avoid overtly complicated jumps back and forth and paradoxes that confuse the audience. Remember the eventual mess in the Back To The Future trilogy? I was then so pleased to see that they kept the time travel relatively simple and easy to follow. There was a small part when they crossed the line juuust a tiny bit when young agent Kay meets a certain father and son don't want to spoil it. Even if traveling back in time was possible you wouldn't necessarily bump into everyone you know in the present.Will Smith is in his usual good form in his character Jay which however needs Kay to balance him. It is then fortunate that Brolin gives a great performance as the young agent.Was it better than the 1997original? It was as good without the novelty value obviously. Was it as good as the MIB2? I would say that it surpassed the second.".

I have to say that this film was much better than the last film which was really just a regurgitation of the first one. This film had a lot more substance and managed to tie up some loose ends which I really appreciated. I think that this film works in 3D because there is a lot of falling through time which my niece and nephew loved. I have to give major props to Josh Brolin younger Agent K who had the daunting task of portraying an actor portraying a role. Tommy Lee Jones old Agent K just basically had to be himself smile. Josh was totally convincing and did an excellent job imitating Tommy's persona. I liked the introduction of Agent O Emma Thompson who had one of the funniest scenes in the film and literally had me laughing out loud. I also liked the fact that a women was in charge of such a prestigious agency. As usual Will Smith Agent J came up with very comical explanations of the weird situations that occur during the film. I think that my favorite character in the film is Griffin Michael Stuhlbarg. He was a psychic who could see into the various futures that could occur if certain things happen. I was a little confused at first but as the film progressed I finally got it. I related to this character because I have always believed that you always have at least two doors to open e.g. you can pick up that piece of paper or not and whatever you decide to do affects everything else. Okay enough of philosophy class and back to the film. The one thing about all the Men in Black films is all of the different characters that the visual effect crew create. You have to appreciate the imagination of those folks. I also like to check out the aliens that they are monitoring at the agency for example in the first one they were monitoring Michael Jackson and Agent J's elementary school teacher. Appropriately in this film you get flashes of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber appropriately. I wonder if they have to agree to that? Anyway this was a very entertaining film and you will be glad that you saw it in 3D. I give this film an outofthisworld green light. Enjoy!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Well whaddaya know the MiB have gone MiA for 10 years already! No wonder many of us have forgotten about them as Men In Cape and Bodysuits aka The Avengers Batman SpiderMan et al have been hogging the cinemas while the Men In Black go missinginaction. No matter they are still a barrel of fun in this threequel that comes as more of a surprise than a treat that we have been waiting for.And with Barry Sonnenfeld back at the helm of this troubled and delayed US215million production it is a nostalgic film in more ways than one.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as agents J and K of the secret Men in Black organization that monitors alien activity on Earth. The 'oddcouple' have their work cut out for them when extraterrestrial serial killer Boris the Animal Jemaine Clement escapes from his maximum security prison on the moon and travels back in time to kill K. Since only J remembers K's existence it's up to him to venture through time look for a young K now played by Josh Brolin and stop Boris from destroying the world once and for all.I have never been a fan of timetravel plots and I still don't like them. However the timetravel subplot here is just to provide the Back To The Future fantasy to the MiB franchise. The narrative as well as the mood and tone of the movie are lighthearted fun and always on the outer limits of credibility. Again it is nice to see how a deadpan face like Jones' can generate so much mirth. The Smith  Jones pairing is augmented by Brolin who gives a good representation of how K would be in the Sixties with most of the sequences accompanied by popular Sixties hits on the soundtrack.One of the staple jokes of the MiB series is the celebrity cameos that suggest alien origins. In MiB3 we have a 'twist' that suggests a certain pop art personality is an undercover MiB agent! Still the mainstay of the MiB series is Rick Baker's creature designs and makeup rendered in 3D. The 'monster show' does not disappoint especially that of a huge fish that attacks diners at a Chinese restaurant. Oh yes there are also a couple of cool gadgets and vehicles like the giant wheel hooverbikes used by Agents J and K. On the whole Agents J and K still provide the 'L'.  limchangmoh.blogspot.com".

No matter they are still a barrel of fun in this threequel that comes as more of a surprise than a treat that we have been waiting for.And with Barry Sonnenfeld back at the helm of this troubled and delayed US215million production it is a nostalgic film in more ways than one.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as agents J and K of the secret Men in Black organization that monitors alien activity on Earth. The 'oddcouple' have their work cut out for them when extraterrestrial serial killer Boris the Animal Jemaine Clement escapes from his maximum security prison on the moon and travels back in time to kill K. Since only J remembers K's existence it's up to him to venture through time look for a young K now played by Josh Brolin and stop Boris from destroying the world once and for all.I have never been a fan of timetravel plots and I still don't like them. However the timetravel subplot here is just to provide the Back To The Future fantasy to the MiB franchise. The narrative as well as the mood and tone of the movie are lighthearted fun and always on the outer limits of credibility. Again it is nice to see how a deadpan face like Jones' can generate so much mirth. The Smith  Jones pairing is augmented by Brolin who gives a good representation of how K would be in the Sixties with most of the sequences accompanied by popular Sixties hits on the soundtrack.One of the staple jokes of the MiB series is the celebrity cameos that suggest alien origins. In MiB3 we have a 'twist' that suggests a certain pop art personality is an undercover MiB agent! Still the mainstay of the MiB series is Rick Baker's creature designs and makeup rendered in 3D. The 'monster show' does not disappoint especially that of a huge fish that attacks diners at a Chinese restaurant. Oh yes there are also a couple of cool gadgets and vehicles like the giant wheel hooverbikes used by Agents J and K. On the whole Agents J and K still provide the 'L'.  limchangmoh.blogspot.com";

Special effects are realistic and the scene involving a very tall building made me so nervous that my palms perspired a lot! The ending is very touching I certainly did not see it coming even though a friend guessed it.I think it is great that Men in Black III manages to combine emotional elements in the middle of mainstream blockbuster entertainment.

When MIBII was finally out in 2002 I wondered why it took so long as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith seemed to work so well together and their characters had that just right mix of complementing but contradicting personalities.Jones has long been a favorite of mine with some other highlight performances being the delightfully crazy villain in Under Siege 1992 and the hard nosed cop in The Fugitive 1993 and U.S. Marshalls 1998. His ability to make a facial expression the equivalent of the picture's 1000 words imho is up there with Humphrey Bogart.Smith has distinguished himself in action comedy and drama films alike. He is a quite versatile actor whose movies I will gladly check out just because he is starring.With MIB 3 coming another 10 years after MIB II I once again wonder what took so long. While Jones's part as K is not so prominent as in the prior releases he does well as the present day character. Smith follows the formula as J although the interaction with old K is a tad forced.The pleasant realization is that Josh Brolin performs admirably as the past younger K. Brolin is certainly a fine actor in his own right but his effective portrayal of Jones' character is nothing short of remarkable. The key to the plot is that Brolin is K before whatever happened that turned K into such a detached curmudgeon.Also juicy was the villain's part done by Jermaine Clement as Boris the animal.Besides all the action and suspense you expect with the good guys vs. bad guy alien stuff and the touches of comedy here and there to break it up there is a dramatic and quite poignant and touching twist that comes out of nowhere that answers why K appears to be such an unemotional person and why K has such regard for J.

It was OK. I wanted to love it but I honestly only barely liked it. It was lacking the things that made the franchise 'cool.' There was no talking pug no funny pawn shop guy no real interesting or funny aliens at all. The lead badguy alien was a somewhat interesting character but no real personality. Nothing that made you want more of him. And other than him there was hardly any other aliens in it. One little stint in a Chinese restaurant but nothing rememorable. No funny ones. I just don't understand not making more characters like the ones that made the first such a hit. And even Wil Smith wasn't funny. He was funnier during his promotions on talk shows than in his movie. He just seemed to walk through the whole thing.ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to see it in 3D. None.I hate to say it  But the special effects were awful. With technology today most special effects are seamless. As an audience we now 'expect' good effects. Half the time it was very obvious when they were using backdrops and green screens and had superimposed stuff. That's just a dealbreaker in today's moviegoing world.

They seemed to run out of things to say so simply rehashed the old the talking pug universes inside train stations regrowing alien heads and a storyline stolen from Jewel in the Nile.

We still have aliens and their everresilient heads in there but there was a genuine attempt to move things to a fresher place. The time travel storyline should have been brilliant this was when spacealien mania took off the birthplace of nutty conspiracy theories combined with swinging sixties free loving trippy hippy bring your own bong culture Get Smart gadgets and a man trying to save the world while being black!

You do a little here but I think in many ways that is because the storyline is too simple. It makes no real attempt to address or in the style of MIB exploit and poke fun at the inherent issues such as the grandfather paradox that inevitably come up with time travel so that you feel as though you must have missed something.That in the end is what ruins this film. They have tried so hard to avoid the obvious the clich the previous tricks of the franchise that they have left themselves with nothing but holes. The beauty of MIB was not that it avoided clichs but how it played with them tweaking our expectations in tiny but deliciously original ways. Without them we are simply left without.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Men In Black III";
	schema:reviewBody "It was 1997 when Men in Black first burst onto the big screen featuring a successful pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as unlikely partners in the protection of Earth against the scum of the universe with action special effects and generous doses of comedy rolled into one. Directed by Barry Sonnenfield they returned five years later for a sequel and chances for a third film got hovered around for the longest time finally taking up to a decade before it materialized taking advantage of the needless 3D format to deliver the latest installment of the popular series.And it's still a lot of fun with the return of Agent Jay Will Smith and Kay Tommy Lee Jones in a new adventure set around the break out of the villainous alien Boris the Animal Jemaine Clement from a lunar maximum prison to take revenge on Kay for the severing of an arm and its imprisonment not to mention also wiping out its compatriots and protecting the Earth from annihilation. Yes Kay is credited for plenty of work done back in his heydays of the 60s and we're about to find out a lot more about his deadpan character which is almost always the punching bag for Jay who makes it his mission to reverse what Boris had set out to do which is to travel back in time and taking out Kay.It's MIB meets Back to the Future with its time travelling element back to the 60s armed with only limited knowledge of his partner's whereabouts no thanks to information being classified over and above Jay's pay grade despite 14 years of dedicated service. The story by Ethan Cohen David Koepp Jeff Nathanson and Michael Soccio proved to be a winner steering clear of having too many cooks with potential of spoiling the broth making that time travel bit pretty much a trip down nostalgic lane filled with incidents and prominent characters from history such as Andy Warhol Bill Hader and the Apollo 11 crew and the tongue in cheek treatment with aliens being very much leaping from typical 60s television and films.This makes up more than its share of laughs and inside jokes that continue in the same spirit from the earlier films even poking fun at the racial divide of the time which provided a fair challenge for Jay as he meets up with the younger Kay Josh Brolin who has to be convinced that his new found friend is his partner from the future and have to work together to rein in the 1969 version of Boris the Animal. Tommy Lee Jones made way for Josh Brolin to own the character of Jay and in truth Brolin does a remarkable job of closely mimicking Jones aptly adding a lot more to the back story of the legendary MIB who has his fair share of one liners but being a little bit less stern than Jay had grown accustomed to.Characterization also got pushed to the forefront with a deeper exploration into each of Jay and Kay's characters backgrounds and their friendship and this helped the film tremendously instead of being a mediocre effort relying solely on the actors charisma and washing everything down in CG glory. There are still some surprises from the effects kept under wraps from the trailers so that's a good thing and I suppose much of the graphics work went into recreating 60s USA as well as earlier more cumbersome versions of tools of the trade that MIB uses back then. Alien designs also got a spruce up looking far more menacing and disgusting even with Boris the Animal possessing and using deadly force that I'm rather surprised at for a PG rated film.Will Smith shows that he hasn't lost his edge and still has what it takes even after being absent from the big screen for some 4 years now Seven Pounds and Hancock were his last outing in 2008 and still comes off as a natural and likable as Agent Jay with a lot more polish as an MIB veteran as compared to when he got first recruited. Tommy Lee Jones got only a supporting role this time round with Josh Brolin left responsible to carry the role of the younger K for the most parts of the film. The SmithBrolin pairing was also a winner though likely to be one off only for this movie but you can guess how any sequel made after this could go  either to continue with SmithJones in the current timeline or having Brolin helm his own partnering another Agent in adventures set in the past. And joining the cast in prominent though limited roles include the likes of Emma Thompson as Agent O taking over as the new MIB Chief with the passing of Zed Alice Eve playing the younger O and both Michael Stuhlbarg and Mike Colter adding depth to the MIB mythos.Still with every time travel movie there are paradoxes that have to be consciously ignored for everything to work. While some aspects work in having being explained away others necessary and crucial to the plot become glaringly obvious especially in the finale where it showed some shades of similarity from A Chinese Odyssey. But all is forgiven for something canonical to be added to the adventures of the MIB providing audiences with new appreciation for the leading MIBs Jay and Kay rather than to rely on louder and bigger explosions for the sake of keeping up with the summer Joneses. MIB3 is a clear winner and worthy of what the previous two films had already set up. Highly recommended!".

	onyx:emotionText "It was 1997 when Men in Black first burst onto the big screen featuring a successful pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as unlikely partners in the protection of Earth against the scum of the universe with action special effects and generous doses of comedy rolled into one. Directed by Barry Sonnenfield they returned five years later for a sequel and chances for a third film got hovered around for the longest time finally taking up to a decade before it materialized taking advantage of the needless 3D format to deliver the latest installment of the popular series.And it's still a lot of fun with the return of Agent Jay Will Smith and Kay Tommy Lee Jones in a new adventure set around the break out of the villainous alien Boris the Animal Jemaine Clement from a lunar maximum prison to take revenge on Kay for the severing of an arm and its imprisonment not to mention also wiping out its compatriots and protecting the Earth from annihilation. Yes Kay is credited for plenty of work done back in his heydays of the 60s and we're about to find out a lot more about his deadpan character which is almost always the punching bag for Jay who makes it his mission to reverse what Boris had set out to do which is to travel back in time and taking out Kay.It's MIB meets Back to the Future with its time travelling element back to the 60s armed with only limited knowledge of his partner's whereabouts no thanks to information being classified over and above Jay's pay grade despite 14 years of dedicated service. The story by Ethan Cohen David Koepp Jeff Nathanson and Michael Soccio proved to be a winner steering clear of having too many cooks with potential of spoiling the broth making that time travel bit pretty much a trip down nostalgic lane filled with incidents and prominent characters from history such as Andy Warhol Bill Hader and the Apollo 11 crew and the tongue in cheek treatment with aliens being very much leaping from typical 60s television and films.This makes up more than its share of laughs and inside jokes that continue in the same spirit from the earlier films even poking fun at the racial divide of the time which provided a fair challenge for Jay as he meets up with the younger Kay Josh Brolin who has to be convinced that his new found friend is his partner from the future and have to work together to rein in the 1969 version of Boris the Animal. Tommy Lee Jones made way for Josh Brolin to own the character of Jay and in truth Brolin does a remarkable job of closely mimicking Jones aptly adding a lot more to the back story of the legendary MIB who has his fair share of one liners but being a little bit less stern than Jay had grown accustomed to.Characterization also got pushed to the forefront with a deeper exploration into each of Jay and Kay's characters backgrounds and their friendship and this helped the film tremendously instead of being a mediocre effort relying solely on the actors charisma and washing everything down in CG glory. There are still some surprises from the effects kept under wraps from the trailers so that's a good thing and I suppose much of the graphics work went into recreating 60s USA as well as earlier more cumbersome versions of tools of the trade that MIB uses back then. Alien designs also got a spruce up looking far more menacing and disgusting even with Boris the Animal possessing and using deadly force that I'm rather surprised at for a PG rated film.Will Smith shows that he hasn't lost his edge and still has what it takes even after being absent from the big screen for some 4 years now Seven Pounds and Hancock were his last outing in 2008 and still comes off as a natural and likable as Agent Jay with a lot more polish as an MIB veteran as compared to when he got first recruited. Tommy Lee Jones got only a supporting role this time round with Josh Brolin left responsible to carry the role of the younger K for the most parts of the film. The SmithBrolin pairing was also a winner though likely to be one off only for this movie but you can guess how any sequel made after this could go  either to continue with SmithJones in the current timeline or having Brolin helm his own partnering another Agent in adventures set in the past.

Emma Thompson will play takecharge MIB operative Agent Oh who is monitoring a prison breakout.The first of the Men In Black franchise was a great movie. It was highly successful and from that spawned a Men In Black dance a no. 1 hit single from the soundtrack loads of toys and a cartoon series. The second film was awful truly awful beyond terrible and instantly forgettable. This latest instalment is somewhere between the 1st and the 2nd film. To be honest it wasn't great at all! Let me get straight into it this.Performances apart from one measure up from terrible to very good. Smith reprises his role as Agent J and is as funny and charismatic as he's always been. Tommy Lee Jones has a small part to play in this but he's an actor who can say one line throughout an entire film and still show more presence than most of the cast members. Emma Thompson throws in her 10 pence worth and does OK but it's Josh Brolin who is very good playing the younger version of Agent K. Most people will agree that Brolin is a highly rated actor who has played a myriad of characters in his career. An almost uncanny performance from Brolin as well as the talented Michael Stuhlbarg A Serious Man who plays alien Griffin are the standouts in this film. Everyone else does what they're supposed to do and they are where they're meant to be I suppose.Set pieces are boring and nothing special. The actual story itself isn't that bad but the whole thing feels rushed. The main villain Boris The Animal played by Jermaine Clement from Flight of the Concords fame belongs in the category of one of the worst villains ever to grace the screen. Just rubbish  nothing special about that him at all. I think only Lara Flynn Boyle in the second movie faired better with Vincent D'Onofrio being the best of a bad bunch. Actually D'Onofrio was awesome in the first film.I think I fell asleep for about five minutes or five seconds. I don't know Men In Black 3 is just average. It didn't grab me like the first film did and I was really hoping that this would. There's nothing else to say but just don't make a 4th film Mr Sonnefield. A real let down and real waste of money time and energy spent to get to the cinema on time to watch this.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1997 the first Men in Black came out. It was something no one had ever seen before a scifi movie crossed with the buddy comedy and action genres? To this day it remains one of my personal favorite movies. However I was disappointed with its sequel Men in Black II. The film felt like a almost a carbon copy of the original. Ten years later we have Men in Black III. It's quite a surprise to see this franchise after it was pretty much left for dead. But is it any good? Yes it is. Men in Black III is a fun movie a cool and nostalgic trip down memory lane. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but it's still a blast.The film takes place in 2012 10 years after the second movie. Agents J Will Smith and K Tommy Lee Jones are still partners working for the Men in Black a secret government organization which monitors all alien life on Earth. But one day J goes to work and finds out that K was assassinated in 1969. J must then go back in time and team up with a young Agent K Josh Brolin to fix the future and stop an alien invasion.The cast is rock solid as always. Will Smith looks like he's having a blast as the cool wise ass Agent J. Tommy Lee Jones plays Agent K the expressionless relaxed veteran. Jermaine Clement plays the films villain the vicious Boris the Animal and Emma Thompson is just alright as the new leader of the MiB Agent O. But the real star of the show is Josh Brolin as a young Agent K. The whole movie you forget he's just an actor and believe he's really a 29yearold K. His performance is very believable and well done.The special effects and makeup some of the most praised parts of the MiB series are very good. Danny Elfman's score is also topnotch sounding very MeninBlacky Is that even a word?. The set pieces too are very cool. You feel like you are in 1969 with not only New York City but also a scene later in the film with the Apollo 11 mission taking off.However the flaws of the film are in the script. The screenplay is very funny and is well written for the most part. The problems lie within the plot holes and goofups. The relationship between Agent K and O could have been fleshed out more. I was left unsatisfied with that plot line. For the goofups there's one instance where J is talking to Young K and he mentions Jedi Knight Mind Tricks. K then looks like he knows exactly what he is talking about. That part of the film takes place in 1969. Star Wars came out in 1977. Whoops.Another problem with the film was that it was just too long. At some points during the film I was a little bit bored. They probably could have shaved off about 1015 minutes of the film and it would be fine.In conclusion Men in Black III is a surprisingly fun movie. It's very funny very well acted and very cool. Unfortunately the script and longer running time prevent it from being a classic like the first movie. Still if you just want some great fun at the movies definitely give MiB3 a go.".

We were in anticipation to see a great entertaining show... Man in Black!!! IMAX 3D!!! It turns to be extremely boring! Dialogs about nothing. Repulsive looking fortune teller in an idiotic baby cap and etc. Just waste of time and money. Best part is funny speech on the alien language of the agent O and the first scene with security staff in the Canaveral Space Center. My dad asked How come all these great actors agreed to play in such a bad movie? My dad thought that actors can choose what to play in the US. We are done with Spielberg and director Barry Sonnenfeld.".

I very much support speranzadaniel's review this movie sucked. Contains spoilers  The plot is extremely Hollywood typical it's poorly put together. J W.Smith has to jump back in time do a Back to the future trick and save K Tommy Lee Jones from inevitable death. The actors are not performing very well and what is with all the staring and lingering of these people you could squeeze a full movie in between all these sighs. As a typical Hollywood plot the movie progresses J manages to fulfill his mission with a huge dose of clich and arguments against K played by Josh Brolin in the future .I liked Brolin in no country for old men but in this movie he doesn't really deliver to be honest I don't feel like anyone of the actors are. As a Jemaine Clement fan from Flight of the Conchords but not very positively surprised.Too bad you can't post negative votes here this one definitively deserves it.".

Mercifully it did makebelieve the second chapter didn't exist and only spoke of events in the original.Was this movie really necessary? Actually I'm not the one asking that  I've heard that question multiple of times leading up to the release but I will be the one answering. 90 yes and 10 probably. No is not the answer.While not perfect as it certainly had script and direction problems and though most of the jokes worked there were a half of dozen scenes of unfun silliness and overkill that made it tad cloudy. That said it was a lot more fun than not and again if this is the final one it was a nice closureway more than that joke of a movie the middle segment was.And besides all that I had a good time. The finale was enjoyable  although it really channeled 2006 Casino Royale's opening and the action was present and from the one cast member I wanted it the most from Tommy Lee Jones. Obviously it's not really him and that's apparent in most the movie considering it was Young K Josh Brolin. Oh and by the way he was not just spoton I never ever thought that was anyone but a young Jones.The movie's opening 10 or so minutes were apparently more successful than all of previously released Lockout and this leads a bad alien to go back in time to kill Men in Black agent K and in turn agentpartner J back as well to save him. And the world of course.That's the best and easiest synopsis I can give and of course there's more to the story but its best you just sit back and let the men entertain you.I don't want to give this my highest praise  it's doubtful this will land anywhere near my 2012 top ten list but it's fun companion the first one. Nowhere as close to freshness or quality but again like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade it's a fun ride that should be seen following part one.Notice how I didn't include part two in that statement.

	schema:headline " The MiB are Back and Almost as Fun as Before";
	schema:reviewBody "The original MEN IN BLACK was awesome. I remember watching it and hoping it became a continuing franchise. Then MEN IN BLACK II came out and I took it all back. What a bomb. I can't say I was all that disappointed when it looked like the second movie might've killed the franchise. If that was the sort of movies they were going to put out let the franchise die before it got any worse. Surprised doesn't even begin to describe my reaction when I found out they were making a third movie. It had been ten years since the second movie. It seemed a little late to go diving back into that well but whatever. Ten years should be enough time to get a story right. I guess it wasn't though because I'd read that the script wasn't even complete when they started shooting MEN IN BLACK 3. It wasn't a good sign. I guess there were a lot of problems during production so I didn't get my hopes up. Regardless I was hoping this movie might reinvigorate the series. The third film returns to Agents J and K doing their MiB routine. When K fails to show any form of emotion at Agent Zed's funeral J begins to question just what happened to turn K into the cold man his is now. He'll get his chance when a criminal from K's past Boris the Animal breaks out of prison and travels to 1969 to kill K and negate Earth's orbital protection system. To save K's life and prevent an Earth invasion J must travel back in time to save the future.I'm hesitant to label MEN IN BLACK 3 a total disappointment because there are some really good elements to it. I loved the time travel element and 1969 was a great time to incorporate. The birth of America's space exploration and a time ripe with it's own brand of cheesy scifi movies. When J arrives in MiB HQ in 1969 all of the flashy sleek aliens we're accustomed to are gone and replaced with rubber suits and glass bowl helmets. It was a great touch. I loved the early versions of popular MiB gear e.g. K's corded neurolyzer with it's dialup modem connection and Bill Hader's got a great cameo as Andy Warhol. I wish more had been done with the 1969 environment but I guess the filmmakers could only fit so much into the movie while keeping the plot on track. Josh Brolin was a perfect choice as a young Tommy Lee JonesAgent K. He totally nails every little nuance of Jones's character adding some new life of his own. This movie wouldn't have worked half as well without Brolin's performance. The first half of MEN IN BLACK 3 was a lot of fun and hearkened back to the best elements of the first movie. I was ready and willing to forget the misstep that was MEN IN BLACK II. For the most part I would call MEN IN BLACK 3 a surprising success but it wasn't perfect.The second half of the move starts to drag right about the time a fifthdimensional alien named Griffin arrives in the movie. The character isn't so much a drag in fact I thought he was a pretty unique creation for the movie and done well with a performance by Michael Stuhlbarg. It's just that his arrival signifies the start of the less exciting more emotional parts of the movie. If I'm watching one of these movies I want crazy scifi action and bizarre aliens with endoftheworld intentions. I don't watch them for an emotional core. It slows down the fun. I can get drama from other movies. There's a big element in this movie about the relationship between J and K and it dominates the second half of the film. Then there's Boris the Animal. He's not a bad villain. He's not on the level of Serleena and her Johnny Knoxville henchman of the second movie but he's nowhere near as cool or threatening as Edgar the bug. I think Jermaine Clement is a funny dude. He was the best part of DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS. But his Boris is just a snarling overloud mess. He's roars most of his lines and fires bone quills from his hands. Not bad but there's been better alien baddies. With a little more effort into the script this might've been as good as the first but even with its flaws it turned out surprisingly well. It's got me interested again in the chance of continuing the franchise.".

But this movie feels rather ungerman as it is truly charming and witty and thoroughly well written and acted. The scenes are hysterical but always remain realistic. Mannerherzen male hearts tells the stories of five guys going to the same gym in Berlinwith everyone trying to be a real man in his life and no one really having a clue what that actually means in our day and age. Their quests for happiness and romance are told from a strictly male point of view which makes this comedy less corny and somewhat more edgy than the usual variations. The English title men in the city i find a bit misleading as this is not in the vain of the sex in the city movies.

	schema:reviewBody "The 2009 German comedy Mnnerherzen is a contender for best German film of the year and also one of the best taking all countries into account. Pretty much all bigger parts are played by Germany's acting elite Schweiger Ulmen Uhl Mhring Fitz von Dohnnyi.... The only one I was not familiar with is Maxim Mehmet but he has a respectable body of work too. The characters include a loner who meets a woman her violent exhusband a pop singer a womanizer a man about to become a dad with no money at all and a man with lastminute panic shortly before his wedding. Mnnerherzen is Simon Verhoeven's second film as directorwriter 8 years after his first. Since 2009 there has only been a sequel to Mnnerherzen in his body of work so he is obviously not exactly prolific. However he has done quite a bit of acting work Das Wunder von Bern which is his real passion it seems. He also plays a minor character in this film here. On a sidenote Verhoeven is the son of famous German actress Senta Berger and director Michael Verhoeven Oscarnominated The Nasty Girl.The ending of Mnnerherzen is fairly dramatic. A man gets thrown in an alligator's compound in a zoo a pregnant woman is hit by a car but as this is a comedy everybody gets out in good health and only with minor injuries given the seriousness of the events. This film manages exactly to reach the right mixture of comedy and drama. Schweiger plays a role that is similar to his usual characters but it's all good. he does a decent job with it. Wotan Wilke Mhring really impressed me here for the very first time. Glad to see the light at the end of the tunnel for his character at the end even if it was maybe a tad too surprising for my liking. His character is not really a bad guy he was just disappointed one time too many. Justus von Dohnnyi won a supporting actor award at the German Film Awards for the unique pop musician he plays great song as well especially with the children's choir and Nadja Uhl managed a nomination as well for a much more serious character. The fact that von Dohnnyi's and Schweiger's characters carry both fake names show us that there is not much reality in show business. One scene I found funny was when the ruthless record producer says he is shocked what business turns some people into near the end. The irony. And pretty much everybody seems to get a happy ending. Or do they. The slightly inferior sequel told us they did not some of them. Oh well.. it probably was not planned already when they made this.Stephan Luca and Bastian Pastewka brought some nice humor too with their alpha male  perfect houseman fights. This was particularly interesting as it was uncertain for a long time how Fitz' storyline would go and even with the way it went they turned it 360 in the sequel again. The revelation of Luca's character at the end was a highlight as well. This film has so many funny scenes the only thing I criticize is how small the guineapig cage from Ulmen's character was and that you should never hold these animals alone. Nonetheless animal activists can watch this too and forgive him in the light of all the other great moments from this film. Very much recommended. Not just another generic romcom. Not at all. And for people from Berlin it is especially worth watching as you will see many locations you have already been like the Alexanderplatz.".

	schema:reviewBody "Phantomschmerz or Phantom Pain is a German 95minute movie released back in 2009 so this one has its 10th anniversary next year and it is the first and only full feature film effort by writer and director Matthias Emcke who otherwise seems to focus on producing. Today this movie is mostly known because it has Til Schweiger playing the central character and he is joined by major supporting players Erceg and especially Pallaske. This is typical German stuff that gets made these days too I would say. It's not a failure but it rarely feels realistic in the sense that you are watching anything other than actors which hurts the film especially in the more dramatic moments as well as when they try to get in some not so subtle comedy. Schweiger however was a bit of a positive surprise here as his acting is better than usual but he nonetheless cannot make the flawed script work either. Kinda unusual to see him with long hair. We got the story of an ambitious cyclist whose life changes in a tragic accident from one second to the next. It takes a while until said accident happens so we get a great deal of character elaboration already from way before that. Nothing too memorable though. Everything afterward is the typical clichd path to mental health for the main character that is plastered with a whole lot of rocks obviously when it comes to finding love and friendship and acceptance of one's life again. Yes it is too melodramatic at times I would say and judging from the overall quality it also takes itself more seriously than it should really which is a pity as here and there you get an okay moment that proves not all hope is lost in hoping this could actually a good film. Admittedly you need to say that this turned out better probably than it would have today with most likely Schweighfer starring in it and this perhaps would have been unwatchable. Anyway there are still too many weaknesses in here and unsatisfying character writing dialogues too frequently for everybody but Schweiger make it impossible for me to give this film a positive recommendation. Overall a thumbsdown. Watch something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never mind Ozgurcd's review of this film he or she is not reviewing the film who knows if he or she even saw it but merely spouting political views about a touchy subject in Turkey. I'm Turkish and know all about Turkish victimization paranoia. I would rather judge the film on its own merits and perhaps acknowledge and discuss the politics also. This film is less about the TurkishKurdish divide as it is about class and the issues of migrant workers in Istanbul. This plot could happen anywhere in the world. Here's my review Journey to the Sun is an almost perfect film but hurt by the stilted acting. God why can't Turkish people act in film? Either it's overdramatic as if they've confused the camera lens with a theater audience or it's so understated to be nonexistent. This film suffers from the latter. I know this happens with nonactors and though I have always loved the Italian neorealists I have also always thought they could have used a hefty dose of the Actors' Studio.But back to the movie Journey has a lot in common with the neorealists by attempting to show the stark reality of migrant life in Istanbul. We first get a glimpse of this in the opening scene in the form of shots of people unrelated to the film and most likely just faces in the crowd of the busy neighborhood of Eminonu.This is the story of two friends one Kurdish Berzan and one not but who is so darkskinned as to be mistaken for one Mehmet. Mehmet is from Tire on the Aegean Sea coast while Berzan is from a village near the Iraqi border. They are both migrant workers trying to eek out an existence. The tragicomic circumstances in which they meet work as an eerie foreshadowing for the events to come. A band of drunk hooligans attempt to beat up a man they think is Kurdish and Mehmet and Berzan save him. They then have to run to save their own asses.All goes well until one day Mehmet is mistaken for a Kurd through a plot twist I won't go into here and is taken to the police station tortured and then let go. The treatment he gets after that brings him on a multitiered journey of political and social enlightenment of identity of geography he ends up going to the East. Berzan is certainly working with some underground organizations but this is never made clear. We see him as Mehmet sees him Mehmet being the nonKurd and representing the nonKurdish audience that Ustaoglu must in some way think is watching this film. This aspect is somewhat problematic. Would Berzan somehow be less sympathetic to us if we knew what he was up to? I don't know and can't say for sure.This is however a beautiful film with the more serious threads punctuated with moments of humor and touching detail. The miseenscene is so exquisitely rendered so detailoriented that the director must have spent time with the everyday people that we normally just passed by. I love seeing women directors creating such important and moving work it gives me hope. What's the point of highlighting injustice if there is no hope? I dare not be a nihilist. And while the the penultimate scene at the submerged Kurdish village is close to heartbreaking like many scenes in the film Mehmet dying his hair blonde in an attempt to seem less Kurdish then reversing his identity and taking on Berzan's own identity it never totally breaks you because the characters are never totally broken.cococravescinema.blogspot.com".

Another aspect that appealed to me is that although the film is obviously political it does not present the situation in any direct way.  The main characters are simple apolitical characters whose lives become affected by the political events around them. By keeping the story focused on the immediate situation of the main characters the background politics are all the more powerful because the director does not directly espouse or preach on behalf of any one point of view.  It makes the viewer want to learn more about the complex nature of the Kurdish issue in Turkey.".

Another aspect that appealed to me is that although the film is obviously political it does not present the situation in any direct way.  The main characters are simple apolitical characters whose lives become affected by the political events around them. By keeping the story focused on the immediate situation of the main characters the background politics are all the more powerful because the director does not directly espouse or preach on behalf of any one point of view.  It makes the viewer want to learn more about the complex nature of the Kurdish issue in Turkey.";

In between a young Turkish man traverses more than 1000 KMs first driving a stolen pickup truck then riding on a                        minibus and a train. All along he is dragging a wooden coffin holding the dead body of a friend.The early setup in Istanbul develops along the protagonist's relations with a young woman and with a political refugee from the Kurdish southeast who later ends up in the coffin. A story of innocent love is presented between the hero and his girlfriend. As he ends up being tossed across the political and ethnic fault lines in the social mix of Istanbul she is one of the very few people who choose to stand by him.I found the story very realistic without being glib about the social life and the political issues it brings to the screen.".

They should just read Amnesty International's description of Turkey's justice system and mistreatment of prisoners. Of course they also deny that their ancestors committed Genocide against the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire in 1915. If Turkey wants to join the EU the young generation must first join twentyfirst century and stop behaving like their ancestors. They must face history and come to terms with it. They must stop imprisoning journalists and others for insulting Turkishness simply by speaking out. It would also be nice if they stopped assassinating journalists and priests.

What I mean by that is that not only did it ewoke the same feelings that the novella gave me it used the possibilieties of cinema to amplify them even. The directing is superb with each shot you feel right there the cinematography is poetic and connects rural Russia to the very soul of the characters. The acting is deep and the last scenes had me close to tears. On the downside it has some of the more out of place shots and this awkward feeling some of the european productions of that era had.If you liked Turgenjews novella definetly see this. If you have ever been a teenager desperatly in love you need to see it just as much.".

	schema:reviewBody "Erste Liebe or First Love is a coproduction between West Germany Switzerland and Hungary from 1970 so this one will soon have its 50th anniversary. It is one of the directorial efforts by Oscarwinning actor Maximilian Schell and he together with John Gould he also adapted the Ivan Turgenev novel for the screen here. This was only the second time Switzerland submitted a film for the Foreign Language Oscar and actually this one here managed the nomination but lost eventually to the Italian entry. I guess the fact that it did get nominated also has a lot to do with Schell's involvement here. He is also an actor in this relatively short Germanlanguage film. It only runs for 85 minutes approximately and depicts the first love of the character of Alexander when he falls for a slightly older but still pretty young woman who has all kinds of suitors some even pretty close to Alexander.So yeah I think this started in a pretty decent way and the scenes between the two protagonists were somewhat okay to watch even if the girl's attraction? and the way it was portrayed and depicted did not always ring true. But the longer the film goes the weaker it got. At some point it juts felt as if it sacrificed all kinds of convincing plot telling and character development because of the artistic impact it was trying so hard to make. Quite disappointing as there was certainly more potential in here. I have not seen the literary work it is based on so I am not sure who is to blame the most for the outcome here. I just think as a film it wasn't working out at all for the most part and as a consequence I cannot agree with all the awards attention it received. Seriously German Film Awards? I know you like Schell and so do I at least as an actor but come on. There is nothing impressive about this film at all. Watch something else instead.".

The Target may be nothing groundbreaking but as an actioncrime buff I thoroughly enjoyed it. Dennis Hopper is a pleasure to watch as an aging criminal accountant forced to flee Capetown for the rural simplicity of his childhood village. All the while pursued by a crime boss with a mysterious mystical side. The first section of the film is an effective urban actioncrime flick and the remainder is part a genuinely charming rediscovery of life and part Western. Production values are not the highest though they were able to snag some big names. Still all the acting was effective if not exceptional. The location is the real star of the film. Having never been to South Africa I can't address the complaints of its residents however I thought the scenery was beautiful and the culture was an interesting twist on a story that could just as well have taken place in New York. I was reminded of the It's easy to rip apart a movie like this.

Both of them actually have mastered the Art of Traveling around the world in this somewhat enjoyable ficks about mobsters monsters and other dramas. This time the plot revolves around a mercenary that is brought to protect a powerful business man from a mobster in Prison. He can see plenty of shots of South Africa and the landscape a couple of car chases and a poorly written dialogue that remained me of Film 101 still this a enjoyable flick if you happened to like BMovies and expect the usual MobsterBodyguard Plot that is somehow the man you are supposed to protect not always is what you thought of it in the First Place. Both actors seemed to have enjoyed the travel expenses and the funny fact of the film is seeing Mr. Hopper wearing a ridiculous toupee that make him look quite funny is good enough. The whole script is clearly not intended to be nominated for an Award so if you are looking for a powerful movie wait for Greenaways new project called The Tulse Luper Suitcases' and please dont be nagging all day because of this little project complete done over South Africa to be seen along side others classics such as Do not Disturb Dick Maas done in the marvelous city of Amsterdam and also Soul Assasin Laurence Malkin also done in that cool city.

	schema:reviewBody "The Piano Player or The Target in the U.S. is a movie that begins with an interesting plot but loses its focus towards the middle. Christopher Lambert plays Alex Laney an unconvincing hitman who must protect Robert Nile Dennis Hopper a lawyer who knows the truth about the leader of a South African mob. The problem with this movie other than it drags is that there's no development of the Lambert character. There's one scene where his hitman qualities shine when he saves Nile's daughter from kidnappers but his hitman character is ultimately weak and unbelievable. We witness the death of his parents when he's a child the past of all hitmen must show why they do what they do but the his passion to kill or protect doesn't go far. Alex Laney is a bad role for Christopher Lambert or any actor. When Robert Nile visits a small town where he was brought up we lose interest in the story because the tension dies and the mood is off tangent. It's too bad because Dennis Hopper is a great character actor who wasted his presence on this movie and Christopher Lambert whom I'm a fan of for Highlander although I think his best work is in Subway must certainly choose his roles more carefully. An actor need not be very diverse in roles but should pick roles suitable for his range.".

Christopher Lambert plays Alex Laney an unconvincing hitman who must protect Robert Nile Dennis Hopper a lawyer who knows the truth about the leader of a South African mob. The problem with this movie other than it drags is that there's no development of the Lambert character. There's one scene where his hitman qualities shine when he saves Nile's daughter from kidnappers but his hitman character is ultimately weak and unbelievable. We witness the death of his parents when he's a child the past of all hitmen must show why they do what they do but the his passion to kill or protect doesn't go far. Alex Laney is a bad role for Christopher Lambert or any actor. When Robert Nile visits a small town where he was brought up we lose interest in the story because the tension dies and the mood is off tangent. It's too bad because Dennis Hopper is a great character actor who wasted his presence on this movie and Christopher Lambert whom I'm a fan of for Highlander although I think his best work is in Subway must certainly choose his roles more carefully. An actor need not be very diverse in roles but should pick roles suitable for his range.";

The problems were writing direction and editing. The screenplay has too much dead time in it. And it's not edited very tightly either. The last half of the film takes place in a remote village and a lot of time is spent reflecting and just sitting around. I feel that the time could have been spent doing exposition work. There's also a problem where when Lambert's character has been knocked out by the bad guy it's hard to tell what he was dreaming vs what was actually happening. Diane Kruger provides some eye candy but adds very little else to the film. Hopper's a better actor than Lambert but not much and acting Ian't this film's strong suit either. Overall in other hands and with perhaps a more vibrant cast this could have been a good film. By far it's strongest point is the beautiful scenery yes including Kruger.".

Curiously enough while he does appear as an actor in THE PEDESTRIAN his is only a star cameo as the dead son of a German industrialist targeted by his surviving Greek subjects 30 years after the retaliatory massacre of their village populace. However Schell did appear as hunted exNazis in such Hollywood indictments as THE ODESSA FILE 1974 and THE MAN IN THE GLASS BOOTH 1975 which garnered him another Best Actor nod and a viewing of which will follow presently before essaying yet another proud Nazi officer in Sam Peckinpah's CROSS OF IRON 1977.The central character of THE PEDESTRIAN  so called because his reckless steering costs him his driving license and the life of his son Schell  is played by Gustav Rudolf Sellner and although it is the first time I have heard of him or seen his work in fact this was his screen debut in that capacity as he is also a director of TV movies his sensitive portrayal is a quietly impressive one that was recognized at that year's German Film Awards typically he is shown leading a double life even on a personal level by keeping a muchyounger mistress! Amusingly at one point Sellner's younger rebellious hippie son is also shown catching a TV screening of the classic Bolivian film BLOOD OF THE CONDOR 1969. Schell's treatment of the somber material including potentially disturbing footage of road accident victims which the felonious drivers are forced to watch as part of their 'rehabilitation' process! is predictably heavygoing if occasionally brilliant relying on several flashbacks to the all important WWII and car crash episodes. Even so the unexpected highlight of the film turns out to be a couple of sequences set in an old people's home where Sellner's wife reminisces with her elderly friends that are unaccountably but delightfully played by such acting veterans as Peggy Ashcroft Elizabeth Bergner Lil Dagover and Franoise Rosay! ...".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Fugnger or The Pedestrian is a coproduction between Switzerland West German and Israel that resulted in a Germanlanguage movie with minor parts in English and French too. It is from 1973 so it will have its45th anniversary next year and it is one of the earlier directorial efforts by Oscarwinning actor Maximilian Schell. He is also one of the two writers next to Dagmar Hirtz who is still alive today and also directed her own films even if her main profession was probably editing. Now about this one here It runs for slightly over 90 minutes and won lead actor Gustav Rudolf Sellner who plays the title character a German Film Award the biggest achievement of his career. Schell also acts in here and there are more known names like legendary silent film actress Lil Dagover in her later years and she collaborated with Schell on other occasions too. Walter Kohut may also be known to some if they are German film buffs.But this film is also a prime example of why Schell just wasn't a good enough filmmaker as actor. Yes this was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe but honestly I think this is just ridiculous. This awards attention probably only came because of Schell being attached to the project and also because of the important subject. Yes Nazithemed films are very common in Germany today so no surprise it was also a frequent subject less than 30 years after the end of World War II. But with great quantity there isn't always great quality. This one here is about a man who is suspected to be a war criminal and how he lives a life with a successful career nonetheless many years after World War II. Investigators are on his trail after the testimony of an eye witness. But this is also the problem. Honestly there are so so many character in here so many supporting characters and instead of elaborating on them properly and using them to deliver a convincing plot maybe even a touching story about the ghosts of the past they just add one more supporting character after the next. The consequence is not only that it was impossible to care for these character but also at times impossible to understand who they even are. It's a bit of a shame as the beginning with the talk between a man and a child about history and how to define it was really well done. But then it goes all south fairly quickly. I think all the praise for this movie is incredibly exaggerated. It does not deliver in terms of drama historic context or acting and all the awards recognition it received is inappropriate in my opinion. Thumbsdown from me. Not recommended.".

Schell also acts in here and there are more known names like legendary silent film actress Lil Dagover in her later years and she collaborated with Schell on other occasions too. Walter Kohut may also be known to some if they are German film buffs.But this film is also a prime example of why Schell just wasn't a good enough filmmaker as actor. Yes this was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe but honestly I think this is just ridiculous. This awards attention probably only came because of Schell being attached to the project and also because of the important subject. Yes Nazithemed films are very common in Germany today so no surprise it was also a frequent subject less than 30 years after the end of World War II. But with great quantity there isn't always great quality. This one here is about a man who is suspected to be a war criminal and how he lives a life with a successful career nonetheless many years after World War II. Investigators are on his trail after the testimony of an eye witness. But this is also the problem. Honestly there are so so many character in here so many supporting characters and instead of elaborating on them properly and using them to deliver a convincing plot maybe even a touching story about the ghosts of the past they just add one more supporting character after the next. The consequence is not only that it was impossible to care for these character but also at times impossible to understand who they even are. It's a bit of a shame as the beginning with the talk between a man and a child about history and how to define it was really well done. But then it goes all south fairly quickly. I think all the praise for this movie is incredibly exaggerated. It does not deliver in terms of drama historic context or acting and all the awards recognition it received is inappropriate in my opinion. Thumbsdown from me. Not recommended.";

Anchored by a strong lead performance by Gustav Rudolf Sellner as Heinz Giese a German businessman suspected of ordering the massacre of a Greek village during World War II the film follows a group of journalists trying to scoop the story. They're far from the idealistic writers we usually see in films howeverthey're mostly interested in the story because it will sell papers. There's one particularly nasty moment when the Giese case is consigned to page 3 because there's a spectacular car theft photo that absolutely must make the front page. Perhaps that's the point in The Pedestrian no one is wholly innocent as the film's coda underscores with its reference to collective guilt. Technically Maximilian Schell's direction seems cluttered and unfocused though Embassy Home Video's Englishdubbed VHS does the film no favours. The Pedestrian is not a likely candidate for a Region 1 digital overhaul but it's worth seeing for Sellner's performance alone and the supporting cast including Lil Dagover Peggy Ashcroft and Gustav's real life son Manuel as Giese's hippie offspring is an interesting one.".

It is basically three films in one as the focus is on three characters and the solution at the end did not really convince me to see it as one movie. Anyway you probably won't find too many known names in the cast list. German film buffs could recognize Moya. But despite the German film Wward nomination it is not an actors' film at all it is much more about the story and maybe also about the ensemble. But I personally struggled to make a connection here perhaps because Qurbani was just trying to include too much here homosexuality betrayal pregnancy abortion religion family life fatherdaughter relationships job struggles etc. The consequence is that several of these areas felt executed underwhelmingly overall and that the film lacks focus on a few occasions. Maybe sticking with two or even onecharacters and having them linked closer would have been the better choice here. It all got a bit messy but even if the film has no area where it truly sucks or disappoints I cannot recommend seeing it. For it also doesn't have any area where it truly shines or delivers. A piece of genuine mediocrity. Watch Qurbani's more known more superior and more recent We Are Young. We Are Strong. instead. Shahada gets a thumbsdown from me. Not recommended.".

	schema:headline " Typical Italian WWII Film SPOILERS!";
	schema:reviewBody "REVIEW OF THE VIDEO TREASURES NTSC VHS VERSIONThroughout the late1960s Italian directors cranked a number of lowbudget action flicks attempting to cash in on the success of The Dirty Dozen and other blockbuster Hollywood war films. While The Dirty Heroes sounds like a cheap imitation it's actually one the most engaging war action films to come out of Europe in the late 1960s. This is credited to professionalism allaround from the ensemble cast to the expert crew behindthescenes.The plot is a bit complicated and has several twists throughout. Sesame Frederick Stafford and Randall Howard Ross are two Allied bomber crewman who are shot down in Holland. It's purely coincidence that their old friend Petrowski Michel Constantine a German guard who's actually loyal to the Allies is a camp guard and helps them escape. The three team up with Rollman Adolfo Celi and plot to heist Dutch diamonds from a safe in the bowels of Wehrmacht Headquarters. But they need help getting inside so they enlist Kristina von Keist Daniela Bianchi wife of General von Keist Curd Jurgens who turns about to be a Jew and has to choose whether to help the partisans or withdraw from the plan to save herself. To complicate matters Von Keist has no idea of his wife's true identity and is already being hounded by a vicious SS General Helmuth Schneider.With a script by six writers it's no surprise that the plot is so complicated. What's amazing is that all of these details and more work together perfectly to create a brilliantly crafted story an incredibly fast pace. You never know whose side each character is on. Are the good guys really dogooders or are they the dirty heroes the title alludes to? There are several conflicts going on here and it's amazing that they never become confusing and contradictory.The movie relies on performances and fleshedout characters to drive the action which is part of the reason it works so well. Frederick Stafford is excellent as usual. He makes Sesame a fleshandblood character whose only ambition is greed  until he meets Kristina and becomes wrapped up in a cause he doesn't necessarily want to be part of. Stafford is one of my favorite actors in this genre because he always has unconventional leading roles and makes his character into a sympathetic dimensional human being. Daniela Bianchi is equally great as Kristina the woman who has to make a difficult moral decision. Unfortunately the character falls to pieces in the final act where her substantial part is reduced to sappy love interest and she's given little to do. As General von Keist Curd Jurgens The Enemy Below is easily the most developed character in the film. He is trying to do a tough job and save as many lives as he can because he knows defeat of the Third Reich is imminent. Von Keist is uncharacteristically sympathetic  he is shown to make truces with partisans to prevent massacres of his own troops and civilian casualties.The supporting characters give the leads plenty of extra juice. John Ireland seems to be enjoying himself as Captain O'Connor an American pilot who gets conned into helping the heroes heist the diamonds. Adolfo Celi is great fun as Rollman the Dutch partisan whose loyalties and motives are questionable until the final act. He gets to be physically active in his role dispatching Germans with a machinegun swimming through canals to escape PT Boats and more. Helmuth Schneider Is Paris Burning? has a very effective if typical role as General Hassler a vicious SS officer. Hassler and Von Keist provide a moral conflict against the backdrop of the greater plot and the two opponents face off in the final act kicking off a complicated plot resolution.Director Alberto de Martino knows his craft. By 1967 he'd already directed several gladiator films and some excellent spy movies along the lines of James Bond adventures. Therefore The Dirty Heroes has an appropriate epic look and always feels a little bit like a spy movie. The location photography is superb. The sets are expansive  the Wehrmacht headquarters Partisan encampment and American airfield all look and feel real in every shot. De Martino captures the scope of some truly massive battle scenes in the final act complete with hundreds of extras and several tanks. But he isn't afraid to take the camera into front lines either giving the audience a personal connection to the action right along with the main characters. The music score written cooperatively by Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai is quite possibly one the best scores ever written for a war film by the two greatest Italian composers who ever lived.Don't let all my praise fool you though. For everything the writers did right the roots of the story manage to be muddled and confusing and there are plenty of poorly explained scenes. For example in one key sequence for convenience's sake O'Connor's plane transforms from a transport to a bomber. And as usual the German SS forces don't seem to have brains  they stand up and charge entrenched infantry who effortlessly mow them down. And just how do all these American conmen manage to get reunited right in the middle of the war? It's ridiculous to assume that Sesame and Randall wound up imprisoned together and that Petrowski just happened to be stationed at their POW camp. The nearby presence of their old pal O'Connor simply adds insult to injury. Well this is all forgivable in the end because one is expected overlook these little details and just get into the plot.The Dirty Heroes is one of the funnest and most original war films to come out of the 1960s. The action sequences are stunningly staged and the story is both engaging and suspenseful. The flaws can be ignored the story is pure escape at its best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Embarrassingly bad lowbudget Italianmade war movie set in Holland in the dying days of WWII. A tedious plodding storyline concerning a plot to steal some diamonds from a German HQ awful acting and dreadful editing make this movie a prize turkey from the opening scene right through to the cringeworthy ohso60s romantic' ending which will have you reaching for the puke bucket  that is if you haven't already reached for the Off' button long before. The worst performances come from John Ireland as Captain O'Connor and the blonde female lead whose name escapes me. She plays the love interest' to our Rugged Leading Man. Perhaps it wasn't entirely her fault as back then female romantic leads especially in action movies were often written as weak wishywashy sobbing supersensitive emotional jellyfish. This one is no exception and the second supporting female character is just as bad. Simply nauseating to watch. Even the action scenes which are few and far between except towards the end are boring and predictable. Most ludicrously in the climatic battle we have Rugged Leading Man and his two mates holed up in some sandbagged bunker and effortlessly gunning down endless attacking Germans right left and centre. The Germans of course are all terrible shots and even seem to be eager cannonfodder as they make little or no effort to take cover dying spectacularly in droves amid much flailing of arms and comicbook shouts of AAAAARGH'. This is glorification of war at its very worst. Then suddenly  right in the middle of the battle  the resistance guy pulls up completely unmolested in a stolen German jeep and trots effortlessly along a convenient trench  which leads directly into the bunker and which somehow hundreds of Germans approaching from all sides have failed to spot  and calmly joins Our Heroes inside the bunker. Another scene of crass stupidity that really must be seen to be believed has Captain O'Connor flying over the German lines in a reconnaissance plane which with the help of some clumsilyinserted old newsreel footage is suddenly and miraculously transformed into a heavy bomber disgorging its massive payload from wideopen bomb bays and pulverising the Germans beneath before once more instantaneously reverting to being a small reconnaissance plane again. The concept of an ongoing truce between the resistance fighters and the occupying German army also seems ludicrous to me yet this is a central theme of the movie. The English title of the film was obviously inspired by The Dirty Dozen' which was made around the same time but it doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. The original Italian title of this film Dalle Ardenne all' Inferno the sleeve notes for the English language video release are also grossly misleading. This film has absolutely NOTHING to do with the Battle of the Ardennes. The Ardennes isn't even in Holland  it's a part of Belgium  which indicates that the filmmakers' knowledge of World War II events and geography was just as limited as their ability to make even a halfdecent film. Don't waste two hours of your valuable time on this rubbish. One of the worst movies I've had the misfortune to sit through  and I've sat through some garbage!!".

There's more to the plot a lot more so it best to get yourself a bowl of popcorn and sit down and relax with this fast moving film.I really liked this film. Its a perfectly modulated Eurowar film that is no more fantastic than any of the dozen or so films I've been watching recently. To be certain the film has little connection to reality any notion of that disappears early on about the time our hero makes good his escape with a little extra help. From the point where Adolfo Celi appears the film suddenly grabs you and you realize that whats going on isn't your typical war film. The film also starts to add on layers of complications that to my mind enhance the film not take away from it.To be certain if you go into this film expecting a straight up war film with some modicum of reality you're bound to be disappointed. However if you take this film as a neat little crime film set during war time then you're going to have a grand old time. Honestly I went into this film not knowing anything about the film since it was badly labeled as part of a multi DVD Multi film set. I had no expectations and I found that I was pleasantly surprised by what I was seeing.I can't say enough good. The cast is good and the action is first rate. If there is any real problem it would be that the film is probably too long at almost two hours it seems to end a couple times too many in the final half hour. I think you should search this film out".

	schema:reviewBody "In watching The Robber I couldn't help but notice the similarities to this year's Drive. You don't have the blood and cotton candy aesthetic that Refn so expertly delivered that made the latter film really sing but the titular character is a similar blank state and this story also plays out in a muted way that lets the action do most of the talking instead of the characters. Which sometimes and works and sometimes doesn't. The action scenes are intense and feel really authentic and as we start to get a better understanding of the character the piece really starts to do some work.My problem is that we never properly get inside the head of this character a similar problem that I had with Drive. We get his motivation and the final stretch of the film is tragic and beautiful because of that but I felt that the whole thing would have been a lot more impressive if I was given an opportunity to emotionally connect with the main character. Unfortunately the film never allows me to do this because he's presented in such a blank unemotional light that it becomes more about the ideas than the person. Which is all well and good and the film is certainly impressive but it holds it back from being something that I could put all of my praise behind and without that wildly unique style that Refn created with his film this similar project doesn't compare too much.Still there's a lot to admire here and aside from the action pieces I really admired the lead performance from Andreas Lust who was aces in a devastating role in 2009's Revanche. Here he isn't given a lot to work with as an actor but he commands the screen and presents a character who you simultaneously want to know more about and want to run and hide from. He's fascinating and intimidating but part of you stands on his side. I just wish I had connected enough so that all of me could be with him.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to this on a whim and I'm glad I did. The Robber is a tight and tension filled thriller based on real events of a convicted bank robber who released from prison goes on a new crime spree. The film is in a way quite quiet in that there is little dialogue but we don't really need too much talk as we get enough visually.Johann is neither a likable person nor is a crazed criminal psychopath which leads the viewer to a unusual predicament in that you start to almost barrack for him. He never hurts anyone just robs banks and in the interim goes running in marathons. In his face mask and plain clothes he doesn't even look like he'd hurt a fly. Of course things turn nasty and caught up in the picture is a woman Erika she like the audience as events get worse are left with the moral dilemma of choosing an outcome for Johann. Should he get away with it or be caught and serve time? Johann himself never really expresses any real emotion so there is little to understand why he should do what he does but this adds to the film as it gives the audience more intrigue without throwing in too many questions.Stylishly the film looks great some beautiful scenery during one of the marathons are great. And then there are the running sequences Johann runs a lot to bank robberies from robberies and then just for the hell of it. Director Benjamin Heisenberg uses some great camera work to follow Johann on these runs and in one sequence when he is chased by a cop car through a car park the editing is effective enough to create a tense exciting sequence. The films ends with quietly in some ways rather sadly but others may find it a little too predictable. However the film is a great piece of work that makes the audience question itself and it's attitude towards others.More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Most fans of Hollywood movies will probably not like this film because it doesn't contain massive explosions or a bombastic soundtrack in fact it practically has none but this stunner based on the story of a real life bank robber is one of the great thrillers of the decade. A sleek sparse study of existentialism THE ROBBER is a must see.It begins rather abruptly the first scene is a man named Johann superbly played by Andreas Lust running in what seems like a training center but as soon as the camera pans back we realize he is in a prison and is about to be released after serving a 6 year sentence. As the story unfolds Johann is set free where he begins to win marathons but leads a double life as he returns to his old habits of stealing cars and then using them as getaway vehicles for his bank robberies.As with European cinema much of the pacing and characters are understated there are times when nobody says anything but from the background noises and the looks on their faces you can clearly tell what they are thinking. Even though the few people he knows his former girlfriend his parole officer deeply cares for him and pulls strings to get him to live a normal life it's clear that he does not want any of it. Johann just wants to rob banks and run because that is all he is. The whole movie takes place in Austria the land of Heidi and Vienna coffee houses but with the movie being portrayed through Johann's eyes Austria seems bleak detached and robotic to make it look almost unbearable to be living in while there are other characters in the story they seem to be nothing more than minor twinkles in Johann's eye he does not care for them and it almost seems like they are ghosts to him.There were some professional critics that lambasted this movie for not revealing Johann's motivation on why he is what he is. But what they don't understand is that it really doesn't matter. Some people do things because it's the one thing or two in Johann's case that gives them meaning everything else is of no consequence. I find the main protagonistantagonist of this movie to be a combination of Johnny Depp's John Dillinger in PUBLIC ENEMIES and Barry Newman's Kowalski in VANISHING POINT. They exist only to do the one thing that matters to them and that's it.".

He was still an interesting conundrum as a bank robber though in that he never spent any of his ill gained cash. He couldn't put it in a bank not even a Swiss one for fear of detection. He couldn't get it out of the country. He didn't seem to want to buy anything anyway. So it just stayed in a bag under his bed  not really the best plan for hiding money. We never really find out why he had this compulsion to rob banks and in the process steal getaway cars. He just did it and it didn't even seem to make him happy. There was nothing about Johann that expressed happiness not even his relationship with his girlfriend Erika Franzeska Weisz.

	onyx:emotionText "Johann Kastenberger Andreas Lust real life bank robber would have been considered just another thief but for his second interest  marathon running. He was still an interesting conundrum as a bank robber though in that he never spent any of his ill gained cash. He couldn't put it in a bank not even a Swiss one for fear of detection. He couldn't get it out of the country. He didn't seem to want to buy anything anyway. So it just stayed in a bag under his bed  not really the best plan for hiding money. We never really find out why he had this compulsion to rob banks and in the process steal getaway cars. He just did it and it didn't even seem to make him happy. There was nothing about Johann that expressed happiness not even his relationship with his girlfriend Erika Franzeska Weisz. But what made him a biopic worthy character was his other compulsion  to run. He was a champion marathon runner who while even in prison maintained his training regime running circles in the yard and using his own treadmill in his tiny prison cell. When asked by a prison official how his life would change when he got out he said 'I won't have to run in circles anymore.' This review is continued at exm.nrBonnisSteiger . Thanks.";

	schema:reviewBody "Adapted from Dennis Prinz's novel which is based on real events The Robber has all the elements of a penetrating character study. Unfortunately director Martin Heisenberg doesn't always use those elements to his advantage. The story is about Johann Rettenberger an Austrian banditmarathoner known as Pumpgun Ronnie. Heisenberg takes a muted nonpsychological approach to his story and without much in the way of emotional engagement keeping viewers engaged is certainly more challenging than need be.Andreas Lust stars as Johann Rettenberger a serial bank robber who has spent a six year bid in prison training as a longdistance runner. After being released from prison Johann runs into Erika Franziska Weisz at the Job Center which helps ex cons find work. The dialogue makes it clear they've met before but the narrative annoyingly withholds any connection to their past. Why is the beautiful welltodo Erika so drawn to this emotionally distant career criminal?Ultimately Johann returns to Vienna and combines his two true passions and what he knows best  running and knocking over banks. His dominance on the marathon circuit gets him noticed as does his daylight bank heists. Notoriously referred to as Pumpgun Ronnie after the Ronald Reagan mask he wears and the shotgun he brandishes. To this day Rettenberger still holds the record time in the Bergmarathon a worldfamous marathon held in the Austrian Alps.Frustratingly we never really get a sense of who Johann is or what motivates him. He is expressionless coldhearted and remains distant throughout. Heisenberg's treatment vividly communicates Rettenberger's neurotic defiance and destructive behavior but that's no substitute for enabling the viewer to become invested in the character's fate. Johann does not let people into his life and is a blank cipher as to why he leads the life of a bank robber. It is clearly not the money. Maybe it's the rush he gets or maybe it is an unexplained obsession. The filmmaker leaves it for the viewer to decide. Although Heisenberg tries to suggest the robberies provide Johann with an adrenaline rush similar to that he experiences while running marathons the character fails to show any sense of pleasure or catharsis that would make this parallel interesting.Technical aspects of the film are highly impressive and the incorporation of Johann into actual Vienna Marathon provides a real sense of authenticity. As a matter of execution the film's last act is undeniably thrilling. Exceptional work by steadicam operator Matthias Biber gives all the chases and action sequences a visceral energy. The Robber could have been a great representation of compulsive behavior. As is it is a rigid film that is technically sound with a fascinating lead protagonist we still know nothing about.".

After being released from prison for armed robbery he goes on to win a Viennese marathon. He is though a loner and his parole officer is concerned that he seems to shun the company of others  'the loneliness of the long distance runner' personified as it were. He soon moves in with an old flame who is still carrying a torch for him. He meanwhile remains as cold as a fish and aside from practice runs he starts to do armed robberies all over Austria. He seems to love the thrill of the chase as much as the loot he is making off with. What follows is a really extraordinary story of a life quite literally on the run. This is in German with good English sub titles.This is a very well made film with Lust putting in an excellent performance of a man who is so far removed from societal norms that he has his completely own set of values. This is based on a novel but the real story comes from Johan Kastenberger who did all his robberies in a Ronald Regan mask and his story is probably more sensational than as depicted here. Either way a really superb way to spend 100 minutes and a film I can recommend to all lovers of Euro based crime cinema.".

Admittedly Lust also plays a very interesting character a restless man who after being released from jail shines as a marathon runner and moonlights as a bank robber. And always he keeps running and just can't be stopped. He does not have any emotional connections initially but finally finds a woman who loves him even after she finds out what he does. However she is also the one who finally tells the police after she is worried they might shoot him during his flight. So when he was finally ready to open himself to another person he gets betrayed again. Still he calls her at the end when he realizes it's almost over.There are some intense scenes in here. In many scenes he threatens to shoot people if they won't let him flee in their cars. In one scene he kills his probation officer with a marathon trophy maybe the most intense scene of the film and also an interesting connection between his two lives. This movie is a pretty good character study from the psychological point of view and I recommend watching it. With its 100 minutes there were hardly any moments where I felt it dragged. Good job from everybody involved with this project.".

He then sanitized the story of this vicious sociopath who not only murdered one person and not his annoying parole officer by the way but is suspected of murdering 3 others. If this movie had been based on fiction then my high rating would be made by the fact that I have never been so engrossed by such a minimalist movie. All of the aesthetic choices Kastenberger made that support existential minimalism are pitch perfect. Fellow reader make the effort and read the history of Johann Kastenberger. Heisenberg clearly didn't want to make yet another movie about a compulsive and cruel robbermurderer so he took the real character and subtracted virtually all the idiosyncratic elements of Kastenberger's persona to give us the enigma in the film. Too bad cause Heisenberg clearly knows how to use all the crafts a director needs to make visually fascinating movies.".

The film is always in the present we're right there with him. The camera style and movement is compelling and tied so close to our lead we can't see another perspective. He's a great antihero. It's a survival film the lead character superbly played can't stop he keeps moving forward like an untamed animal acting in the only way he knows how. And I appreciate the filmmaker's restraint in not revealing every little motivation he has. This is based on a true story which I wasn't aware of going into it clearly the filmmaker understood the essence of the character was most important not every minute detail and I feel that's captured and conveyed brilliantly. I'm looking forward to checking out his other films".

The running sequences are good I'm a distance runner myself and they did a nice job portraying it the actor Andreas Lust had to do a lot of running for these and the flight sequences! On the DVDBD watch the extras about how they shot the Vienna City Marathon scenes during the actual event  even many spectators were fooled! Plus there's a lot of outdoor scenes on many different locations you have to wonder how they managed so many takes in just I believe 40 days of shooting. As a consequence light isn't always perfect but the film definitely has a very realistic look. While interesting to watch it's difficult to relate to this very quiet and coldblooded man. The girlfriend is of course madeup for the story in reality the robbers contacts to women were restricted to prostitutes yes he did spend some of that money. Maybe the film would be more involving if it were nearer to the reallife robber who seems to have been a pretty choleric type sometimes committing murder just out of a sudden rage.

	schema:reviewBody "This is an emotionally tale and very decent drama about the terrifying existence in Vilna ghetto including suffering  grisly executions  theatrical happenings  starvation and other grisly events until a terrible ending . Based on Joseph Sobol's play Ghetto recounts the last days of the Vilna Ghetto Theatre company . German troops entered Vilnius on 26 June 1941 followed by units of the Einsatzgruppe or death squads . Germans rule over Vilna and close Jews at a ghetto . It is commanded by the twentytwo year old nasty officer Kittel Sebastian Hulk in charge of the ghetto in the capital of Lithuania . When he finds the gorgeous Hayyah Erika Marozsan taking some beans from the German army he condemns her to death but when he is informed that she was a previous successful singer he decides to activate the old theater and promote spectacles . The Jew Chief of Police named Gens Heino Ferch uses the theater to save people and makes a sewing factory . Unlike in other ghettos the resistance movement in the Vilna Ghetto was not run by ghetto officials . Jacob Gens appointed head of the ghetto by the Nazis but originally chief of police ostensibly cooperated with German officials in stopping armed struggle.This is a portentous drama about Jews suffering in the Lithuanian holocaust . Very good performances from main cast as Heino Ferch as Jew chief police who save as much lives as he can and Sebastian Hulk as sadistic Nazi who kills relentlessly and a gorgeous Erika Marozsan as Jew singer suffering the anger from villain commandant. Filmmaker Audrius Juzenas correctly directs a spellbinding portrait about the holocaust based on true facts .Adding more details over largely described on the movie referred 'the Vilna ghetto ' the events happened on the following manner  Vilna Ghetto was called Yerushalayim of the Ghettos because it was known for its intellectual and cultural spirit. Before the war Vilnius had been known as Yerushalayim d'Lita Yiddish Jerusalem of Lithuania for the same reason. The center of cultural life in the ghetto was the Mefitze Haskole Library which was called the House of Culture. It contained a library holding 45000 volumes . Jewish groups organized events commemorating Yiddish and Hebrew authors and put on plays in these languages . The Vilna Ghetto was wellknown for its theatrical productions during World War II. Jacob Gens Heino Ferch the head of Jewish police and the ruler of the Vilna ghetto was given the responsibility for the starting of this theatre.Performances included poetry by Jewish Authors dramatizations of short stories and new work by the young ghetto people. The Ghetto Theatre was a great source of revenue and had a calming effect on the public. A total of 111 performances had been given by January 10th 1943 and a total of 34804 tickets were sold. The theatre was renovated to accommodate a bigger audience and create a betterlooking theatre for the public eye. This theatre permitted the nonAryan race to display their power through plays and songs .The last theatrical production The Flood was produced by the Swedish dramatist Henning Berger and opened in the summer of 1943 in the last week of this Ghetto's existence. This play set in an American saloon during a flood featured a group of people who banded together during a time of danger and need. In early 1943 the Germans caught a member of the Communist underground who revealed some contacts under torture and the Judenrat in response to German threats tried to turn Yitzhak Wittenberg the head of the FPO over to the Gestapo. The FPO The Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye United Partisan Organization was able to rescue him after he was seized in the apartment of Jacob Gens in a fight with Jewish ghetto police. Gens brought in heavies the leaders of the work brigades and effectively turned the majority of the population against the resistance members claiming they were provoking the Nazis and asking rhetorically whether it was worth sacrificing tens of thousands for the sake of one man. Ghetto prisoners assembled and demanded the FPO give Wittenberg up. Ultimately Wittenberg himself made the decision to submit to the Nazi demands. He was taken to Gestapo headquarters in Vilnius and was reportedly found dead in his cell the next morning. Most people believed he had committed suicide. The rumour had it that Gens had slipped him a cyanide pill in their final meeting.During roughly two years of its existence starvation disease street executions maltreatment and deportations to concentration camps and extermination camps reduced the population of the ghetto from an estimated 40000 to zero. Only several hundred people managed to survive mostly by hiding in the forests surrounding the town joining the Soviet partisans or finding shelter among sympathetic locals.".

The first point that impresses the viewer is certainly the cruelty and sadism of Kittel. Sebastian Hlk has an awesome performance in the role of the despicable Kittel and deserved a nomination to the Oscar. The screenplay does not spare the reality of the lives of the dwellers of this ghetto and their fight to survive in times of war including the beginning of their resistance. However it does not show the final destruction of the ghetto after a failed uprising on 01 September 1943 organized by the first Jewish partisan unit in Nazioccupied Europe the Fareinigte Partizaner Organizacje  the United Partisan Organization. The beauty of Erika Marozsn and the dramatic and conflictive position of Gens brilliantly performed by Heino Ferch are also amazing. The music score gives a touch of class to this great Lithuanian production. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Ghetto".

And the lighting is very good.The story is about a lot of Jewish people living in a ghetto during the 2nd word war in Lithuania. The main plot confuses you with the story of a German officerwho you can't tell or not is trying to save the Jews in the Ghetto. He wasis an artist and so he is drawn to the Jewish artists within the ghetto. They form a theatre while the Russians get ever closer to liberating them. And well I won't say any more and won't spoil it for anyone. Just watch it. It is an awesome film.".

Since this movie was spoken in English and everyone was talking about it I went to see it in one of the big theaters. It added to the experience to be in the city where the story took place but regardless it was very well done it just seemed to be unsure whether it was a musical play or war movie. That made it very original but also confusing at times. I see it as a lighthearted approach of something good during very bad times. Meaning that the tone of the movie switched often and took the audience of guard which is a great thing but it should have been done more subtle.I must add that the acting was superb and my hat's off to Hlk great performance!".

The same time a Jew police of Ghetto also struggles mentally the same way protecting and saving Jewish lives by killing and taking Jewish lives.

The same thing as if you are a Christian you found the Gospel of Juda is true?When you reach the point the Jew Police is taking the third child from each pair of parents for killing while assigning the second child to some parents with only one.

You were never sure who to trust who was good and who was bad though obviously the Nazis were easy to categorize as the bad guys. The movie is really about Gens and the position he is in between the Nazis and the Jews. It really isn't clear whether he does the right thing indeed it isn't clear that there IS a right thing to do. In this way I thought the movie was more threedimensional than The Pianist in which we know that our hero is an innocent victim. Here Gens could be an innocent victim or he could be a ruthless opportunist. Or he could be both. In my opinion that is what makes a character interesting. What impressed me the most about this movie however was the music. Please if anyone could find a soundtrack for it let me know. It was a great combination of opera swing and tango and captured the passion and drama of the times. While it could be argued that The Pianist was in Adrian Brody's own words about how a man's love of music saved him during horrible times that movie had almost NO music at all. This movie is a much better illustration of the theme of music and art being mankind's salvation.To me a good movie is one that makes me think one that rattles around in my head long after it ends. This movie passes the test as I've been thinking of it on and off for several days. Yes it is an odd blend of humor drama and horror but I thought its uniqueness and depth made it a great film.".

Although it has fairly good storyline it is definitely not as strong as movies such as the Pianist. There is no strong character growth and it is hard to tell who is really the main character. However it is interesting to watch how the story incorporates drama musical and some light humour all into a warthemed movie. I was bit disappointed in the acting especially the voice acting. The audio almost sounds like as if it was dubbed because the voice you hear does not really go with the character. I would have rather liked if they just spoke in German not in English. One of the main reason I watched it was because of Heino Ferch. Unfortunately his acting seems bit artificial when compared to his acting in der Untergang and der Tunnel.Overall it is a good film that could have been better.".

Niall MacGinnis portrays the friar whose nailing of the 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg created such a stir that it shook the very foundations of the medieval Church. This film shows the struggle between Luther and Rome and how the medieval Church did not fully explain things he questioned which led to him to be labeled a heretic.";

The focus is simply on Luther and his philosophy rather than on alot of the side elements that make todays movies popular. With very good acting and a straightforward timeline Martin Luther's story is told.  The movie begins with a quick steeing of both the history of the times and the prevelant religious attitudes.  After that it segues into Martin Luther as a successfull law student.  Because Luther's life developed one major event after another so the movie builds the story.  A lot of history was unfolding during Luther's time the middle of the Renaissance and some interesting historical facts can be gleaned from the movie.  Good direction very good acting and stark lighting all add to the historical significance of this work.".

This film shows the atmosphere of the times the mindset of the people and particularly Luther's own mental anguish about the condition of the Christian church at that time and his thoughts and feelings as the driving force of a major religious and political upheaval. Very illuminating is the seriousness with which personal beliefs are taken not only by the little people but by their worldly leaders as well in contrast to the callousness of the church leaders around the pope. It is also interesting how Luther benefited from the relatively fair and tolerant attitudes and practices of the 16th century which were completely wiped out a hundred years later.The acting in the movie is excellent as are the scenery and costumes shown in stark black and white photography. The producers spared no expense to present the wide range of political and religious figures with whom Luther interacted. The dialogs are poignant and always clearly understandable over any background music. Unfortunately my CD exhibits a rather poor video quality considering that it is based on a postWW2 bw movie. Still the film is fascinating to watch from beginning to end and if shown in high school would successfully replace a week of dry learning.".

Luther never envisioned his questions would lead to the Protestant Reformation but once it got beyond the initial query of the 95 thesis  when he was faced with either knuckling under or facing death by burning as a heretic  Luther proved himself the man to continue leading his reformation. He was not a flawless figure. He was selfcentered and resented rival heretics Zwingly John of Munster Calvin and he would become really vicious towards the Jews for failing to follow his leadership into true Christianity. In fact his diatribes against the Jews would become the true foundation of modern German antiSemitism. But he remains the founder of Protestantism.His flaws do not appear in this film which was made by the Lutheran Church.However the film is a pretty faithful account of his conflict with the organized Church and how it led to the creation of Protestantism and in particular Lutheranism. It gave Niall MacGinnis the best straight dramatic lead role in his career the closest second is his Karswell the villain in NIGHT OF THE DEMON. MacGinnis always was a superior supporting actor in small parts so it is worth noting that when he was given an important part like Luther he did the part well.".

Though compromised in this edition by the softness and slight damage of the available print the handsome production afforded the film itself resulted in two Academy Award nominations uncommon for an independentlymade effort  best cinematography and best blackandwhite art directionset decoration.MARTIN LUTHER is a curious collaboration between three countries  the U.S. Germany from where Martin Luther himself emanated and the U.K. in fact while the director and bitpart actor Irving Pichel is an American the lead here is played  superbly I might add  by the Irish character actor Niall MacGinnis perhaps bestknown for his chilling portrayal of Karswell the occultpracticing villain of Jacques Tourneurs CURSE OF THE DEMON 1957. His thoughtful performance is very effective in illustrating the various facets of Luthers personality his initial inner conflicts the layingdown of and firm conviction in his own beliefs as well as the strength necessary for opposing the power of the Church facing disrepute from both his peers and his congregation not to mention an eventual excommunication. Furthermore were also shown the buildup of support to his particular credo where it attracts people from all walks of lifeand even lands him a wife! The script does quite well in delineating the essential difference between the doctrine of the Catholic Church in its most oppressive state back when it was still a political force to be reckoned with and Luthers pragmatic but no less steadfast approach to religion the latter favors a strict adherence to Scriptures in the face of the Churchs fireandbrimstone teachings resorting to the deception of ignorant parishioners by proposing the worship of worthless holy relics and the offer of money in order to obtain indulgences in the afterlife or the callous bestowing of titles upon nonclerical albeit aristocratic subjects.When I was in Hollywood in 2005 I had caught LUTHER 1974 on TV directed by Guy Green from a stage rendition by John Osborne and featuring Stacy Keach in the title role its been released on DVD by Kino as part of The American Film Theater Collection. While that version too was undeniably interesting and effective the earlier cinematic i.e. less stagey treatment was perhaps the more satisfactory by the way theres been an even more recent biopic of the famous religious figure starring Joseph Fiennes which is readily available from my local DVD rental outlet.".

The Roman Catholic Church is presented has having forsaken its spiritual mission for geopolitical strategies yet it is Luther's idealism that of course wins out yet the bad consequences of individual interpretation the rise of eccentric religious cults and Christian fundamentalism are hinted at.Ultimately though this is a film about a quest for freedom of both conscience and freedom from a patronising corrupted priesthood with a monopoly on religious truth.By breaking from the practice of indulgences and the notion of priestly intercession and by triggering the breakup of the Holy Roman Empire Luther and his God granted Europe the freedoms from the twin yokes of tyranny and the feudal system that we enjoy today.The film ends with one of Luther's most famous selfpenned hymns a fitting tribute to a man who stood against the governing forces of his day in the name of truth. He preached faith alone and it was this faith which changed the face of Europe forever and regenerated the spirituality of the continent.".

The many flaws of Martin Luther his sexism his antiSemitism get no mention here. His contributions to theology and to the German culture the good ones are discussed at great length.Martin Luther is not THE founder of Protestantism he's the founder of one of the Protestant denominations. There was a fellow over in Switzerland named John Calvin a guy later on in Scotland named John Knox and even that wife slaughtering monarch in England Henry VIII all founded various Protestant denominations.Yet Luther a priest who originally wanted to be a lawyer and who attacked the ruling Roman Catholic Church certainly showed a lawyer's training. His famous 95 questions nailed to the church door in Wittemberg was nothing less than an indictment.The great contribution theologically speaking that Luther made was the notion that no one not even a Pope intercedes for man in his relationship with the Deity. One is saved by faith alone in the fact that Jesus is the Messiah who sacrificed himself for the sins of man.It should not be forgotten that at this time the Catholic church was very engaged in the geopolitics of Europe and the world as a temporal power as well as a center of faith. The Pope as a temporal ruler had temporal needs like the ruler of any other state maybe more so with his dual function. Hence the sale of indulgences which according to the Lutheran versions were dispensations for sins to come. I'm sure Catholics will differ but they didn't produce this film.Niall McGinniss makes a fine and upstanding Martin Luther. The film was shot on location in West Germany in the places mentioned in the story. The film also got Oscar nominations for ArtSet Design and black and white cinematography in its very graphic depiction of medieval Germany.It's not my view of Martin Luther but it certainly is the view that Lutherans certainly have of him.".

This version comes from the original negative material and is by far the finest you will see of this title  However the film does not survive in pristine form. It is in need of a restoration. Until this happens if it ever does you will find this issue to be quite fine with a number of little Extras that give some insight into present day sites of events in Martin Luther's life an interesting biography of how the film came to be made and the special way that it was brought to theatres as well as bios and photos of the actors and production crew.   This films was nominated for two Oscars in 1953 picked by the New York Times as one of the 10 best films of the year and generally acclaimed by most Christian groups except the Catholic Church of course who considers Martin Luther to be a heretic. I know the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints bought a number of 16 mm prints for use in their seminary programs. The power of this film in depicting the reformation period helped influence the LDS Church into starting its own motion picture department.   To me Luther's story is an important key needed in preparing the way for the restoration of the restored gospel in these latterdays which I believe happened when God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ appeared to the young Joseph Smith for others it will have a different effect  but the exciting thing about this film is that it tells its story accurately with great fairness and has power in performances words and images.

	schema:reviewBody "A film based on a historical plot is always difficult to make especially on the religious theme such as Martin Luther 1953. There will be always people who favor a particular interpretation of religious teachings and at the worst will state that they do not believe in the truthful presentation of the story. But nevertheless the authors of this picture give a notice at the beginning of the movie that it was a result of careful research of facts done by reformation scholars Theodore Tappert and Jaroslav Pelikan. I believe that authors coped with their tasks to represent the history of reformation started by Martin Luther even if the movie showed a too idealistic picture of the protagonist.First of all it is important to note that the film was shot in Germany where Martin Luther is a national hero that I why I do believe that film reflects Luther's real biography and his ideas without an author's vision of picture as most commercial movies do. Still I found that the primary intended audience of Lutheran Church Productions is English speaking Lutherans all around the world thus the movie portrays their progenitor in the best possible light.Martin Luther 1953 is a good movie that was able to represent on screen the complexity and inconsistency of the religious situation in Europe at the beginning of the 16th century the dominance of the church the unquestioning authority of the pope in Western Europe the lack of education of ordinary lay people who blindly follow instructions church leaders. As long as they carry the Word of God to people everything they do and claim should be considered as the truth. However Luther was a thirsty person for justice withdrawing from the Law School and trying to find justice in St. Augustine's Monastery. For almost two years he was following a strict regimen of ascetic piety he still didn't find an inner peace. His mentor monk Staupitz seeing Martin flagellating himself half to death states that he can't help his soul by punishing his body and send him to Holy Rome. In his trip to Rome where he supposed to help his troubled soul to reconcile Martin viseverse discovered the corruption of Roman Catholicism. He recognizes that symbols rituals are not the thing that should connect common people with a God. He believed that only faith and Jesus Christ can make you close to the God not the Church. Moreover at that time the Pope gave an order to Church sell indulgences for raising money for construction of St. Peters Cathedral. Indulgences offer people to buy forgiveness of their sins. As long as he already had internal doubts about this system Martin calls indulgences as not a salvation but a damnation of the soul and claims that it is not supported by the Scripture. The point of reference in his biography becomes the time when he goes to the University of Wittenberg to get a degree of Doctor of theology. From now on Luther offers questions and seeks evidence he is bold in his judgments and is not afraid of authorities. It was clearly shown in the movie when he and his followers burnt the books and texts which supported the power of the Pope.Considering the inconsistencies of the movie the central place of the movie of course is occupied by the famous 95 theses of Luther against indulgences that he nailed it to the door of the Catholic Church. It is considered as the beginning of the Reformation in Europe and the history of Protestantism. However insufficient attention is paid to other events. For example the process of translating the Bible into German such an important and responsible decision is shown somehow chaotic and erratic as if Luther simply took sat down and translated the Holy Scripture. In fact he devoted a whole year to this from 1521 to 1522. Moreover I think that the lack of information given about Martin's supporters like the German nobles.To conclude the whole film is a detailed story about the stages of a difficult journey shown in a slightly idealized way as a loved one and an outstanding personality can be idealized. Authors convinced me that this path was not for many  that only such a person as Martin Luther could persuade the people to resist the Pope and fundamentally revise all Christianity.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Film Martin Luther 1953 shows the major 16th century's movement which is now called Protestant Movement started by a monk Luther as a result of his attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church. The movement of Luther put and end of the Christian unity and marked the beginning of split of Christianity. In the 16th century Rome believed in the nonseparation of religion and government pope and an emperor. Luther condemned the church for its promises to forgive the sins in return for money contributions to the church and the increasing number of political rulers extending their power from behalf of a church.Film of Martin Luther's life begins with the depiction of his life as a monk that feels deep guilt for not loving a God and traces his life to the point where he separates from the Roman Church. The journey of Luther begins with his confession to the vicar of Catholic church that he cannot love a God that condemns the man for being evil by his nature. However the vicar sends Luther to Rome in order for the later to learn more about the God and find peace for his troubled soul. Luther sees and passes over all the relics of Catholic churches. The Catholic doctrine teaches and promises that those who pass over those relics such as the cross in altar of st.John the steps on which Jesus walked and fell in palace of Pilate among others will gain release of his soul from flames for certain thousand years. After 2years being in Rome Luther returns Augustinian monastery. However at return his teachers find Luther believing totally different interpretations of scripture than those taught by the Catholic church. Soon the preaches of Luther start to contradict the preaches of Roman church. Luther denied the authority of Roman church and taught his followers for obeying not human priest pope or church but God. Luther condemns the church for its emphasis on relics as the main focus of the religious practices arguing that the meaning of the prayer is lost as a result. He criticizes the church for extensive levies on peasants and ordinary men by giving them the false promise of forgiveness of sins in return. In turn Luther preaches that salvation can be attained not by buying indulgencies of a church as it was believed before but by believing and praying and reading the scripture. Such teachings were not heard before by the Catholics. And as it is not surprising the teachings of Luther greatly disturbed the Catholic church the pope and other priests who have been building their system of levies on believers and funded their expenses through those paper promises of forgiveness of sins. By such preaches Luther earned many enemies in the face of the highs of the church and political rulers. However the numerous attempts to fear him and make him silent did not persuade Luther to stop his way of finding the truth. Thus the overall unquestioned before authority of Catholic Church was now subject to debates.The heat around the Luther's teachings elevated when he released his 95 theses which was the work of his life. In this theses Luther argues that a man needs only Bible to be able to practice Christianity and to attain forgiveness of sins. Luther was condemned for exile and death by the emperor and the church. However his followers gave him a harbor and saved him from the anger of church. While his theses gained great popularity all over the Europe and the number of his followers rose dramatically. This work of Luther revoked the religious debates over the Europe finally resulting in the split of Christianity.The film tells the biography of the monk who searched for the truth by himself and attained it by denying the authority of anyone but God. However the movement of Luther can be criticized for bringing resentment to Christianity and its believers at the time when the unity was needed as never before. As it is known the 16th century is not only the time of the wake of Protestant movement but also the time of an increasing spread and influence of Islam in the Central Europe. Thus it can be argued that the debates within the Christianity were unnecessary in the face of the growing oppositional forces. However it can be said that Luther did not even attempted to separate the church he just wanted the Church to accept the scripture as the supreme code of religious conduct and practice. But the involvement of political figures such as the emperor in the deals of the church as well as the chase of a church itself after the material gains made the unity of Luther's teachings and the Catholic church's teachings impossible. Thus the importance of Luther's movement to the becoming and development of Christianity cannot be denied.".

But the involvement of political figures such as the emperor in the deals of the church as well as the chase of a church itself after the material gains made the unity of Luther's teachings and the Catholic church's teachings impossible. Thus the importance of Luther's movement to the becoming and development of Christianity cannot be denied.";

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Luther is biopic about the one after whom the film takes it's title made by Irving Pichel. It tells us the story of Protestant Reformation Movement that is closely associated with Martin Luther's biography that takes period between 1505 and 1530 A.D. One needs to emphasise the work of the director the writers and actors who take you to the atmosphere of that times with both their work and dedication personally I appreciated Niall MacGinnis' work and talent as I forgot that I am watching a movie at all. Everything starting with costumes background and dialogues especially give a sense of time travel experience. However one can note to oneself that authors have very pro Protestant views or at least the film and the depiction of Martin Luther gives that sense. He is portrayed in heroical role almost in connected to the role of Jesus Christ in the Christian religion. As there is some particular expectation towards movies that are said to be biographical there should be more human like depiction of them with all the flaws that people had during their lifetime the thing that one does not get from this movie since Martin Luther is shown as flawless figure with perfectly clear history with obedience to his faith thoughts and beliefs. Maybe it is because of my cynicism I personally cannot believe in that kind of flawlessness and some even minor realistic flaws would have earned my appreciation.It is very good movie even for general education without emphasis on religious side a movie about one man's struggle through life to find a meaning on something that he cares about. A movie about someone standing his ground against authority against all the world for example when he argues with other monks on his opinion a monk asks him who is Martin Luther's authority to base his opinion on to which Dr. Luther responds saying that he is his on authority to believe in. Moreover the fact that he creates an idea of individualistic faith is something that definitely worth attention that is actually well emphasised in the movie when he debates with his mentor telling the importance of faith alone in order to reach salvation Dr. Luther explicitly writes sola which means alone on his Latin Bible showing the audience the strength of his belief.In addition to those strong scenes and actions shown in the movie his strong belief and his strong character is even more revealed in the scenes where he is asked to recant on his thoughts that he had shown on his writings that were spread in Germany. His only response was Here I stand I can do no other. God help me. Amen that are his famous words. All these scenes are depicted with such a truthfulness and realness that one can do nothing but believe in what is happening Niall MacGinnis does a great work in showing all the emotions that you expect from a person of that type of Martin Luther as he speaks with passion and belief in his words. However that is what makes it feel like something more close to epos or a tale of a hero rather that a real human being. The flawlessness of the main character is what makes it so plastic and unreal because as it is biographical picture there is some expectations on seeing the real human real Martin Luther that can feel anger fear or bitter. There is a bit of subjectivity that can be understood. Overall with all the atmosphere music that creates an atmosphere of drama and intrigue costumes dialogues and performance makes this film a great work of art and history but not a biography.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film Martin Luther produced by AFIFA Film studios in 1953 West Germany represents the historically significant process of Protestant Reformation in a surprising way. As a person of nonChristian group of people I enjoyed the film directed by Irving Pichel who was one of the best revealers of extremely crucial religious and political shift in the history of Europe. According to IMDb the film has gained valuable nominations including Oscar for cinematography and artdecoration. From my perspective it is indeed so because while watching the video it is not so hard to dive into the atmosphere of the black and white film with its almost perfectly detailed decoration. Passing to the scenario and audio it was sometimes unclear what characters were talking about but by rewatching the film I hope most of the dialogues became understandable. The biography of inspiring Martin Luther that was shot in the film clearly explains how the dynamics of religious practices and beliefs have changed with influence o questioning the Catholic church and the one more significant consequence is that it directly influenced the political system in the Roman Empire. Although the film has some untold stories connected to the Martin Luther it should be considered as one of the main sources to understand the Protestant Reformation that influenced both belief and politics in Europe in 15th and 16th centuries.Young and energetic law student Martin Luther might always have been searching for the absolute truth the purpose of the life and his life mission and starts it in the way of Christianity probably because the church at those times had absolute power as they claim gained from divine doctrine. In fact his curiosity made him one of the leading monks in the church but in his mind he blamed himself for not loving the God as the fathers claimed they must. Nevertheless I was surprised that he did not stop his education and practices just because of the absence of pure love but rather started learning more and more. As the Holy Bible was written only in Latin that few monks understand fully even not considering other people Martin started learning Latin and translating to German which was way more commonly used. In the way of becoming Dr Luther he worked hard and worked on his faith only. His main goal was his faith and destiny not planned revolution by religious education.Sola Fide was his doctrine in short but it had long lasted war history against Luther. His journey to the battle of the truth starts with the indulgence made by fryer Tetzel in the early 16th century. The purpose of the indulgence in literal meaning was selling for the forgiveness or in other words heaven trade where people have demanded money for the forgiveness of all sins in return. Saxons at that time were deeply convinced that God has given divine dual authority to church and king so they can decide and interfere people's current life and hereafter. Words of Tetzel full forgiveness for all sins absolution for all punishments sounds just as a promotion of the super innovated product. But the reality is that as Luther says they put a hole in His drum you cannot buy God's mercy meaning that no one except God can judge forgive and make decisions about man's destiny. The play in God of the local authorities pushed Luther to write his debut doctrine called 95 Thesis in 1517 that he nailed on the door of the church but people did not really read it because they thought they can reach salvation only by performing what church has told. Even though the thesis was written in German which was commonly used by other people ignore it in the beginning. King even says letters have no trouble in Germany meaning that people will not understand anyway. Nevertheless everything comes out unexpectedly in a different way. Luther's doctrine questioning the dual authority which was not supported by the scripture diffuses to whole Roman land by causing paradox among the population because the paper was denying the whole Catholic practice that Christians perform by accepting it right. Some people start to compare Luther to Hus who was blamed for heresy and prosecuted later. However Martin Luther succeeds in his revolt because of the printing invention that multiplied the amount of the doctrine and even further was translated into various languages. In one scene we can see that one person explaining the story from the paper to ordinary people who used to obey to church only which shows that people started being interested in the debate and start their way to the conscience.Even though Martin Luther has succeeded in establishing the truth according to the scripture the film does not show his preference for the aristocracy. The faith only doctrine stating that man need only the faith and by it he can rich salvation influenced the revolt of peasants who thought that aristocrats are those they should blame that in the result hundreds of them have died. According to the lecture when that happen Luther prefers aristocrats supporting him and orders to kill those peasants but in the film he is represented as a merciful priest explaining to them that their religion is a religion of love. In general even it might have some unrelated scenes the film is suitable as a history of Martin Luther Protestant doctrine because the story in general has not been changed comparing to other sources.".

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Luther is a documentary movie filmed by Irving Pichel with the support of the Lutheran Church. This film is about the life of the German priest who decided to give up his study of law even if he was succeeded in that in order to devote himself into the monastic life. At that time the whole power in the Roman Empire was divided between the Emperor and the local Catholic Church. Even if he fully devoted his life into the Church and followed all strict rules of the religious doctrine he confessed that he could not love a God. Consequently his mentor wanted to expel him from the Church but Catholic theologian Staupitz convinced the Church further strict study will help to find Luther's way to love God. Staupitz was one of the first people in Luther's live with whom he argued the issue of the indulgence.The issue of giving the indulgence by the Church for the money led to the economic decline among both rich and poor people. So the Martin Luther was against this type of the indulgence as he thought that Church abuses their authority and seeks only their profit in order to become a superior power. Because of this contradiction to his belief he decided to find his own way to love and believe in God. Later on after his excommunication from the Church Martin Luther came to the conclusion that people can find their way attain the faith on God only when they will be able to read and understand the Bible. Therefore he decided to translate the whole Bible into the German language. Through this Bible he came to the conclusion that people do not need the Church. The only crucial thing for people should be their faith solely on Jesus Christ. After rejecting the authority of the Church he decided to continue his study but for that time as a theologist.At the beginning of the XVI century he took a degree of Doctor and as a result makes a decision to became a teacher. Moreover at that times Martin Luther wrote his set of doctrine called The NinetyFive Theses that aimed to convince people to reject the authority of the Church and find own way to attain a faith through the Bible. In order to share his doctrine with other Christians he nailed it to the door of the Catholic Church. Through teaching and his The NinetyFive theses he has begun to spread his ideology throughout the Holy Roman Empire. These interrelated events led to the emergence of the new branch of Christianity  Protestantism. The ideas of Protestantism founded by Martin Luther fully rejects the ideas of Catholic Church that were mostly based on the clergy meditation and monasticism. In the movie it was displayed through the scenes where Martin Luther was burning all books in that there was written the rules of Catholic churches.Overall the cinematography was not impressing as it was an old movie that was filmed when the overall cinematography was not fully developed. The quality of video and audio was to some extent poor and sometimes it was hard to understand some dialogue and visuals. On the other hand the symbolism and the content of the visuals were really outstanding and perfectly suits the overall content of this movie. Moreover the black and white colors and oldfashioned music displays the documentary mood of this movie. In addition the cast of this film was a surprisingly good even if in that times the art of acting was not popular enough in order to have such highly skilled actors that perfectly convey emotions of characters.At the moments when I noticed that the movie was filmed with the support of the Lutheran Church I was quite skeptical about this movie. I thought that this movie was created in order to propagate the beliefs of this Church and spread its ideology all over the world. However at the first scenes of this movie it was clarified that the scenario was based on the facts extracted from the research done by theological scholars Theodore Tappet and Jaroslav Pelikan that were the honorable Professors of Ivy league.As for me this film was a really good source of knowledge about the history of the Christianity.".

On the other hand the symbolism and the content of the visuals were really outstanding and perfectly suits the overall content of this movie. Moreover the black and white colors and oldfashioned music displays the documentary mood of this movie. In addition the cast of this film was a surprisingly good even if in that times the art of acting was not popular enough in order to have such highly skilled actors that perfectly convey emotions of characters.At the moments when I noticed that the movie was filmed with the support of the Lutheran Church I was quite skeptical about this movie. I thought that this movie was created in order to propagate the beliefs of this Church and spread its ideology all over the world. However at the first scenes of this movie it was clarified that the scenario was based on the facts extracted from the research done by theological scholars Theodore Tappet and Jaroslav Pelikan that were the honorable Professors of Ivy league.As for me this film was a really good source of knowledge about the history of the Christianity.";

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Luther is one of the significant figures in Christian history. He was a German monk who played key role in Protestant reformation which begun in 16th century. He made a doubt in traditional roman Catholicism which finally lead to split and creation Lutheran church. In the following movie we can see the life of this great person and the picture of world where and when he lived. It is important to know that movie was produced by Lutheran Church Production so this is how Lutherians see his life. In this film Luther is person who think with his own mind and brave enough to go against traditional Roman Catholicism. Starting from the very beginning of the film we were introduced with fact that at his time it was common believe that all human beings are full of sins. So if do not do something with it you go to hell. In that moment church had tradition of indulgencies. Any person can pay some price in order to let go of sins. This kind of system led to economical division. Martin Luther was against such kind of traditions. In his trip to holy city Rome he was introduced with traditional ceremonies of Roman Catholicism. Luther opposed such kind of symbols rituals and system of rule. He claims that God should be close to people. People should be able to directly connect to God not by Church. In one of the dialogues in this movie he was asked what should fill emptiness that would be created if we take of all those rituals symbols and traditions. Luther answered that man need only faith and Jesus Christ. By this dialogue we can clearly see his main idea about concept of true faith. Man don't need priest to be close to God the divinity of pop should be rejected. Going back to issues about indulgencies church used their ideas to make profit from common people fears and lack of education. There was interesting moment in the film where Luther was asked what would happen if common people will read holy text by his own and interpret it by his own. Martin answered that there would be more Christians. By this moment we can see that Martin Luther believed that every person should be able to read Bible and be close to God. In order to do that he translated Bible into German language so everybody will have chance to read it in their own language. As it can be seen in the movie Martin wrote articles and books so spreading them would help people. He went further and wrote ninetyfive theses where he opposes Catholic Church. In this work we can see basis of new flow of Christianity Protestantism. Most of these doctrines contradict with traditional Roman Catholicism. As it was previously sad traditional Roman Catholicism is built on a basis of system where priests are connection between men and God. Martin Luther rejected this kind of system and build the one where system based not on saints but on Scripture. There is a moment in the movie when Luther as a symbol of rejection burned books and texts which supported the power of Pope in presence of spectators. Such an action is a symbol of protest against divinity of Pope.In conclusion this movie is a good representation of Martin Luther's life and world where he lived. The film clearly indicated the position of traditional Roman Catholicism as a system which is based on power of priests and divinity of Pope. Church overused their privilege and used luck of education of ordinary people in order to gain profit. As it was sad it was common believe that humanity is full of evil and in order to clear yourself you should pay some money to church. Martin Luther rejected these ideals and tried to create possibility for ordinary people to read Bible and become closer to God without help of Church. Eliminating intermediate between person and God and creation condition for true faith was main idea of Martin Luther. Writing text and books that support those ideal and translation Bible into German spreading those works was made in order to reach those goals. Those ideals finally created new flow in Christianity named Lutheran Church. This Church is based on idea by grace alone through faith alone on the basis of Scripture alone. This is different from Catholic Church where authority comes from not only the Scripture but also Traditions. In overall as a movie created by Lutheran Church Production this picture is perfect representation of ideals that they stand for. In my opinion because of that this film became on sided and created idealistic picture of Martin Luther. Despite of this this picture is perfect for understanding the ideas on which Lutheran Church is based on.".

It was initiated by the German priest and theologist Martin Luther. Produced by RDDR Corporation Lutheran Church Productions and LutherFilmG.M.B.H. the movie was released in 1953. It was the fourth best movie of 1953 according to the National Board of Review and nominated for two Academy Awards for the Best Cinematography and Art DirectionSet Decoration 1.The movie portrayed the story of Martin Luther from a student of Law School at the University of Erfurt to a historical figure in the Church. There were different episodes demonstrating the attitude and views of Luther towards the faith and salvation. The events took place in 16th century Rome Empire ruled by Pope Leo X and Emperor Charles V. The predecessor of the Leo X had lied the foundation of the St. Peter's cathedral. So Pope was gathering resources for the construction via releasing indulgences. This fact became important as a trigger for spreading the Luther's doctrine. From the beginning of his monastic life Luther was seeking something missing. As he confessed later his unpardonable sin was not loving the God. This state of search brought Luther to the Scriptures. At that time his interpretations were considered radical particularly because they did not correspond to those of the Church. For example one of the scenes in the movie when Martin Luther encountered a drunk man who told him that his sins were forgiven as he had spent good money on the indulgences had triggered a cascade of important events. Luther tried to deliver to people the idea that when indulgencies are peddled bartered and sold  this is not a salvation this is a damnation of the soul. In short his point was that people cannot buy God's mercy. Luther explicitly put his reply into Ninety Five Theses written in Latin and nailed into the church door. It became the most read and printed writing that time in Germany. These actions rose conflict in which the emperor and Pope accused Luther of introducing new heretic dogma.Luther's dogma gathered numerous followers and profound changes were introduced. For instance marriage of nuns and monks and translation of Bible into German. So the main difference of Luther's position and Catholic Church became the authority of Pope with Luther's being We must serve God not people.In the first place the story of a man who brought changes into Church left very empowering impression. From my perspective the movie very accurately represented fundamental principles of the Protestant Church by drifting the plot around central ideas  God's mercy cannot be bought and the ultimate truth lies in Scriptures. For instance during the debates at Leipzig Luther interfered the authority of Pope for which he was proclaimed a heretic. Moreover his senior the vicar general released his vows as Augustinian monk. Nonetheless Martin Luther took a stand on his beliefs regarding the indulgencies and Pope's authority.Whole story accompanied with appropriate music decorations clothing cast's and production team's work immersed into the atmosphere of the Germany in 16th century. The white and black cinematography brought seriousness and drama to the picture. Dramatic music especially during dialogues of Luther with the vicar emperor and mass made his every word sound. Niall McGinnis starring Luther delivered confusion with value of symbols Pope and indulgences and persistence in views that he believed to be the truth with a convincing genuineness. I still remember the facial expression of Luther Niall McGinnis when he refused to retract his writing and tried delivering what he thought to be true to the Emperor Charles V.In addition I would like to bring attention to the script of the movie. The lines of Luther Frederick Pope Emperor and the vicar conveyed their position regarding the Church and politics as well as their emotions. Moreover they were catchy impressing and convincing.Above the cinema scenes there different pictures with narration of the events not only of Luther's life but also of Germany and the Empire at that period of time. This allowed to relate all of the portrayed events and see what where the effects of the actions of a just one man.Aside such a powerful plot decorations script music and cast the movie had minor historical inconsistencies. For instance the movie said that the man who bought the indulgences was not required to confess. In the reality however one who bought the indulgences for oneself must confess. Still the movie had a great consistency with significant historical dates. Furthermore the flow of the portrayed events facilitated the overall perception. Finally it was inspiring and empowering to watch a man that did not give up on his believes and faith who was not scared of authority and led the mass.".

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Luther is a 1953 biography movie about the formation of reformist identity of Martin Luther. The movie demonstrates the life and the main philosophy of Martin Luther about religion. As this is a biography film it encompasses the character traits and features of the reformist. What is significant is that the movie tells the story of how the different reasons stepbystep caused Martin Luther to aberrate the religious rituals of the Holy Roman Church.Regarding the plot movie begins with Martin graduating the University in the major of law and becoming a priest in Augustinian Order. In 16th century according to the movie the church required strict obedience from people. That is why Martin Luther as a friar had submitted to the Holy Church as others. Movie shows that Martin had doubts in the soul and could not find the peace within a soul from the beginning of his monastic life.Initial stumble at Church rituals began when Martin Luther confessed to another priest by uncovering the doubts of his soul by telling that he could not love God and proclaimed this as an 'unpardonable sin'. Luther's doubts only increased in its nature when he was sent to Rome and saw how the Church suggested indulgencies for visiting Holy Places. This was the turning point of Martin's thoughts as he started to believe that the people and laymen should interpret the Bible and Holy Scriptures by themselves to have sincere faith in their souls.The plot of the movie demonstrates the life changes of Martin Luther by coinciding them with the reformist ideas' appearance. Thus the particular events had influenced Martin in strengthening his thoughts. For instance it is seen how the certain procedure makes Martin Luther doubting the symbolic meaning of the priests' acquisitions and thinks it only exacerbates the Holy Truths and sacred meaning of the faith. He highlights the symbolization as the crutches to uphold the tottering faith rather than the symbol of devotion to God.In 1511 Luther obtains a degree as a Doctor of Theology and becomes a teacher. He has another argument with others by suggesting that it is the faith which is the most important in religion and all the relics and other features are not significant to the true faith. Luther's ideas formulated on a solid ground that only Christ and the faith are dominating in the Christianity  Man only needs Jesus Christ and People should leave solely by faith.Another major point that infixed Luther's thoughts is the fact that Holy Roman Church started to sell indulgencies to acquire money for building of St. Peters Cathedral. Martin Luther opposed the idea of selling indulgencies because he claimed that it is not supported by the Scripture. After proclaiming that the true Christians do not need to obtain indulgencies Roman Church excommunicated him though it did not stop Martin from comparing Church doctrines to the Holy Scripture.It is also significant that Martin Luther was compared to Jan Hus who had been burned at stake and proclaimed as heretic in 1415. Jan Hus was one of the founders of the Hussite movement and Luther suggested that despite he does not support Hussitism he had some common ideas with the Hussites  idea of one universal church. I have a right to believe freely and to be a slave for no man's authority. No one has authority over my conscience. In 1521 he appeared before the Diet and was obliged to retract from his writings. However Luther refuses to do so and tells that Truths is only written in the Holy Scripture not proclaimed by the Pope.Martin Luther is demonstrated as a strong personality who wished to find the truth in the Holy Scripture and God's teachings. His break from Catholicism highlighted the initiation of the reformation. There are dramatic moments of his speech which emphasized the core reformist ideas. The nailing of 95 Theses to the castle door is also demonstrated in the movie.Also the Holy Roman Church is shown as the corrupt institution. Movie shows Church as the one which needs to gain money to build cathedrals to recover from financial crisis and other.The movie shows the chronological events the historical settings and events such as the noticeable comparison with the Hussite reformist Jan Hus as well as there is good music background. What I liked about the film is that it is more a documentary movie rather than biographical art film. This means that the narration is shown without any fantastic features which boosts imagination and impresses the audience. Historical part is given much attention and the actors are playing very earnestly. Heresy! So be it...it is still the Truth. Thus this movie should be paid considerable attention.".

	schema:headline " Why did Martin Luther oppose indulgences?";
	schema:reviewBody "Martin Luther is a Christian theologian initiator of the Reformation translator of the Bible into German founder of Protestantism and of the evangelical Lutheran church. In the film he was represented as persistent principled forceful fearless purposeful brave and confident priest who fought for justice rights of the people and true faith. All of his actions and achievements were driven and initiated by increase of indulgencies in 16th century. This resulted in economic oppression of the ruling classes and impoverishment of the layman. However the reasons of Martin Luther being motivated to oppose indulgencies are deception of the church for the unscrupulous profit strict adherence to bible verses and belief that Catholicism as the power of the antichrist. Martin Luther considered that Roman Catholic church abused its position everywhere by giving indulgencies for money which resulted in a crises of faith. There is no doubt that the most common deception by church at that time was to ask indulgence for profits and convince that soul would surely go to heaven and as a result all sins would be forgiven. In 16th century the church unscrupulously profited from the stupidity and ignorance of common people. The popular movement of asking money by church caused an increase in general indignation in Europe. The movie shows that trading indulgencies with a shameless profit was the main cause to start struggle and oppression with the Catholic church. I think that the main idea of the Martin Luther's theses was to show that the priests are not intermediaries between God and man and that church representatives should not only set an example of true Christians. Martin Luther refuted the divinity of the pope's personality which was showed in a movie during Luther's discussion with Johann Ekk. The movie also clearly showed that he rejected church by showing his negative attitude toward the most of the sacraments symbols angels the worship of icons holy relics and questioned the authority of church activities by saying that man saves the soul not through the Church but through faith.  Another reason of Martin Luther being opposed to the indulgencies was his strong faith in God and strong adherence to the words of the Bible that contradicted what the church did at that time. According to Martin Luther remission of sins and salvation are only possible with the help of true faith not through indulgences and other church activities. For the reformer God was more than the crucified Christ. All ways of salvation are only based in the personal faith of man to God. By following to the rules and verses of the scripture Martin Luther claimed on the right of freedom of religion faith thoughts morality and consciousness. Therefore he translated the scripture to German and claimed that every person has a right to read Bible in his or her own language. The movie also showed how he referred constantly to the verses of Bible and tries to spread it by writing books and publishing articles. He wanted to show that the Bible is open and accessible to everyone in any language. It is not required to learn ancient sophisticated language in order to know the truth.  The third reason of Martin Luther rejecting indulgencies is his belief that Catholicism is the power of antichrist. He created 95 theses against indulgences posting on the doors of the Wittenberg Castle Church that were directed against the Catholic Church. They contained the important views of his new religious doctrine that developed to Protestantism which rejected the basic tenets of Catholicism. Luther rejected the Catholic idea of the need for the mediation of the church and Pope between man and God. Particularly he rejected Catholic monasticism the celibacy of the clergy the cult of the saints. The true ways of salvation and service to God are not in leaving the world but in serving the world. In addition Luther rejected the authority of the papal decrees and demanded the restoration of the authority of Scripture. The movie shows how Martin Luther burnt books papers with its canonical laws and special rules supporting the authority of Pope in the presence of many people. This Luther's action was done in the name of God for helping people to reach the truth. I think that Luther proved on the basis that was written in the Bible that the rule of Antichrist was fulfilled in the rule of the Papal Rome. In conclusion Martin Luther made a great contribution in the understanding of the true faith and abolishment of indulgences. However there are three reasons that made him to oppose indulgencies. The first is manipulation by the Catholic Church to get profits. The second reason is a strict adherence to bible verses and strong faith to a God. The third reason is a belief that Catholicism is the power of the antichrist.".

	onyx:emotionText "Martin Luther is a Christian theologian initiator of the Reformation translator of the Bible into German founder of Protestantism and of the evangelical Lutheran church. In the film he was represented as persistent principled forceful fearless purposeful brave and confident priest who fought for justice rights of the people and true faith. All of his actions and achievements were driven and initiated by increase of indulgencies in 16th century. This resulted in economic oppression of the ruling classes and impoverishment of the layman. However the reasons of Martin Luther being motivated to oppose indulgencies are deception of the church for the unscrupulous profit strict adherence to bible verses and belief that Catholicism as the power of the antichrist. Martin Luther considered that Roman Catholic church abused its position everywhere by giving indulgencies for money which resulted in a crises of faith. There is no doubt that the most common deception by church at that time was to ask indulgence for profits and convince that soul would surely go to heaven and as a result all sins would be forgiven. In 16th century the church unscrupulously profited from the stupidity and ignorance of common people. The popular movement of asking money by church caused an increase in general indignation in Europe. The movie shows that trading indulgencies with a shameless profit was the main cause to start struggle and oppression with the Catholic church. I think that the main idea of the Martin Luther's theses was to show that the priests are not intermediaries between God and man and that church representatives should not only set an example of true Christians. Martin Luther refuted the divinity of the pope's personality which was showed in a movie during Luther's discussion with Johann Ekk. The movie also clearly showed that he rejected church by showing his negative attitude toward the most of the sacraments symbols angels the worship of icons holy relics and questioned the authority of church activities by saying that man saves the soul not through the Church but through faith.  Another reason of Martin Luther being opposed to the indulgencies was his strong faith in God and strong adherence to the words of the Bible that contradicted what the church did at that time. According to Martin Luther remission of sins and salvation are only possible with the help of true faith not through indulgences and other church activities. For the reformer God was more than the crucified Christ. All ways of salvation are only based in the personal faith of man to God. By following to the rules and verses of the scripture Martin Luther claimed on the right of freedom of religion faith thoughts morality and consciousness. Therefore he translated the scripture to German and claimed that every person has a right to read Bible in his or her own language. The movie also showed how he referred constantly to the verses of Bible and tries to spread it by writing books and publishing articles. He wanted to show that the Bible is open and accessible to everyone in any language. It is not required to learn ancient sophisticated language in order to know the truth.  The third reason of Martin Luther rejecting indulgencies is his belief that Catholicism is the power of antichrist. He created 95 theses against indulgences posting on the doors of the Wittenberg Castle Church that were directed against the Catholic Church. They contained the important views of his new religious doctrine that developed to Protestantism which rejected the basic tenets of Catholicism. Luther rejected the Catholic idea of the need for the mediation of the church and Pope between man and God. Particularly he rejected Catholic monasticism the celibacy of the clergy the cult of the saints. The true ways of salvation and service to God are not in leaving the world but in serving the world.

While it disregards his flawed later life it properly focuses on the most important religious figure since the disciples and St. Paul. Specifically Martin Luther did as portrayed in this very good film identify Roman Catholic theology and practices which had no Biblical foundation. And again as accurate the movie shows us that he did not intend to undermine or leave the Roman Catholic Church but rather to bring it into a more Godly practice according to holy scripture. While other reviews on this site point out that the movie neglected the latter Luther life that ranted against Jews the fact is that every holy Biblical person except Jesus himself was flawed as well  From Moses down to David Solomon and later Peter and Paul so human flaws need not be the point when focusing on the man who changed major organized religion forever partially by his own Biblical study and partially by the reaction of the Roman Catholic hierarchy which is not unlike the politicized Jewish hierarchy of Jesus' time. The film also importantly includes the fact that Martin Luther thought it important for ordinary German Christians to understand the church rites and the Bible in their own language which they could not understand in Latin. The Roman Catholic constructs of indulgences the forgiveness of sins by monetary contributions to the church the intercession of dead religious figures named saints by the Catholic church the necessity for confession to a priest and salvation through human endeavors and achievements alone and finally the infallibility of the Pope were all challenged by Luther and ultimately formed the foundation of a worldwide religious reformation and the fact that this movie focuses on such importance with brilliant acting makes this a mustsee picture.".

Although the screenplay tends to overconcentrate on the vexed question of indulgences and to present its hero as a man with no flaws but a noirishly besetting overconcern for God's truth and the welfare of His people the writers admirably attempt to shed some favorable light on Luther's adversaries as well. They even make the point that it was never Luther's intention to found an opposing church but to correct Leo X's papal abuses and thus reform the Holy Roman i.e. the Catholic Church. In fact Protestantism is presented primarily as an attempt to check Leo's political and cultural ambitions. The question of Scripture as the foundation of faith is obviously not equally important in the movie's eyes but a secondary consideration. This is of course one way of avoiding the question What is Scripture? and noting the rather unpleasant but undeniable fact that  unknown to Luther  the Scriptural texts he based all his theology upon were somewhat corrupt.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well this was a huge disappointment! I really liked the first Piranha 3D film so I was looking forward to this. This is a lazy lifeless and pointless sequel that had no business being made. Instead of being so bad it's good like the first film this one is just so bad it's terrible. For starters the first Piranha film actually had likable characters and somewhat of a plot to it. This one has the thinest of a plot you can get and the characters are incredibly lifeless and not even the main character serves any purpose to the film at all. You'd think that with this being a sequel they would amp up the gore and deaths but the deaths in this one are actually tamer than the first and there's actually less of them. The film tries to be much more of a comedy this time around by adding more humor which all of it falls flat. The humor in this film is so awful and outdated thats it's hard to believe anyone over the age of 13 actually wrote this film. But what really annoyed me about this film is just how damn stupid it is! The writers couldn't even come up with a decent way to get these characters in a situation to set up a death scene and instead have them do something really stupid or come up with a really stupid reason to get them in a situation that sets up a lame death. The acting here even though it's suppose to be bad is bad even for a BMovie. And just when you think you will finally get a payoff after sitting through 55 minutes of crap the film presents you with a lazy and totally underwhelming climax that is filmed so poorly that most of the time you can't even tell what is going on And this really sucks because that was the highlight of the first film. And then the film presents us with an ending so stupid and forced that even those who can suspend their disbelief the most will be left frustrated with just how incredibly stupid the ending is. The film is a short althought it feels much longer 70 minutes followed by 11 minutes of credits that include a ton of lame outtakes. I can now see why The Weinstein Company decided to only release this in barely any theaters and just put in on VOD. I still can't believe how bad this movie was. The director John Gulager shouldn't ever be allowed to be involved with a film ever again because this guy can't direct to save his life. Alexandre Aja who directed the first film actually understood the material he was working with. John Gulager had no idea what the hell he was doing and just decided the wip out a POS to make a quick buck because he obviously didn't care about this film at all and just wanted to get paid. As far as the cameo's in the film go Gary Busey is only in the films opening scene and is wasted the only thing we get to see him do is light a cow's farts on fire. Ving Rhames cameo doesn't just feel forced but also is just really pathetic and sad to watch. The only positive things I can say about this film was that David Hasselfhoff's scenes are actually chuckle worthy and there's a lot of gorgeous nude women on screen many times. Even though i'm only giving the film 12 a star that feels generous. This film could've really been a blast and fun just like the first one was but it really is just an atrocity of a film that not even the biggest fans of the first one will enjoy. If you are looking for a fun BMovie go rent Piranha 3D and just forget that this film even exist. Piranha 3DD tries to so selfaward of itself that it just ends up being exactly what it's parodying.".

I can now see why The Weinstein Company decided to only release this in barely any theaters and just put in on VOD. I still can't believe how bad this movie was. The director John Gulager shouldn't ever be allowed to be involved with a film ever again because this guy can't direct to save his life. Alexandre Aja who directed the first film actually understood the material he was working with. John Gulager had no idea what the hell he was doing and just decided the wip out a POS to make a quick buck because he obviously didn't care about this film at all and just wanted to get paid. As far as the cameo's in the film go Gary Busey is only in the films opening scene and is wasted the only thing we get to see him do is light a cow's farts on fire. Ving Rhames cameo doesn't just feel forced but also is just really pathetic and sad to watch. The only positive things I can say about this film was that David Hasselfhoff's scenes are actually chuckle worthy and there's a lot of gorgeous nude women on screen many times. Even though i'm only giving the film 12 a star that feels generous. This film could've really been a blast and fun just like the first one was but it really is just an atrocity of a film that not even the biggest fans of the first one will enjoy. If you are looking for a fun BMovie go rent Piranha 3D and just forget that this film even exist. Piranha 3DD tries to so selfaward of itself that it just ends up being exactly what it's parodying.";

	schema:reviewBody "Wow. Just wow. Let me note that I enjoyed the first Piranha and went into this movie with an open mind despite horrible reviews. What a absolutely HORRIBLE sequel. The time around the directors have obviously run out of ideas. It was a sequel to a movie that didn't need a sequel. You can only get about 1 good movie from a concept as simple as piranhas and that's all but clear seeing as this movie sucked. First of all this movie is disgusting. You see a fat mans bloody ass the tip of a severed penis gore galore and not the good kind...the bad overly bloody fake looking kind and a piranha that swam up a girls v ag. At points you could tell the piranha's were puppets and the puns were cheesy one liners at best. The whole film made me nauseous and the deaths of several people were fake as fake can be. A guy gets decapitated from a yellow flag ribbon...yah...that's right...a guy's head gets severed though the neck bone and all by a piece of plastic that is soft stretchy only about 1 nanometer thick and not even sharp. There is also a guy who gets skewered through the eye because of an explosion that caused a trident to have impeccable aim falling from the sky. Also one of the main characters has enough aim to skewer a bag of chips and a piranha perfectly from a good 20 feet away which begs the question of how he is a lifeguard. The whole film makes no sense with a girl who has a seizure while having sex due to a piranha inside heronly to come back to life once a guy severs his pen!s and the kick butt black man from the first movie has a shot gun leg. And finally the ending sucked to an extreme. The piranhas have now begun to walk or really hop at the end only to cut off the entire head of a really nice innocent kid just for a cheesy one liner that wasn't even funny. In short this movie is complete an utter crap. Avoid watching unless you like stupid gross and fake movies.".

This followup to the 2010 movie is just honestly embarrassing. It had all the elements that the first movie had but everything goes horribly wrong with incompetent direction laughably bad acting and dialogue and some of the cheapest gore effects I've ever seen.Why is this movie so bad? Let's start with the plot  there is none. If you can buy the premise that piranhas are going to go in underground lakes and somehow end up in a water park swimming well then I have a bridge to sell you as well. The characters are all terrible. The one couple in the van early on exists only to die no other purpose no even attempted development. Yet later we see other characters mourning their disappearance only it's forgotten 5 minutes later. The one scene that people will probably remember involves a girl that had a piranha swim up her lady parts and somehow survive only to bite her boyfriend's penis during intercourse. Trying to be inventive there but really just shows the lack of any restraint with this movie. But even if you think the plot and acting are atrocious at least there will be good gore right? Wrong. The gore effects can be described in one word cheap. The special effects with the piranhas are terrible too  you wonder where they spent 20 million on this movie. Not to mention the inevitable massacre scene is shot so poorly that it has zero coherence and lacks any punch. It looks like they just poured some red dye in the pool and hired a few extras to flop around. The massacre scene in the first film had some of the best gore effects I'd ever seen. This is a joke of a followup.So which actors disgraced themselves for a paycheck? There is a cameo by David Hasselhoff where he's basically mocking himself but you have to wonder what is going through his head when his character mutters Welcome to rock bottom. I wonder if the irony is lost on this man. David Koechner is just obnoxious and terrible. Jerry O'Connell played this type of character way better in the first film. Every time Koechner was on screen I was just wanting him to get killed off already.And also surprisingly we don't even get any good nudity. All the extras they hired for this movie look like washed up strippers. None of the cute female leads goes topless. Maybe they ran out of budget and couldn't pay them enough to do it.I have a feeling that 95 of the people involved in this film will ever have meaningful work in Hollywood again thankfully. Don't waste your time.".

Which I like. Danielle Panabaker is great as the lead and done well with this film. Ving Rhames was back and that was just delightful. David Hasselfhoff  well what can you say about David? Just too awesome for words. Katrina Bowden gives us the best line in the film Josh cut off his penis because something came out of my vagina then of course Ving with his Bring me my legs. The other cast members were hilarious! It was great seeing some not so familiar faces. The effects again were not amazing but enjoyable non the less. The deaths were inventive and funny wait for the last one! And of course  Christopher Lloyd amazingly crazy once again. I gave the Piranha 3D 910 this one I give 810. It's awesome but the first one is well... AMAZING! Just don't take the film so seriously just enjoy it have a laugh and smile! When this comes on DVD I will have my beer and pizza ready! Great lads film but i'm sure the ladies will love it too! Please go and watch it so we can get a third  God knows what it'll be called...".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit that it is very hard to write a review for something this amazing but I will try my best to express it here.The sequel to the ever so popular Piranha 3D is back and my Lord it came back with a vengeance. Returning to the big screen with everything we loved about the first film but with even more substance thrown in to entice new fans of the series as well as keeping us existing ones impressed.The movie is set 12 months after the tragic events that transpired at Lake Victoria where at a nearby lake the first sign of the piranha's return is beckoned upon two unexpected townsfolk with a disastrous end. Now by the lake a new water park called 'Big Wet' is opening up to uplift the general public who have had a morbid and disconsolate year and what better way to attract customers than with scantily dressed women? But our main character Maddy has caught wind of the recent piranha attack and is in a desperate race against time to stop the piranhas from feasting on the unexpected public. This leads to some edge of your seat moments that leaves you totally immersed.This is the perfect example of how you don't need a complicated plot to make something great. The casting was perfection. It has all of the recognisable faces such as Danielle Panabaker Matt Bush and Katrina Bowden. And if these names are not making your jaw hit the floor then the two amazing cameos by Christopher Lloyd and David Hasselhoff certainly will. And let us not forget about the various porn stars scattered around in this movie. You would think that porn actresses can't act to save their lives and they are there for fan service but this movie has removed this ridiculous stereotype. From the beginning you can sense the raw emotion that these girls are portraying in their characters from the ecstasy of them enjoying the carefree lifestyle working at the water park to the anguish they must feel when they see on of their own friends attacked by a ruthless and unforgiving piranha.And you may be thinking that this adrenaline rush of a movie won't have any character development but that's where you're wrong. There is a love triangle in this movie that can give 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' a run for its money. Google it The conflicts between Kyle Chris Zylk an old flame of Maddy Danielle Panabaker and Barry Matt Bush a childhood friend who was secretly in love with our protagonist Maddy is electrifying it is very rare to see this much passion in modern cinema these days and provides an enjoyable side story to go with the already fantastic plot.The visuals in this movie was very simplistic to the point where compared to some other blockbusters out there it looks like some kid shot it from his blackberry. But this wasn't a bad thing. It shows that the visuals do not need to be excessive and it proves that you don't need a ridiculous budget to fund flashy FXs to stick in people's mind Looking at you Avatar. It also doesn't use cheap 3D tricks like a guy sticking his hand towards the screen but utilises the 3D to truly emerge you into the movie itself. When a piranha jumps out of the water you can sense the raw ferocity of it as it homes in on its unexpected targets which could only be provided with the inclusion of 3D.Walking into the cinema screen I had very low expectations but this film has done more than just exceeded them but made me reevaluate cinema as a medium. While writing this review I was hard pressed as to what score to give this as a perfect 10 may not give it justice to what may be one of the most influential movies of our generation.So I'd like to advise all movies goers to grab their jackets match down to the cinema and watch this masterpiece of a movie known as Piranha 3DD.".

Meanwhile in an underground lake nearby yet more ferocious Piranha hatch  make their way in the local water system killing  eating anyone that wanders into the water. With the grand summer opening of Big Wet the park is going to be packed full of people looking to have a good time but the killer Piranha manage to feast on them after being sucked into the park through water pipes. The Piranha seem unstoppable as they tear their victims apart...Directed by John Gulager the son of veteran actor Clu Gulager who has a small role in this I am sure the average person on the street will probably hate Piranha 3DD with it's stupidity moronic character's over the top gore in jokes film references  downright silliness but I have to say I really liked it  I am 100 serious when I make that statement. Every one of the 80 odd minutes that Pirahna 3DD lasts for is either gory funny or downright stupid  there's never a dull moment if nothing else. It takes a special kind of person to appreciate a film like Piranha 3DD I am that kind of person as I found the constant in jokes  references absolutely hilarious seriously I just found this so funny  during the moments that were supposed to be funny as well. Any scene with David Hasselhoff is just brilliant he makes fun of himself  his public image seemingly in good humour from a hotel room encounter with two gorgeous twenty something girls to his droll reaction to the carnage at the waterpark as he states the obvious when he says 'once these moron's get out of the water the fish are hardly likely to follow them home' to a really funny send up of the Baywatch opening credits just after the closing credits here as a curious little bonus. In fact the film itself lasts for a mere 70 minutes yet the end credits last for 12 minutes with lots of outtakes including what looks like a couple of deleted scenes the female life guard being strangled on her own whistle cord  messing around by the cast  crew. The whole film is just so much fun to watch from the first moments with the farting cow corpse to the scene in which Josh runs around with a Piranha clamped to the end of his penis before castrating himself to the young kid who gets his head bitten off at the very end. The more I think about Piranha 3DD the more I like it. There's plenty of gore although maybe not quite as much as the first  there's plenty of flesh on show with nude swimming pools  lots of horny teens wanting sex. Call me easily pleased but I laughed at the right places I got just about all the in jokes  film references  enjoyed the film as a whole too as it has a reasonable if not exactly brilliant story in fact the story is basically the same as the original Piranha 2010 but set in a waterpark rather than a big lake  it's considerably more funny.The special effects are alright the CGI Piranha look okay but not much else  I can't believe they roar like Lions. Whose decision was that exactly? It's the aspect of Piranha 3DD that I thought ended up really lame. There's some gore here there's plenty of blood  chewed up bodies there's another severed penis as in the original  to go with all the blood there's lots of nudity on show. Blood  boobs what more do you want? There's nothing particularly scary here there's not much buildup of tension  you can guess what's going to happen but it's still great fun. There are lots of bad taste humour  tastelessness going on a guy with a flapping Piranha stuck up his bum  the priceless line of dialogue where a woman says 'Josh cut of his penis because something came out of my vagina' which is surely one of the greatest lines ever spoken in a motion picture. Enough said. Noinvolved in the making of Piranha 3DD is taking it seriously so I suggest that anyone watching it doesn't either  just take it for what it is.The IMDb says that Piranha 3DD had a budget of about 20000000 which it total rubbish try about half that. Since I am blind in one eye I cannot watch films in 3D so I have no idea how effective it is here. Filmed in Wilmington in North Carolina. The cameos from Christopher Lloyd  Ving Rhames reprising their roles from the original are also pretty funny especially Rhames  his gun legs which he borough by saving money from 'not buying any socks'! Gary Busey also has a small cameo at the start. The rest of the cast are OK they were obviously chosen for their looks rather than their acting skills.Piranha 3DD is a film that the majority of people will hate  despise of that I have no doubt but for those of us who it was actually made for will probably love it. Sure it constantly tries to appeal to the lowest common denominator with it's nudity gore nastiness  outright silly sendups  gags but there's no harm in that. Is there?".

Even though its not a long film everything moves fast giving plenty of action along the way.Danielle Panabaker is great in the lead role David Hasslehoff has fun with his cameo and Christopher Llyod laps up his brief screen time.There's a decent amount of blood and gore but definitely nowhere near as much as the first. Also the scale of the film feels so much smaller then the previous entry you start to think that they released the films in the wrong order!!But having said that the film is such fun just like the first and there is never a dull moment thrown in with some great laughs ".

	schema:reviewBody "The aquatic penis munching and poor character choices continue in Piranha 3DD the even goofier followup to Alexandre Aja's surprisingly entertaining 2010 remake the former of which has just been made available on DVD and Bluray. Although containing plenty of both intentional and unintentional laughs 3DD often mistakes simpleminded schlock cinema for parody and ballsout nonsense for organic fun. The Weinstein CompanyDimension Films should strongly consider packing this disc with a six pack of beer combo offer.It's really no surprise that an influx of gratuitous nudity celebrity cameos as game and often ironically funny as they often are and heaps of sheer camp can do little to raise Piranha 3DD to the level of its predecessor. It's even less mysterious as to how populating this film with jerks ditsy bitches and pure morons who are seemingly all bipolar judging by their mood rationalizing and motivations fail to make for a compelling Bmovie. Of course we expect these humanshaped hunks of piranha fodder to make poor decisions for the sake of crimson water but when it seems like the writers are intentionally trying to craft most of these individuals with the IQ of waterlogged bait worms it comes off more as insulting.A year has passed since the massacre at Lake Victoria and following an eradication campaign that led to the complete and utter contamination of the water the town's tourist industry has been likewise extinguished. But to paraphrase Dr. Malcolm from Jurassic Park life finds a way and a newly evolved school of prehistoric nasties has managed to elope to another nearby lake which unlucky for its inhabitants supplies the local water park called The Big Wet. Oh and in case you were even going to ask these piranha have mutated to thrive in chlorinated water or something so the attack may in fact commence without delay. Of the things to enjoy in Piranha 3DD it's bar none the extended cameos from Ving Rhames complete with a shotgun leg and a boozeswilling outofshape David Hasselhoff whose selflampooning is the only effective instance of parody to be found in this sequel. His reluctant celebrity appearance at the opening of The Big Wet amounts to nearly all of the films involuntary chuckles and his bond with a young boy which forms because he is the only one who doesn't recognize him as the star from Baywatch is close to the stuff of comedy gold. Aside from those fleeting moments of inspiration Piranha 3DD is missed opportunity after miscalculated setpiece. I mean if you've managed to devise a scenario where a fish has managed to enter and live in a woman's vagina and then manage to overlook the chance to make an eating out joke the filmmakers have failed us all. As far as high camp is concerned you could certainly find more blas fare though that doesn't excuse this film from being an unnecessary sequel that seems to think its audience consists of horny preteens who have never seen a proper parody rather than horror buffs looking for a faithful and lovingly crafted followup to Piranha 3D.".

What we see readily earns this flick its R rating within 10 minutes. There is political incorrectness and then there is Girls Gone Wild outtakes intercut with cheap indie horror.

	schema:reviewBody "Piranha 3DD is the first 3D film or 3DD film in this case to be released both theatrically and through video on demand. I wouldn't even call this 3D. All you get are creatures breasts blood water and vomit careening towards the camera amateurishly and in an unnecessary fashion. At least it's in bright colors and not dimmed with a ludicrous surcharge.The film is an affront to the genre of horrorcomedy shielded by the unacceptable and numbing phrase leave your brain at the door and atrociously erected off of clichs idiocy and nude characters. The original Piranha 3D was a surprising summer success and to be fair it wasn't horrifically awful. The actors in it knew they were in a goofy outrageous Bmovie ode and some sequences were well arranged. The problem? The CGI which killed many of the death scenes making them look implausible and unrealistic virtually killed the mood and the idea that this was a low budget cheesy horror flick.And now the marginally passable horror flick has a sequel leaching off of it that pushes the envelope of parody so far that it becomes dreadfully incompetent. It is so indulgent always trying to be so witty and cute with its puns references and spoofelements that the stench of desperation quickly fogs the screen.Instead of a beach this time we are taken to a waterpark ran by the royally perverted and careless stepdad of our main character Koecher. He is so preoccupied with prepubescent fantasies that he ignores everyone around him completely. His daughter Maddy Panabaker coowner of the waterpark and aspiring marine biologist is concerned that with the rumor of piranhas swimming through sewers and drain pipes that they may be a hazard to the park. Her stepdad doesn't listen and it isn't before long that he gets his comeuppance.The remainder of the picture is a mindless shows for the kiddies containing more breasts than anything I've seen this whole year sometimes even two or more pairs per frame. The film is so juvenile crass and filthyminded and the characters so impotent onenote and poor that one can not help either drifting away while watching or just simply not caring.There is a degrading nasty scene in the film I'd like to discuss. It involves a piranha festering around the part of a woman that goes without saying before it leapfrogs and jumps out onto that part of a man that goes without saying before he has to cut the whole thing off with scissors. The scene is nothing short of unnecessary and borderline reprehensible.One thing that Piranha 3D had was the starpower its sequel woefully lacks. It had the appearances of great actors like Elizabeth Shue Jerry O'Connell Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd showing despite their well deserved success could still pull off a campy exercise relatively well. Lloyd makes a cameo in a scene far too short Rhames does too and earns the only laughs the picture sees and David Hasselhoff portraying himself as a lifeguard shows us why he has fallen off the face of the mainstream world in the first place.Now maybe I'm being too brazen and unfair. Piranha 3DD is a fairly harmless piece of work but not a good one at that. Its structure of scantily clad women many fullfrontally nude phonedin characters too little too late cameos third rate special effects and cheap nonexistent suspense wears so thin so quickly it becomes appalling. I have no problem with horror even when it creates a hybrid with the neighboring genre of comedy but this is a work of hybrid indulgence and overkill.NOTE The film ends the same way Piranha 3D ended with an abrupt unsuspecting scene that provides us with one last quick jump and conveniently leaves the franchise open for another sequel. Though with the very secluded release of this sequel I wouldn't put all my money on 3DDD so quickly.Starring Danielle Panabaker Matt Bush David Koechner Chris Zylka Katrina Bowden Gary Busey Christopher Lloyd and David Hasselhoff.

	schema:reviewBody "What can be said about Piranha 3DD that others have not already said. I have to admit not much more.This is a sequel made on an obviously smaller budget which is not actually a bad thingThe film is nice to look at it has that sunshine bubblegum look that throws back to 1980s comedies. There are less locations and sets used. The support castnaked women I suspect were deliberately employed because they were ropey looking and were probably past their prime strippers. The story itself is secondary and so it should be the viewer wants one thing only hungry piranhas OK two the male viewer also wants female boobs. In the first 30 minutes it is a boob fest but once David Hasslehoff appears the boobs end and are replaced by moobs excellent use of slow motion.In the UK Mr Hasselhoff is a living joke and represents all that is down market about the US. The use of Mr Hasslehoff is one of the films revelations as he plays along with the script and just rips his entire persona to pieces if he wins a golden raspberry or even gets nominated he should accept it with pride. Gary Busey opening cameo meant nothing to me I think it was a gag that only Americans will understand. The director gives his father a nice cameo as well. Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames rip their scenes to pieces BUT do come out of the film with their dignity intact. This film probably explains why Rhames was not available for Mission Impossible 4. Who wants Cruise when they can have a scene blasting piranhas out of the water.The lead actors were very bland and nondescript and this helped the viewer root for the annihilation of the cast. Some of the gore is good and inventive.I don't think this film will clean up at the box office but I think it will have a long after life on home media. The use of 3D does get wearisome after a while and found myself taking the glasses for long stretches of the action. Luckily some of it played OK in this situation".

The movie could also be referred to as Redemption because that's definitely what you'll see this as if you have been disappointed with Bruce's recent efforts.However I would recommend that you not go into the movie expecting a Die Hard clone. Hostage sacrifices heavy action and humor for a darker more characterdriven tale and it works. THIS is how a thriller should be! Things start off on an intense note as we see a grizzledlooking Bruce Willis attempting to negotiate with a psycho who has locked himself and his family in their house. He's got a gun and he's clearly not right in the head. I will not reveal what happens but flash forward a year later and having burnt himself out in the negotiation business Willis is now a police chief in a smaller town. You think he'll be called on to use his negotiation skills again? If you say no then please let me slap you upon the cheek.The thrills only intensify from there once the trailer park trio takes Kevin Pollack's family hostage. I really like the fact that we have two sets of bad guys here. There are the white collar criminals who remain faceless yet ruthless in their desire to get what they want. Then there are the blue collar boys who make a stupid mistake and get in way over their heads.I also appreciate the fact that the blue collar bad boys aren't onedimensional. Jonathan Tucker plays the older brother Dennis Kelly and he does a great job of making his character somewhat sympathetic. He's a smalltime wannabe tough guy who gets himself in a very bad situation that only escalates as the movie progresses. As the situation worsens we see that Dennis regrets what he's done. He obviously wants to be anywhere else at the moment. He's scared but he continues to try to talk tough. He's reaping the consequences of falling in with the likes of Mars.Mars portrayed by the showstealing Ben Foster is a longhaired black clotheswearing troublemaker. His back story is completely a mystery at the beginning but we deliberately begin to see that he may not be quite as sympathetic as the others. Is he pure evil? Coldblooded? Misunderstood? Regretful? Revealing anything would be a disservice to your viewing enjoyment so I'm not saying anymore except that the character is very welldeveloped.I know it's only March but other than Million Dollar Baby Hostage is the best movie I've seen this year. If you want a fun suspenseful night at the movies then ignore the critics whining and moaning about clichs and improbabilities and go check out Hostage. I love the irony in the fact that half of the negative reviews on Rottentomatoes complain about the clichs in the movie. Wow at least THAT complaint isn't clich or anything. Try a little originality yourself.Some of these critics like to go to WalMart before a movie like this and purchase the biggest most industrial strength Nitpicker they can find. You didn't know that was an actual tool? Oh yes. They're owned by every single uptight critic who whiteknuckle clenches his Movie Snobbery PhD degree at all action and thriller movies. Don't listen to 'em. Hostage is a movie for movie fans not movie elitists.THE GIST Are you in the mood for a dark intense edgeofyour seat thriller? Then Hostage will most certainly entertain. If you're the type of moviegoer who only knows how to complain about clichs and coincidences then I'm sure you'll do the same here. I recommend loosening up and enjoying life a little.Rating 4.5 out of 5".

No cheap tricks every second is well written superb acted and directed. The same with the soundtrack and  as I said before  the visuals.Hostage is a kind of violent Film noir in a MTV a like style. A real ride. I don't want to tell much about the story. Go and see!";

Bruce Willis portrays his character so accurately ...in the Bruce Willis way..as only a veteran actor can and you can be assured Hostage will become one of his most notable films. His emotional range was tested time and time again and he passed with flying colors. Another noteworthy mention should be for Ben Foster in his role as Mars Krupcheck. I almost felt sorry for him. His tormented and demented character came through so vividly in his glaring eyes. The overall performances by all cast was excellent...even the Beagle. Thanks for the adrenaline rush.".

Artistically and dialogue wise this movie is lacking except for the first scene but this is to be expected from a Bruce Willis film. As a an actionthriller the movie hits the mark. It is noir gritty violent and similar to the director's Florent Siri style used for his 2002 film The Nest. Several very cool shots by the cinematographer tie this movie together. This is a great movie to go watch on a Saturday night with friends. You will be thoroughly entertained by Willis who is best suited for this type of role.".

Very sinister and portrays Mars with great capability. The movie was darker than I expected but I liked it better this way it was more believable and scarier...a real thrill ride!! There is not one actor that could've done a better job. Bruce Willis is his great usual self he is heroic and tough. Jimmy Bennet who plays Tommy is so unbelievably cute as well. He also is great in the movie. The movie has a film noir feeling to it which is really cool. The score appeals to the film noir aspect as well. I also agree with the other voters in that the movie is very visual not sugarcoated or anything like that. I was kept on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie with the suspenseful twists that I didn't expect. All in all I loved it and will be first in line to pay to see it again on the big screen opening day. I would recommend this movie for those who like thrillers suspense action and those who are just looking to see a really good movie. Hope this review helps!

The innovative credits drew me in and I thought I was going to see a cool S.W.A.T. vs. young punks holed up in a fortresslike mansion movie. But after the credits we descend into standardissue fare with Willis overdoing the acting as he bungles a hostage situation as a bigtime LAPD negotiator. With his unkempt appearance and ridiculous messiahlike overacting Willis is a joke.Fast forward to the present day where Willis is a Chief of Police in nocrime Mondays lowcrime Tuesdays suburbia and the real story starts. Three nogood youths in a beater truck spot a Cadillac Escalade rant about rich people Escaladerich people? not in LA where this movie takes place and decide to steal the car by breaking into the drivers' fortress mansion highup in the canyon areas of greater Los Angeles. Things go wrong and the Escalade's driver teen daughter and young son are held hostage by the violent and unpredictable boys but not before the silent alarm gets activated by the resourceful son and Willis reenters the picture.Unforntuately with Willis back in the picture we aren't allowed to have a straightforward hostage movie and we're presented with a twist as Willis' family is also taken hostage by a shadowy group intent on getting their hands on a disk of offshore account numbers. The problem the disk belongs to the Escalade driver Kevin Pollak he's unconscious and may die and nobody knows where this disk is hidden. Willis has to get the disk by any means possible even if it means violating every hostage negotiator rule which he does with impunity.This setup is what destroys the movie. It's so implausiblefirst that a Chief of Police and veteran hostage negotiator would fail to let other law enforcement aware of the situation and secondly that the other law enforcement agencies who come into the picture would allow a raving lunatic like Willis to behave as he does and control the scene. In any real hostage situation Willis would have been instantly removed from the scene and taken to a hospital for a mental eval regardless of his rank. And the idea that a bunk of blackclad hooded FBI tactical HRT members would be able to bust into a hostage situation and assume command with little resistance from a fairly large sheriff's department is ridiculous.The best actor is this movie is the housea fortresslike mansion built up next to the face of a cliff and outfitted with amazing hightech security. But not hightech enough to stop three loser teens from climbing the fence and entering the home unnoticed! The best scenes involve the young son scurrying around unnoticed in the air ducts which gives him a flyonthewall view of the goings on of the trio in the home's many rooms. If the film had centered on the fortress and dealt with the family's plight and their response to their situation I liked the Stockholm syndromelike response of the teen daughter to the creepy sexual advances made by the most disturbed of the trio the film may have resonated more. Instead we got a bifurcated plot that never really engages the viewer.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Hostage";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been some time since I last saw a movie with creative opening credits. This one is unique with comic book like panels and graphics which looks suspiciously like Sin City capturing different aspects of first responders in a hostage crisis before dissolving into real life and putting everything into perspective.And we see Bruce Willis with hair! Lots of it! Well at least for the opening tense and engaging scene. He seems to have monopolized the role of the world weary cop this time a renowned hostage crisis negotiator until the mission goes awry and he literally has blood on his hands.We fast forward to today and we see the Willis we're all too familiar with  bald and into a career as a small town police chief. Before you can say bring on the action! 3 teenage delinquents hold a man and his 2 children hostage in their swanky ultra modern home.To add to the mix there's something shady going on behind the man held hostage and given Willis' reputation as an exhotshot negotiator he's now blackmailed by unidentified masked men holding his own family hostage who want a DVD from the house with probably important information don't ask. So Willis has to use his smarts play both sides putting his skills into practice and wiggle out of both situations  get the hostages safe deliver what the masked men wants and in turn guarantee safe passage for his own family. Naturally when you play both sides those on the side of the law always question your motives as you deviate from the book.What intrigues me is the negotiation process  between Willis and the hostage taking delinquents and between Willis and the professional masked men  which takes centerstage in any hostage drama. I've been reading up a bit on crisis negotiation and some aspects of the movie does seem to apply the principles of what I have read which is cool.It's a thrill from start to end and this film delivers with 2 finales tying up the 2 major plots. While at times predictable the superb delivery by the cast does not bore you though some might think that having unidentified masked men seems a little too convenient as their motives go unexplained.This is based on a novel so I might just check out the book.

	onyx:emotionText "It's been some time since I last saw a movie with creative opening credits. This one is unique with comic book like panels and graphics which looks suspiciously like Sin City capturing different aspects of first responders in a hostage crisis before dissolving into real life and putting everything into perspective.And we see Bruce Willis with hair! Lots of it! Well at least for the opening tense and engaging scene. He seems to have monopolized the role of the world weary cop this time a renowned hostage crisis negotiator until the mission goes awry and he literally has blood on his hands.We fast forward to today and we see the Willis we're all too familiar with  bald and into a career as a small town police chief. Before you can say bring on the action! 3 teenage delinquents hold a man and his 2 children hostage in their swanky ultra modern home.To add to the mix there's something shady going on behind the man held hostage and given Willis' reputation as an exhotshot negotiator he's now blackmailed by unidentified masked men holding his own family hostage who want a DVD from the house with probably important information don't ask. So Willis has to use his smarts play both sides putting his skills into practice and wiggle out of both situations  get the hostages safe deliver what the masked men wants and in turn guarantee safe passage for his own family. Naturally when you play both sides those on the side of the law always question your motives as you deviate from the book.What intrigues me is the negotiation process  between Willis and the hostage taking delinquents and between Willis and the professional masked men  which takes centerstage in any hostage drama. I've been reading up a bit on crisis negotiation and some aspects of the movie does seem to apply the principles of what I have read which is cool.It's a thrill from start to end and this film delivers with 2 finales tying up the 2 major plots. While at times predictable the superb delivery by the cast does not bore you though some might think that having unidentified masked men seems a little too convenient as their motives go unexplained.This is based on a novel so I might just check out the book. And if Willis' character is called John McClane this could well be a worthy addition to the Die Hard franchise.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's not really worth going on about the plot of this movie or really anything else about it. Three kids enter a house and take the pater familias and his two young children hostage. Willis is the negotiator for the Bristol Camino Police Department. If you can get past the improbable name for the community a macaronic hybrid of Olde Englishe and Spanish maybe you'll find the rest of the movie rewarding in a way I didn't.Points of originality. While trying to extricate the hostage family from its opulent household Willis learns that his OWN family has been taken hostage by a group of embezzlers who want to recover evidence against themselves from the house of the hostage family. Are you following this so far? The point is that instead of one menace to Willis's mind and body you will now have three 1 the young kids who invaded the house in the first place 2 the criminal enterprise that doesn't want the evidence to get into the wrong hands and 3 the chief hood dressed and masked entirely in black who leads the team of the criminal enterprise in their attempt to make sure they recover the incriminating evidence which appears to have been recorded on a CD hidden within the keep case of a DVD of a movie called Heaven Can Wait. Why  you the discerning viewer ask  must there be three antagonists? Well because that provides for three action climaxes. Or rather one climax preceded by a penultimate climax preceded by an antepenultimate climax. That last word means third from last. I had to look it up in the dictionary. Two of the climaxes end in full body burns and bullet holes. I wasn't awake for the last.Something though that I found myself missing. What happened to the car chase? Oh sure there is clich after clich in this stultifyingly dumb action movie. The writers must have been proud of thinking up the line I know you're scared because they use it three times. But no action movie is complete without a CAR CHASE. The best this one can do is have Willis jam on the brakes of his speeding police van with Bristol Camino painted prominently on its door and the van spins around like an ice skater doing a butterfly jump.This is full of suspense and thrills  and that's all. Want to see a good movie about hostage situations? Rent Dog Day Afternoon.".

Talley can't prevent the set of events that happens when the trigger man goes berserk and doesn't want to hear what Talley has to tell him.Fast forward to a year after that incident and we see Talley again. By now he has shaved his hair and beard and by the magic of the movies he is transformed in Bruce Willis a favorite action hero of many films of this genre. As Talley he is now working in a small suburban town where soon will be the center of the TV news on all the news channels.Dennis and Kevin who are brothers and their friend Mars like the car that Walter Smith is driving. They follow the car to a remote house that has the looks of a fortress. Walter and his children the teen ager Jennifer and the small boy Tommy are getting ready to order something to eat at home. Little do they know the trio of bandits have decided to invade their home and take the car and whatever they can.When everything goes bad Jeff Talley as the chief of police of that locale comes to the house and realizes what's going on. To make matters worse Walter Smith is a criminal accountant that is fronting some bad criminals. Smith possesses the key to their ill gotten fortune and in order to ensure he will deliver the higher ups decide to kidnap Talley's wife and daughter to make him do whatever they dictate in order to assure their money is safe.Back at the house the trio of young criminals make the blunder of almost killing Walter Smith as everything unravels because the situation goes beyond their control. Mars who is the cruelest one of the three takes matters into his own to create havoc but Talley is able to deal with them and his family captors as we expected him to do.Bruce Willis' role as Talley has been humanized. He is not the hero that shows no feeling in his pursuit of justice. When his family becomes part of the equation he realizes he is cornered and must act accordingly. Mr. Willis' contribution to the film although a bit over the top but then again it wouldn't be a good action film otherwise is effective in bringing all the elements together. Ben Foster plays the mercurial Mars the vilest of the three youths that break into the Smith household. His performance goes from being a cool killer to a desperate man who will do anything to destroy before letting him be taken away.As an action film and as directed by Florent Siri Hostage is a good entertainment that will not disappoint. The novel by Robert Crais was adapted by Doug Richardson and produces a film that is entertaining and while it doesn't break new ground it's recommended for fans of this type of movies.".

Ever since Die Hard incidentally my favourite film Bruce Willis has been the 'everyman' action hero of choice. If you're in a jam with serious badass criminals be it robbers assassins or even intergalactic tyrants he's the 'the guy' you'll want on your side. So if you're family were ever to be taken hostage by scumbags and it looked like gun play would be necessary Bruce should be the only call you make.So here's Hostage the first English language film of hotshot French director Florent Siri. You might not have seen his last film 'The Nest'  it was a tense action thriller that covered similar themes fear mental suffering empathy cowardice. Anyway Hostage is another deliciously dark tale of crime and retribution  you know how it goes  dumb but dangerous kids take family hostage then realise that they may have gotten over their heads when it turns out that the dad is actually the accountant for a seriously shady bunch of crims. Bruce plays local Sheriff Jeff Talley who used to be a hostage negotiator but was dismissed for letting a young family get butchered by one of the kidnappers he failed to 'talk down'.Things get more complicated when the shady crims take Talley's family hostage and force him to try and retrieve something from the under siege house. It's a good set up but it wouldn't have worked as just a standard Hollywood 'production line' action film. This is why Siri is directing  he's definitely 'one to watch' because he lovingly creates a film that oozes style brutal violence and has characters that you can't help finding interesting.Credit should go to most of the cast too Foster delivers an iconic teen psycho 17 year old Michelle Horn lives up to her name as the daughter in peril and Kevin 'voice actor from Ewoks The Battle for Endor' Pollak is good as the dad.But this is Bruce's film and he should be proud of it he should also work with Siri again if he gets chance as the guy is quality and I can't wait to see what he does next!!".

We can identify with the characters and that's one of the most important things in filmmaking.Overall the movie is pretty great. Don't go into it expecting to find just another action movie absent are the underdeveloped characters and the thrilling car chases. Also don't go in expecting to find typical action star Bruce Willis absent is the usual playfulness of his most famous herocop character. That is to say don't judge a movie by its poster.

A lot of this may be because of his choice of projects like this one in which the special effects distract from the performances. There is great economy in Willis' performance here. Take the scene for example in which he learns his family has been kidnapped the way he shifts from rage and fear for them to determination. It's a small moment in the film I mean the moment when his character makes that shift going from the futile almost impotent rage to the determination but watch Willis in the scene the way he expresses that transformation.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was much too convoluted for its own good. Bruce Willis is fine in his ultraclich role of the damaged cop as are most of the other actors and the movie does begin with a few promising scenes. But then it quickly VERY quickly I might add devolves into a silly mess. I would echo the sentiments of other users who pointed out that much of what occurs seems completely unnecessary. For instance why didn't the big bad guys let's call them the guys who wanted the DVD for lack of a better term simply infiltrate the house themselves? Why enlist Talley when what he could or could not do was unavoidably going to be dictated at least to some extent by the young hostagetakers in the house i.e. the punks? The DVD bad guys tell Talley don't let anyone get in or out of the house... Fine but isn't that asking a whole heck of a lot from just one guy? Why take such a risk? Do criminals  especially these organizedcrime types  generally take such unnecessary gambles? Wouldn't it have been much easier  and the end result much more certain  if they simply repelled into the house without getting anyone else involved?

The conclusion was equally convoluted although I suppose I should not have expected this mess to be wrapped up in a neat package.

For a moment I thought HE was supposed to be the guy in charge after all but then that theory fell apart when Talley simply left him behind. Why wasn't he arrested? The real shame here is that if this entire DVD bad guy subplot is done away with this may have been an entertaining film. We would be left with the three punks and a hostage situation that's harrowing because one of the three is an unpredictable psychopath. The social underpinnings are interesting because the punks' motivations Dennis' at least seem to relate to the sharp divide between the haves and have nots.

Unfortunately such is not the case and we are ultimately left with this nonsensical slop.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film was much too convoluted for its own good. Bruce Willis is fine in his ultraclich role of the damaged cop as are most of the other actors and the movie does begin with a few promising scenes. But then it quickly VERY quickly I might add devolves into a silly mess. I would echo the sentiments of other users who pointed out that much of what occurs seems completely unnecessary. For instance why didn't the big bad guys let's call them the guys who wanted the DVD for lack of a better term simply infiltrate the house themselves? Why enlist Talley when what he could or could not do was unavoidably going to be dictated at least to some extent by the young hostagetakers in the house i.e. the punks? The DVD bad guys tell Talley don't let anyone get in or out of the house... Fine but isn't that asking a whole heck of a lot from just one guy? Why take such a risk? Do criminals  especially these organizedcrime types  generally take such unnecessary gambles? Wouldn't it have been much easier  and the end result much more certain  if they simply repelled into the house without getting anyone else involved?

	schema:headline " Overwrought overblown overacted";
	schema:reviewBody "This could have been a taut tense little thriller. The premise gave me high hopes for this film.True we're dealing with awfully familiar stuff. The protagonist Jeff Talley Bruce Willis is a clich  a Los Angeles police negotiator whose wrong instincts in a crisis situation cost lives. He's now left the hubbub of urban life to find solace as a police chief in a tranquil small town.Even forgiving that conventional aspect I liked the initial premise of this film. But its execution is terribly flawed. And the fault lies with both director Florent Emilio Siri and screenwriter Doug Richardson whose previous scripts Die Hard 2 1990 Bad Boys 1995 and Money Train 1995 aren't exactly known for their subtlety or originality.The basic plot The tranquility of Talley's small town gets disturbed when three young men Ben Foster Jonathan Tucker and Marshall Allman break into a mansion equipped with stateoftheart surveillance and security and hold its three occupants hostage.The film's big flaw is the lackadaisical storytelling. It's almost as if Richardson didn't care whether some parts of his script made sense. For instance the mansion's supposed to be extremely secure you get the sense that the slightest noise would set off an alarm somewhere. But yet the security system works only when the writer wants it to work. On other occasions there are giant lapses in security that are simply brushed aside.The same's true also for plot points. Some characters' actions seem completely arbitrary. They do things not because it would be in their character but because it makes it easier for the writer to deal with some issues. Characters are gotten rid off only so the hero wouldn't have to deal with them. This is awfully lazy storytelling. And why is it that in these movies the heating vents always are big enough to hold adults quite comfortably?Then there's the acting and direction. Willis does a credible job portraying a man conflicted with what he has to do and dealing with his past mistakes. But Willis seems to be waging a lone battle. He's given little support from other actors in woefully underwritten roles. The poor chap's also working with a terribly clichd character with an estranged wife and a disillusioned daughter played by Willis' real daughter Rumer to boot. Wanna guess if this latest crisis brings them all together?Don't even worry about the bad guys who throw a wrench into Talley's plans. They're used minimally and we know nothing about them. They're just onenote bad guys. As for the burglars there could have been an intriguing battle of wits between Dennis Kelly Tucker who considers himself the leader and the evermorose Mars Foster. But their idea of conflict is to overact. Foster's so overthetop in his depiction of a troubled youth with a fondness for Jennifer Michele Horn the teenager in the house that it's impossible to take him seriously. Every moment with him seems overwrought.That might not be his fault. It seems Siri was under the impression he was making not a simple tight thriller but an important piece about the human condition. He overplays moments and often resorts to excessive use of slow motion to thunderous music and opts for melodrama. People don't just die when they're shot in this film. They fall to their knees arms outstretched as they're filmed from above as the music swells.After a while this film became laughable. Pity because Hostage had an exciting premise that could have made for a terrific Bpicture.".

	schema:headline " Excellent movie that is challenging the established clichs";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me disregard all the comments made here about the movie being a total rewrite of the established clichs in the action genre cause that's simply not true! Brus Willis in a departure from his previous roles in the last couple of years movies i didn't even bother watching plays a chief of police and a negotiator who after a hijacking plan goes awry is compelled to reassume command of the situation since his family has been kidnapped by terrorists whose nature remains a mystery even at the end of the movie. Bruce in this role is absolutely EXCEPTIONAL! The one reason why i always liked him so much was his face which has a very mysterious outline and it's never really completely obvious whether he is being serious funny or just plain sarcastic and that's what gives his character quiet the charm in this movie. While the plot itself is a beaten horse by now take Samuel's the negotiator pump it up with some special effects and add another subplot and you've got it and has been firmly reestablished numerous times in the past the commitment of the entire assemble of actors for this movie is astounding! Kevin Pollak plays the role of rich man father of two young children daughter Jeniifer and son Tommy living in a MichaelJackson type neverland house with sophisticated technology and a very large budget. The two baddies in question played by Ben Foster and Jonathan Tucker provide astonishingly downtoearth and exhilarating performances with Jonathan being a more traditional type of badass gangster who got himself way over the hills and Ben being the more eccentric type of guy who dynamically changes as the story unfolds you can't really pinpoint what's he gonna do next and as the last scene unleashes it's really quiet a sight to behold how his deep and troubled past comes in contact with one of the family members i wish they would elaborate more on that. Pollak was never really my cupoftea until this movie that is... he's inadvertently conveyed in the beginning as a squeamish and softspoken type of guy but the more i found out about him the more he brought to me to a state of shock after seeing him blow the noggin of the badass FBI decked lads back at their hideout.Overall it would really take me about that many lines to express fully my opinion of this great movie! 2005 has barely begun and i'm already eying this one as one of my favorite movies of the year! The cast is exceptional the special effects especially near the end are mindbending the music is heartrending and the plot twists though clichs all the way challenge the encrusted notion that it's better to reinvent the wheel rather than polish it some more as the latest batch of movies attempt to do some fail miserably some take lighthits on their way down.Highly recommended!!!!!!1010".

IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONESTGrowing up in Oxnard Ca this film always played on KTTV Channel 11 around Christmas time. It later moved to KTLA Channel 5 and Pia Zadora even did a fireside chat with television movie host Tom Hatten. Even today watching this film is a huge part of my Christmas traditions. It was a Must See when I was a child and today I still watch it Around Christmas. I also still watch Rudolph Charlie Brown Frosty the Snowman and MGM's A Christmas Carol. One of the main reasons why I love this film is because I loved John Call as Santa Claus. He is a huge delight. He is a terrific Santa. In this film Santa gets kidnapped by Martians. The reason is that the children of Mars do not have a Santa. They also do not know how to have fun. So the leader of Mars goes to Earth and kidnaps Santa as well as 2 earth children. Santa then slowly wins over the Adult Martians even though there are certain forces against him. Now if you are an adult and you have never seen this you will think this movie is terrible. Children Who still believe in Santa will be entertained. It is harmless fun! Even the theme song Hooray For Santa Claus is Cute  Catchy.The films low budget is all too apparent here however if this film did have a bigger budget then it might not have the weird charm.I beg all of you to watch this film. Have a viewing party. It is a film that many people have seen and actually are afraid to admit that they enjoy it. I am not afraid to admit that I even bought this film on BluRay.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe I have a soft spot somewhere in my heart for poorly written badly conceived silly 1960s children's movies  but I really can't understand why Santa Claus versus the Martians is in the worst 100 movies of all time here on IMDb. Sure most viewers will breathe a sigh of relief when it ends but this film really seems downright harmless compared to the six month old Kennel Ration Hollywood has been feeding us as commercial film for the last ten or so years. Hey at least it's not a remake a sequel or a 2 hour long CGI cartoon with a few human faces tossed in for effect.Santa Claus gets kidnapped by distraught martians white guys with bad green makeup and a few dishwasher parts glued to their heads as well as inexplicable capes who want to rescue their depressive antisocial children from the doldrums by giving them all toys and a big redsuited guy with a beard to laugh at... err... with. Santa adapts to life on Mars very well and starts cranking out the toys with the help of Martian machines but political controversies surrounding his activities soon threaten the fabric of Martian Society.I'm not kidding.... really.... this is the plot.Aside from the ludicrous plot and mediocre acting Bill McCutcheon gives the only really enjoyable performance in this film though Pia Zadora and Vincent Beck are not too bad this is no worse than many of the kid films of its time. In the age of ADD and general impatience however this film is more than a little dated. The only modern kid I can imagine enjoying this film is one with an extraordinarily great attention span and a penchant for Bfilms. In terms of production this film has the feel of a 2 hour 1960s low budget TV show and is almost as clever.I would recommend avoiding this film unless you're compelled to watch films which go to extremes. I found it cute funny and more than a tad ridiculous. To most people it's a film version of your great Aunt's wallpaper  it's just there on the TV while far more interesting things are happening in the carpet below your feet.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoy this silly little holiday flick. A bunch of serious Martian adults are afraid that their serious Martian children are too serious so they go to a serious Martian senior citizen. The old guy tells them that the children need to be taught how to laugh and then he explodes for no reason. The only logical thing left to do of course is go to Earth and kidnap Santa Claus who we meet as he is being interviewed by the Rip Taylorlike Andy Anderson. I liked how in the movie's universe Santa is unquestionably real and everyone knows about him. He really does deliver toys to everyone toys made by a dozen elves who all look like they're suffering from miniseasonal depression. One toy shown is a toy rocket that runs on real rocket fuel Santa proudly explains. I would ask Where do little kids get rocket fuel? The details of Santa's amazingly speedy mass distribution methods are not brought up but it's probably black magicrelated.The Martians nab Kris Kringle and two little Earth children who seem to live alone in the woods with no parents or family but are clean and well fed. The Martian leader forces Santa and the children to run their soulless toy machine Soulless Toy Machine would be a good name for a band. Despite the numerous violations of human rights it's all in good fun and everybody is nice and happy except for one mean Martian with a disturbing droopy mustache and a sidekick that looks like Jamie Farr who plots to kidnap Santa even though he's already been kidnapped. Santa encourages the kids even the Martian kids who have now learned to have fun to hurl lots of heavy midsixties toys at the bad guy's skulls. Through this display of parental negligence and bad music the evil is thwarted and Santa is permitted to go back to Earth letting the mewling halfwit comic relief Martian named Droppo take over the reigns of the Martian Toy Empire. The Martians are outofshape guys in tights and helmets with antenna sprouting out of them and what looks like diarrhea smeared across their faces. Imagine a guy dressed like that mugging worse than the teacher guy in Juan Piquor Simon's Monster Island and that's Droppo.How can you hate this movie? If I were a little kid in 1964 I'd be enthralled. They packed this movie with nutty stuff. Elves get shot with freeze rays. Mrs. Claus is a frantic goofball. The Martian children sleep under strange lights and eat only pills. The bad guy's hideout looks like that one King Crimson album cover.  I loved the part where the villain tries to shoot Santa and the kids out of an airlock and the part where the bad guys meddle with the toy machine and the toys come out all mixedup. There's a guy in a goofy robot costume and a guy in an even goofier polar bear costume. And that deliciously idiotic theme song You spell it SANTA CLAUS Hooray for Santy Claus! Oh it's so good!I sincerely feel the people making this had the best intentions and while they didn't have a huge budget they made a fun silly kids movie. If it was the same exact movie but done in Rudolfstyle stop motion animation it would be a regular holiday viewing tradition.Oh yeah and  Pia Zadora is in this as if anyone cares.".

The sets costumes and makeup are all bargainbasement but they all work well enough within the confines of the plastic coated world that they exist in. Some of the highlights of the film as a whole include an angry Martian and friendly but stupid Martian an impressively unconvincing and fake polar bear a comedy punch up and last yet surely best of all a truly infectious theme song about Santy Claus.

The special effects are weak  although to be honest I've seen worse portrayals of space flight. And the costumes are hilarious  especially the polar bear and the robot. But come on  you have to admit that there's a certain cuteness to the story of Martians coming to earth to kidnap Santa Claus so that he can bring happiness to their children. All the characters are pretty one dimensional. There's good guys and bad guys and fun guys and kids from both Earth and Mars. No one gets particularly well developed. And then of course there's Santa. In all honesty I thought John Call did a decent job as the jolly old man. In this age of high tech special effects and big budget movies there's no doubt that this looks pretty weak  and even by the standards of 1964 it was still pretty weak. But it's good fun and for the fun alone I don't think it deserves its reputation as one of the worst movies ever. What's left to say except  Hurray for Santy Claus! 410".

I couldn't stop watching it.The plot is about what happens when Saint Nicholas himself is kidnapped by Martians and they also kidnap two EarthChildren to help them find him as there's too many of his impersonators for them to identify the real thing. The premise is daft but the execution is brilliant as you really do believe that you are seeing reallife Martians kidnapping Santa from the North Pole. Taking him to their base on Mars all chaos breaks loose but Santa doesn't actually conquer the Martians at all meaning that the title is a lie but if you can get past the misleading title you'll find this to be an incredible Christmas treat that is not to be missed in fact you have no excuse to miss this as it's in the public domain and the whole thing is on YouTube for free.The acting directing writing effects and sets are all superb. This didn't win any awards which is nothing short of daylight robbery this movie is so good that it puts the likes of The Shawshank Redemption and The Dark Knight and Raiders of the Lost Ark to shame for how shoddy they are I didn't laugh even once at any of them but every moment of this is spectacular comedy. I give this ten out of ten!".

HOW MEAN! i think it's funny. i look forward to it every Christmas and i love to drink alcoholic egg nogg and clap my hands and happily sing the Milton DeLugg theme song. oooh. did i just say that? i need to get out more.but seriously. does anyone think that John Call is really the actual Santa Claus? either that or they got him from some mental institution because this guy acts like he's the real thing. i mean John Call doesn't just act in this he's obviously living the FN role. i personally think he's the real Santa pretending to be an actor because nobody can be this convincing. no actor can possibly throw themselves this much into a performance. either he's the real thing or he's gone over the deep end. i kinda hope this Santa doesn't come to my house because he seems like he's lost his marbles in sugar plum land. like Christmas on hard drive. i'd hate to see what he'd do if you were naughty and made him mad.this movie is a bargain basement 'Toyland'. it might not be as good as Disney. but it's a helluva lot funnier. the robot was funny and the guy in the stuffy polar bear suit was even funnier. m.s. Claus was a total freak.the dialogue even though mostly atrocious offers some deep insights into children and humanity. upon seeing a Martianat least i think it's a martian that looks like plumbing fixtures on the helmets the little earth girl asks what R those things on yer haid? to which the impatient Martian replies they are sophisticated antennae. the little girl then questions  duh R yew a teevee set?. the disgusted Martian then scowls is that what you want to do to the intelligent children on Mars? turn them into nimcompoops like these earth brats. how true how true. and how very deeply insightful.i thought Droppo was a tard and Chochum didn't seem as wise as everybody said he was. those are also the ugliest elves i've ever seen. Volder the evil bad guy was cool though. he's the only one who makes any sense. he's thinks it's a all a bad idea and wants to kill Santa. i like Santa but he has no business on Mars and is an offense to Martian culture and tradition.still what would Christmas be without this cheapo freak show. it's schlocky but hilarious and that's a convincing if not kinda scary Santa Claus. funny when i was a little kid this movie used to scare me and give me nightmares. i used to close my eyes because i was afraid of the robot. i was also kind of afraid of this Santa. shows what dunces kids are. now i think it's so funny i use it for laughs. in the immortal words of John Call who i think might be the real thing  Merry Christmas and AWAAAAAAAY!!!!".

SEE aliens aka guys with green facepaint and green helmets on! SEE Santa Claus CONQUER THE MARTIANS! Quite possibly some of the worst special effects in film history and one of the fuinniest plots in film history it all adds up to fun!

	schema:reviewBody "This film is regarded as a turkey and one of those films that's so bad it's good. There are several things to consider when reviewing this film but the most important considerations are the time it was made and the intended audience. Santa Claus Conquers The Martians was made in 1964. Anyone who was a child around 1964 can tell you it was a very innocent time compared to today. Kids genuinely believed in Santa Claus then. One must also consider a child's concept of Martians robots and space travel in 1964. The cheesy Martian makeup and the clunky robot may evoke laughter from a modern audience but a child's toy collection in 1964 might have had a Marx tin robot toy that looked very much like the one featured in this film. In fact Marx Toy Company created the toys used in this film. I was born in 1968 and I remember watching this movie on commercial television in the early 70s with my mother. Adult viewers see the story set design and effects as cheap and silly but to a child in the 60s and 70s this film was perfect Christmas viewing. It's important to remember that this film was intended for children and more specifically children from a specific time in history. Not all films are timeless and this one can be regarded more as a time capsule showing just how innocent kids were 50 years ago. The premise that Santa was real and had adventures beyond his annual duties was just fun for kids. I can't imagine this film having the bad reputation it has if it were done as one of the RankinBass animated Christmas specials. A look at the cast also reveals that all of the adult actors were professionals from stage and other film productions. I found the line delivery and acting to be sincere and it's obvious that the cast did this because they loved their children. If this were done as a stage production the audience would laugh along with the silliness but kids would be mesmerized. And that's another thing to consider the movie's costumes and set design actually seem more suited to a stage play rather than a film. I'd say if you watch this film expecting some kind of scifi classic you'll be disappointed. But if you look at it from a historical point of view and consider that it's a play made with love for children who believed Santa Claus would visit them soon you might see it in a different light.".

	schema:headline " I have no idea why Superman Returns has such a bad reputation. This is actually reallyreally good!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was totally surprised and blown away by this movie! First of all Superman Returns takes you back to the original cinematic universe of Superman 1 and 2. When the movie started and I realized that I was pretty skeptic I didn't believe that it could work 26 years after Superman 2 actually it was 36 years when I was watching it. Then when Clark Kent returned to the Daily Planet and I saw that the actor Brandon Routh is actually doing Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent I was like Oh no this will be bad!. The same thing with the young photographer Jimmy Olsen  the actor was playing the exact same character. I didn't like the concept. But then I said to myself okay I'm gonna go with it so I kept watching the movie and very shortly I had to realize that it actually works! It was funny it was exciting it was emotional  it was everything that a classical Superman movie needs to be! Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane was amazing! She was actually not trying to copy Margot Kidder she was doing her own thing but still remained Lois Lane. I would say as far as acting goes Kate Bosworth was the best thing in this movie. A couple of things I didn't like 1. In the first half of the movie there were some pretty bad CGI moments. There were some scenes where Superman almost looked cartoonish. Thankfully it was only 2 or 3 scenes the rest of the visuals and CG were pretty good  especially considering that the movie was made in 2006. 2. Kevin Spacey was not a good Lex Luthor. He probably was told to do Gene Hackman's Lex and it just didn't work. At least in the first half of the movie. In the last hour or so it seemed like he started to adjust the character to himself a little bit and that did make him more believable as Luthor.In the last half an hour the movie was flying! There was action there was suspense drama and a lot of emotion  but not too much! It was just perfect. I was actually in tears which doesn't happen to me very often.By the way I did like Man Of Steel too I didn't mind that DC eventually took the franchise in that direction. But I have to say I did like Superman Returns even more. This one I loved! This is not the kind of superhero movie that fans expect from DC andor Marvel in 2016. This rather takes you back 2030 years in time and helps you feel what it was like when as a kid you were cheering for Superman. Thank you Bryan Singer and whoever else was involved in it!".

It even has one of the most brutal fight scenes in any Superman movie which could be a bit hard to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "Bryan Singer has made it no secret that he was going to make this film a sequel of sorts to the first two Superman films which starred Christopher Reeve. Which I though was an interesting idea even though I thought Superman 2 was lame. However I thought the premise of Superman returning after a long absence was a great idea unfortunately Singer's heavy reliance on the first two films really crippled this film.Some minor film details are included in my comments below which may hint at spoilers... I attended a screening of Superman Returns last night and even though I'm not the biggest Superman fan I was REALLY looking forward to seeing this film. I have to admit I had misgivings about the casting of Kate Bosworth and Brandon Routh because there were too young. However Brandon Routh was the BEST Superman yet and Kate Bosworth really did very well as Lois Lane. Kevin Spacey was GREAT as Lex Luthor especially when he and Routh briefly shared the screen. However Parker Posey was wasted in a dull clich. The opening credit sequence was amazing. Hearing the original Superman theme gave me chills. The next 45 minutes of the film were awesome. Lex's reintroduction demonstrates at his ruthlessness even on a smaller scale. Clark KentSuperman's return home was thoughtful and well done as was the reintroduction to the crew at the Daily Planet. However because Singer assumes that we all saw the first two films he apparently does not feel the need to develop any of the characters outside of Superman and Lois. Lex Luthor's character is just a caricature of a mustache twirling villain and even though Spacey does this very well it's hard to take him seriously as a threat. His evil plan is nothing more than a rehash of Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor the 1978 film except using crystals instead of nukes. There is NO REAL logic behind his motives at all if you think about it. More importantly you just don't care if he succeeds or not. Lex Luthor's character is only validated in the very brief face to face confrontation with Superman at the end. Let me say that LexSuperman confrontation at the end is one of the BEST scenes in the whole film and further proof of wasted potential. Lex Luthor shows how truly evil he can be and again Spacey does an amazing job here. The on screen presence of Brandon Routh and Kevin Spacey together was SO good. Routh could really hold his own next to Spacey. Too bad Singer couldn't have found a way to elaborate on this scene or do something more interesting with the characters than just having Luther figuratively twirl his mustache and have Superman pine over Lois Lane the whole film.Overall this film is bound in a weak story with plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. The story relies too heavily on the SupermanLois Lane love story so much so that the rest of the film and the other characters just feel like an after thought.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superman Returns is a competent movie generally very well produced directed and cast. But it didn't quite gel for me. I thought it dragged at points as Superman got bogged down with pining over Lois Lane instead of saving the day. Alas I thought the dialogue just wasn't sharp enough to sustain these heavyhanded emotional scenes what sort of catchphrase is I'm always around anyway? Here's what I did enjoy. The flight scenes were beautiful Superman cut a very majestic figure as he soared across skylines and starscapes. The set design was great too creating a modern feel with hints of the Art Deco style I associate with Superman. And I appreciated the performances of Spacey Bosworth and Langella. Routh had a curiously small role especially as Clark Kent so I had trouble judging whether he was wooden or actually good at playing a modest hero.Here's what I enjoyed less. Luthor's plan simply didn't interest me. I found the whole notion of growing a giant crystal island very surreal and not too threatening. Also he poses a fairly boring threat to Superman. If Luthor's got Kryponite Superman is helpless if he hasn't got Kryponite he's helpless. These two legendary antagonists can never really meet on equal terms. Thus most confrontations between them must inevitably be onesided. Read boring. I also had a mixed reaction to the CGI effects. Some were wonderful and others looked artificial despite being very detailed. The soundtrack was great of course with the classic John Williams theme wisely reused  though maybe they trotted it out once too often? The conflict involving Lois Lane's family life was pretty good though I felt that the revelations about her son which I'll avoid spoiling here undermined much of the potential tension and drama in the story. I'm very glad though that Lois' boyfriend was depicted as a smart handsome and capable guy instead of some dumb and unworthy straw man rival to Superman.I noticed that Roger Ebert's twostar review of Superman Returns is already taking a lot of criticism on this site. Though I think he was perhaps a tad too harsh I have to say that I agree with many of his criticisms. His headline for the review Atlas Yawned provoked a sympathetic laugh from me. I guess I can only hope for a sequel with more action more oomph more...Superheroism?".

	schema:reviewBody "After languishing in the disappointment that was Brett Ratner's X3 I made it a point to walk into Superman Returns with low expectations. They should have been lower. It isn't that the film is outright terrible though it has many glaring flaws rather I had unknowingly outgrown the Superman myth. And considering that Bryan Singer offers nothing original to the new installment I think America will find its timeless icon a little dated.First there is the castingthe most important part of any film attempting to match an original that has become so iconic its actors have replaced the comic book characters in America's collective conscience. Newcomer Brandon Routh most definitely looks the part besides being too young but has half the screen presence of Christopher Reeve. Although Superman isn't known for his emotional instability it seems that Singer played it safe by limiting Routh's range to avoid having the new Superman give a poor performance. Instead we are left with almost no performance.Kate Bosworth is equally as bland as Lois Lane and again too young for the role. And with her lifeless brown hair that left me aching for her typical screen blond she isn't even much to look at. Kevin Spacey's performance as Lex Luther also left something to be desiredthough I'm not sure exactly what. He's hardly the lovable Lex that Gene Hackman played. The rest of the cast was decent with the exception of Frank Langella. His dull portrayal of Perry White made me wish they had grabbed J. K. Simmons straight out of Spiderman to talk about his barber.Though suspension of disbelief is required for nearly every comic book film the plot of Returns is so illogically strung together I had trouble letting go. At first my mind started asking questions that shouldn't be asked of Superman. What did Superman eat while he flew around the universe looking for Krypton? Does Superman need to eat? How does he breathe in space which to be fair is a question that applies to the original films as well? Once Lex Luther's plan emerged however I moved past the unfair premise questions and asked some legitimate questions. Without spoiling the plot I'll just say that there are ways for Lex to hatch his plan for world domination without killing billions people. I didn't buy into the necessary sacrifice.On the upside Singer's direction is glossy and competent. The score works well thanks to a liberal sprinkling of John Williams' original theme song the special effects are of course impressive and the action sequences especially stand out. Overriding the tension generated by wellstaged and edited action however is a lack of any real sense of peril. And surprisingly the pace is rather slow throughoutwhich is only made tolerable by some scattered comic relief.Singer takes an unexpected turn toward the end of the film when he emphasizes the parallels between Superman and Jesus to the point where the audience wonders if Returns is simply another allegory in the vein of The Chronicles of Narnia. While the comparison is interesting one can only wonder how far it can be stretched considering the Superman in this rehash stands for truth justice and irresponsible romances reflecting the plot's only surprise.The bottom line for any resurrection of a classic film or series is there better be a damn good reason. In the case of Batman Begins Christopher Nolan ripped the decaying body of Batman from the grave and gave him the breath of life. Batman became complex raw and 100 real. Although Superman is an entirely different beastone who is too busy saving people to reflect on his lack of flawstoday's audiences expect their superheroes to be tad more human. Unfortunately for Returns in an overexerted effort to pay tribute to Richard Donner a supercautious Singer reanimates Superman like a puppeteer but fails to give him life.5.510".

Unfortunately for Returns in an overexerted effort to pay tribute to Richard Donner a supercautious Singer reanimates Superman like a puppeteer but fails to give him life.5.510";

	schema:reviewBody "Having looked forward to this film for many years I naturally went in with high expectations. And they were most certainly met. From the casting of Brandon Routh who I actually find slightly better than Christopher Reeve because of the emotional complexity and sense of mystery Routh brings to the character to Kate Bosworth who i think is the BEST actress to have portrayed Lois Lane to Kevin Spacey different interpretation than previous Lex's but still very good all of the actors have played their respective roles well.As for the story many have questioned its originality. The plot elements were similar to Superman the Movie because Singer needed to establish the connection of this franchise with the original movie due to the many different interpretations and versions of the character over the years. Plus a different more serious take on Perry White and the idea of superman's disappearance and Lois having had a child with another man were all aspects of originality to the film. Like I said before Routh seems to have taken a more serious approach to the Superman character than Reeve but still maintains many qualities of Reeve's performance.And the special effects...well...enough said if you've seen the film  Overall this may be the best of the Superman series and if not it is definitely on par with Richard Donner's original classic.P.S. Don't listen to the haters  Watch the film with an open mind and judge for yourself.".

	schema:headline " Good effects but ultimately emotionally uninvolving";
	schema:reviewBody "I was finally able to screen the newest adventure from Warner Bros. and DC Comics Films Superman Returns starring relative unknown Brandon Routh in the role the late Christopher Reeve rode to stardom upon.Now some 28 years after Richard Donner's classic Superman hit the big screen director Bryan Singer XMen XMen 2 with a trillion dollar budget tries his hand at helming the ultimate graphic novel adventure.Sadly Singer is no Donner.While wonderful to look at and sometimes interesting to ponder this newest version of the saga of the Man of Steel leaves one with an impressive vapidity a passive disinterest and an emotional detachment which overwhelms one with a cold empty feeling.In an effort to do what last year's Batman Begins did to the Caped Crusader franchise  bring a new dark brooding vitality to the series Superman Returns succeeds only in making one wish for the deft hand of Donner as well as the acting ability of Reeves Margot Kidder as Lois Lane Ned Beatty as a stupidly evil henchman Otis and especially Gene Hackman as the best Lex Luthor ever.The plot takes place supposedly five years after the action in Superman II from 1981 when scientists discovered proof of such a world Superman journeyed there evidently without telling anyone of his plans to find if it was possibly a living planet. It wasn't so now he's back  but things have changed in his absence.Mainly that his love interest Lois Lane Kate Bosworth Win A Date With Tad Hamilton is involved with the nephew of Daily Planet editorinchief Perry White Richard James Marsden who played Scott SummerCyclops in the XMen films and they now have a young son about fiveyearsold.He won't let go however even flying to her mansion to spy on and stalk her  in a very unSupermanlike scene.Despite that last heartbreak it's Lane's famous Daily Planet editorial Why The World Doesn't Need Superman for which she will collect a Pulitzer Prize huh? that really stings ClarkMan of Steel.That's one of the first problems I had with this version. In the first two films nothing matters after part two Superman saved Lane's life at least four times from a helicopter plummeting of a skyscraper from being buried alive in the desert from a plunging elevator in the Eiffel Tower and from going over the cliff at Niagara Falls. After all of that she writes an article saying no one NEEDS him anymore?!Then in a nice bit of CGI work the powerful hero rescues her again from a plane plunging to earth stopping the craft from crashing nosefirst on the infield of a Major League baseball stadium. It's truly an awesome scene.Meanwhile in the frozen North evil madman Luthor Kevin Spacey Academy Award winner for The Usual Suspects and American Beauty is out of prison and raiding Superman's Fortress of Solitude making off which his collection of priceless crystals.Routh is handsome all right and looking close enough to Reeve except his eyes are CGI'd blue from their natural brown to keep us comfortable his voice though is creepily similar to the late actor so I have no real problem with him in the lead role.Likewise Sam Huntington as bumbling photographer Jimmy Olson was adequately goofy in comic relief while Frank Langella as blustery Perry White is good in just about any role he plays see Dracula and Dave for proof of this.The inclusion of Jack Larson the original Jimmy Olson in the 1950s series and Noel Neill who played one of the Lois Lanes in that show in cameo roles as a bartender and a rich dying widow respectively was also a nice touch.The other parts however do concern me. Bosworth is just too spineless and ineffective to be a hardnosed reporter for a major newspaper as well as the only real confidant our hero has in his life. To me the spunky Parker Posey who portrays Kitty Kowalski Luthor's gun moll would have made a much better Lois.As for Spacey as Luthor well to me he just is not evil enough. Gene Hackman had a deliciously devious demeanor coupled with a madman's desire to rule the world  with basically realistic plans to do so. Spacey seems more of an annoyance than a real threat.Another crime this movie commits is that it goes on and on  at least 20 minutes after it should have concluded. Now there will be fans out there who will no doubt blast me for this opinion claiming how I dare I compare the 1978 and '81 films to this one.To those detractors I simply say that this new picture invites comparisons utilizing the same opening credits the same theme song archival footage of Marlon Brando as JorEl speaking dialogue from the original film even the same scene where Superman flies Lois around New York the only thing missing is Kidder's corny voiceover.".

	schema:headline " Bryan Singer owes Superman an apology";
	schema:reviewBody "First let me just comment on what I liked about the movie. The special effects were fantastic and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game. There that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film. In fact I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I can't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. I have innumerable complaints about the film but four major complaints jump to mind. My first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away where Lois's 5 yearold son turns out to be the superpowered child of Superman. When the crying superchild throws a piano at Lex's henchman to save his mother I almost got up and left the theater. Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently superpowered illegitimate child. It's been 5 days since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit. My next major complaint has to do with the fact that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. It doesn't take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out what's wrong with that. I don't know how many comic books Brian Singer has read but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Supermanrelated projects ever again. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. That's not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in reentry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground. My third major complaint has to do with the fact that Singer slaps moviegoers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie. I have to take issue with his characterization of Superman as the only son of a Godlike Jorel sent to Earth to be a savior. Jorel wasn't allwise he was just a scientist. And he didn't send his son to earth to be a savior he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode. I'll buy the Christ allegory if Brian Singer can show me the part in the Bible where God sends Christ to Earth because Heaven was about to explode and then radioactive pieces of Heaven become Christ's primary weakness. Furthermore the crucifixion scene where Luthor stabs Superman in the side with a kryptonite spear just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until I'm too braindead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future. They might as well rename this movie Superman Returns the Passion of the Christ.And speaking of Luthor my last major complaint has to do with Singer's depiction of Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor is a shrewd coldhearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for President which he does in the comics than try to destroy the world. The man wants money and power he wants to be in charge not wreck everything. Yet the Luthor we see Superman Returns as well as all the previous Superman movies is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world. If Singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the quite awful previous Superman movies this film might not be such an unbearable travesty. Maybe Singer's next project can be a Batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of Batman from 1960s TV show. ZAM! WHAP! POW!!To summarize I don't know what I hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you don't hate this movie then your opinion is wrong. I sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven't already. Don't see it don't buy it when it comes out on DVD don't rent it...basically don't contribute any money towards it in any way. This movie does not deserve to make any money. In fact I think that for every person that sees this movie Bryan Singer should be fined 45 billion dollars. If you're a Superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you'll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time.".

	schema:headline " It's okay but FAR from great thanks to weak script";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw the original Superman The Movie when it was released in theaters. It was an epic event. It would be unfair to expect the same from Superman Returns but the filmmakers are inviting comparisons since they rely so much on certain events that occurred in the first two films even going so far as to reuse some of Tom Mankiewicz's dialog. It's obvious when watching the film that a lot of money and hard work went into making it...with the exception of the screen writing which is where this film falls short. It insists on making several characters dumber than they would appear. Take Richard concerned about an old article Lois wrote called I spent the night with Superman. Richard boy she has a kid. She obviously spent the night with SOMEONE before she met you. If you really stop and consider it every character in the film is basically commanded by the script to do something kind of dumb in order to advance the unimaginative story.Perry White assigns Clark Kent the task of looking into a mysterious blackout. At no time in the film is it remotely hinted that he has been doing anything of the sort or anything at all when you think about it whereas Lois in defiance of White is seen in several scenes looking into it and it becomes a major plot point. Meanwhile Kent Superman mind you is doping around the office.The powers of Superman are well known. And writers can have a lot of fun being resourceful with them. But not in this film. Everything Superman does is predictable. By comparison think back on the way Superman saved California after the bomb struck. Things like having the train run across his back in part 1 or freezing the lake with his breath then dropping it on an outofcontrol fire in part 3 are what I'm talking about.The music wisely incorporates John Williams classic score but a lot of cues are overused especially Can You Read My Mind? which has little place in this film considering the tepid relationship between Superman and Lois. It could have been used to great effect just once when she visits an unconscious Superman in the hospital where everything she feels for him comes to the surface. Instead we're hit over the head with it practically every time they run into each other.I thought Luthor's plot had interesting promise. But I find it puzzling that after his test run in the Atlantic Ocean Metropolis is basically now literally standing on shaky ground and the skyscrapers all have questionable structural integrity after the shockwave ran through them shaking the foundations to the point that all the windows shattered in every building and even the Daily Planet's iconic sculpture topples from atop the building.Director Singer certainly subscribes to Richard Donner's verisimilitude approach to the first film the lack of which is what killed the series in the 80s. I like Brandon Routh as Superman and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. You could recast everyone else for all I care. Kate Bosworth is a walking pot of boiling water. Feisty and headstrong are one thing but i think they pushed that too far in this film. Why in hell is Richard or ClarkSuperman attracted to her?I've noticed a lot of people hungry for this film to come out are satisfied with the product. If this review has a low helpful score it's because they are blindly supporting the film. This review was written for anyone who knows how to discern between quality and quantity particularly when it comes to film. I so very much wanted to love this film. Hollywood studios have a way of systematically destroying every decent franchise they get their hands on. In spite of my relative disappointment of the movie it's far from being horrible. It's just not great...like it should have been.".

It's obvious when watching the film that a lot of money and hard work went into making it...with the exception of the screen writing which is where this film falls short. It insists on making several characters dumber than they would appear. Take Richard concerned about an old article Lois wrote called I spent the night with Superman. Richard boy she has a kid. She obviously spent the night with SOMEONE before she met you. If you really stop and consider it every character in the film is basically commanded by the script to do something kind of dumb in order to advance the unimaginative story.Perry White assigns Clark Kent the task of looking into a mysterious blackout. At no time in the film is it remotely hinted that he has been doing anything of the sort or anything at all when you think about it whereas Lois in defiance of White is seen in several scenes looking into it and it becomes a major plot point. Meanwhile Kent Superman mind you is doping around the office.The powers of Superman are well known. And writers can have a lot of fun being resourceful with them. But not in this film. Everything Superman does is predictable. By comparison think back on the way Superman saved California after the bomb struck. Things like having the train run across his back in part 1 or freezing the lake with his breath then dropping it on an outofcontrol fire in part 3 are what I'm talking about.The music wisely incorporates John Williams classic score but a lot of cues are overused especially Can You Read My Mind? which has little place in this film considering the tepid relationship between Superman and Lois. It could have been used to great effect just once when she visits an unconscious Superman in the hospital where everything she feels for him comes to the surface. Instead we're hit over the head with it practically every time they run into each other.I thought Luthor's plot had interesting promise. But I find it puzzling that after his test run in the Atlantic Ocean Metropolis is basically now literally standing on shaky ground and the skyscrapers all have questionable structural integrity after the shockwave ran through them shaking the foundations to the point that all the windows shattered in every building and even the Daily Planet's iconic sculpture topples from atop the building.Director Singer certainly subscribes to Richard Donner's verisimilitude approach to the first film the lack of which is what killed the series in the 80s. I like Brandon Routh as Superman and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. You could recast everyone else for all I care. Kate Bosworth is a walking pot of boiling water. Feisty and headstrong are one thing but i think they pushed that too far in this film. Why in hell is Richard or ClarkSuperman attracted to her?I've noticed a lot of people hungry for this film to come out are satisfied with the product. If this review has a low helpful score it's because they are blindly supporting the film. This review was written for anyone who knows how to discern between quality and quantity particularly when it comes to film. I so very much wanted to love this film. Hollywood studios have a way of systematically destroying every decent franchise they get their hands on. In spite of my relative disappointment of the movie it's far from being horrible. It's just not great...like it should have been.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological. I stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes  eyes wandering at their neighbor wondering if it was just them. I mean how could the movie really be bad. Nobody'll admit it it's a classic case of The Emperor Wears No Clothes. Who am I to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner? But the fact remains every member of the audience is thinking what I'm writing right now. I actually plagiarized their faces.Obviously Lois is only aroused by power she won't even have a cup of coffee with the Superman With Glasses who doesn't stop jet liners. It can't be the look in his eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that. In the old Supermans she had some level of connection with him he wasn't priority number 1 obviously but it strengthened her character that she was torn. I bet Henry Kissinger would have even won this Lois over before Clark Kent.And now it's official Kryptonite does to Superman what eating at McDonalds does to the avg. person.SUPERMAN ONE He loses his earth dad then finds his real super dad the story is captivating every step of the way. He's human he relates to people and he feels love for people he relates to highschool students he relates to people who feel different. He relates. The Superman Returns superman seems to relate only to Superpeople and it seems he's just doing a job when he's saving people.There's something about Clark that Lois likes she's really internally in love with him but can't admit it and when he comes into the picture as Superman it throws a kink in the ontherocks love. Without Superman she would've fallen in love with Clark at least that's what the movie points to whether it was the intention or not. Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN Clark is like a pile of horse maneur to Lois. Literally.SUPERMAN TWO I just watched it again. As a kid I thought I enjoyed the action but now I know it was the STORY that held me then too watching it over and over again. If I saw Superman Returns as a child I would've hated it then too I think.There is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie it's sick. Superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile MEANWHILE Lex Luther's got something fantastic up his sleeve.SUPERMAN THREE Now there's a threeway love story between Superman and Lana and Clark only humanity wins and Clark's inner nature beats Superman's power because when his SUPERmoral nature is gone and he's SuperHUMAN who does human things with his superpowers she sees it's not the power of Superman that she's in love with it's not SUPERpowerman but SUPERMORTALman that she loves  and who's really SUPER. And when she tells Clark she prefers him to Superman he is elated he has made a human connection again. He wants to be accepted for who he is not just for his ability to bend steel. THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT'S MISSING FROM SUPERMAN RETURNS.Clark supersneezes to help the kid get a strike  humanity again. Plus it's an INERESTING use of superpowers. He's not just using straight brute strength.He crushes the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for saving.It seems there's nothing at stake in Superman Returns. Even in Superman Three we see the damages caused by the nemesis' world domination plot.. we see suffering we see how it effects Pryor and others and people in the middle of it.. there's no damage esp. emotional from Lex's plot to sink the US. We see a glob of crystal thrown into space.. Superman had to get very creative in the first three Supermans in order to stop the plot against him he couldn't just access his superpowers. In the first one he had to stop two missiles going in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase history to save Lois' life... this was THIRTY YEARS AGO!! In the second one he had to outsmart three guys that he was already more POWERFUL than but combined with Lex's genius and the villains' immoral tactics Superman's overpowering wasn't enough he had to work one against the other and outsmart them... In Superman III again his superpowers weren't enough to win.. He had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything it saw. He couldn't use straight aggression on the computer because it calculated it in advance so he had to use a benign acid that would only become deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression. And he found that acid earlier when he couldn't simply use his superpowers to BLOW out a fire because it was a chemical fire so he had to use his superbrains  he couldn't carry water so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire.. Now in Superman Returns he simply lunges the island into outerspace like a night temp for UPS. He doesn't need to figure anything out he just uses his super strength. And Lex Luther's brilliance was shown at the premeditation level of a junkie who just ran out of junk.To say nothing of the fact that he threw that island into outerspace after getting stabbed with a KNIFE of kyrptonite right in the bloodstream AND the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores in his face but he just averted his eyes and nose like it wasn't Grey Poupon he was looking at.".

	schema:headline " So in summation...";
	schema:reviewBody " Contains spoilers. Please skip if you have not seen the movie or more importantly liked it So let me see if I understandwhat this movie taught me 1. Superman was in space for five years to find out if Krypton or at least parts of it still existed. I'm guessing this of course because at no point in the movie was that ever extrapolated on. You know we're just kindasorta supposed to know because he did the same thing in the comics. Don't you read the comics? No? Anyway back story is for sissies.2. This is supposed to be the actual sequel to the original Superman not any of the others. No really. Honest. So what if feckless mannequins like Brandon Routh have none of the warmth and charm of Christopher Reeve? In fairness three and four should be utterly forgotten. 3. Speaking of sequels isn't it great that the writers took it upon themselves to redo the same catchphrases and mannerisms of the original characters? Why that wasn't lazy at all. Seriously God knows how many script doctors and producers and marketing kids mutated this thing. It took 33 uncredited writers to come up with the Flintstones movie. The Flintstones! 4. Big deal if the merchandising whiz kids at AOL Time Warner made the red in Superman's costume some kind of bizarre burgundy. Don't you salute the Burgundy White and Blue on the flag? I know I do. 5. Starting the series from scratch would be terrible idea. So what if Batman Begins was both a success both critically praised and financially? That doesn't prove relaunching a series actually works. It's this kind of thinking that helped the kids at AOL Time Warner I refuse to let them off the hook by disavowing AOL's stench lose almost a billion dollars a few years ago. It takes guys who are waaaaaay smarter than me to lose that amount of money. I could never do it and I'm pretty ambitious when it comes to blowing cash.6. That Marlon Brando is quite an actor.7. Lois Lane Pulitzer Prize winner devoted mother yet not allowed to stay up past ten o'clock on school nights. Casting 23year old Cate Blanchett was a stroke of genius. I figure Lois must have won have won her Pulitzer when she was what fifteen? Say what you want about Margot Kidder's descent into utter goofiness at least she made a believable worldweary reporter not a little girl playing dressup.8. Speaking of Lois' kid isn't it great that she and Superman had Super Rugrat? I assume he and Lois had sex again sometime after that whole Fortress of Solitude escapade. Remember Clark's superkiss at the end of number two erased her memory. Otherwise Lois would just get preggers without any prior knowledge of how it happened. Which really ought to be a good reason not to kiss the guy otherwise you'll forget where you parked your car. Or maybe she was seeing James Marsden at the exact same time and figured the baby was his. Wait  does this mean she was cheating on Superman? 9. Anyway back to Super Illegitimate Kid who manages to kill a guy with a piano. True the guy was a creep who had it coming but shouldn't any child of The Man of Steel be taught that killing is very very bad and deserves a time out? 10. Let's hear it for Supes being a paragon of virtue. Was that Clark and Jimmy drinking at a bar during work hours? It's also nice old Super Jealous found time in his busy schedule to illegally spy on Lois's home life with his Xray vision. Just another example of the Patriot Act in action. And who's more patriotic than Mr. Burgundy White and Blue? 11. Nice to see Lois has all the fealty of Olive Oyl. Sure she's got a nice guy waiting for her at home but Superman can still literally sweep her off her feet and float over the city in a loving embrace. Gee I sure wish they did that in the 1978 version. Wait they did? 12. Then there's Lex Luthor with his wacky pals he met in prison. What do you want to bet he has tattoos on his body like Robert DeNiro's in Cape Fear? For five years this genius had time to plot revenge on Superman and come up with a diabolical plan for world domination and the best he can come up with is the same real estate scheme back in 1978? Whoops I mean 2001. Whatever. This guy should be selling time shares in Florida. I wish Lex gave the 'people will pay through the nose for land' speech in the 1978 version. Wait really?? What a coincidence!13. Lois still has a brain the size of a chick pea and stows away aboard Lex's yacht. Exactly the sort of thing an intrepid Pulitzer Prizewinning teenager would do. Luckily Lex trumps her stupidity by deciding to kidnap her and Super Ankle Biter instead of doing the logical thing and call the police for trespassing. Oh well logic is also for sissies.14. The last scene of Superman flying around the world was a nice touch. Golly I sure wish they did that in the 1978 version. Wait really? Aw come on! I suppose I could add more but I'm getting an ulcer just regurgitating this offal. This isn't meant to change anyone's mind. If you loved the movie no amount of pointing out the HUGE flaws will make a difference. But hey a movie like this involves turning your brain off. And off and off and off.Golly look at the pretty special effects!".

A superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with a lot of fun and magic.This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes technically there are all sorts in yes there is a lot of small talks there are a few jokes a view action scenes etc but the only one what all these worse pieces have in common is their poor quality.It's not more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my live.The ridiculous cast strategy Cast them young as possible so we can make sequels in the next 25 years gives the rest.

The problem here is they mean this serious not as a joke. Next time Spiderman or Batman or Ironman falls and rises like Jesus or angels ? Or they speak with god directly. Why not ? They are superheroes saving human lives every day. So at least one talk with god every week should be possible... Oh my god.Maybe this was not the real announced movie instead it is from a bizarre dull parallel universe.For the warner brothers this superlame depressive flick will be possibly the greatest disaster in history. Not only because of the money.I understand how difficult it maybe was to create and transport some messages or feelings but showing lone lost and sadly people isn't new and thousands of movies or TVShows did it better in very old or new ones like magnolia. And the flying frogs there were more impressive than this flying superwoman sorry superman of course.Singer and WB that's simply nothing.

	schema:headline " Why the world needs Superman...";
	schema:reviewBody "The basic premise of Superman Returns is that Superman has returned from an unexplained 5year absence to find a world that seems to be getting along fine without him that the woman he loves has moved on and has a family and that he is at least in terms of any beings similar to him completely alone. The amazing thing is this is the least angstfilled least melodramatic superhero film in the past 5 years or so. I think the recent trend has been to try to get audiences to empathize with their heroes more by making them more human and actually taking them seriously. Peter Parker battles some very serious demons and is in constant struggle with being Spiderman the XMen films are very serious and political and the latest instalment The Last Stand featured some startling and emotionally wrenching revelations and Batman well need I go on? So here we have Superman in the first new film in almost 20 years. He has his issues but unlike all the other Super heroes around he seems to be very solemn about it all. After all he is Superman not Clark Kent Clark Kent is his mask. Obviously a huge nitpick people will have is that Clark comes back the very very same day as Superman and not one single idiot in the city of Metropolis seems to notice right? Well yes that bugged me too at first. But then the more you think about it that's just how Clark Kent is designed completely forgettable except by Jimmy always in the background and always overshadowed by the bigger story which is Superman. David Carradine has a very great speech about Superman at the end of Kill Bill Volume 2 that justifies everything quite nicely to me so I suggest seeing that if you haven't already. What this movie does a great job of doing is just showing this classic iconic super hero doing what he does best saving the day. There's something so refreshing about finally getting that clear view of Superman for the first time after he saves a planeload of passengers from certain doom and saying with a smile Don't let this turn you off to flying folks. Statistically it's still the safest mode of transportation. But that brings us to the actual plot. It goes for simple safe repetitive tedious even? And honestly it's the kind of plot that just doesn't justify the runtime. Lex Luthor comes up with a ridiculous plan that even in the world of comic books is pretty hard to swallow. He compares himself to Prometheus how he is so generous with the mortals by sharing his wonderful discovery though planning on killing billions in the process. Lex obviously forgot the last half of that story where Prometheus is punished and confined to terrible pain for all of eternity. But maybe that's the point. I mean we all know from the very beginning Lex won't win he's doomed to lose that's just how it's meant to be Superman wins and Lex loses. Written in the scriptures is was ever shall be in comic strips TV shows feature films living in an ageless universe for all eternity.Bryan Singer is obviously aware of this. Singer also directed XMen 12 and I think his biggest problem as a director is that he lacks a sense of completion in his works. XMen is not the kind of movie that you watch and then once it's over you want to watch it over again. It's the kind of movie that you watch and then once it's over you want to see the next one. The XMen films were each done with the presumption that there would be a next instalment and that's fine I guess if you like always being on the edge of your seat waiting for the next one but when his Superman movie does the same thing and drags past the 2andahalf hour mark there's a problem. If nothing else the movie establishes that Superman is indeed back and we should expect to see more of him in the future.Superman Returns is definitely a grand film. It's big it's loud it's expensive. I usually don't think to myself 'hey that looks expensive' when watching a movie but I did in this case. It doesn't try for anything new or bold it doesn't want to and it's nice to see a super hero movie where the hero is the generic dogooder and helps mankind because he really wants to. That's why I think Superman garners more universal appeal than any others. But honestly the angsty heroes can be much more interesting. Certainly so with last year's Batman Begins which I thought was a great perfect movie while I though Superman Returns was really good but probably could have been better.My rating 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first Superman filmas it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original.After an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals the credits pay homage to the evencrummylookingfortheirtime futuristic sweeping credits of the original Superman film.Then there is some more murky stuff. Ma Kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield. Then Superman sneaks up on her and faints.Next we catch up with Lex Luthor in a scene about many murky closeups of an old lady as she dies. We don't see Luthor's face until the end of the scene an early instance of the film's drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned. Lex Luthor is a guy who doesn't like Superman because he is not human. Also he probably doesn't like humans either as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about Lex Luthor planning to kill most of Earth's population.After a while Clark Kent shows up back at his old job I forgot to mention he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened. Then he finds out Lois Lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating Cyclops. It upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame.At this point we see that Miss Lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle. It is some kind of important event on account of it is on television. Then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event. There are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit. The film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer.As the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build I excused myself to get a soda. I accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about Al Gore showing slides in its entirety. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns but I somehow wandered into Prairie Home Companion which I watched twice in a row. Then it was time to stop messing around.I walked back into the first theater found my seat and looked up to see that the impending Lois Lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us. Still it seemed to be taking forever so I wandered around the theater met a girl got married raised a son and sent him off to college. While attending my son's medical school graduation I remembered that I should probably check in on Superman Returns so I excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry. It still took about another half hour before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane. When they did Superman saved everybody which was pretty cool.. And then there is a a subplot where Superman turns really creepy and starts stalking Lois Lane and her family with his xray vision and superhearing. Then he tries to get her to cheat on Cyclops who seems like a good guy.Meanwhile Lex Luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie. I forgot to bring my scorecard home with me they give you one at the door but I think he scored damn close to one hundred percent. I hope he wins the million dollars.At this point things start to gear up for the big murky finale. I think maybe the projector was broken on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here. I remember seeing murky things growing out of the water Superman getting sick Superman getting better back to the murky things he's sick again no wait he's okay again.Then Lex Luthor unleashed his final bad guy move yelling at his girlfriend a little bit.Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was over so I left.Ninety years later the nursing home where I lived felt a little chilly. I realized I left my sweatshirt back in the theater and I went to retrieve it. When I did I was slightly surprised to find that Superman Returns wasn't over yet. I tried to ask some of the viewers what I missed but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by now.I sat back in my old seat and watched as Lois Lane puttered around her house for a while. Then Superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie and since I already saw that part I thought it was okay to leave.So that is my review of Superman Returns.Oh also if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog you will love this movie. On account of there are two jokes like that in it.".

	schema:headline " Superman didn't need to return if this is the result";
	schema:reviewBody "There are so many things wrong I don't know where to start.The pacing of the film...there's no flow to it. The first hour feels rushed. There's no time given to anything. The movie just jumps back and forth between Luthor's plan I'll get to how ridiculous that was later and little moments that don't amount to much. Clark makes a cameo on the farm has a few lines of pitiful dialogue with his mother terribly acted by the way has a little flashback to his youth and the next thing you know the guy is back in Metropolis and gets his job back in a throwaway line. Even the first action scene is rushed. Supes has been gone for almost two decades so you would think the first shirt rip and welcome back would be iconic along with the music. It's not. It's a half second shirt rip and the next thing you know we have a pilot saying we have an unidentified bogey coming. I thought the clips online were edited but it turns out they're not. It's those little things that irritated the hell out of me.The musical score. This score specifically the choir just beats you over the head. You would think something epic was happening on screen when the choir kicked in but more often than not there wasn't and it made me chuckle to myself a couple of times. It was like the music was trying to make the action scenes more than they really were.And speaking of the action....repetitive comes to mind. There's only so many times I can watch Superman catch or lift something before it starts to get stale. As the movie goes on he lifts heavier objects...great. I swear I almost think they repeated him catching some guy in the movie. The very hyped plane rescue was underwhelming to say the least. Honestly most of the clips online are just about the entire sequence. I heard this scene was supposed to be 10 minutes. Felt more like around 3 minutes. Most of the footage during that sequence is Lois and passengers bouncing around the plane. And then on top of that they have to ruin that scene with a line Christopher Reeve said 10x better.Also this felt more like a natural disaster flick than a Superman movie. Those little crystals sure do cause plenty of trouble. There are more tremor scenes in Superman Returns than the Jurassic Park movies combined. You always know when something big was going to happen because you would see a closeup of a pencil holder or some random object shaking on the desk ad nauseum. The 3rd or 4th time I saw it I seriously lost count I was almost tempted to leave. I honestly couldn't believe the mediocrity I was watching.Which leads me to Luthor's plan. One of the worst plans I've ever seen in a comic movie topping Ra's magic microwave in Batman Begins. The bad part of this plan is it takes up so much of the damn movie. From the start this plan gets a lot of attention and it goes NOWHERE. By the time the third act rolls around after Lex has executed his little plan and you see Lex Kitty and his henchmen sitting around on this desolate rock looking bored I wonder what the hell it was all for. They couldn't come up with anything better than this? The performances....SupermanClark Kent  The performance of Routh was underwhelming and I can't blame him. I blame the writers. Routh is given absolutely nothing to say as Superman or Clark Kent. He's just THERE. If the guy isn't staring or lifting something he's nonexistent. Maybe they decided he couldn't act and scrapped his lines...I don't know. Anyway how am I supposed to care for him? Lines like Bye Lois I'm always around is not what I call character building.Lois Lane  She's given plenty to say...but her character was so cold throughout the whole film I honestly didn't give a damn about her either. She just has a bitchy look about her that I couldn't warm up to. Her chemistry with Superman is nowhere to be seen. The only reason I can see Superman and Lois have a romantic history is because of the past movies.Lex Luthor  Spacey sleptwalk through this movie...maybe because he can play this kind of character in his sleep. After all the camp or menace threads it turns out Lex is basically the same as Hackman. He has his Ms. Tesmacher 2.0 same wigs same plan. The only difference is he gets his licks in on Superman. Their little showdown was a VERY underwhelming scene mainly because Superman stands there like a statue and says NOTHING before getting his ass kicked.This post is getting long in the tooth so I'll just say the rest of the cast was adequate.As far as the big revelation with the kid goes....I was so disgusted with SR by the time it happened that I really just didn't care anymore.Overall I would say this movie is a colossal failure on all levels.The only good thing I can say about Superman Returns is some scenes were very pretty to look at. That's about it.".

	onyx:emotionText "There are so many things wrong I don't know where to start.The pacing of the film...there's no flow to it. The first hour feels rushed. There's no time given to anything. The movie just jumps back and forth between Luthor's plan I'll get to how ridiculous that was later and little moments that don't amount to much. Clark makes a cameo on the farm has a few lines of pitiful dialogue with his mother terribly acted by the way has a little flashback to his youth and the next thing you know the guy is back in Metropolis and gets his job back in a throwaway line. Even the first action scene is rushed. Supes has been gone for almost two decades so you would think the first shirt rip and welcome back would be iconic along with the music. It's not. It's a half second shirt rip and the next thing you know we have a pilot saying we have an unidentified bogey coming. I thought the clips online were edited but it turns out they're not. It's those little things that irritated the hell out of me.The musical score. This score specifically the choir just beats you over the head. You would think something epic was happening on screen when the choir kicked in but more often than not there wasn't and it made me chuckle to myself a couple of times. It was like the music was trying to make the action scenes more than they really were.And speaking of the action....repetitive comes to mind. There's only so many times I can watch Superman catch or lift something before it starts to get stale. As the movie goes on he lifts heavier objects...great. I swear I almost think they repeated him catching some guy in the movie. The very hyped plane rescue was underwhelming to say the least. Honestly most of the clips online are just about the entire sequence. I heard this scene was supposed to be 10 minutes. Felt more like around 3 minutes. Most of the footage during that sequence is Lois and passengers bouncing around the plane. And then on top of that they have to ruin that scene with a line Christopher Reeve said 10x better.Also this felt more like a natural disaster flick than a Superman movie. Those little crystals sure do cause plenty of trouble. There are more tremor scenes in Superman Returns than the Jurassic Park movies combined. You always know when something big was going to happen because you would see a closeup of a pencil holder or some random object shaking on the desk ad nauseum. The 3rd or 4th time I saw it I seriously lost count I was almost tempted to leave. I honestly couldn't believe the mediocrity I was watching.Which leads me to Luthor's plan. One of the worst plans I've ever seen in a comic movie topping Ra's magic microwave in Batman Begins. The bad part of this plan is it takes up so much of the damn movie. From the start this plan gets a lot of attention and it goes NOWHERE. By the time the third act rolls around after Lex has executed his little plan and you see Lex Kitty and his henchmen sitting around on this desolate rock looking bored I wonder what the hell it was all for. They couldn't come up with anything better than this? The performances....SupermanClark Kent  The performance of Routh was underwhelming and I can't blame him. I blame the writers. Routh is given absolutely nothing to say as Superman or Clark Kent. He's just THERE. If the guy isn't staring or lifting something he's nonexistent. Maybe they decided he couldn't act and scrapped his lines...I don't know. Anyway how am I supposed to care for him? Lines like Bye Lois I'm always around is not what I call character building.Lois Lane  She's given plenty to say...but her character was so cold throughout the whole film I honestly didn't give a damn about her either. She just has a bitchy look about her that I couldn't warm up to. Her chemistry with Superman is nowhere to be seen. The only reason I can see Superman and Lois have a romantic history is because of the past movies.Lex Luthor  Spacey sleptwalk through this movie...maybe because he can play this kind of character in his sleep. After all the camp or menace threads it turns out Lex is basically the same as Hackman. He has his Ms. Tesmacher 2.0 same wigs same plan. The only difference is he gets his licks in on Superman. Their little showdown was a VERY underwhelming scene mainly because Superman stands there like a statue and says NOTHING before getting his ass kicked.This post is getting long in the tooth so I'll just say the rest of the cast was adequate.As far as the big revelation with the kid goes....I was so disgusted with SR by the time it happened that I really just didn't care anymore.Overall I would say this movie is a colossal failure on all levels.The only good thing I can say about Superman Returns is some scenes were very pretty to look at. That's about it.";

	schema:headline " Believe the negative reviews here...They are right!";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying that I was SO looking forward to seeing this movie despite reading some of the not so great reviews on this site. I trusted the people who gave it high marks and made it sound like it was as good as or better than the original. My husband had doubts going in but he is a HUGE comic book fan so I figured he was just being picky. Boy was I WRONG! When we left the theater which was surprisingly empty by the way there were a few faint claps and absolutely no conversation. Usually when a movie is good you hear a few Wow that was great! comments when you are leaving. I heard complete silence. Out of respect both my husband and I left the movie theater without saying a word. It wasn't until we got in our car and shut the doors that my husband finally burst out and said God that was horrible!!!Although the movie had many elements from the first film they were just not pulled together as well. The main problem was the storyline which was pretty thin and had a numerous plot holes that did not make sense. Brandon Routh looked great although during a couple of points in the movie I found myself distracted by the bad blue contact lenses his pasty white skin and his bushy eyebrows which should have been plucked a bit. Still he is a great looking guy! His acting was good but the script didn't give him much to do. There were not enough scenes of him as Clark Kent to create the full persona of the character. I saw a faint resemblance to Christopher Reeve but not enough to say they were identical at all. What made the Christopher Reeve performance great was not just the actor himself but the fact that they gave him a lot of time on screen to play both Superman and Clark. This made the audience believe that there was enough difference for him to maybe pull off the disguise. Plus how stupid can people be to not put two and two together and realize that both Clark and Superman were gone during the same five year time span! Duh! Kate Bosworth was WAY too young to play Lois Lane. True she is much more attractive than the original actress Margot Kidder but the spunk and spark of Lois was just not there. Her character seemed bland and depressed for most of the movie. There was also no chemistry between her and Brandon Routh. Ihave to say that one of the main reasons that I went to this movie was for the supposedly heightened emphasis on the romance. Just wasn't good enough. The whole storyline with Lois and her son was also unbelievable. SPOILER WARNING I couldn't buy the fact that she would given up on Superman coming back so quickly as to convince another guy that this kid was actually his child and not someone else's. Plus didn't Superman erase Lois' memory of their time together in Superman 2? It was unclear to me how much super power this child actually had. The kid had ample opportunity to show it by saving their lives at numerous points but only chose to do it once. Also was Lois making him fake being an asthmatic and in fragile health or did was the kid actually having asthma attacks? My husband and I are still debating that one. How did Lois know that Kryptonite didn't affect him before Lex was waving it in front of him? Just not enough info. was given to make the audience understand what was going on. I echo another reviewer who said they just could not picture Superman as a deadbeat dad. Superman is just beyond this whole illegitimate child thing. Whoever thought this plot line would breathe new life into the Superman saga was completely wrong! Kevin Spacey was very good at Lex Luther but the script just wasn't good enough for his great acting abilities. I give him credit for doing what he could with the role. Again the whole plot with him creating a new continent out of crystals from Superman's Fortress of Solitude completely does not make sense. Who would want to buy land on an island made of sharp pointy rocks? Ouch! Plus Lex and Superman had only one scene together throughout the whole film! A few final comments on the lack of believability in the plot. How could Lois and Richard possibly locate Superman while in that tiny seaplane with only his head slightly bobbing above the water? How could tiny Kate Bosworth dive in and pull a 225 lb. man out of the ocean? Finally how could Superman have enough strength to lift that crystal continent out of the ocean and toss it into space when he still had a chunk of Krytonite in him which later almost ended up killing him? The whole thing does not make sense! Regarding the special effects they are technically amazing but not enough to make up for lack of plot in the story. I think they should have invested their money in better writers. I'm not a big fan of special effects anyway so I guess I'm not the best one to comment but during several points in the movie I grimaced and felt like I was being shaken up in a blender! The noise and motions on the screen were that jarring. Are special effects supposed to feel that way? I found myself wishing for them to end! I just want to close by saying that in retrospect I enjoyed the two minute preview clip they showed to Spiderman 3 coming out next year more than I enjoyed this movie. I hope the folks working on that film right now don't make the same mistakes as they did here.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the movie last night and I really wanted to like it. My expectations for the movie had been going up and down ever since I heard it was being made. Some days I'd see something spectacular and some days I'd be disappointed.Yet being the kind of fan I am I had high hopes for this movie but in the end I was sorely disappointed.While I love the Richard Donner movies I didn't like their sometimes campy nature or the changes they made to Superman's character and his powers.Singer however chose to take the worst elements of the Donner movies and put them in his version.While his Lex Luthor is slightly darker he's still nothing more than a shyster a conman and a common criminal. He's no more intelligent than when Gene Hackman played him. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well but ultimately he falls victim to shoddy writing and unremarkable dialog.His henchmen are more two dimensional than even comic book henchmen. Most of them literally have no dialog in the movie.SPOILERS AHEAD Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same character as Ms. Tesmacher. She seems to be as evil and cold as Lex Luthor but she proves to be just an underling who melts after seeing Superman in trouble and quite predictably betrays Luthor.The biggest disappointment in the movie was Frank Langella as Perry White. I wasn't a huge fan of the over the top Perry White in the Donner movies but at least he had a soul. He was after all said and done a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story. Langella's Perry White is nothing but a corporate stooge. He wants everyone to concentrate on the Superman related stories because they sell papers even though every other paper is doing the same thing. He doesn't care about the real stories the real mysteries like the black out and what Lex Luthor is up to now that he's out of prison.The worst thing about Langella is that he's DULL! Some actors can be quiet and sober and yet have an undercurrent that lets you know that still waters run deep. Frank Langella is puddle.Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. He's OK but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie. Not the actor's fault. His movements are clearly meant to look graceful like even the slightest movement of his fingers effects the way he flies. But it still looks choreographed and artificial.Lois Lane while badly written was surprisingly well acted by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately again for a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and writer she is about as eloquent as any teenage on Dawson's Creek.James Marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie mostly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without any superpowers he manages to figure out Lois Lane's message flies a plane to the location gets on board Luthor's yacht and rescues Lois and her son.The only moving moment in the movie is when they are all trapped pantry as it is flooding with water and the ship is sinking. You see them slowly going being immersed in the water. You know Superman's going to come by at the last moment to rescue them but still you can't help but feel sorry for them.As I said before the plot is very haphazard. Unlike Singer has said this is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find his place in the world. As soon as he returns the world welcomes him back with open arms. Lois is the only one who's not happy to see him back. Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because it gives him a chance to settle the score with the man of steel.Superman is shown to be probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe. A big green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum Lex Luthor is out of prison he now has knowledge about Superman's powers and weaknesses and yet he's still not able to connect the dots enough to know Luthor would be using kryptonite against him.According to the movie the only thing Superman is good for is lifting really really heavy things. The action sequences are all incredibly predictable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like many other people the character of Superman has always been a firm favourite of mine dating back to my childhood. Christopher Reeve's Superman made me believe a man could fly with the lighthearted 'Lois and Clark' series seeing me through the Nineties. I was sceptical as the next Supes fan when I heard they were to bring back the character recast and revitalised for a twentyfirst century audience. But having seen 'Superman Returns' those fears were instantly pushed back as I now eagerly await a sequel.'Superman Returns' is set five years after Christopher Reeve's 'Superman II' thankfully ignoring the events in the lacklustre 'Superman III and IV'. Superman after five years of searching for the remains of his homeplanet Krypton has returned to Earth to resume his life as Clark Kent only to find things moved on without him. Lois Lane is now mother to fiveyearold son Jason and engaged to Perry White's nephew Richard. She is also thoroughly disenchanted with Superman although it soon becomes clear there is much unresolved feelings between the two. But between juggling his conflicting emotions for Lois and his duties to protecting the population Superman has to face his archenemy Lex Luthor who has stolen the crystals from the Fortress of Solitude and is intent on using them to rule the world.It was never going to be easy Brandon Routh to step into Christopher Reeve's shoes but he takes it in his stride managing to capture the bumbling but kindly nature of Clark and the strong reserved demeanour of a Superman who strives to find a balance between his alien heritage and the life he has made for himself on Earth. He both makes the role his own yet does well in succeeding where Reeve left off. Kate Bosworth was also another surprise. I was very disappointed in her casting initially but seeing her perform in the film left me realising that she was perfect for the job as she portrays the cocky and determined yet vulnerable Lois to a tee. Kevin Spacey was great as the obsessive slightly unhinged Luthor who possesses a real hatred for our hero while Parker Posey gave us a nicelyportrayed 'shades of grey' character in Kitty a villain with a heart. Even the little moppet who played Jason gave a decent performance without being wooden or grating.What I loved most about the film is that it delivered an interesting storyline that didn't reject the first two 'Superman' films which are classics in the heart of any Superman fan and had already done a good job in covering the origins story. But at the same time it didn't shirk in giving us deeper insights into the character of Superman the solitary hero and the man who just wants to fit in. What was a pleasant surprise was that the film also refused to dumb down to small children in the audience which is a growing problem with many Hollywood films that overdose on infantile humour to appeal to kids resulting in boredom for anyone over fourteen. There was humour some on a level to make children laugh but overall there was a nice mix of action romance and darkness aimed more at an older audience. They even avoid the clichd pitfall of portraying Lois' love interest to be a sanctimonious twit and instead he came across as a genuinely nice guy who shows that it's understandable why she has problems choosing between him and SupermanIn fact my only real problem was that there wasn't enough interaction between Lois and Clark which would have been nice as Clark's jealousy towards his alterego and the attention Lois lavishes on him is a large part of the story yet in the film you felt as if Clark and Superman really were two different people with Clark just being some rather random guy. However it can be overlooked by the fact that Clark was so happy to just have Lois' attention that he didn't care whether it was projected onto himself in his real personality or on Superman.For anyone who has yet to see the film I do recommend it and don't allow yourself to be put off by nitpickers complaining about the actors' being too young better they be a shade on the younger side than going the 'Smallville' route where you have adults in their late twenties and thirties prancing around pretending to be teens and just looking ridiculous for it or that the film is too long even the eightyearolds in the audience sat quietly glued to the screen for the entire film or that it's bland no more so than 'Spiderman'. I for one thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to a sequel. After a rather dull summer at the cinema this film renewed my faith in the summer blockbuster!".

However it can be overlooked by the fact that Clark was so happy to just have Lois' attention that he didn't care whether it was projected onto himself in his real personality or on Superman.For anyone who has yet to see the film I do recommend it and don't allow yourself to be put off by nitpickers complaining about the actors' being too young better they be a shade on the younger side than going the 'Smallville' route where you have adults in their late twenties and thirties prancing around pretending to be teens and just looking ridiculous for it or that the film is too long even the eightyearolds in the audience sat quietly glued to the screen for the entire film or that it's bland no more so than 'Spiderman'. I for one thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to a sequel. After a rather dull summer at the cinema this film renewed my faith in the summer blockbuster!";

	schema:reviewBody "The biggest mistake director Bryan Singer made with SUPERMAN RETURNS was not giving the series a full reboot. Instead of starting over he gives us something that is part new part continuation of the Christopher Reeve series from the 1970s and '80s.Let's start with the old. The familiar orchestral music is the same. The late Marlon Brando is still Superman's dad thanks to footage salvaged from the 1978 version. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is the same onedimensional villain Gene Hackman was though give Spacey credit... he is bald. But there's lots of new here. Superman played by newcomer Brandon Routh is much more complex and human than before. The plots he thwarts are much more threatening than Hackman's antics years ago. Most surprisingly and controversially Superman now has an illegitimate superchild with Lois Lane.This is an awkward blend at times. Here is the most modern interpretation of Supes ever filmed but we're constantly reminded of the simpler version of the first four films. It's reminiscent of what Tim Burton's BATMAN films might have looked like had Burton incorporated a flavor of the Adam West series into his work.All of that aside there are a lot of good things to say about SUPERMAN RETURNS. The plot is involving and the action scenes though too infrequent are a visual treat. Singer has made a superhero movie with depth but not too much depth so as to ruin it ala HULK. The performances are topnotch. Routh proves to be more than up to the part exuding heroism in the hero's blue and red and fragility in Clark Kent's glasses and necktie. Perhaps for the first time ever you'll believe that glasses and a curl of hair are enough to fool people. Kate Bosworth takes some getting used to as Lois Lane but proves fitting. And Spacey's Luthor despite being written with little imagination is passable.Further to its defense SUPERMAN RETURNS had a tough task in front of it bring a beloved character into 2006 while staying true to his roots. As a longtime Superman fan I wasn't thrilled with some of the changes Singer made particularly the introduction of Superman's illegitimate son. However I can appreciate the film as decent entertainment. It's not the best Superman movie ever made but it is worth your time.".

Brandon Routh does a good job portraying the physical presence of Superman and I think he is a decent actor but they don't give him enough to do. Kevin Spacey is evil as Lex Luthor but nothing exciting. Parker Posey I am definitely a fan of her work Mighty Wind anyone? is terribly under utilized. Kate Bosworth is no Margot Kidder and James Marsden is just plain boring. There were so many long sequences of Superman flying and thunder rolling and seas thrashing and not enough of a plot. Where is the romance or the comic relief or something? I know everyone is going to say But this is a new Superman movie. The movie is called Superman Returns and it supposed to pick up where the last movie left off so it should have at least had something of a tangible connection to those films. I would like a refund and so would the other 20 people with whom I spoke outside the theater including my two children. Crap total crap!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Superman's back and there's gonna be trouble hey na hey na Superman's back! Well hey if Batman can begin again Supes can come back to Earth so to speak right? Only this time it's not the late Christopher Reeve or even George Reeves it's relative newcomer Brandon Routh as the Man o' Steel. Seems he's been gone lo these past five years in deep space checking the general vicinity of where Krypton once existed. Astronomers reported they'd found traces of the planet so off Superman went to check out his home oddly neither he nor the astronomers mentioned that he was leaving. But now he's back and so is coincidentally Clark Kent. After reunited with his Earth mom Martha Eva Marie Saint Clark returns to work at the Daily Planet greeted enthusiastically by Jimmy Olson   and less enthusiastically by Lois Lane Kate Bosworth who's really moved on. Seems Lois has fallen in love gotten married and given birth all five years ago. Huh how about that. Her hubby is now an assistant editor at the Planet and is conveniently the nephew of Perry White played by the magnificent Frank Langella.Meanwhile Superman isn't the only one making a comeback after five years seems Lex Luthor put away in prison for what was supposed to be many life sentences is out on appeal or something. Anyway he's up to no good and it involves killing billions of people and forcing the survivors to bow to him and lavish him with money and gifts and so on. Kevin Spacey plays Lex this time around and he's a great choice  megalomaniacal without being hammy which is a fine line. Makes one even forget the great Gene Hackman. Of course we all know the pitfalls of having a villain who has a stronger personality than the hero don't we Tim Burton? So Supes is back and Perry wants Lois to cover his return but Lois wants to cover this weird blackout that affected pretty much everyone notably a Space Shuttle launch that winds up being saved by Superman as you've no doubt seen in the trailers. Could the two issues be related? You're reporters  find out! Perry growls at his young charges.There have been scads of comicbookrelated movies over the past decade or so with varying degrees of success and from what I've read of this one it was a bit of a disappointment both critically and financially it made 200 million in the US but it cost 270 million to make. Having said that though I liked it. Plenty of great action as you'd expect from a director like Bryan Singer who left the XMen series just to do this. For a change the big action scenes don't feel particularly staged as they can in superhero movies  you know Looks like it's time for Our Hero to.... uh..... lift a train with his bare hands! and so forth. There were a few ooooh scenes that had me gripping the sides of my recliner especially the planeabouttocrash scene.Routh was pretty good as the Man of Steel taciturn and resolved but conflicted and isolated. Watching him I got the impression that there was more going on in his head than there ever was in Reeves' mind hey I'm sure Christopher Reeves was a heck of a nice guy but he wasn't a terribly good actor. His acting style was more cartoony than realistic and nowadays that's not a good style even for a comic book movie. But Routh looked the part and even more importantly sounded the part as well. Look for a line from him that echoes his first meeting with Lois Lane in 1978's Superman The Movie. Spacey of course was a lot of fun as Luthor. Mean evil intelligent with a touch of humor and glee  what more could you ask for in a supervillain? Of course even Spacey can fall victim to a somewhat tepid script I loved it when Luthor basically tells Lois Lane his evil plans. This information comes in useful for Lois later on. But regardless at least Spacey didn't have Luthor laugh maniacally or gesture wildly. You know hallmarks of cinematic madmen for decades.Bosworth was miscast as Lois Lane though. She didn't look the part check out her huge forehead  how come the set stylist didn't have a lock or two fall over her brow? and she came off as whiny petulant conceited and..... well just plain annoying. Other actresses who could have done a better job are Keri Russell Claire Danes and Scarlett Johansson all of whom were considered for the role. It's just a flat performance by an actress who looked at times to be a bit overwhelmed by the role.So overall  not a disappointment. Not that awesome thriller that SpiderMan was not as fantastic as the XMen movies not as mysterious as Batman but still loads better than Daredevil Elektra and Fantastic Four. Some sincerely harrowing scenes and a solid performance by Routh lift this one enough to compensate for the weak female lead.".

This longlasting sequence is only interrupted by moody flashbacks of her first encounters with her husband and lover and surreal love and sex scenes.This extreme movie style is the strength of this movie as well as its weakness at the same time  the thrilling story and the beautiful pictures get lost in the slow pacing and the sometimes too lame direction. In the end you will fall asleep during the film is running or you will stay awake and be confused and fascinated at the same time.

Certainly the role of the strong insensitive rich man is very clich and he did not have to perform any better than he did in his numerous criminal films. The waiterlover is a bad joke it is impossible to take him seriously. But the main component of failure is Elisabeth who is not either mysterious or desirable enough she looks just plain and quite often stupid. This kind of slow suicide is hard to believe anyway but a good actress and a real femme fatale Hanna Schygulla or Romy Schneider could have played this well filling up the empty spaces of the script. Not for the budget this film had but the 91 minutes are too long anyways. Herr Schilling should have better made a really good short instead of a failed feature film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The legendary RheingoldExpress Rhine Gold was a famous train riding between Hoek van Holland near Rotterdam and Basel Switzerland a distance of 662 km. It drove along the Rhine River via Arnhem Netherlands and Cologne Germany had special luxury coaches. It was named after Richard Wagner's Das Rheingold opera which romanticized the Rhine from wikipedia.This film is as much the sad tale of a fatal love affair as it is a very effective featurelength commercial of the Rheingold train and the romantic German landscape of castles and rocky hills near the banks of the Rhine river.Elisabeth is a rich woman in her late thirties. Since Elisabeth has traveled on more occasions with the Rheingold one day she recognized her former sweetheart from elementary school now working as an attendant aboard the train. Unhappy with her marriage Elisabeth started an affair with the attendant.At the start of the film Elisabeth is breaking up with her husband. Lost for words her husbands stabs her in a fit of rage with the letter opener Elisabeth just gave him as a farewell present. The husband flees from the train leaving Elisabeth unhurt or so it seems.Shortly after the train has started its voyage she finds out she has a wound in her abdominal section. Instead of alerting attendants and ask for emergency assistance Elisabeth acts as if nothing has happened. When she meets with her lover the attendant she tells him of her breaking up with her husband at which her lover says he's very happy.As the train progresses on its journey through the romantic German Rhine landscape Elisabeth has flashbacks as she remembers happier days with her husband meeting up with her old childhood love and a memorable scene when both her lover and she were still kids. Possibly the other flashback scenes that don't involve the Rheingold train were shot in the direct vicinity of the train route. If that's the case then the movie also doubles for a rather effective commercial for Rhine tourism. That said all of the photography is of remarkable quality and the direction is also second to none.The director maximizes his efforts by having the husband filled with remorse charter a taxi cab and order the chauffeur to chase the Rheingold! This was way before computer editing so the scenes are very effective and shows the director's great skill in one scene in a continuous shot the husband is arguing with the cabdriver as they are driving through Germany. The driver turns his head to the left points to the train that has appeared in view and says there she is! Just bear in mind how much organizational skills and plain talent a director needs to complete such a shot either in one take or with extreme patience in multiple takes until he ends up with the perfect continuous shot. After a failed take they would have to wait for the next train with the characteristics of the Rheingold to appear in view.As the train gets closer to its destination Elisabeth's wound keeps getting worse while none of the other passengers in her cabin noticing anything strange. They are much too caught up in their own life and musings to see that anything's the matter with Elisabeth. It is the last passenger she meets after having changed cabins who remarks she is looking rather pale and not at all well.The viewer will wonder why Elisabeth never alerted anyone to her critical condition but then if she had this beautiful film would never have been made.Operation of the Rheingold TEE Trans Europe Express ended on May 30 1987 after 59 years and 15 days.

	schema:reviewBody "The boys of London toil in a cotton mill and are enthralled by Daniel Defoe's just published story Robinson. Although the book was banned by King George II it circulates underground and scores of boys flock at night to Defoe's modest lodgings to hear him reveal more details and embellishments. The work in the mill which is still a handoperated factory is boring and the boys mull over nothing more than to go to sea and find Robinson's island for themselves. Yet they understand perfectly well that they need to work to make a living and Defoe's remark that children should play instead of work is met with their hearty laughter.This is shown at the beginning of the film which soon however changes the course of its sociological underpinnings from the mores of the 18th century towards the apologetic permissibility of the late 20th. When little Ben is to be punished by 25 strokes with the belt for shooting an arrow into a courtier's back while playing Robinson of course his father is most reluctant to carry it out and reiterates Ben's lame excuse that it was just an accident. What remains unmentioned is the cause of this accident namely Ben having pointed his bow towards said courtier. Why my own father would have whipped me with conviction in the 1940s and my mum would have nodded in agreement instead of covering her face in desperation like Ben's mother.Three of the boys try to put their dream of finding Robinson's island to work and hire themselves onto a merchant ship to sail within a few days. After their last day at the mill which hasn't progressed yet into the age of free expression to employ a night watchman they ransack the establishment braking what modest equipment there is and throwing the buckets of dye all over the walls. Since these boys are the heroes of the story this act sends decidedly a wrong signal to a juvenile audience. It is not only utterly ungrateful towards the proprietor who gave them a job they definitely needed as they knew themselves it is also highly inconsiderate towards the other boys at the outfit who must continue to work there without interruption. This bad signal is regrettably reinforced at the end of the movie when they happen to meet the king and he assures them that he will take care of the rampage. So this is the lesson of the story It is great to tear things up when you feel like it you will not be punished and the government will cover the damages  a lesson in contemporary children's education? Teenagers are in for a treat too Defoe's dashing young son Tom much adored by his landlady's daughter Maud has already squandered most of old Defoe's assets and to avoid going to jail because of further debts he steals and sells his father's most precious remaining possession the Robinson manuscript. This literally breaks the old man's heart. Tom when confronted by the king regrets his last bad deed as well as his licentious life and agrees that he must be punished. But when lovestricken Maud objects to several forms of penalty the king as the final and supreme punishment hands him a bag of money to repurchase the manuscript and presumably pay his other debts. Some punishment! Dapper young Tom gets out scotfree. Lesson number two Regardless how stupid and reprehensible you behave the government will bail you out. This film should be permitted only for children over 50 years of age.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robinson soll nicht sterben or The Legend of Robinson Crusoe or The Girl and the Legend is a west German Germanlanguage movie from 1957 so it will have its 60th anniversary next year. The film runs for slightly under 90 minutes and was directed by Josef von Bky based on a play by Friedrich ForsterBurggraf. The former was one of Germany's really successful filmmakers at that point so it should not be a surprise to anybody that he got 2 of Germany's biggest young stars at that point on board namely Romy Schneider the lead and Horst Buchholz her colead. This film came out around the time the Sissi trilogy ended and as with other Schneider works this is despite its age a film in color. Buchholz plays once again the German version of Marlon Brando in a character that is a bit of a brute and hangs around with the wrong people. Luckily he has Schneider's character and a bunch of kids to save the day for him. Yes Schneider plays a girl named Maud and as in all her other works she is a bit of a saint no pun intended to Eva Marie  Waterfront who personifies warmth altruism and innocence as she pretty much always does.As for the film itself I was not impressed. Not at all. The two stars play characters that are really stereotypical for them but bring nothing really new to the table and the script story and plot are also not doing them any justice when it comes to letting them put their talent on display. Also on boards are established German actors like Romy's mother Magda Gustav Knuth and even Gert Froebe plays a small role. Sadly too insignificant to really make a difference.

	onyx:emotionText "Robinson soll nicht sterben or The Legend of Robinson Crusoe or The Girl and the Legend is a west German Germanlanguage movie from 1957 so it will have its 60th anniversary next year. The film runs for slightly under 90 minutes and was directed by Josef von Bky based on a play by Friedrich ForsterBurggraf. The former was one of Germany's really successful filmmakers at that point so it should not be a surprise to anybody that he got 2 of Germany's biggest young stars at that point on board namely Romy Schneider the lead and Horst Buchholz her colead. This film came out around the time the Sissi trilogy ended and as with other Schneider works this is despite its age a film in color. Buchholz plays once again the German version of Marlon Brando in a character that is a bit of a brute and hangs around with the wrong people. Luckily he has Schneider's character and a bunch of kids to save the day for him. Yes Schneider plays a girl named Maud and as in all her other works she is a bit of a saint no pun intended to Eva Marie  Waterfront who personifies warmth altruism and innocence as she pretty much always does.As for the film itself I was not impressed. Not at all. The two stars play characters that are really stereotypical for them but bring nothing really new to the table and the script story and plot are also not doing them any justice when it comes to letting them put their talent on display. Also on boards are established German actors like Romy's mother Magda Gustav Knuth and even Gert Froebe plays a small role. Sadly too insignificant to really make a difference. People who love relatively old German films from after Nazi Germany and the silent film era will see a handful familiar faces in here. But even to those it it difficult for me to recommend the watch. I personally did not see anything memorable or even special in these 1.5 hours. I give it a thumbsdown. Watch something else instead.";

The Comedian Harmonists gained their fame and popularity during the time when Hitler came into power. These men were loved by all even the Nazi soldiers but ironically three of the six men happened to be Jewish. And just like the rest of the Jewish of people during Hitler's rule they were not able to continue to lead their normal lives celebrities or not. You see spectacular scenes in this film were the group performs and you get good examples of the harsh treatment of the Jews by the Nazi. There is a love triangle with in the group that brings out a steady stream of character development. This with the racial segregation makes all of the character come to term with their futures.

Vilsmaier is very adept at spotting interesting movie material such as Stalingrad or Marlene Dietrich at financing and marketing his productions and signing up A  list actors  but his directing is wooden and painting  by  numbers the movies themselves are tripe.  If you are interested in the Comedian Harmonists I recommend you watch the 1976 documentary instead.".

Vilsmaier is very adept at spotting interesting movie material such as Stalingrad or Marlene Dietrich at financing and marketing his productions and signing up A  list actors  but his directing is wooden and painting  by  numbers the movies themselves are tripe.  If you are interested in the Comedian Harmonists I recommend you watch the 1976 documentary instead.";

This film seamlessly blends the actual recordings of the group with wonderful acting and directing to create a true classic.  The R rating is a bit too strong in my opinion and should be closer to PG13.  The film features mature themes but would be suitable for viewing by most audience members aged 11 and above with parental guidance of course.  Anything of a mature nature in the film is strictly secondary to its real story and was not presented lewdly in any way.  You will want to talk about the subject matter with the kids ie the effects of prejudice and how Hitler  seemingly on a quest to create perfection and beauty by trying to play God which none of us have the right to do actually destroyed so many beautiful things which were meant to be here to enrich all life.  I won't use any plot spoilers but I can tell you there were no dry eyes left in the room at the end.  Truly worth seeing and the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a long time. Bravo!".

It showed better than I've seen the slow subtle changes in behavior and attitudes of both the oppressor and the oppressed  the denial then realization that this could and is happening.  This evolution made even more believable because this a true story about six very talented people three of which who are Jewish who form a musical group in 1927 in Berlin.  As national socialism cements its hold on Germany external pressure is brought on the group for containing Jewish members resulting in internal pressures within the group. The interpersonal relationships made for a compelling story.  Add to this a great love story good acting fantastic musical score and interesting people you come to care for and you have a great movie.  Since the film finishes in 1934 I particularly enjoyed the follow up at the end telling what happened to each of them.  For a fascinating look at anecdotal history I highly recommend that you see this film.  Three and a half stars!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Comedian Harmonists or The Harmonists is a Germanlanguage film from 1997 so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. The director is Joseph Vilsmaier and the script comes from Jrgen Bscher and Klaus Richter. If you know a bit about History especially German history of the 20th century then you will maybe also heard of the Comedian Harmonists a music group who were really famous in the first half of the century with their a capella music. They probably weren't the most talented singers in terms of range or particularly high notes or volume of their voices but they found their niche and succeeded in entertaining the audiences with funny texts and a little bit of wisdom too. The big problem They were Jewish.This film won big at the German Film Award including lead actor for Noethen and supporting actress for Becker. Her brother Ben also plays in here and their dad Otto Sander has a brief cameo too. And last but not least the movie won German Film of the Year even if it was not picked as Germany's submission to the Oscars back then. Maybe the Harmonists just weren't known enough abroad or they were scared that the Hamonists would fail again in the United States as their attempts to make it there were not successful after they had to leave Germany. I personally like some of the songs of this band that the film is about. But not all of them are used in here. I would say the music is the only aspect that was pretty good in here. The acting was mostly forgettable I felt and the script also wasn't great.I do not think that this film really stands out compared to all the other many many German films that are about the days of Hitler Germany. I think they missed a chance here as the Comedian Harmonists were a pretty unique band still are today and people here in Germany know them very well and many still like them with their wit and nice texts. Sadly they did not really manage to elaborate on all the Harmonists convincingly. I just did not care about some of them at all. And they also could have been played by better actors. Ferch is mostly forgettable and Becker is very much in your face but lacks subtlety and it's also not a good performance. Noethen is decent but not really awardsworthy. The rest is entirely forgettable and this makes me especially sad in Schafmeister's case as I quite like him. This film certainly goes on long enough to deliver a convincing film and make every character count but the screenwriters did not succeed. Many people consider this Vilsmaier's most known possibly best work but I cannot agree. It dragged on too many occasions and the nice music alone is not enough. I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

In my circle most think my opinion of the Obama governmental thug like actions are hysterical. Many in Europe never wised up even as they saw there clothing being sorted and piled high before entering the showers so they wouldn't louse up the camp.Even as a non Jew member of the group fought between his love of his family and group members. The Nazi's knew how to control their people. Remember the A chicken in every pot is a Hitler quote! Free stuff and falling into line are rewarded under these totalitarian regimes.

I often think that I and my family and friends are much like the middle class in German pre Hitler. The black minority would have you believe America is made up of brown shirt para governmental thugs reigning havoc on them. In my circle most think my opinion of the Obama governmental thug like actions are hysterical. Many in Europe never wised up even as they saw there clothing being sorted and piled high before entering the showers so they wouldn't louse up the camp.Even as a non Jew member of the group fought between his love of his family and group members. The Nazi's knew how to control their people. Remember the A chicken in every pot is a Hitler quote! Free stuff and falling into line are rewarded under these totalitarian regimes. If you are getting the analogy thank God if you aren't then you never will.";

Their closest contemporary analogue may be the Kings Singers a group which has actually recorded many of the Comedian Harmonists songs and like the German group sings in close harmony blending their voices so that none stands out until it's required. The effectiveness of the film is immeasurably enhanced by the use of actual recordings with the onscreen ensemble lipsyncing the words. The Comedian Harmonists came to the fore during the late twenties and were extinguished when the Nazis came to power because they sang many songs by Jewish composers and three of the six members were Jewish. Although certain liberties have been taken with the biographies of the individual singers their story comes alive on the screen with faithful attention to period detail. The focus is more on two of the six musicians and their girlfriendincommon than on the other four. Nevertheless each of the six is realized as an individual. It's a splendid film available on Netflix and I found it sufficiently entertaining that I will search out their recordings. But beyond being entertaining it tells a moving story about the impact that the rise of Hitler had on the lives of individuals who were essentially apolitical beings with no agenda other than to entertain and to succeed.".

It was also very instructive to see the lyrics to the songs translated.  I never knew that they had a risqu lyric or two.  I wish the credits for the film had been translated as well.  I was curious as to whether the actors were also doing the singing in the rehearsal scenes.The director made nice use of flashback and flashforward.  The story was engaging although with a biopic one always wonders how much licence is being taken. The film was not a work of genius but it was very enjoyable.

The festival program was read through again and again but still the selection of films was difficult like before randomness was the easiest way so my premade film list looked quite different at the end. In the Panorama section of the festival I came across zgr Yildirim's feature film debut Chiko produced by Faith Akin. His name created an urge to see the film as I am deeply interested in the Transnational German Cinema.zgr Yildirim is a young director from Hamburg. He tells a dark story about loyalty friendship rage revenge drugs passion and alienation in a youth gang in Hamburg. The main character Isa Cakiroglu Denis Moschitto is called Chiko by his friend circle in Hamburg. This circle is made up of young people with migration background speaking the famous sociolect. They like action excitement fame expensive cars and especially power. Of course money is the key in order to get the things they dream of. Money is power money is respect.It is quite clear that zgr Yildirim was inspired by films like Scarface Goodfellas and Reservoir dogs. Chiko has a high tempo it proceeds too quickly without characterization of figures and ends like other films of that genre. Furthermore the film uses too many clichs about young immigrants which the audience from this side of the world apparently enjoys.Still Denis Moschitto fits very well with his own charm and masculinity Volkan zcan as the loser one and Reyhan Sahin are very promising as new faces. Moritz Bleibtreu is fascinating as usual.In the discussion after the premiere at the Berlinale zgr Yildirim Volkan zcan and some of the crew were on the stage to answer the questions. The director is a smart enthusiastic witty person. The overall reaction of the audience was positive people enjoyed the funny dialogues. A person in the second row came up with the idea that violence in the film may cause more violence among the young people. The violence theme and especially violence among young people with migration background is quite popular nowadays. Do such films really have a negative effect on young people? The answer came from one of the back rows These guys are not presented as heroes to be admired why should anyone be bothered seeing such nice hot guys on the screen? Public premiere tickets of Chiko at the Zoo Palast were sold out quickly and the film created a lot of excitement among the audience. To my mind it is enough reason to go and see this film.".

The violence isn't as explicit as it could be. But violence is needed in a picturemovie like this to ground it.Far away from a masterpiece this is still a good addition to the crimethriller.";

Now you will probably say that you have never heard of these two and I cannot blame you to be honest. This is quite a shame though that they are not connected to any other great film as their efforts for this one here were simply outstanding. At least supporting actor Moritz Bleibtreu is among Germany's most known for a truly long time. And this film was produced by Faith Akin a household name as well. You can certainly see Akkin's influence on the film if you know a bit about him and his works. Chiko known no taboos sex death drug abuse graphic violence. Now many films only include these to be as shocking and controversial as possible to have people talk about the movie. Not so this one. It all works very well in the context of the plot. Nothing in here ever feels included just for the sake of it. And it concerns everybody here. Everybody gets their fair share especially the good ones. Life's not fair guys movies shouldn't be either. Happy endings are for other works.Chiko is a fairly short movie does not even come close to the 90minute mark even with credits at least in the version I saw. And that is perfectly fine. I prefer short films with great entertainment value from start to finish and a compelling story over movies that are stretched for 10 or even 20 minutes in order to grant a longer viewing but don't have the material or story for it. You will be moved by watching Chiko you will be touched entertained and surprised by the action. It is a truly positive surprise. You don't find that brave approach by Yildirim very often in other German films. Don't worry about the Turkish background of many characters in here. There is hardly no Turkish language in here so you will understand everything fine without subtitles if you are fluent in German. So what are you waiting for. If you have a chance to see it do not miss out under any circumstance. Highly recommended.".
